This Change a. Updates Section IV , Table of Contents. b. Provides guidance for the initial and subsequent evaluation of fitness of general and aviation duty personnel and applicants requesting medical clearance to operate s mall unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) . Specifically, this change provides exemption from flight physical requirements and permits local medical cle arance for aviation duties for small UAS (Groups 1 and 2 as defined by OPNAVINST 3710.7U and commercial off -the- shelf models weighing less than 55 pounds). c. Updates article 15 -63 by adding clarifying guidance in the form of an amplifying note. Redirects the inquirer of UAS aircrew standards to the Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED) extension document: The U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG) and provides a link to the approved worksheet, NAVMED 6410/13 Unmanned Aircraft Syste m (UAS) Physical Worksheet to assist D epartment of Defense (DoD) providers with the completion of UAS physicals. 2. Background. In 2013, physical standards and processing requirements were developed to address the growing need for UAS operators. UASs were categorized as Groups 1 through 5 based on weight and flight characteristics (normal operating altitude and airspeed). At that time, uncertainty existed as to the specific aeromedical risks related to each of the UAS Groups and types. As such, a generally conservative approach was used to create one standard flight physical submission requirement across all UAS types. These standards have been effective and functional, however accumulated evidence has suggested that the small UAS operators (Groups 1 and 2 and most small, commercial, off-the-shelf models) have different operational requirements, risks, and processing requirements when compared to the larger UAS aircraft. Additionally, the high number of these small UAS operators has required the rapid processing of correspondingly large numbers of flight physicals and waiver requests, often on short notice, leading to unnecessary operational delays. These issues associated with the current medical guidelines were raised by senior operational flight surgeons and Line operators. Subsequently, a Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BU MED ) review was formally requested by Commander, Naval Air Forces (CNAF) and the Deputy Commandant for Aviation and performed by the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI) Aero medical Advisory Council. In response, experts in aviation medicine have assessed and appropriately modified previous U.S. Naval UAS aeromedical accession and designation standards and requirements found in the MANMED and the ARWG . 3.

This Change Revises Chapter 15, Section IV, article 15-107, Explosives Motor Vehicle Operator and Explosives Handler Examinations and Standards. 2. Summary of Changes This revision makes the following major changes: a. Adds the requirement that examiners conducting Explosives Motor Vehicle Operator examinations for Navy civilians be trained and certified per the requ irements of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7390.101 - 390.115; they must also be registered in the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME). This policy is also in BUMEDINST 1500.30. b. Changes the periodicity of Explosives Motor Vehicle Operator exams (cu rrently every 5 years for active duty personnel) to be consistent with the periodicity of exams for civilian Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (every 2 years), per 49 C .F.R. \u00a7391. Therefore, periodicity of these exams will be the same for civilian workers and active duty members. Current certificates with 5 -year expirations will remain valid until expiration. c. Removes the change in periodicity of exams at age 60 for Explosives Vehicle Operators and Explosives Handlers. In the previous version, the pe riodicity of exams changed to annual at age 60; the new 2- year periodicity requirement will be applicable to all ages. d. Introduces the concept of \"exceptions\" to address unique mission- critical situations while maintaining emphasis on safety and regula tory compliance. e. Amends the language on waivers to explain the legacy Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) waiver program under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7391.64, by which FMCSA granted waivers to a small number of drivers. Waivers may be granted by commanding officers for Explosive Handlers with normally disqualifying limitations in specific situations where job safety is not compromised by their continued work. f. Introduces the term \"exemptions\" as defined and issued by the FMCSA for drivers with specific medical conditions (i.e., insulin-dependent diabetes, monocular vision, and limb loss or impairment). g. Adds language concerning drivers that use a controlled substance or drug prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner. In these cases, t he practitioner must not only advise the driver, but also provide the examiner a written statement certifying that the prescribed substance or drug will not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle (or equivalent). This is consistent with 49 C.F.R. \u00a7391.41. h. Incorporates language regarding the new OPNA V 8020/6 (Rev Feb 2015), Department of the Navy Medical Examiner's Certificate. 3. Action a. Remove pages 15-94 through 15-95b and replace with like-numbered pages from this change. b.

Updates the Contents page of Section IV to show the article changes. 2. Background . The development and utilization of U.S. Naval unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) has recently undergone explosive growth. With that comes an improved sense of physiologic requirements most desirable for the selection and retention of qualified and competent UAS operators. Removal from the inhospitable exposures of aerial flight (extremes of altitude, pressure, temperature , etc.) leaves only a few physiologic parameters that may still demand aeromedical standards above the general duty Sailor. In response to the needs of the Fleet and Fleet Marine Force, our experts in aviation medicine have appropriately modified previous outdated U.S. Naval UAS aeromedical accession standards in the Manual of the Medical Department. 3.

This Change corrects two items in MANMED Change 126, Chapter 15, Physical Examinations and Standards, Section IV, article 15-65(1), Applicant, Student, and Designated Standards, page 15-51 of 12 Aug 2005: a. The parenthetic descriptor following the term \"designation\" changes from (commissioning) to (winging) for when the Student Naval Aviator (SNA) or Student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) physical standards become Class I or Class II physical standards respectively. b. Changes the description of when physical standards for applicants to other Class II or III communities become \"designated\" from when orders to training are released to completion of the aviation training pipeline or required training syllabus. 2. Background a. The current descriptor in parentheses \"commissioning\" is not equivalent to its preceding tenn \"designation.\" Commissioning will generally happen before entering the aviation training pipeline, so it may not be used as an alternative to designation when training is complete. The \"winging\" ceremony is, however, coincident with becoming a designated Naval Aviator or Naval Flight Officer respectively and hence a better descriptor. _ b. For other Class II and III aviation training programs, the transition from applicant physical standards to designated physical standards is upon completion of that training pipeline or syllabus vice when orders to training are released. 3.

This document represents the first major revision of Chapter 15 of the Manual of the Medical Department in 10 years and the first top to bottom revision, including special duty examinations, in more than 20 years. In addition to re-numbering of the document, many articles have been revised to clarify language or maintain consistency with other governing instructions that have been modified but the overall intent has remained predominantly unchanged. However, many significant changes have been introduced in other articles and these changes are summarized in bullets below. While a complete reading of the entire chapter is necessary to discover all the changes, the following list captures the major revisions. a. Enlistment, Commission, Affiliation, Continued Service, and Separation (l) Clarification as to the role of this chapter as guidance on screening or qualifying examinations rather than guidance on population health or other clinically indicated evaluations. (2) Consistent with item #1 above, periodic examinations, including Flag officers, are no longer required. Based on data from the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board as well as the Air Force, routine examinations are not efficient or effective in maintaining the health of the Naval Force. Rather, the use of the Periodic Health Assessment should be used to meet this goal. (3) Also consistent with item #1 above, the section on Women's Preventive Health Care has been moved to MANMED chapter 22. In the event that this chapter is published before the revised chapter 22, the current guidance on Women's Preventive Health Care is included in Section V. (4) Disparities between Section III (Standards for Enlistment and Commission) and the parent instruction (DOD Instruction 6l30.4) have been eliminated. Previous differences between these instructions, especially for hearing and allergy immunotherapy, created problems for recruiting as well as recruit screening. The DOD Instruction authorizes additional service-specific standards for programs leading to a commission and color vision, which are essentially unchanged from the most recent Manual ofthe Medical Department (MANMED). (5) The physical qualification processes for affiliation and retention of reservists have been significantly revised to improve clarity and internal consistency as well as making it possible for service members (officers and enlisted) to be found physically qualified to affiliate with the reserves more easily within the first 6 months of separation from active duty service. These changes were requested and then endorsed by both Commander, Naval Reserve Recruiting Command (CNRRC) and Naval Personnel Command (NA VPERSCOM). (6) The processes for physically qualifying enrollees in programs leading to a commission for actual commissioning have been formalized and streamlined. (7) The authority to recommend a waiver of the physical standards to various line commands has been formalized and is now consistent with the other parallel instructions that govern application and acceptance to these programs. (8) Separation and Retirement evaluations have been streamlined and clarified to satisfy changes in Federal law, desires for smooth transitions to care via the Veteran's administration, and current recommendations for clinical practice. (9) Use of the Standard Forms 88 and 93 have been eliminated in favor of the forms DD 2807-1 and DD 2808 for recording complete physical examinations consistent with BUMED guidance issued in various ways over the last 4 years. (10) Increased use of references to parallel instructions within specific articles, especially the Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) and Marine Corps Separations Manual, to aid patient administrators as well as medical examiners in fulfilling their dual roles as Naval Officers and patient advocates. (11) A references and resources section has been added that provides guidance on other sources of related information not speci ficall y addressed in this chapter. b. A viation Duty (l) Class I aviation standards have been completely revised with Service Group categories no longer based on visual performance. (2) Aviation special duty standards have been aligned with revised entry and commission\u00ad ing standards (as defined by DOD Instruction 6130.4) in mind. (3) Integrated changes made in the last two revisions of NATOPS General Flight and Operating Instructions (OPNA VINST 3710. 7 series). Inconsistencies between NA TOPS and MANMED have been eliminated. (4) New validity and periodicity guidelines have bcen established that better support fleet and Marine Force sustainment requirements. (5) The aeromedical waiver process has been streamlined. 2 (6) The previously approved recommendations from several Aeromedical Advisory Council meetings have been codified. The new standards apply to both applicant as well as designated aviation personnel of all three classes. c. Diving Duty (1) This chapter is rewritten with the requirement for a annual health review (PHA) for divers in addition to maintaining the 5-year periodic examination. Particularly new is the requirement for a cardiology examination for Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) after a decompression sickness event. (2) MRI scanning after central nervous system (CNS) decompression sickness (DCS) and acute gas embolism (AGE) is now required. (3) Laser corneal refractive surgery is no longer disqualifying when there is a successful outcome. (4) Although a NAVPERS program, Alcohol Abuse and Dependency Treatment guides must be followed before resumption of Diving Duty. (5) All requests for waiver from the standards listed will be processed from the member's parent command to NAVPERS via type commander (TYCOM) medical endorsement and BUMED endorsement. d. Special Warfare/Special Operations Duty (1) The section on Special Warfare/Special Operations Duty (NSW/SO) is brand new. A small portion was previously covered under Diving Duty. It is the purpose of this chapter to define the physical standards that will support the physical demands and hazardous duty experienced by the NSW/SO service member. Included in the section are combat swimmer diving and basic and free-fall parachute duties covered by the physical standards that are outlined. (2) Standards include disqualification of accession applicants with a history of drug and steroid abuse as well as necessity for freedom from chronic diseases that might deteriorate when in isolated non-medically supported environments, psychotropic medication use, and the option of waiver for desihrnated operators who require prosthetic appliances. (3) All requests for waiver from the standards listed will be processed from the member's parent command to NA VPERS via TYCOM medical endorsement and BUMED endorsement. e. Submarine Duty (l) Prohibition of use of psychoactive medications have been updated and defined for purpose of waiver consideration. (2) Prohibition of surgery for weight loss has been added. 3 (3) Disorders of sleep are frequent and these disorders are now required to have specific medical documentation in order for disqualification or waiver to be considered. (4) The duration of waiting time before a return to duty in a service member who has had a single idiopathic seizure has been added. (5) The guidance for waiver of color perception deficiency has been added. A supervisor statement that the service member can satisfactorily distinguish color differences necessary in his employment is required. (6) The requirements for evaluation and waiver consideration of nephrolithiasis have been listed. (7) All requests for waiver from the standards listed will be processed from the member's parent command to NAVPERS via TYCOM medical endorsement and BUMED endorsement. f. Nuclear Field Duty (1) The guidance for waiver of color perception deficiency has been added. A supervisor statement that the service member can satisfactorily distinguish color differences necessary in his employment is required. (2) Prohibition of use of psychoactive medications have been updated and defined for purpose of waiver consideration. 3. Action a. Remove Chapter] 5 and replace with the new Chapter. b.

The purposes of these examinations arc specific for a wide range of duties or qualifications but are not guidance on population health or clinically indicated evaluations. (2) The chapter is divided into five sections (which include an appendix). (a) Section I discusses the application, recording, validity, and other issues that apply to all examinations. Instructions on applying for a waiver of the standards are now included in this section. (b) Section II provides guidance for specific groups of individuals who may require physical examinations. (c) Section III lists the disqualifying con\u00ad ditions for general duty enlistment and commission\u00ad ing. Instructions on applying for a waiver of the standards arc now included in the beginning of this section. (d) Section IV provides guidance on con\u00ad ducting examinations for certain special duty pur\u00ad poses (e.g. Aviation). 12 Aug 2005 Change 126 15-3 Article 15-1 (c) Section IV, Appendix A, is a new section that lists references for relatcd topics and resources. Note. The section titled E;:amina\u00ad oFtize Medical Department Chapter 22 (P\"\"vcllti,\u00b7c and Occupational lvfedicil1f'). (3) This chapter applies to all applicants and individuals already on active duty scrvice within thc Dcpartment of the Navy including the Marine Corps. Any reference to \"service member\" or \"applicant\" includes both organizations unless otherwise specifically stated. (4) The standards contained in this chapter are based on the DOD Instruction 6130.4. Additional requirements, including laboratory tests, resulted from an analysis of guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force, the US Navy Committee on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Anned Forces Epidemiology Board, and other published recommendations from recognized specialty organi\u00ad zations. Also, the unique operational need to main\u00ad tain a fit and ready Naval force was considered. 15-2 -Purposes of Medical Examinations (I) The primary purposes of medical examina\u00ad tions are to ensure that individuals undergoing these examinations are: (a) Physically capable of performing assigned and prospective duties without unnecessary risk of injury or harm to themselves or other service mem\u00ad bers. (b) Physically capable of performing assigned and prospective duties without assignment limitations or modifications to existing equipment and systems. ( c) Not likely to incur a physical disability as a result of military service. Manual of the Medical Department (2) Based upon the needs of the Naval Service and DOD, as well as ongoing changes in the under\u00ad standing of many physical or medical conditions, the standards contained in this chapter arc frequently reviewed and modified. Please ensure that the most current vcrsion is in use. (3) As stated in articlc 15-1, the purposes of the medical examinations contained in this chapter are not population or preventive health in nature, but rather are specific screening criteria developed to answer specific duty or qualification questions. 15-3 -Interpretation and Application of Physical Standards (I) For examinations conducted for the purpose of entry into Navy or Marine Corps service or speci\u00ad fic special duty service, the standards contained in this chapter are intended to be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. For many conditions the mere presence of the defect (e.g., hearing loss) would be a cause for disqualification even if the condition has not adversely affected the applicant. For other conditions (e.g., recurrent headaches) the impact on the applicant's health or functionality is of paramount importance. The evaluation ofthese latter conditions will be significantly more qualitative in nature and appropriate clinical judgment remains a critical cle\u00ad ment in effectively conducting an examination. (2) While clinical judgment is critical, examiners should be reluctant to find qualified those individuals who report concerning medical histories, but cannot present pertinent past medical records for review, or who are able to meet a particular requirement only after coaching or multiple repeat tests with only a single passing result. 15-4 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards 15-4 -Conducting and Recording the Examination (I) A Licensed Independent Practitioner or Physi\u00ad cian Assistant may perform all physical examinations covered in this chapter unless otherwise indicated. A General Medical Officer may independently per\u00ad form examinations ifhe or she has successfully com\u00ad pleted an accredited internship. All examiners, regardless of clinical speeialty, performing and recording physical examinations must be familiar with the standards outlined herein. Some special duty examinations (e.g., Aviation) must be performed or co-signed by examiners with specific training and/ or qualifications, review Section IV for further guid\u00ad ance. (2) All complete physical examinations will include forms DD 2807-1 \"Report of Medical History\" and DD 2808 \"Report of Medical Examina\u00ad tion.\" Examiners will carefully and objectively record all medical history and physical examination findings in the appropriate blocks on forms DD 2807-1 and DD 2808 using commonly accepted medical language. Also, ensure blocks on the form prompting identifying data, such as name or social security number, are properly completed on all pages. Use of the Standard Form (SF) 88 and 93 or NAVMED 6120/2 is not appropriate unless specifically required as part of a special duty evaluation. (a) Examinees will be carefully questioned about their medical history. Examiners should review form DD 2807-1 and comment on all affirmative or uncertain answers. (b) Physical examination findings should be recorded on form DD 2808 with particular emphasis on positive or negative results related to any items noted on form DD 2807-1. Dental officers should pcrform dental evaluations when available. (c) Examiners should request past medical records, additional diagnostic tests or specialty consultation when further information is deemed necessary. Article 15-4 (3) The examiner shall review and comment on all pertinent entries noted on forms DD 2807-1 and DD 2808 in sufficient detail to facilitate review by another qualified provider. Comments about positive responses on form DD 2807-1 or findings on form DD 2808 that do not constitute a significant diagnosis should be included solely in bloek 30 of form DD 2807-1 or block 73 offonl1 DO 2808. All significant diagnoses shall also be listed in block 77 of form DD 2808. For each condition or diagnosis and based upon the purpose of the examination (e.g., enlist\u00ad ment), notation should be made regarding whether the condition is or is not disqualifying for service. See article 15-3 above for further guidance. (a) For a condition or diagnosis that is deemed to be within the standards outlined in Section III or Section IV as appropriate, the notation NCD for Not Considered Disqualifying should be made at the end of the description of the condition or diagnosis. (b) For a condition or diagnosis that is /lot deemed to be within the standards outlined in Section III or Section IV as appropriate, the notation CD for Considered Disqualifying should be made at the end of the description of the condition or diagnosis. (c) For a condition or diagnosis that the examiner is U/lcertain whether it is or is not within the standards outlined in Section III or Section IV as appropriate, the notation PD for Potentially Disqualifying should be made at the end of the des\u00ad cription of the condition or diagnosis. This category should be used only temporarily until further informa\u00ad tion is available and should then be updated to either NCD orCD as appropriate. Use ofblock 78 ofform DD 2808 may be used to describe additional data required to make a final qualification decision. (d) If a condition deemed disqualifying by the examiner is ultimately granted a waiver (see article 15-31) by an appropriate authority, notation should be made in block 76 or 77 of DD 2808. Nota\u00ad tion should include the date and authority granting the waiver. These conditions may subsequently be deemed disqualifying for duties or programs not covered in the original waiver request. (4) The examiner shall indicate the final determination regarding qualification by checking the appropriate box on form DD 2808 block 74 (a). 12 Aug 2005 Change 126 15-5 Article 15-4 (5) For an examination to be considered valid, it must bear the signature and legibly printed, stamped, or typed name of the provider who performed the exam. (6) All physical examinations will be permanently filed in the member's outpatient health record. Sec Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED), Chapter 16 for further guidance. (7) Facilities conducting physical examinations will keep a copy of the examination and any support\u00ad ing documents on file for 2 years. (8) Examinations will be conducted with appro\u00ad priate regard for privacy and following current standards of care regarding standby attendants. 15-5 -Special Studies (1) The results of the studies listed below, in addition to any other studies deemed necessary by the examiner, will be entered on form DD 2808 in the appropriate sections of blocks 45-52 and 61-71. (2) The following studies shall be recorded for all complete medical examinations: (a) The result of a current human immuno\u00ad deficiency virus (HIV) test. (b) The results of a current audiometric test. (c) The results of a current visual acuity test. If uncorrected distant or ncar visual acuity is less than 20/20, the results of a current manifest refraction. (d) The results of a current dental examinati on (see Chapter 6, article 6-99). (e) The result of Sickle Cell screening ifnot previously recorded in health record. (f) The result of G-6-PD screening if not previously recorded in health record. (g) For females age 21 and older at the time of the examination, the results of a current Pap smear. Manual of the Medical Department (3) Enlisted service applicants do not need a Pap smear result recorded before reporting to their respective recruit training commands. (4) For all applicants for commission or a pro\u00ad gram leading to a commission the results of color vision testing. (5) Specific laboratory results will be recorded using current medical terminology. 15-6 -Personnel Already on Active Duty (1) In general the standards contained in this chapter are applicable only to initial entry into the United State Navy and Marine Corps, active and Reserve, or entry into special programs. See article 15-11 for guidance on recruits with disqualifying conditions discovered within the first 179 days of enlisted service. (2) Qualification for continued active duty service or retention, reenlistment, or separation should be based on the ability of a service member to perform the functions of his or her rate, rank, or occupational specialty without physical or medical limitations. (a) Examiners should consult SECNAVINST 1850.4 series (Disability Evaluation Manual) and Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED), Chapter 18 for guidance regarding service members who are unable to perform their duties as a result of a physical defect or medical condition. (b) In situations where a member is unable to perform their duties secondary to a physical con\u00ad dition not considered a disability, guidance may be found in MANMED, Chapter 18 as well as MIL\u00ad PERSMAN articles 1920 series (officers), 1910-120 (enlisted), and the Marine Corps Separations Manual, Chapter 8. 15-6 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards 15-7 -Validity Periods of Examinations (I) All complete physical examinations recorded on forms DO 2807-1 and DO 2808, assuming appro\u00ad priate in scope, are valid for 2 years. This standard does not apply to: (a) Some Special Duty Examinations. Review Section IV of this chapter. (b) Applicants applying for affiliation with the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves. Reviewarti\u00ad cle 15-22 of this chaptcr. (c) Enrollees in programs leading to a com\u00ad mission. Review the specific program heading in Section II of this chapter. (2) In cases not covered above, when a complete physical examination is required and more than 90 days, but less than 2 years has elapsed since the most recent examination was conducted, an updated form DO 2807-1 will be completed by the examinee and reviewed by an appropriate examiner (see article 15- 4). This DO 2807-1 should be annotated \"Addendum to Medical History dated (note the date of previous DD 2807-1 )\" on the top of the form. (a) Ifthere are no changes since the recording of the previous OD 2807-1 the statement \"No signi\u00ad ficant interval history since last evaluation dated (note the date of previous DD 2807-1)\" should be recorded Article 15-7 in block 30. The examiner's determination regarding quali fication for the duty or assignment sought will also be included in block 30 (e.g., \"Member is quali\u00ad fied for commission\"). The examiner must sign the DD 2807 -I. No further documentation or laboratory data is required. (b) If significant new medical history is obtained, each item should be specifically reviewed and commented on by the examiner in block 30. ill If the updated information does not warrant any type of physical exam then the statement \"No physical examination performed\" will be in\u00ad cluded in block 30 of the DD 2807-1. The examiner's determination regarding qualification for the duty or assignment sought will also be included in block 30 (e.g., \"Member is qualified for commission\"). ill If the updated information warrants physical examination of applicant, the results should be recorded on form DD 2808. The statement \"Addendum to Physical Examination dated (note the date of previous DD 2808)\" should be recorded on the top of the form. All pertinent administrative data (e.g., name, date, and social security number) must be included on the DO 2808, but only the specific area(s) examined and any new laboratory results should be recorded on the applicable parts of the form. The examiner must sign form DD 2808. The examiner's determination regarding qualification for the duty or assignment sought will also be included in block 77 (e.g., \"Member is qualified for com\u00ad mission\"). 12 Aug 2005 Change 126 15-7 Article 15-7 Manual of the Medical Department THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 15-8 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-8 Section II COMMON MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS Article Page 15-8 Purpose 15-10 15-9 Periodic Examinations for Active Duty Personnel States Naval Academy 15-12 15-15 United States Merchant Marine Academy 15-13 15-16 Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) and State Maritime Academies 15-13 15-17 Programs Leading to Superseding Commission 15-14 15-18 Platoon Leadership Course 15-15 15-19 Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) 15-16 15-20 Separation from Active Duty 15-16 15-21 Retirement from Active Duty 15-17 15-22 Affiliation with the Naval And Marine Reserves 15-18 15-23 Retention in the Naval and Marine Reserves 15-20 15-24 Civilian Employees 15-21 12 Aug 2005 Change 126 15-9 Article 15-8 Manual of the Medical Department Article Page 15-25 Deserters 15-21 15-26 Pdsoners 15-2 ] List (TDRL) 15-22 15-8 -Purpose (1) The specific reasons for conducting a physical examination andlor evaluation contained in this section are not all-inclusive but provided to give additional guidance for some of the common situa\u00ad tions in which an examination is indicated. 15-9 -Periodic Examinations for Active Duty Personnel (1) Routine periodic physical cxaminations are no longer required for active duty personnel including flag officers. Please sec OPNAVINST 6120.3 series for guidance on the Preventive Health Assessment. 15-10 -Applications for Enlistment (1) All applicants for enlistment must have a com\u00ad plete physical examination conducted within the pre\u00ad vious 2 years of application per Section I of this Chapter. Ifmore than 90 days, but less than 2 years have elapsed since completion of the most recent examination and formal application, sec article 15-7 for further guidance. 15-11 -Recruit Screening (1) Recruit Screening evaluations are conducted at Recruit Training Commands and Marine Corps Recruit Depots for the purposes of detecting medical disorders that may have been missed or concealed during the recruit's initial examination, or that may have developed during the period from initial exam\u00ad ination to enlistment. (2) Recruit screening examinations should be conducted within 14 days of reporting to recruit training. 15-10 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards (3) Applicable studics listcd in aIticle 15-5 will be conducted if not completed prior to arrival at recruit training.

Use of a pre-fonnatted SF 600 is encouraged. (5) For recruits with less than 180 days of active service since enlistment who are discovered to have a disqualifying medical condition per Section III of this chapter that existed prior to enlistment and that has not materially changed since in receipt of base pay, recruit training commands may pursue one of two options: (a) For recruits not recommended for reten\u00ad tion on active duty, separate the service member under the provisions of MILPERSMAN 1910-130 or the Marine Corps Separations Manual. The pro\u00ad cedures outlined in article 15-20 in this chapter are not required for these separating service members. (b) For recruits recommended for retention on active duty, the Director, BUMED Qualifications and Standards will issue, on request, a recommenda\u00ad tion regarding retention of the member on active duty to the member's recruit training command comman\u00ad der. Send requests including all pertinent medical data along with the relevant seetions of the recruit's most recent complete physical examination (forms DD 2807-1 and 2808) to the Director, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Qualifications and Standards for review. The Director, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Qualifications and Standards will issue a recommendation regarding retention to the member's recruit training command commander who will make the final determination regarding retention or separation from active duty service. 15-12 -Article 15-12 Reenlistment (I) Reenlistment exami nations and eval uations are conducted for the purpose of ensuring that no new medical conditions have developed or no previously diagnosed conditions have materially changed that might prevent the service member from safely or effectively fulfilling the responsibilities of their rank or rating. (2) Reenlistment evaluations will include as a minimum: (a) Completion of form DD 2807-1 by the service member. (b) Review of the completed DD 2807-1 by an appropriate examiner (see article 15-4 and article 15-12(2)( e) below) with specific comments on any new medical conditions that have arisen or conditions that have materially changed since the most recent enlistment or reenlistment.

(2) For enrollees at the USUHS applying for a superseding commission at the time of graduation, the Dean of the USUHS has exclusive responsibility for establishing these policies and procedures. 15-20 Separation from Active Duty (1) Separation examinations will follow MAN - MED guidance as well as requirements and timelines outlined in the DoD Instruction 6040.46 , The Separa- tion History and Physical Examination (SHPE) for DoD Separation Health Assessment (SHA) Program and DoD level guidance that pertains to the com - pletion of the SHPE. (a) For reserve component individuals who do not meet requirements for a SHPE as outlined in DoD Instruction 6040.46, a request for a physical examination may be made an d documented utilizing a DD Form 2697. (2) Separation examinations and evaluations, in - cluding for members of the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves serving on active duty for 31 or more con - secutive days, shall be performed for all separating Service members within 180 days of last active duty day per DoD Instruction 6040.46 regarding separa - tions physical examinations. A DoD -performed phy- sical examination may be accepted between 90 days and up to 12 months prior to the scheduled date of separation from active duty if it meets SHPE mini - mum standards, but a medical assessment must be completed no more than 30 days prior to separation from active duty. These comprehensive evaluations are conducted for the purposes of ensuring that Ser - vice members have not developed any medical con - ditions while in receipt of base pay that might con- stitute a disability that should be processed by the Physical Evaluation Board ( PEB ) and to ensure Ser- vice members are physically qualified for recall to additional periods of active duty. Thus, the stand - ards for being physically qualified to separate are the same as those being qualified to continue active duty Service and to affiliate with the reserves . See SEC - NAVINST 1850.4 series and MANMED chapter 18, Medical Evaluation Boards, for further guidance. If the Service member has recently returned from a deployment, while not speci fically part of the sep - aration evaluation, ensure appropriate completion of post-deployment health screening. A separate process exists for the unique situation of returned deserters being processes for separation (see article 15 -25). (3) To meet the goals outlined above, separa- tion evaluations will include at a minimum: (a) Completion of DD Form 2807- 1 by the Service member.* (b) Interview of the Service member an d review of the completed DD Form 2807- 1 by an appropriate examiner (see article 15 -4) with specific comments on any new medical conditions that have arisen or have materially changed since beginning active duty service (this should include a review of the member's outpatient medical record).* (c) A focused physical examination docu - mented on DD Form 2808 and laboratory test results, as indicated, for any new or materially changed medi - cal condition discovered.* (d) Determination by the examiner if the Service member is physically qualified for separation. (e) All Service members over the age of 35 at their effective date of separation shall be offered screening for the presence of hepatitis C antibodies. (f) A mental health assessment completed within 180 days of separation. Mental health assess - ments completed within this timeframe in conjunc - tion with the Service member's periodic health ass - essment , pre -deployment health assessment, or post - deploy ment health reassessment meet this require- ment. *Note. In lieu of articles 15 -20(2)(a) through 15 -20(2)(c) , providers may accept a current Veteran's Administration compensation and pension (C&P) history and physical or Special Duty Examination. (4) The completed DD Form 2801- 1, DD Form 2808, and the results of the evaluation outlined in articles 15 -20(c) and 15- 20(d) will be uploaded into the Service member's electronic medical record. The 15-16 Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -21 results of the evaluation, including any laboratory test results obtained, will be documented in the electronic medical treatment record indicating completion of SHPE. If a Service member is found not to be physi - cally qualified for separation, the planned course of action (e.g., referral to PEB) should also be stated. For reservists found not physically qualified for separa- tion, see MILPERSMAN 1916 series. Service mem - bers found physically qualified to separate shall also read and i nitial the following statement: Reading Text: You have been evaluat ed because of your planned separation or retirement from active duty service. You have been found physically qualified to separate or retire, which means that no medical condition has be en noted that disqualifies you from the performance of your duties or warrants disability evaluation system processing. To receive disability benefits from the Department of the Navy, you must be unfit to perform the duties of your office, grade, or ratin g because of a disease or injury incurred or exacerbated while in receipt of base pay. Some conditions, while not considered disqualifying for separation or retirement, may entitle you to benefits from the Department of Veteran's Affairs. If you desire ad ditional information regarding these benefits, contact the Department of Veteran's Affairs at 1 -800- 827-1000 or view the Web site at http://www.va.gov . (5) Hepatitis C screening is voluntary and the results of any testing or delays in obtaining results will not interfere with release from active duty. Service members who request screening must complete NAV - MED 6230/1 and it must be placed in the out -patient medical record. (6) For administrative purposes only a pr e- formatted SF -600 may be used to report completion of DD Form 2807- 1 and DD Form 2808. (7) For Service members separating from S er- vice after 30 or fewer consecutive days on active duty, a different separation process may apply per DoD Instruction 6040. 46. All Service members should complete DD Form 2807- 1 and an authorized exam - iner will interview each Service member focusing on any new or materially changed medical conditions occurring since the start of active duty and, if indicated, conduct a focused physical examination on DD Form 2808 and document the Service member's health status in electronic medical record. For mem - bers found not qualified due to service -incurred or service -aggravated injury or illness a Notice of Eligibility (NOE) may be a ppropriate, see SECNAV - INST 1770.3. (8) For Service members being separated fol - lowing a finding of \"unfit for continued Naval Service\" by the PEB, the procedures outlined in articles 15 -20(3) through 15- 20(6) do not apply. Instead, documentation in the Service member's electronic medical treatment record will be made indicating, that the Service member has been found unfit and is being processed for separation from active duty service. (9) Sepa rations or discharges characterized as adverse (i.e., other than honorable, bad conduct, dis - honorable) affect how medical conditions fit into the separation process, but do not change the require- ments for the evaluation outlined in articles 15 -20(3) and 15- 20(4). See MILPERSMAN article 1910 -216 (enlisted). MIL PERSMAN 1920 articles (officers), and the Marine Corps Separations Manual, sections 1011 and 8508. See article 15- 25 for specific guid - ance on separation evaluations of deserters. 15-21 Retirement from Active Duty (1) Retirement examinations and evaluations shall be performed using DD Form 2807- 1 and DD Form 2808 for all retiring Service members within 180 days of the member's last active duty day. These comprehensive evaluations are conducted for the purpose of ensuring that Service members have not developed any medical conditions that might constitute a disability that should be processed by the PEB. The \"standards\" for being physically qualified to retire must include the presumption of fitness that comes with reaching retirement eligibility, and the threshold for referral to the PEB for a member who has successfully reached years of service qualifying for retirement is different than a member who has not reached the threshold. See SECNAVINST 1850.4 series and MANMED chapter 18 for further guid - ance. If the Service member has recently returned from a deployment, while not specifically part of the retirement evaluation, ensure appropriate completion of post -deployment health screening. 15 Feb 2019 Change 167 15- 17 Article 15 -21 Manual of the Medical Department (2) To meet the goals outlined above, retirement evaluations will include at a minimum: (a) Completion of DD Form 2807- 1 by the Service member.* (b) Review of the completed DD Form 2807- 1 by an appropriate examiner (see article 15 -4) with specific comments on any new medical con - ditions that have arisen or have materially changed since beginning active duty service.* (c) A focused physical examination docu - mented on DD Form 2808 and laboratory test result s, as indicated, for any new or materially changed medi - cal conditions discovered.* (d) Determination by the examiner if the Service member is physically qualified for retirement. (e) All Service members over the age of 35 at their effective date of retirement shall be offered screening for the presence of hepatitis C antibodies. (f) A mental health assessment completed within 180 days of separation. Mental health assess - ments completed within this timeframe in conjunction with the Service member' s periodic health assessment, pre-deployment health assessment or post -deployment health re -assessment meet this requirement. Note. In lieu of articles 15 -21(2)(a) through 15 -(2)(c), providers may accept a current Veteran's Administration compensation and pension (C&P) history and physical. (3) The completed DD Form 2807- 1 and the results of the evaluation outlined in articles 21 -(2)(c) and 15- 21(2)(d) will be placed in the Service mem - ber's electronic medical treatment records. If a mem - ber is found not to be physically qualified for retire - ment, the planned course of action (e.g., referral to PEB) should also be stated. Members found physi - cally qualified for retirement shall also read and initial the following statement: Reading Text : You have been evaluated because of your planned separation or retirement from active duty service. You have been found physically qualified to separate or retire, which means that no medical condition has been noted that disqualifies you from the performance o f your duties or warrants disability evaluation system processing. To receive disability benefits from the Department of the Navy, you must be unfit to perform the duties of your office, grade, or rating because of a disease or injury incurred or exacerbated while in receipt of base pay.

(5) Hepatitis C screening is voluntary and the re - sults will not interfere with release from active duty. Service members who request screening must com - plete NAVMED 6230/1, this form will be placed in the Service member's electronic medical treatment re- cord. 15-18 Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -22 15-22 Affiliation with the Nav y and Marine Corps R eserves (1) Applicants desiring affiliation with the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves who have separated from Navy or Marine Corps active duty service or drilling reserve status or with a type of separatio n that was not related to a medical condition (i.e., PEB finding of unfitness, administrative separations for: fraudulent enlistment, defective enlistment, a physical condition not considered a disability, not being worldwide assignable, or personality dis order) must follow guide - lines outlined in 15 -22(3)(a) or 15- 22(3)(b), dependent on the date of their last complete comprehensive SHPE consisting of DD Form 2807- 1 and DD Form 2808. (a) For applicants who have no prior service in the Navy or Marine Corps , the applicant must follow the guidance outlined in a rticle 15 -10 for en - listed applicants and a rticle 15 -13 for commissioning applicants. For validity of new affiliation exams, refer to article 15 -7. (2) The validity of a SHPE for Navy and Marine Corps Service members desiring to affiliate into the Navy and Marine Corps reserve is 36 months from the date listed on DD Form 214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, with the understanding that additional tests, as indicated, may be necessary for any new or materially changed medical condition(s) discovered with additional required documents. (a) In lieu of SHPE, Providers may accept a current Veteran's Administration compensation and pension (C&P) history and physical. Receipt of Veteran's Administration (VA) disability compensa - tion does not necessarily render the Service member unfit to reasonably perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, rating, or deployability. Reserve component applicants who have received VA disability , may be affiliated without a medical waiver recommendation if one of two conditions are met: 1) they are within the separation timeframe criteria out - lined in DoD Instruction 6130.03 s ection 4(d); or 2) they were in a deployable status upon separat ion and have no material change in medical condition and a level of activity supports functional capacity to serve in the selected position. C ases will be individually screened and reviewed by appropriate medical personnel. Screening providers may use cli nical judgement for adjudication of recommending these individuals for affiliation to the Navy or Marine Corps reserve. Acceptance of Veteran's Administration C&P history and physical will follow the same guidance listed in a rticles 15 -22(1) through 15 -22(4) for SHPE documents. (b) In lieu of SHPE, providers may accept Special Duty Examination, including a completed DD Form 2807- 1 and DD Form 2808, following the same guidance listed in a rticles 15 -22(1) through 15- 22(4) for SHPE documents. (3) Applicant Responsibilities (a) If SHPE , or appropriate alternative phys - ical examination listed in a rticles 15 -22(2)(a) and (b), is over 36 months from date of separation on DD Form 214, the applicant must: (1) Undergo a physical examination consisting of completing a new DD Form 2807- 1, Report of Medical History and meet with a medical provider to conduct a physical examination that is documented using a DD Form 2808, Report of Med- ical Examination following the procedures outlined in article s 15-3 through 15- 5.

(4) Examiner Responsibilities. If less than 36 months from date of separation on DD Form 214, an appropriate examiner (see article 15 -4) shall review all provided documents and conduct a focused physical examination and request additional tests, for any new or materially changed medical condition(s) dis - covered. If greater than 36 months from date of separation on DD Form 214, full physical examination documented on a DD Form 2808 is required. (a) If no new condition(s) have developed or materially changed since active duty or active reserve duty separation, the applicant is physically qualified for affiliation and this inf ormation is annotated on the new DD Form 2807- 1 and placed in the Service member's outpatient medical record. (b) If any new condition has developed, or a previously existing condition has materially changed, an initial screening of the condition(s) usi ng the standards outlined in Section III, chapter 15, will be per-formed. (1) If after screening and review by appropriate medical personnel, no disqualifying con- dition(s) exist, per affiliation standards, the applicant should be found physically qual ified for affiliation and no higher level authority review is required. This information should be annotated on the new DD Form 2807- 1 along with any additional medical documentation and placed in the Service member's outpatient medical record. (2) If as a result of the screening the condition(s) are considered disqualifying for affilia - tion, all documents will be forwarded to their respec- tive service as indicated below: (a) For Navy 1. Commander, Navy Recruit - ing Command (CNRC) for review a nd determination of qualification for affiliation, then 2. Commander, Naval Person - nel Command (NAVPERSCOM) , where final deter - mination for affiliation or retention in the reserves will be made. (b) For Marine Corps 1. BUMED Chief of Qualifi - cations and Standards Director for review and deter - mination of qualification for affiliation, then 2.

(c) A grace period through 31 December 2019 is granted to allow for documentation of the physical exa m on a preformatted SF 600, in lieu of a DD Form 2808. An updated medical history is still required using the DD Form 2807- 1 to accompany the preformatted SF -600. If the quality of th e exam and assessment on the SF 600 is not sufficient, the reviewing provider may require a more compre - hensive exam on a DD Form 2808. 15-23 Retention in the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves (1) The structure of the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves differ from those of the full -time active duty components and as such unique processes exist in the medical evaluation of reservists for retention. Additional guidance is contained in MILPERSMAN 6110- 020 and the Marine Corps Separations Manual. (2) All members of the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve annually complete a periodic health assess - ment. (3) The unit Medical Department Representative (MDR) will review each periodic health assessment and evaluate all new or materially changed medical conditions. MDRs are encouraged to obtain additional information from reservists via outpatient medical records or other sources as appropriate to develop as complete an un derstanding as possible of the con- dition(s). (4) If an MDR determines that a reservist has developed or had a material change in a medical con - dition that will likely prevent the Service member from safely or effectively fulfilling the responsibilities of their rank or rating or interfere with mobilization, the following actions should occur: 15-20 Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -23 (a) The member should be classified \"temp - orarily not physically qualified\" as appropriate. (b) The following documentation will be assembled: all available medical information includ - ing copies of outpatient medical records, the 3 pre- vious years of preventive health assessments, a com - manding officer's statement regarding any limitations in the reservist's performing of required duties and potential for future military service, and any DD Form 2808 completed within the previous 3 years. (c) The documentation outlined in article 15-24(4)(b) will be sent, via appropriate chain of command, to the Director BUMED Qualifications and Standards for review. (1) When a recommendation can be made regarding retention in the reserves, the Director, BUMED Qualifications and Standards will send the recommendation to NAVPERSCOM or Marine Corps Personnel Command (MMSR -4) for final action. (2) If a recommendation cannot be made regarding retention (e.g., incomplete in forma - tion, condition not yet stable) the Director, BUMED Qualifications and S tandards will send requests for information or guidance directly to the reservist's unit. (d) For reservists whose medical condition is newly diagnosed or not yet stabilized or appro- priately treated, MDRs may delay submission of a retention package until sufficient medical information is available. However, at no time should submission of a retention package be delayed more than 180 days. (5) If an MDR is not able to determine whether or not a reservist's medical condition will likely pre - vent the Service member from safely and effectively fulfilling the responsibilities of their rank and rating or interfere with mobilization. Contact the Director, BU - MED Qualifications and Standards directly for ad di- tional guidance. Retention packages as outlined in article 15 -23(4) may not be necessary for some conditions. (6) If an MDR determines that a medical con - dition will not prevent the Service member from safely and effectively fulfilling the responsibi lities of their rank and rating or interfere with mobilization then the reasoning for this determination should be documented in the reservist outpatient medical record. An entry on the DD Form 2766 should also be made when indicated. (7) For screening of reservists ordered to active duty, see OPNAVINST 3060.7 series and BUPERS - INST 1001.39 series. (8) If a Service member is not recommended for retention per the Director, BUMED Qualifications and Standards or the Service member is found \"Unfit to Conti nue Naval Service,\" the Service member may be authorized an appeal process through a formal PEB, as outlined in SECNAVINST 1770.5 series and SEC - NAVINST 1850.4 series. Navy or Marine Corps Headquarters responsible for processing of PEB appeals may apply de finitive time limitations for submission of PEB packages. (9) For reserve component individuals who are eligible for retirement but do not meet requirements for a SHPE as outlined in DoD Instruction 6040.46, do not meet requirements for a retirement exam ination as outlined in article 15 -21, or do not require a referral to a formal PEB , a request for a physical exam may be made and documented utilizing a DD Form 2697. 15-20a Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -26 15-24 Civilian Employees (1) For guidance on performance of medical examinations of civilian employees by Medical and Dental Corps officers; see NAVMEDCOMINST 6320.3 series. 15-25 Deserters (1) For deserters being detained at a Naval place of confinement; review SECNAVINST 1640.9 series.

(c) A focused physical examination and lab - oratory test results, as indicated, for any medical con -dition(s) that may pose an immediate danger of death or may be extremely severe. (d) Determination by the examiner if the Service member is physically qualified for separation. A Service member who is felt to be free of medical conditions that may pose an immediate danger of death or that are extremely severe should be found qualified to separate. (e) Completion of DD Form 2697. Note. Obtaining previous active duty records is no longer required. A psychiatric evaluation is no longer required in all cases and should be obtained only if deemed necessary in determining if a condition poses an immediate danger of death or is extremely severe. (3) The completed DD Form 2807- 1 and the re - sults of the evaluation outlined in articles 15 -25(2)(c) and 15- 25(2)(d) will be placed in the Service mem - ber's outpatient medical record.

Please see SECNAVINST 1850.4 series for further guidance on conducting these examina\u00ad tions. (2) For members removed from the TDRL by being found fit for duty who choose to return to active duty service, conduct a complete physical under the guidelines in articles 15-3 through 15-5 in this Chap\u00ad ter. The condition leading to placement on the TDRL that has now been deemed compatible with active duty service does not require a waiver of the physical standards. Additionally, disqualifying medical con\u00ad ditions (see Section III) that existed while the service member was previously on active duty that have not materially changed and did not interfere with their ability to safely and effectively fulfill the responsi\u00ad bilities of their rank and rating should be classified as \"not considered disqualifying.\" New or materially changed conditions require a waiver of the physical standards, see article 15-31 of this Chapter. 15-22 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -30 Section III STANDARDS FOR ENLISTMENT AND COMMISSIONING Article Page 15-30 Purpose 15-25 15-31 The Senior Chief Shannon Kent Process for Waiver of Physical Standards 15-25 15-32 Introduction to the Physical Standards Ears 15-44 Abdominal Organs Gastrointestinal System 15-34 15 Feb 2019 Change 167 15- 23 Article 15 -30 Manual of the Medical Department Article Page 15-45 Female 15-50 Lower 15-39 15-52 15-40 15-53 Skin and Psychiatric and Behavioral Disorders 15-44 15-59 General and Miscellaneous Conditions and Defects 15-46 Malignant Diseases 15-46 15-61 Misce llaneous 15-46 15-24 Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -31 15-30 Purpose (1) The primary purposes of the physical stand - ards contained in this section are to ensure individuals applying for enlistment or commission (or affiliation with the reserves) are physically capable of perform - ing the assigned duties in accordance with DOD Instruction 6130.03. (2) Many individuals will be physically qualified to enlist, commission or affiliate , but not be physically qualified for some special duties or assignments; see section II of this chapter for further guidance. (3) Service Medical Waiver Review Authorities (SMWRA) must proactively develop th e medical waiver recommendation process to maximize positive waiver recommendations while maintaining quality applicants. DoD policy requires those currently and previously serving to meet accession standards out - lined in DoD Instruction 6130.03, Medical S tandards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction into the Military Service. The ability to perform military duties is a critical component of the waiver decision and highest consideration should be afforded to those already serving in a deployable status . (4) To facilitate a standardized waiver process, all SMWRAs will operate on the same information technology platform, undergo standardized training, and maintain a combined quality assurance program. (5) The standard s for enlistment, appointment, or induction in the military service are published in the DoD Instruction 6130.3, according to the authority in Title 10, United States Code, Section 13. Navy specific vision color standards for commission are outlined in MANMED Chapter 15, Change 152. The standards within DoD Instruction 6130.03 are frequently reviewed and modified; ensure that the most current version is used. Future updates or re - visions will align the MANMED Chapter 15, Section III standards for enlistment and commissioning with the DoD Instruction 6130.03. 15-31 The Senior Chief Shannon Kent Process for Waiver of Physical Standards (1) For some applicants , their current level of functioning or state of health, in spite of the presence of a disqualifying medical condition as outlined in DOD Instruction 6130.03 , warrants a waiver of the standards. (2) Waivers of the standards do not make an appli cant \"physically qualified,\" but rather provide the applicant the opportunity to enlist or commission (or affiliate with the reserves) despite the fact that a disqualifying condition exists. (3) The authority to grant a waiver lies with the commander charged with enlisting or commissioning the applicant and the specific program desired (e.g., Commander, Marine Corps Recruiting Command is the authority for applicants desiring enlistment in the Marine Corps). The medical authority to recommend a waiver of the standards to these various commands resides with Chief, BUMED. By direction authority to carry out this function has been granted to the SMWRAs: (a) The Director, BUMED Qualifications and Standards. Provides waiver recommendations to: Commander, Marine Corps Recruiting Command; Commander, Naval Services Training Command (NROTC entry, commission of NROTC enrollees, commission of MMR, USNR enrollees); Commander, Naval Medical Education and Training C ommand; Commander, Officer Candidate School; Superinten - dent, U.S. Naval Academy; Superintendent, United States Mercha nt Marine Academy (USMMA entry) . Additionally, the Director, BUMED Qualifications and Standards provides guidance to the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve commands regarding physical qualification for retention of Service members in the reserves and to the recruit training commands regard - ing retention of recruits found to have disqualifying medical conditions. 15 Feb 2019 Change 167 15- 25 Article 15 -31 Manual of the Medical Department (b) The Senior Medical Waiver Review Authority , Navy Recruiting Command. Provides waiver recommendations to: Commander, Navy Re - cruiting Command ( includ ing: Health Professions Scholarship Program and Nurse Comm issioning Pro - gram ). (c) The Navy Brigade Surgeon, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. Provides waiver recommendations to: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (enrollment and grad uation commissions). (d) Admissions Medical Officer, United States Naval Academy. Provides waiver recommen - dations to: Superintendent, U.S. Naval Academy. (e) The Commanding Officer, Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center. Pro - vides wa iver recommendations to Navy Recruit Train - ing Center for mental health matters only. (4) The processes for requesting a waiver vary based on the program the applicant is seeking. Review the pertinent guidance issued by the enlisting or com - missioning authority 15-31(3)(a) through 15- 31(3)(e). However, regardless of the specific procedures in - volved, most delays in waiver recommendations result from inadequate information provided with the waiver request. When assembling a waiver request package ensur e, at a minimum, the following information is included: most recent complete physical examination, all pertinent past medical records, documentation regarding past and current limitations of activity asso - ciated with the condition, and the results of any laboratory testing. (5) The following describe s the process for sub - mitting an Appeal of Medical Waiver Recommenda - tion Decisions: (a) Service representatives (i.e., recruiters or admissions personnel representing the commanders charged with enli sting, commissioning, retaining, or inducting) may request an appeal of physical standards if a \"waiver not recommended\" disposition on a waiver request for an applicant has been issued. (b) Appeal requests that come through other entities (Congressional inquiries, the applicant, friends or family members of the applicant, etc.) will be routed through the Service representative. (1) The first level of appeal will be a reconsideration of the case by a different med ical reviewer than the person who did the initial review. If the Senior Medical Review Authority (SMRA) does not have the personnel to provide a second reviewer, the SMRA can seek a second review from the appro- priate Specialty Leader or BUMED Medical Readi - ness (BUMED -M34). If the second reviewer makes a \"waiver recommend\" determination, the decision will be routed back to the commander charged with enlisting, commissioning, retaining, or inducting the applicant via the established system for each com - mander. (2) If the second reviewer makes a \"waiver not recommended\" determination, the case will be forwarded, with any amplifying comments from the SMRA, to BUMED Deputy Chief, Readiness & Health. The BUMED Deputy Chief, Readiness & Health will make the final medical waiver recom - mendation determination. (c) The recommendation made by BUMED Deputy Chief, Readiness & Health will be routed back to the commander charged with enlisting, com - missioning, retaining, or inducting the applicant via established system for each commander. (6) Service members who enter the military with a medical waiver may be separated within 180 days without referral to the Disability Evaluation System, in accordance with MANMED Chapter 18. 15-25a Change 167 15 Feb 2019 Article 15 -31 Manual of the Medical Department (5) Results of waiver requests (approved or denied) should be recorded in block 76 or 77 of the DD 2808. (6) Waiver processes for special duty examina - tions and assignments are contained in Section IV within the description of the standards for each specific program. (7) The Navy Medicine Operational Training Center Detachment, Naval Aerospace Medical Insti - tute, (NAMI Code 342) is designated as the Program Manager for assessment and determination of the qualification of applicants, both enlisted and com - missioned, for duties involving aviation. In this capacity, NAMI is authorized to issue correspond - dence recommending waivers of physical standards to the commander charged with enlisting or com - missioning and the specific program desired. Such correspondence shall include letters recommending commissioning by the appropriate authority. 15-32 Introduction to the Physical Standards (1) The following list of disqualifying physical and medical conditions is organized generally by organ system and from the head down.

(2) Aviation physical standards and medical ex- amination requirements are developed to ensure the most qualified personnel are accepted and retained by naval aviation. Further elaboration of standards, medical examination requirements, and waiver pro- cedures are contained in the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG); (see http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmotc/nami/arwg/Pag es/AeromedicalReferen ceandWaiverGuide.aspx ). 15-63 Classes of Aviation Personnel (1) Applicants, students, and designated aviation personnel assigned to duty in a flying class and certain non-flying aviation related personnel defined below must conform to physical standards in this article. Those personnel are divided into four classes. (a) Class I. Naval aviators and student naval aviators (SNA). For designated naval aviators, Class I is further subdivided into three Medical Service Groups based on the physical requirements for pur- poses of specific flight duty assignment: (1) Medical Service Group 1. A v i a t o r s qualified for unlimited or unr estricted flight duties. (2) Medical Service Group 2. A v i a t o r s restricted from shipboard aircrew duties (include V/ STOL) except helicopter. (3) Medical Service Group 3. A v i a t o r s restricted to operating aircraft equipped with dual controls and accompanied on all flights by a pilot or copilot of Medical Service Group 1 or 2, qualified in the model of aircraft operated. A separate request is required to act as pilot-in-command of multi-piloted aircraft. (b) Class II. Aviation personnel other than pilots, designated naval aviators, or student naval aviators including naval flight officers (NFO), techni-cal observers, naval flight surgeons (NFS), aerospace medicine physician assista nts (APA), aerospace oper- ational physiologists (NAO P), aerospace experiment- tal psychologists (AEP), naval aerospace optome-trists, naval aircrew (NAC) members, and other per- sons ordered to duty involving flying. (c) Class III. Members in aviation-related duty not requiring them to personally be airborne including Air Traffic Controllers (ATC), flight deck, and flight line personnel. (d) Class IV. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operators. Active duty and DON/DoD-GS members in aviation-related duty not required to per- sonally be airborne including: Air vehicle operators (AVO), sensor operators (SO), mission payload oper- ators (MPO), and unmanned aircraft comm anders (UAC). Note. The physical qualification submission requirements and any associated waiver recommendations are now based on the assigned UAS Group as listed in Commander Naval Air Forces (CNAF) M- 3710.7 series or with respect to commercial, off-the-shelf, models by aircraft operating characteristic s. While the physical standards across all of the UAS Groups remain the same, the physical exam processing requirements have c hanged appropriately to address operational requirements. UAS operators must be assessed and processed based on the highest UAS Group they are qualified to operate. UAS operators flying aircraft limited only to those of UAS Group 1 and 2 and small, commercial, off-the-shelf vehicles weigh-ing 55 pounds or less may have th eir physicals performed by any qualified DoD medical provider and any associated waivers may be approved locally by individual unit commanders. The NAVMED 6410/13 UAS Physical Worksheet, and the ARWG continue to provide useful reference and guidance for all UAS classes. How- ever, there are likely few conditions for the majority of the small UAS operators that may demand aeromedical standards above that of the general duty Sailor or Marine . In no case should an individual receive medical clearance with a medical condition present, which may incapacitate an individual suddenly, subtly, or without warning. Further, personnel may not perform UAS operations while using any medication whose known common adverse effects or intended action(s) affect alertne ss, judgment, cognition, special sensory function or coordination. This includes both over the counter and prescription medications. 15-50 Chan ge 165 1 J un 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-64 NAVMED 6410/13, which should be performed and included in the health record for all UAS classes, can be found at: http://www.med.navy.mil/directives/Pages/NAVME DForms.aspx . (e) All United States Uniformed Military Exchange Aviation Personnel. As agreed to by the Memorandum of Understanding between the Services, the Navy will generally accept the physical standards of the military service by which the member has been found qualified. (f) Aviation Designated Foreign Nationals. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee have agreed that the items listed below remain the responsibility of the parent nation (nation of whose armed forces the individual is a member). More detailed information is located in the ARWG. ( 1 ) Standards for primary selection. ( 2 ) Permanent medical disqualification. ( 3 ) Determination of temporary flying dis- abilities exceeding 30 days. (4) Periodic examinations will be conduc- ted according to host nation procedures. (5) If a new medical condition arises, the military flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner (AME), or aerospace medicine physician assistant pro- viding routine care will determ ine fitness to fly based on the host nation's aviation medicine regulations and procedures. Temporary flying disabilities likely to exceed 30 days and conditions likely to lead to permanent aeromedical disqualification should be referred to the parent nation. (g) Certain non-designat ed personnel, includ- ing civilians, may also be assigned to participate in duties involving flight. Such personnel include selec- ted passengers, project specialists, and technical ob- servers. The specific requirements are addressed in the ARWG and CNAF M-3710 .7 series (Naval Air Training and Operating Pr ocedures Standardization (NATOPS) General Flight and Operating Instructions) and must be used to eval uate these personnel. 15-64 Authorized Examiners (1) The aviation medical examination must be performed by a medical officer who is authorized by the Chief, Bureau of Medici ne and Surgery or by the proper authority of the Army or Air Force who has current clinical privileges to conduct such examina- tions. Aviation Medical Examiners (AME) provide medical administrative sup port and primary care to flight status personnel and are authorized to complete an aviation medical examination. Naval Aerospace Medicine Physician Assistan ts (APA) are designated Flight Surgeon extenders who have graduated from the NAMI Aviation Medical Officer (AMO) course and work under the supervision of a designated Naval Flight Surgeon per current APA guiding instructions. 15-65 Applicant, Student, and Designated Standards (1) Physical standards for SNA become Class I standards at the time of designation (winging). Prior to that point in time, SNA applicant physical standards must apply. Physical standards for student naval flight officer (SNFO) become designated NFO standards at the time of designation (winging) or redesignation as a SNFO; prior to that point in time NFO applicant physical standards will apply. Physical standards for applicants to other Class II and III communities transition from applicant to \"designated\" upon com- pletion of the aviation training pipeline/completion of the required syllabus as per NATOPS, NAVPERS-COM, or Headquarters, U. S. Marine Corps (HQ/ USMC) guidance. (2) Designation or redesignation as a student (SNA, SNFO, SNFS, etc.) must not occur prior to certification of physical qualification (physically qualified (PQ) or not physically qualified (NPQ)/ waiver recommended (WR) favorable, BUMED endorsement of a naval aviation applicant physical 1 Jun 2018 Change 16 5 15-51 Article 15-66 Manual of the Medical Department examination), and anthropom etric qualification veri- fied through utilization of a Naval Aviation Anthro- pometric Compatibility Assessment (NAACA) report, which is endorsed by Naval Aviation Schools Comm- and (NAVAVSCOLSCOM) as the cognizant line authority designated by CNAF. For further informa- Physically Qualified (NPQ) ( 1 ) Physically Qualified (PQ). Describes aviation personnel who meet the physical and psychiatric standards required by their medical classification to perform assigned aviation duties. ( 2 ) Not Physically Qualified (NPQ). Describes aviation personnel who do not meet the physical or psychiatric standards required by their medical classi- fication to perform assigned aviation duties. Aircrew who are NPQ may request a waiver of aeromedical standards. A waiver must be granted by NAVPERS- COM or HQ/USMC prior to a disqualified member assuming flight duties. See disposition of personnel found NPQ, article 15-79 below.

A member's aeronautical adaptability is assessed by a naval flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner, or aerospace medicine physician assistant each time an evaluation of overall qualification for duty involving flight is performed. AA has its greatest utility in the selection of aviation applicants (both officer and enlisted). (a) Aviation officer applicants must demon- strate reasonable perceptual, cognitive, and psycho-motor skills on the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB) and other neurocognitive screening tests that may be requested. (b) Applicants are generally considered AA on the basis of having the potential to adapt to the rigors of aviation by possessing the temperament, flexibility, and adaptive defense mech anisms to allow for full attention to flight (compartmentalization) and successful completion of training. Before selection, applicants are to be interviewed by the flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner, or aerospace medicine physician assistant for evidence of early interest in aviation, motivation to fly, and practical appreciation of flight beyond childhood fantasy. Evidence of suc-cessful coping skills, good interpersonal relationships, extra-curricular activities, demonstrated leadership qualities, stability of academic and work performance, and absence of impulsivity should also be thoroughly elicited. (c) Designated aviation personnel are gener- ally considered AA on the basis of demonstrated per-formance, ability to tolerate the stress and demands of operational training and deployment, and long-term use of highly adaptive defense mechanisms (compart- mentalization). (2) Not Aeronautically Adaptable (NAA). When an individual is found to be PQ, but his AA is regarded as \"unfavorable,\" the DD Form 2808 block 74a must be recorded as \"physically qualified, but not aero- nautically adaptable.\" (a) Applicants are considered NAA if diag- nosed as having a personality disorder or prominent maladaptive personality traits affecting flight safety, mission completion, or crew coordination. (b) Designated aviation personnel are consid- ered NAA if diagnosed as having a personality dis-order or prominent maladaptive personality traits affecting flight safety, crew coordination, or mission execution. (c) When evaluation of designated aviation personnel suggests that an individual is no longer AA, refer the member to, or consult with, the NAMI Aero- space Psychiatry Department. ( d ) A f i n a l d e t e r m i n a t i o n o f N A A f o r d e s i g - nated aviation personnel may only be made following evaluation by or consultation with the NAMI Aero- space Psychiatry Department. 15-68 The Field Naval Aviator Evaluation Board, Field Naval Flight Officer Evaluation Board, and Field Flight Performance Board (1) These are the normal mechanisms for handling administrative difficulties encountered with aviator performance, motivation, attitude, technical skills, flight safety, and mission execution. The above diffi-culties are not within the scope of AA. Aeromedical clearance is a prerequisite f or ordering a board evalua- tion of an aviator, i.e., the member must be PQ and AA or NPQ and AA with a waiverable condition. 15-52 Chang e 165 1 J un 2018Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-71 15-69 The Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide ( 1 ) This guide, prepared by NAMI and approved b y B U M E D , s e r v e s a s a n a d j u n c t t o t h i s a r t i c l e a n d provides elaboration on specific aviation standards, examination techniques and methods, and policies concerning waivers for disqualifying conditions.

As described in the CNAF M- 3710.7 series, chapter 8, all aviation personnel involved in flight duties are required to be evaluated annually. Generally it is preferred that scheduling occurs within the interval from the first day of the month preceding their birth month until the last day of their birth month. However, examinations may be scheduled up to 3 months prior to expiration to accommodate specialty clinic and other scheduling issues. This 90-day window is referred to as the \"vulnerability window.\" To accommodate special circums tances such as deploy- ment requirements, permanent change of station, tem- p o r a r y d u t y , o r r e t i r e m e n t , t h i s w i n d o w m a y b e extended up to a maximum of 6 months with written approval by the member's command. Aviation design- nated personnel (including those personnel who are assigned to non-flying billets or duties) must comply with these frequency requirements as well as those specified by Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) or Commandant, Marine Corps (CMC) waiver approval letters. According to the CNAF M-3710.7 series, \"flight personnel delinquen t in receiving an aviation physical examination must not be scheduled to fly unless a waiver has been granted by BUPERS/CMC.\" (2) Validity. Once completed, all examinations are valid until the last day of the following birth month. (a) If an applicant has not commenced avia- tion preflight indoctrination within 2 years of the conduct of a favorably endorsed BUMED applicant physical and recording of anthropometric measure-ments, the applicant must s uccessfully complete an aviation long form flight physical (see article 15-71 below), have anthropometric data reassessed, and meet the defined Class I or Class II standards prior to comm-encing aviation training. If the member is designated as an SNA at the time of subsequent aviation flight physicals, SNA physical s tandards will apply. (b) If an applicant has not commenced air traffic control or other air crew qualification training within 2 years of the conduct of a favorably endorsed BUMED applicant physical, the applicant must suc-cessfully complete an aviation long form flight physical (see article 15-71 below) and meet the defined aviation standards prior to commencing aviation training. 15-71 Complete Aeromedical Examination ( L o n g F o r m ) (1) A complete physical examination includes a medical history recorded on the DD Form 2807-1and a physical examination recorded on the DD Form 2808. A p p l i c a n t s m u s t a l s o s u b m i t a n S F 5 0 7 a n d a C o n -tinuation of DD Form 2807. This examination must be typed or completed in the individual's Aeromedical Electronic Resource Of fice (AERO) record. (2) The following aviation personnel are required to receive complete examinations: (a) Applicants for all aviation programs (offi- cer and enlisted). (b) All aviation personnel at ages 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and a nnually thereafter. 1 Jun 2018 Change 165 15-53 Article 15-72 Manual of the Medical Department (c) Personnel specifically directed by high- er authority. (d) Personnel found fit for full duty by medical board following a period of limited duty. (e) All personnel involved in an aviation- related mishap. 15-72 Abbreviated Aeromedical Examination (Short Form) (1) The results of this examination must be entered on NAVMED 6410/10, and the individual's Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office (AERO) record, only for initial waiver requests or for mem-bers whose waiver stipulates annual submission. (a) Purpose. This examination is used for aviation personnel who do not require a complete physical as listed above. (b) Elements. All elements of the abbrevi- ated aeromedical examinati on must be completed. The NAVMED 6410/10 is considered incomplete if any blocks are left blank with no entry. Individual items may be expanded as required based on the interval medical history, health risk assessment, and physical findings. 15-73 Check-In Examinations (1) All aviation personnel reporting to a new command must present to the aviation clinic for a fitness to fly examination. For students who have commenced training, a check-in examination is not required for transferring to another phase of training when medical care will continue to be given at the same medical treatment facility. The extent of this examination is determined by the flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner, or aerospace medicine physician assistant but should include a personal introduction, a complete review of the medical record for past medical problems, currency of physical examination, medical waivers for flight, and immuni- zation and medical readiness currency. Check-in examinations require logging onto AERO to assure required physical examination submissions are up to date and to assure compliance with any waiver pro-visions that may apply. Links to this web site may be accessed from the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide contents menu. (2) Documentation must include: (a) The results of the evaluation, entered on the SF 600 or in the member's electronic health record, with statement of qualification for assigned flight duties (PQ, NPQ, or waiver status). (b) Updating the Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet (DD Form 2766). (c) Disposition entry on the NAVMED 6150/2, Special Dut y Medical Abstract. (d) A new Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (DD Form 2992). An aerospace medicine physician assistant must be allowed to issue a DD Form 2992 authorizing flight without NFS or AME co-signature. Specific attention is required to existing waivers. (e) A review of all duty not involving flying (DNIF) periods for patterns of frequent or excessively prolonged grounding or if cumulative DNIF periods in any single year appear to exceed 60 days. 15-54 Ch ange 165 1 J un 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-77 15-74 Post-Grounding Examinations (1) Following any period of medical grounding, aviation personnel must be evaluated by a flight sur- geon, aviation medical examiner, or aerospace medi- cine physician assistant and issued a DD Form 2992 authorizing flight prior to returning to aviation duties. The extent of the evaluation must be determined by the flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner, or aeros-pace medicine physician assi stant. An aerospace med- icine physician assistant may issue a DD Form 2992 recommending return to flight without NFS or AME co-signature. The only exception to these require- ments is self-limited grounding notices issued by a dental officer under special circumstances as dis-cussed in article 15-77 below. 15-75 Post-Hospitalization Examinations (1) Following return to duty after admission to the sick list or hospital (including medical boards), aviation personnel must be evaluated by a NFS, AME, or APA prior to resuming flight duties. The extent of the evaluation must be dete rmined by the NFS, AME, or APA. If a disqualifying condition is discovered, a request for waiver of standa rds must be sub-mitted. If deemed medically appropriate, an APA may issue a DD Form 2992 recommending return to flight without NFS or AME co-signature. The reason for the hospitaliza- tion and the result of the evaluation must be recorded on the Special Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2). If found qualified, a DD Form 2992 authoriz- ing flight must be issued. 15-76 Post-Mishap Examinations ( 1 ) A p p e n d i x N o f O P N A V I N S T 3 7 5 0 . 6 s e r i e s details medical enclosures and physical examination requirements for mishap investigations. All post- mishap examinations must be submitted to BUMED regardless of whether a new or existing disqualifying defect is noted. 15-77 Forms and Health Record Administration (1) Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (DD Form 2992). T h i s form is the means to co mmunicate to the aviation unit's commanding officer recommendations for fit- ness to fly, clearance and grounding, as well as clear-ance for high and moderate-risk training such as aviation physiology and water survival training. Examiners authorized per a rticle 15-64 above (NFS, AME, APA) are the only personnel normally autho- rized to issue a DD Form 2992 recommending aero- medical clearance. In remote locations, where the services of the above medical officers are not avail- able, any specifically designated MDR may issue a DD Form 2992 in consultation with an aviation quali- fied medical officer. See BUMEDINST 6410.9 series for additional details. (a) The DD Form 2992 is issued (with cop- ies to the member and the unit safety or NATOPS officer) after successful completion of an aviation physical, or after return to flight status following a temporary grounding. A corresponding health record entry must be made on the Special Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2). It must contain a state- ment regarding contact lens use for those personnel authorized for their use by th e flight surgeon. Waivers are valid for the specified condition(s) only. 1 Jun 2018 Change 165 15-55 Article 15-77 Manual of the Medical Department ( b ) A D D F o r m 2 9 9 2 w i t h t h e m e d i c a l recommendation returning an aviator to flight is always issued with an expiration date . Generally, expiration is timed to coincide with the validity of aviator annual or periodic examinations which expire on the last day of the member's birth month. R eissue of the aeromedical clearance as part of an aviator annual or periodic examination certifies that the member is in full com-pliance with all waiver provisions, special submission requirements, and BUMED recommendations con- tained in the original waiver letter from NAMI. Specific waiver provisions may be verified on the NAMI disposition Web site. (c) All aviation personnel admitted to the sick list, hospitalized, or determined to have a medical concern that could impair performance of duties involving flight must be issued a DD Form 2992 recommending grounding to the commanding officer. All medical department personnel (Corpsmen, Nurse Corps officers, etc.) are authorized to issue a DD Form 2992 recommending grounding. Similar to article 15- 77, paragraph (1)(a), an entry must also be made in the member's health record on the Special Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2). A recommendation against flight must remain in effect until the member has been examined by a flight surgeon, aviation medi- cal examiner, or aerospace medicine physician assistant and issued a DD Form 2992 recommending return to flight. ( d ) Dental officers are authorized to issue a self-limited DD Form 2992 that recommends ground- ing. This typically only applies when a member on flight status receives a local anesthetic. ( e ) Administration of routine immunizations, which require temporary grounding, does not require issuance of a DD Form 2992. (2) Special Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2). All changes in status of the aviator must be immediately entered into the Special Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2). (3) Medical Screening for Class III Flight Deck Personnel and Personnel who Maintain Aviator Night Vision Standards (NAVMED 6410/14). NAV- MED 6410/14 is used for the annual screening of critical and non-critical flight deck personnel and non-aviator personnel required to maintain aviator night vision standards. (4) Filing of Physical Examinations. Completed physical examinations must be filed in sequence with other periodic examinations and a copy kept on file for 3 years by the facility performing examination. 15-78 Submission of Examinations for Endorsement (1) Required Exams. Required exams can be performed, completed, and submitted by a flight sur-geon, aviation medical examiner, or aerospace medi- cine physician assistant. The following physical exam- inations must be submitted for review and endorse-ment through the Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office (AERO) to: Navy Operational Center 53HN, 340 Hulse Road, Pensacola, FL 32508: (a) Applicants for all aviation programs (officer and enlisted). (b) Any Class I, II, or III designated member requesting new waiver of physical standards. ( c ) Periodic waiver continuation examina- tions may be submitted on the DD Form 2808 (Long Form) or NAVMED 6410/10 (Short Form) including renewal or continuation of waivers for designated aviators following the ARWG requirements if stipu- lated in the NAMI waiver letter. (d) When a temporary medical grounding period is anticipated to exceed 60 days, this exami- nation need not be a complete physical examination as listed above, but should detail the injury or illness on a DD Form 2808. On the DD Form 2808, blocks 1-16 and 77-85 must be completed at a minimum and include all pertinent information. (e) Following a medical grounding in excess of 60 days, a focused physical examination is required. Submission should include a treatment course, the specialist's and flight surgeon's recommendations for r e t u r n t o f l i g h t s t a t u s , m e d i c a l b o a r d r e p o r t , a n d a n LBFS report. If waiver is required, submit request fol- lowing the applicable instructions. 15-56 Chan ge 165 1 J un 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-79 (f) If the member's NFS, AME or APA recommends any permanent change in Service Group or flying status. (g) Personnel who were previously dis- qualified and so reported to BUMED that are sub-sequently found to be physically qualified. (h) Aviation personnel who have been re- ferred to medical board for disposition, regardless of the outcome. (i) All long form physical examinations at the ages of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and annually thereafter. (j) Waiver continuation or modification re- quests for designated personnel and members curr- ently in training may be su bmitted as an aeromedical summary (AMS), an Abbreviated Aeromedical Eval- uation (i.e., short form physical), or a DD Form 2807/DD Form 2808 with appropriate flight surgeon, AME, or APA's comments recommending continua-tion or modification and commanding officer's concurrence. (2) Required Items. Submission packages must include the following items: ( a ) Applicants, all classes: ( 1 ) The original typed DD Form 2808 signed by the flight surgeon, AME, or APA. ( 2 ) T h e o r i g i n a l h a n d w r itten DD Form 2807. The examining flight surgeon, AME, or APA must comment on all positive responses and indicate if the condition is considered disqualifying or not considered disqualifying. The following must be added to DD Form 2807: \"Have you ever been diagnosed with or received any level of treatment for an alcohol use disorder?\" ( 3 ) A n S F 5 0 7 , C o n t i n u a t i o n o f D D Form 2807, Aeromedical A pplicant Questionnaire, must be completed and si gned by the applicant.

( b ) Designated, all classes: ( 1 ) L o n g f o r m p h y s i c a l e x a m i n a t i o n s a t the ages of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and annually thereafter. ( 2 ) For all new waiver requests: ( a ) I f w a i v e r i s r e q u e s t e d w i t h i n the 90-day window of vulnerability defined in article 15-70 above, submit the examination that is normally conducted that year. ( b ) I f w a i v e r i s r e q u e s t e d o u t s i d e the 90-day window of vulnerability defined in article 15-70 above, submit a copy of the most recently con-ducted examination (long or short form) and an aeromedical summary detaili ng relevant interval his- tory and a focused examination related to the physical standard requiring the new waiver. ( 3 ) F o r p e r i o d i c w a i v e r c o n t i n u a t i o n examinations, unless otherwise directed by the NAV- PERS or CMC waiver letter, submit a long form or short form following the birt hday celebrated that year. (3) Submission Timelines (a) Annual examinations and other waiver provisions must be submitted to NAMI Code 53HN within 30 days prior to the last day of the birth month in order to continue or renew the aeromedical clear- ance under a previously granted BUPERS or CME waiver. (b) If submission is delayed, a 90-day extension may be requested from NAMI Code 53HN by submitting an interval history and the proposed timeline for complying w ith waiver requirements. 15-79 Disposition of Personnel Found Not Physically Qualified (NPQ) ( 1 ) General. When aircrew do not meet aviation standards and are found NPQ, they may request a waiver of physical standards following CNAF M-3710.7 series and the Ae romedical Reference and Waiver Guide. In all cases, NAMI Code 53HN must be a via addressee. In general, applicants and students in early phases of training are held to a stricter standard than designates and are less likely to be recommended for a waiver. In those instances where a waiver is required, members must not begin instructional flight 1 Jun 2018 Change 165 15-57 Article 15-79 Manual of the Medical Department until the waiver has been granted by NAVPERSCOM, the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC), or appropriate waiver granting authority. Sufficient information about the medical condition or defect must be provided to permit reviewing officials to make an informed assessment of the request itself and place the request in the context of the duties of the Service member. ( 2 ) Newly Discovered Disqualifying Defects. If a disqualifying defect is discovered during any eval- uation of designated personnel, an Aeromedical Sum- mary must be submitted for BUMED endorsement, along with a waiver request if deemed appropriate. An AMS is required for an initial waiver for all personnel. The Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide out- lines additional information required in the case of alcohol use disorder waiver requests. ( 3 ) Personnel Authorized to Initiate the Re- quests for Waivers of Physical Standards (a) The Service member initiates the waiver request in most circumstances. (b) The commanding officer of the member may initiate a waiver request. (c) The examining or responsible medical officer may initiate a waiver request. (d) In certain cases the; the Commanding Officer, Naval Reserve Center initiative to request or recommend a waiver will be taken by BUMED; CMC; or NAVPERSCOM. In no case will this initiative be taken without informing the member's local comm- and. (e) All waiver requests must be either initi- ated or endorsed by the member's commanding offi-cer. ( 4 ) Format and Routing of Waiver Requests. Refer to the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide for addressing, routing, and waiver format. 15-80 Local Board of Flight Surgeons (LBFS) (1) This Board provides an expedient way to return a grounded aviator to flight status pending offi- cial BUMED endorsement and granting of a waiver by NAVPERSCOM or CMC for any NEW disqualifying condition. The LBFS may also serve as a medical endorsement for waiver request. Additionally, this Board may be conducted when a substantive question exists about an aviator's suitability for continued flight status. (2) The LBFS may be convened by the member's commanding officer, on the recommendation of the member's flight surgeon, aviation medical examiner, or by higher authority. (3) The LBFS will consist of at least three medical officers, two of whom must be flight surgeons or aviation medical examiners. An aerospace medi- cine physician assistant may serve as one of the required medical officers on a LBFS when a flight surgeon or aviation medical examiner is unavailable, however, the flight surgeon or aviation medical exami-ner must act as senior board member. (4) The LBFS's findings must be recorded in chronological narrative form at as an aeromedical summary (AMS) to include the aviator's current duty status, total flight hours and duties, recent flight hours in current aircraft type, injury or illness necessitating grounding, hospital course with medical treatment used, follow-up reports, and specialists' and LBFS recommendation. Pertinent consultation reports and documentation must be included as enclosures to the report. Once a decision has been reached by the LBFS, the patient should be informed of the Board's recommendations. Local Boards must submit their reports within 10 working days to NAMI Code 53HN via the patient's commanding officer. 15-58 Chan ge 165 1 J un 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-79 (5) Based on its judgment and criteria specified in the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide, if a LBFS recommends that a waiver of physical standards is appropriate, the senior member of the board may issue a DD Form 2992 recommending a return to flight pending final disposition of the case by NAMI Code 53HN and NAVPERSCOM, or CMC. An aeromedical clearance may be issued only for conditions outlined in the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide where information required for a waiver is specified. The DD Form 2992 must expire no greater than 90 days from the date of the LBFS report. (6) An LBFS must not issue a DD Form 2992 recommending a return to flight to personnel whose condition is not addressed by the ARWG. In those cases, an LBFS endorsement of a waiver request should b e f o r w a r d e d t o N A M I w i t h a r e q u e s t f o r e x p e d i t e d review if required. (7) An LBFS must not issue a DD Form 2992 recommending a return to flight if the member cur-rently holds a grounding letter issued by NAVPERS- COM or CMC stating that a waiver has previously been denied, or when the ARWG specifically states that an LBFS adjudication is not authorized. 15-81 Special Board of Flight Surgeons (1) This Board consists of designated naval flight surgeons appointed as voting members by the Officer in Charge (OIC), Naval Aer ospace Medical Institute. The OIC, NAMI, serves as the Board President. Guidelines are published in NAVOPMEDINST 1301.1 series. Copies of this instruction can be requested through the NAMI Web site. (2) The Special Board of Flight Surgeons evaluates medical cases, which, due to their complexity or uni-queness, warrant a comprehensive aeromedical evalua- tion. Regardless of the presenting complaint, the patient is evaluated by all clinical departments at NAMI. A Special Board of Flight Surgeons should not be requested merely to challenge a physical standard or disqualification without evidence of special circum-stances. (3) Requests are directed to the OIC via the Director for Aeromedical Qualifications, (Code53HN). The request must include member's name, rank, EDIPI (preferred) or SSN, unit or squadron address, and flight surgeon contact information. The requesting letter should convey an understanding of why the member was aeromedically grounded and a specific appeal of why the case warrants consideration by a special board. With properly executed DD Form 2870, Authorization for Disclosure of Medical and Dental Information, the member's written consent, the request must include copies of all clinic visits, specialty consultations, laboratory reports, and imaging and other special studies that relate to his or her history that have not been included in any previous waiver requests. (4) Requests for a Special Board of Flight Surgeons does not, in and of itself, guarantee a board will be convened. (5) The board is convened by the OIC, NAMI, at the request of the member's commanding officer or higher authority. (6) The board's recommendations (along with min- ority reports, if indicated) are forwarded to BUMED (Aerospace Medicine). Although normally forwarded to NAVPERSCOM or to CMC for implementation without change, BUMED has the prerogative to mod- ify or reverse the recommendation. 15-82 Senior Board of Flight Surgeons (SBFS) ( 1 ) T h e S B F S s a t B U M E D s e r v e s a s t h e f i n a l appeal board to review aeromedical dispositions as requested by NAVPERSCOM, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), or CMC. 1 Jun 2018 Change 16 5 15-59 Article 15-82 Manual of the Medical Department (2) The Board must consist of a minimum of five members, three of whom must be flight surgeons, and one of whom must be a senior line officer as assigned by CNO (N98) or CMC. The presiding officer will be the Assistant Deputy Chief, Operational Medicine and Capabilities Development (BUMED-M9), Assistant Deputy Chief, Healthcare Operations (BUMED-M3) assisted by the Aerospace Medicine Branch Head (BUMED-M95). (3) Individuals whose cases are under review must be offered the opportun ity to appear before this Board. (4) The medical recommendations of this Board must be final and must be forwarded to NAVPERS- COM or CMC within 5 working days of the com- pletion of the Board. 15-83 Standards for Aviation Personnel (1) Differences between flying Classes. In gene- ral, applicants for aviation programs are held to stricter physical standards than trained and designated per- sonnel and will be less likely to be recommended for waivers. Refer to the Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide for specific information. Likewise, standards for Class III personnel are somewhat less stringent than for Class I and II; exceptions to dis- qualifying conditions for Class III personnel are listed in article 15-94 below. (2) Fitness for Duty. Personnel must meet the physical standards for gener al military service in the Navy as a prerequisite before consideration for any aviation duty. Any member who has been the subject of either a limited duty board or PEB-adjudicated medical board, must be found \"fit for full duty\" before he or she is eligible for a waiver of aeromedical standards. 15-84 Disqualifying Conditions For all Aviation Duty In addition to the disqualifying defects listed in MANMED Chapter 15, Section III (Physical Stand- ards), the following must be considered disqualifying for all aviation duty. (1) Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate. T h e s e measurements must be determined after examinee has been sitting motionless for at least 5 minutes. (a) Blood Pressure.

W h e n ordered to duty involving flying for which special requirements have not been prescribed, personnel must, prior to engaging in such duties, be examined to determine their physical qualification for aerial flights, an entry made in their H ealth Record, and a DD Form 2992 issued if qualified. The examination must relate primarily to the circulatory system, musculoskeletal system, equilibrium, neuropshyciatric stability, and patency of the Eustachian tubes, with such additional consideration as the individual's specific flying duties may indicate. The examiner must attempt to determine not only the individual's physical qualification to fly a particular aircraft or mission, but also the physical qualification to undergo all required physical and phy- siological training associated with flight duty. No individual will be found fit to fly unless fit to undergo the training required in CNA F M-3710.7 series, for the aircraft or mission. Consult with the Navy ARWG for additional information.

Diving duty is character- ized by intense physical and mental demands in a hos- tile environment. Divers must be able to perform des- pite these challenges, exercising good judgment while executing complex tasks. Divers must be free of dis- tracting musculoskeletal conditions, otolaryngologic or or behavioral instability. ( 2 ) Applicability. The physical standards in this article apply to personnel whose primary military duty is diving, to personnel whose duties expose them to a hyperbaric occupational environment, and to candi- dates for the aforementioned duties who are trained in a U.S. Navy program. The physical qualification re- quirements for non-U.S. divers operating with U.S. forces and non-U.S. diver candidates trained in a U.S. Navy program on behalf of foreign nations are dictated by international agreements, status of forces agree- ments, and other diplomatic arrangements. Examples of personnel in applicable d uties include, but are not limited to: Navy divers, Naval Special Warfare/SEAL operators, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) divers, Marine Corps Special Operations divers (Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MAR- SOC) and Force Reconnaissance (RECON), Under-water Construction Team (UCT) divers, and ship or boat divers, as well as personnel who have hyperbaric exposure for clinical or research purposes and per-sonnel required to enter pressurized ship sonar domes. These standards also apply to personnel from sister Services (including U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)) or other State or U.S. Government agencies who are trained in a U.S. Navy program. (a) These standards DO NOT apply to per- sonnel not listed above, but who perform work in a hyperbaric environment involving exposure to pres- sures less than 8 pounds per square inch (psi) (i.e., compartment/hull containment test workers). How-ever, other standards may apply (i.e., NAVSEAINST 10560.4 series). (b) Aviation duty personnel (applicant or designated) with documented medical concerns about their ability to safely tolerate barometric changes, sec- ondary to post-surgical or other otorhinolaryngologi- cal conditions, but with an otherwise current aviation duty medical examination, may be evaluated with a modified Diver Candidate P ressure Test, as defined by the U.S. Navy Diving Manual. A diving duty phys-ical examination is not required under these condi-tions. This test should only be performed upon written request or referral from a designated flight surgeon and directly supervised by a n undersea medical officer (UMO). ( 3 ) Examinations (a) Periodicity. Within 2 years of application for initial training. Periodicity between examinations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Diving duty exami- nations must be performed no later than 1 month fol- lowing the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical examination date. For example, for an examination performed on a 20-year old on 15 Feb-ruary 2018, the next examination must be completed by 31 March 2023. A complete physical examination is also required prior to returning to diving duty after a period of disqualification. In addition to the special duty examination: ( 1 ) A l l a c t i v e d u t y S e r v i c e m e m b e r s o n diving duty must have a current annual periodic health assessment (PHA) in order to maintain diving duty qualifications. This will include recommended pre- ventive health examinations. The requirement for a PHA does not apply to government service (GS) civil- ian divers. The annual PHA will include documenta- tion of skin cancer screening, specifically a head-to-toe skin examination, and will address the risks of diving while pregnant for all female divers, per BUMEDINST 6200.15 series. ( 2 ) A l l a p p l i c a n t s f o r i n itial and ad- vanced dive training must have a valid NAVPERS 1200/6, U.S. Military Diving Medical Screening Questionnaire, completed and signed by an UMO not more than 1 month prior to actual transfer to dive train- ing. This document serves as an interval medical history from the time the original DD Form 2807-1/2808 were completed until time of transfer for accession into training in basic and advanced diving duty, as well as a medical record screening for any missed or new condition(s) that may be considered disqualifying (CD). Any condition found to be CD that has not been properly addressed needs to be resolved prior to the candidate's transfer to dive training. The NAVPERS 1200/6 should be added to the member's medical record. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-73 Article 15-102 Manual of the Medical Department ( b ) Scope. A diving duty physical examina- tion (also referred to as a diving medical examination (DME)) must consist of a completed Medical History (DD Form 2807-1) and Medical Examination (DD Form 2808). All organ systems will be examined with special attention to organ systems which affect the member's ability to safely function underwater, in temperature extremes, in other hyperbaric environ- ments, and while exposed to non-standard breathing gas mixtures. Those organ systems (air-filled spaces) which can be adversely affected by hyperbaric expo- sure must also receive focused assessment and under- lying conditions which predispose the examinee to increased risk in the hyperbaric environment must be noted and addressed. ( 1 ) F o r c a n d i d a t e s a p p l y i n g f o r i n itial diving duty and for designated divers undergoing anniversary physical examinations, the following s p e c i a l s t u d i e s a r e r e q u i r e d t o s u p p o r t m e d i c a l a s s e s s m e n t , a n d m u s t b e c o m p l e t e d w i t h i n t h e f o l - lowing timeframes (unless otherwise noted): ( a ) W i t h i n 3 m o n t h s o f t h e e x a m date: 1 .

S i c k l e c e l l . ( 2 ) I n a d d ition to any applicable BUM- EDINST 6230.15 series (Immunization and Chemo- prophylaxis) requirements, all diver candidates and designated divers must b e immunized against both Hepatitis A and B. Diver candidates must have two doses of Hepatitis A immunization and at least the first two out of three doses of Hepatitis B immunization prior to the start of diver training. The third Hepatitis B immunization must be administered prior to assignment to an operational unit. If documentation of completed immunization is lacking or in doubt, demonstration of serological immunity is sufficient to meet this requirement. ( c ) Examiners . DMEs may be performed by any physician, physician assistant, or nurse practi- tioner with current DoD clinical privileges. DMEs not performed by a UMO are not valid until they are reviewed and co-signed by a UMO (block 84 of DD Form 2808). All reviewing authority signatures must be accompanied by the \"UM O\" designation. A UMO is defined as a medical officer (or physician employed by DoD who previously served as a UMO) who has successfully completed the entire UMO course con- ducted by the Naval Undersea Medical Institute (NUMI), which includes the diving medical officer (DMO) course conducted at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC), and who is curr-ently privileged in undersea medicine. ( 4 ) Standards. The standards delineated in this article define the conditions which are considered disqualifying for diving duty. The standards deline- ated in Chapter 15, Section III (General Standards) are universally applicable to all diving duty candidates. Certain of the General Standards are applicable to continued qualification for diving duty whereas others are not. UMOs, based on their specialty training and subject matter expertise, are charged with applying the General Standards to qualified diving personnel when appropriate to ensure physi cal and mental readiness to perform their duties without limitation. Standards in this article take precedence over General Standards where conflicts exist. 15-74 Change 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-102 ( a ) General. Any disease or condition that causes chronic or recurring disability for duty assign- ment or has the potential of being exacerbated by the hyperbaric environment or diving duty is disqualify- ing. ( b ) Ear, Nose, and Throat ( 1 ) C h r o n i c E u s t a c h i a n t u b e d y s f u n c - tion or inability to equalize middle ear pressure is disqualifying. ( 2 ) A n y p e r s i s t e n t v e r t i g o , d i s e q u ili- brium, or imbalance with inner ear origin is dis- qualifying. ( 3 ) M a x illofacial or craniofacial abnor- malities precluding the comfortable or effective use of diving gear including headgear, mouthpiece, or regulator is disqualifying. ( 4 ) O b s t r u c t i v e S l e e p A p n e a ( O S A ) with cognitive impairment or daytime hypersomno- lence is disqualifying. Individuals whose OSA is ade-quately treated (i.e., asymptomatic) using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or by other non- surgical interventions meet physical standards and do not require a waiver. Note: CPAP equipment is not certified for use in recompression chambers. Therefore, any diver with a diagnosis of OSA whose treatment plan includes CPAP is precluded from participation in saturation diving evolutions. Such an individual opting not to use a prescribed medical device does not obviate this restriction. ( 5 ) H i s t o r y o f i n n e r e a r p a t h o l o g y o r surgery, including but not limited to vertigo, Men- iere's disease or syndrome, endolymphatic hydrops, or tinnitus of sufficient severity to interfere with satisfactory performance of duties is disqualifying. ( 6 ) C h r o n i c o r r e c u r r e n t i m p a i r m e n t d u e to moderate or severe motion sickness is dis- qualifying. ( 7 ) E x t e r n a l a u d i t o r y c a n a l e x o s t o s i s o r atresia that results in recurrent external otitis or pre- cludes adequate visualization of the tympanic mem- brane is disqualifying. ( 8 ) A n y l a r y n g e a l o r t r a c h e a l f r a m e - work surgery is disqualifying. ( 9 ) H i s t o r y o f i n n e r e a r b a r o t r a u m a i s disqualifying. ( 1 0 ) H i s t o r y o f s i n u s s u r g e r y ( e . g . , f u n c tional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)) is disquali- fying. ( 1 1 ) H e a r i n g i n t h e b e t t e r e a r m u s t m e e t standards for initial acceptance for active duty as spe- cified in MANMED article 15-38(2). While not dis- qualifying for diving duty, unilateral high-frequency hearing loss should receive appropriate otology eval-uation and surveillance monitoring. Required use of hearing aids is disqualifying. ( 1 2 ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s w i t h f u l l r e c o v - ery from either tympanic membrane perforation or acute sinusitis may be reinstated at the discretion of the UMO. ( c ) Dental ( 1 ) A n y d e f e c t o f t h e o r a l c a v i t y o r associated structures that interferes with the effective use of an underwater breathing apparatus is disquali- fying.

( d ) Eyes and Vision ( 1 ) A l l D i v e r s m u s t h a v e a m i n i m u m corrected visual acuity of 20/25 in one eye. ( 2 ) M i n i m u m u n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l acuity: ( a ) U n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y r e - quiring more than +/- 8.00 diopters correction in both eyes is disqualifying for UMOs, U.S. Army diving medical officers (DMO), basic diving officers (BDO), self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCU-BA) divers, and non-diving occupational hyperbaric workers. ( b ) U n c o r r e c t e d v i s u a l a c u i t y worse than 20/200 in either eye is disqualifying for all other divers. ( 3 ) M A N M E D C h a p t e r 1 5 - 1 0 5 p r o v i d e s additional visual acuity standards for special opera- tions personnel. ( 4 ) P h o t o r e f r a c t i v e k e r a t e c t o m y ( P R K intraocular lens implants (including Collamer) within the preceding 3 months are disqualifying for diving candidates only. Stable results from appliance or surgery must meet (see paragraph (4)(d)(1)-(3)) corrected visual acuity standards and the patient must be discharged from ophthalmology follow up with a disposition of \"fit for full duty\" and requiring no ongoing treatment. Desig- nated divers may return to duty 1 month after refractive corneal or intraocu lar lens implant surgery 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-75 Article 15-102 Manual of the Medical Department if they are fully recovered from surgery and have acceptable visual acuity per p aragraph (4) (d)(1)-(3)) of this article. No waiver is required, provided these respective time constraints are met, for either candi- dates or designated divers. Depth perception deficits are not disqualifying. ( 5 ) A d v e r s e r e f r a c t i v e c h a n g e s a t t r i - buted to orthokeratology, which persist >6 months after cessation of treatment, are disqualifying. ( 6 ) L a c k o f a d e q u a t e c o l o r v i s i o n (MANMED article 15-36, paragraph (1)(d)) is dis- qualifying. Waivers will be considered for Navy S E A L s , U M O s , U S M C d i v e r s , s h i p o r b o a t d i v e r s , underwater constructors, hyp erbaric chamber workers, and sonar dome entry personnel and candidates. ( 7 ) H i s t o r y o f R a d i a l K e r a t o t o m y ( R K ) is disqualifying. ( e ) Cardiovascular. condition that chronically, intermittently, or potentially impairs exer- cise capacity or causes debilitating symptoms is dis- qualifying. Specific disqualifying conditions include, but are not limited to: ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f s y m p t o m a t i c a t h e r o - sclerotic heart disease. ( 2 ) A h i s t o r y o f m y o c a r d i a l i n j u r y o r hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ( 3 ) A h i s t o r y o f c h r o n i c o r r e c u r r e n t pericarditis. A single episode must be completely resolved prior to initiation of training or return to duty and may be cleared by a UMO. ( 4 ) C a r d i a c d y s r h y t h m i a ( s i n g l e e p i - sode, recurrent, or chronic) other than sinus brady-cardia and 1 st degree heart block.

A w a i v e r may be entertained, after discontinuation of medica- tion, if use is of short duration and for a condition which is unlikely to recur. ( 7 ) T h r o m b o p h l e b itis and Deep Vein Thrombosis. Localized, superficial thrombophlebitis related to intravenous (IV) catheter placement is not disqualifying once asymptomatic. ( 8 ) U n c o n t r o l l e d h y p e r t e n s i o n , d u e either to the refractory nature of the disease or patient non-compliance, is disqualifying. Hypertension re- quiring complex medical management to achieve control is disqualifying. Hypertension associated with evidence of end organ d amage is disqualifying. ( 9 ) A h i s t o r y o f c a r d i a c s u r g e r y , i n - cluding ablations for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and other accessory pathways, other than closure of a patent ductus a rteriosus in infancy. A history of incidental, asymptomatic WPW which has been assessed by a cardiologist, deemed benign, and recommended for return to duty without surgical ablation is not disqualifying. ( 1 0 ) P a t e n t f o r a m e n o v a l e ( P F O ) ( i n - cludes functionally equivalent atrial septal defect (ASD)). Generalized universal screening for PFO is not required. The presence of a PFO is not disquali-fying and closure of a PFO is not required to return to diving duty unless closure is recommended by the treating UMO based upon consultation with the eval-uating cardiologist. If a PFO is identified, a full car- diology assessment is required and must be docu- mented, along with any treatment recommendations, in the member's health record prior to return to diving duty. If closure of a PFO is recommended for return to diving duty by the treating UMO based upon consultation with the evaluating cardiologist, the procedure must be completed prior to a return to diving duty. A second opinion may be pursued if the diver disagrees with the initial UMO recommenda- tion based upon cardiology recommendation. In all instances where the respective recommendations of the UMO and cardiologist(s) are discordant, the case must be referred, by means of the established waiver process (see paragraph (5) Waivers and Disqualifica- tion Requests found in this article), via BUMED-M95 (or corresponding USCG office), to the applicable waiver authority. ( f ) Pulmonary ( 1 ) S p o n t a n e o u s p n e u m o t h o r a x i s d i s - qualifying. Waivers will not be considered. ( 2 ) T r a u m a t i c p n e u m o t h o r a x ( o t h e r than that caused by a diving-related pulmonary baro- trauma) is disqualifying. A waiver request will be considered for a candidate or designated diver after a period of at least 6 months since injury and must include: ( a ) P u l m o n a r y f u n c t i o n t e s t i n g (spirometry). ( b ) H i g h - r e s o l u t i o n / s p i r a l , n o n - contrast chest CT. 15-76 Change 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-102 ( c ) F a v o r a b l e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n from a pulmonologist.

( 3 ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f a s t h m a , c h r o - nic obstructive, or restrictive pulmonary disease is disqualifying. ( 4 ) I n d i v i d u a l s w i t h e i t h e r p o s itive tuberculin skin test (TST) or positive interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) (e.g., QuantiFERON-TB Gold test) must be removed from diving duty pending further clinical investigation. ( a ) A c t i v e t u b e r c u l o s i s i s d i s q u a l i - fying; however, a waiver request will be considered upon completion of all treatments resulting in sterili- zation of the infectious lesion, and demonstration of normal pulmonary function. Individuals diagnosed with LTBI are non-infectious, but have the potential to progress to active disease. ( b ) L T B I i s d i s q u a l i f y i n g f o r c a n - didates. A waiver request will be considered upon completion of all indicated LTBI therapy. ( c ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s d i a g n o s e d with LTBI will be evaluated by their attending UMO. The UMO may return the diver to diving duty, without waiver, 8 weeks after initiating LTBI antibiotic ther- apy, provided the diver remains asymptomatic, is compliant with therapy and has no adverse reaction to the medication(s). Continued diving is contingent upon completion of therapy. Completion of treatment must be documented in the medical record. Note: LTBI treatment with Ioniazid (INH) presents several con- cerns. INH may cause peripheral neuropathy; this is avoided by proper Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation. Acute INH intoxi- cation has been demonstrated to cause seizures and it is reasonable to postulate that LTBI treatmen t with INH may lower a diver's seizure threshold. This risk ma y be increased when diving mixed gas, rebreather or saturation systems with their higher oxygen partial pressures. ( d ) F o r e i g n n a t i o n a l s p a r t i c i p a t i n g in U.S. Navy Diving training programs must be screened for tuberculosis, and if indicated, receive documented treatment to the same standard as that of U.S. nationals, prior to acceptance into training. History of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin ( BCG) vacci- nation does not change these requirements. ( 5 ) D i v i n g - r e l a t e d p u l m o n a r y b a r o t r a u - ma (i.e., pneumothorax, mediastinal or a ) A n y h i s t o r y o f p u l m o n a r y b a r - otrauma in a diver candidate is disqualifying. ( b ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s w h o e x p e r i - ence pulmonary barotrauma following a dive with no procedural violations, or a second episode of pul-monary barotrauma, for whatever reason, are con- sidered disqualified for diving duty. A waiver request will be considered if the diver is asymptomatic after 30 days and must include: 1 . P u l m o n a r y f u n c t i o n t e s t i n g (spirometry). 2 . H i g h - r e s o l u t i o n / s p i r a l , n o n - contrast chest CT. 3 . F a v o r a b l e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n from a pulmonologist. 4 . F i n a l e v a l u a t i o n a n d f a v o r - able recommendation by a UMO. ( c ) A d e s i g n a t e d d i v e r w h o s u f f e r s pulmonary barotrauma after a procedural violation may be returned to diving duty by the attending UMO without a waiver after 30 days with an appropriate workup which identifies no pulmonary predisposing conditions (e.g., blebs, bullae, etc.). ( d ) A d d itional waiver requirements for AGE are found in paragraph (4)(n) of this article. ( g ) Skin. Skin cancer or severe chronic and recurrent skin conditions, which are exacerbated by sun exposure, diving, the hyperbaric environment, or the wearing of occlusive a ttire Gastrointestinal ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f g a s t r o i n t e s t i n a l t r a c t disease of any kind is disqualifying, if any of the following conditions or diagnoses pertain: ( a ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f g a s t r o - intestinal bleeding, including positive occult blood testing, if the cause has not been corrected. Minor rectal bleeding from an obvious source (e.g., anal fissure or external hemorrhoid) is not disqualifying if it responds to appropriate th erapy and resolves within 6 weeks.

( 5 ) C h r o n i c m y o p a t h i c p r o c e s s e s c a u s - ing pain, atrophy, or weakness are disqualifying. ( 6 ) A n y a m p u t a t i o n , p a r t i a l o r c o m p l e t e , is disqualifying. ( 7 ) L o n g b o n e p a i n i n s a t u r a t i o n o r career divers should be aggressively evaluated with appropriate imaging. Any history, documentation, or x-ray finding of dysbaric osteonecrosis involving articular surfaces is permanently disqualifying. Shaft involvement requires a waiver and annual evaluations for progression of disease. ( 8 ) D i v e r s w i t h a h i s t o r y o f u n c o m p l i - cated fractures may return to diving duty after 3 months (or diver candidates after 12 months) if with- out residual symptoms or physical limitations, after evaluation by the attending orthopedic surgeon and at the discretion of the UMO without a waiver. Those with residual symptoms or physical limitations, or those seeking to return to diving duty sooner than 3 months (12 if candidate) require a waiver. ( 9 ) D i v e r s w i t h a h i s t o r y o f b o n e ( e . g . , open reduction, internal fixation) or major joint sur- gery may return to Diving Duty after 6 months (or diver candidates after 12 months) if without residual symptoms or physical limitations, after evaluation by the attending orthopedic surgeon and at the discretion of the UMO without a waiver. Those with residual symptoms or physical limitations, or those seeking to return to Diving Duty sooner than 6 months (12 if diver candidate) require a waiver. Retained hard- ware, after the aforementioned time intervals, is not disqualifying unless it results in limited range of motion. ( l ) Psychological and cognitive ( 1 ) A n y d i a g n o s i s f r o m t h e c u r r e n t v e r - sion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-tal Disorders (DSM) which negatively affects the Service member's ability to perform their diving duty is considered disqualifying. Any condition resulting in emotional, psychological, behavioral, or mental dysfunction should be fully addressed, with the diver asymptomatic and stable (on or off medications) before a waiver request is made. A waiver may be considered when the individual's symptoms no longer affect their ability to perform their duties; any waiver request must include a favorable recommendation f r o m t h e a t t e n d i n g m e n t a l h e a l t h p r o f e s s i o n a l . T h e attending UMO will exercise his or her judgment in determining the time interval necessary to demonstrate clinical stability.

If characterized as MILD or MODER- ATE, a waiver request may be submitted after com- pletion of all recommended treatment. Waiver requests should detail any prescribed or recomm- ended continuing care and/or aftercare plan. If the alcohol use disorder is characterized as SEVERE, waiver requests will only be considered after the individual demonstrates sustained sobriety (typically 12 months) and has completed any recommended continuing care and af tercare programs.

No waiver is required to return to diving duty for 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 77b Article 15-102 Manual of the Medical Department short-term use (less than 6 months) of a psychotropic medication. Long-term use (longer than 6 months) of a psychotropic medication is disqualifying and will require a waiver to return to diving duty. Note: ASD(HA) Guidelines for Deployment-Limiting Psychiatric Conditions and Medications states that a member may not be deployed within 3 months of starting a psychotropic medication. Note: OPNAVINST 3591.1, Small Ar ms Training and Qualifica- tion states that a member may not be issued a weapon while on psychotropic medications unless an operational waiver is obtained; personnel will be limited to administrative duties unless waiver has been granted. ( m ) Neurological. Any chronic or recurrent condition resulting in abnormal motor, sensory, or autonomic function or in abnormalities in mental status, intellectual capacity, mood, judgment, reality testing, tenacity, or adaptability is disqualifying. ( 1 ) M i g r a i n e ( o r o t h e r r e c u r r e n t h e a d - ache syndrome) which is chron ic, frequent, recurrent, or debilitating, or is associated with changes in motor, sensory, autonomic, or cognitive function, is dis- qualifying. ( 2 ) A h i s t o r y o f s e i z u r e d i s o r d e r , w i t h the exception of febrile convulsion before age 6 years, is disqualifying. A minimum of two seizure-free years after cessation of anti-convulsant medication with a normal Electroencephalograp h (EEG) and neurologic evaluation is necessary before a waiver will be con- sidered. Isolated seizures attributed to known causes (e.g., blunt trauma, intoxications) may be waived sooner. ( 3 ) P e r i p h e r a l n e u r o p a t h y d u e t o s y s - temic disease is disqualifying. Impingement neuro- pathy yndrome), is not disqualifying. Small, isolated patches of dimin-ished sensory function are not disqualifying if not due t o a s y s t e m i c o r c e n t r a l p r o c e s s , b u t m u s t b e thoroughly documented in the health record.

P T A l e s s t h a n 1 h o u r i s disqualifying for at least 1 month. A normal brain magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) and normal ex- amination by a neurologist or neurosurgeon is re-quired before return to duty. If more than 2 years has elapsed since the injury, a normal brain MRI and a normal neurologic assessment by the UMO is suffi-cient. Further specialty consultation is only indicated for abnormal findings. 2 . P T A l a s t i n g f r o m 1 t o 2 4 hours is permanently disqualifying for candidates. Waiver may be entertained for designated divers if individual remains asymptomatic for at least 1 year and brain MRI and neurologic and neuropsycho- logical evaluations are normal. 3 .

( 9 ) S y n c o p e , i f r e c u r r e n t , u n e x p l a i n e d , or not responding to treatment, is disqualifying. Note: All DMEs require documentation of a full neurologic examination and tympanic membrane mobility in blocks 44 and 72b respectively on DD Form 2808. The neurologic exam will be supplemented with an anatomic stick figure to document DTRs (n) Decompression Sickness/Arterial Gas Embolism ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f d e c o m p r e s s i o n s i c k - ness (DCS) or AGE is disqualifying for diving duty candidates. A waiver may be considered provided the episode(s) and any subsequent treatment(s) are well documented and available for review. ( 2 ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s d i a g n o s e d w i t h any DCS or AGE must have an entry made in their medical record, signed by the attending UMO, describing the specifics of the dive/episode, treatment provided, and the condition of patient status-post treatment.

( b ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s w i t h h i s t o r y of DCS Type II or AGE whose symptoms resolve completely and who remain asymptomatic after the initial hyperbaric treatment may be cleared after 30 days to return to diving duty by a UMO without a waiver, provided there is brain +/- spine MRI performed within 7 days of the event and the MRI results are normal/unchanged. ( c ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s w i t h a h i s t o r y of DCS or AGE with residual symptoms, neurologic deficits (new/changed) and/or abnormal findings (new/changed) on brain +/- spine MRI, after appro- priate treatment are considered disqualified for diving duty. A waiver may be considered provided the epi- sode and any subsequent treatment(s) are well docu- mented, including any follow-up MRI, a neurology consultation, and the assessment and recommenda- tion of the attending UMO. ( d ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s w i t h r e c u r - rent DCS or AGE are consid ered disqualified and re- quire a waiver prior to ret urning to di ving duty. ( 3 ) D i v e r s / c a n d i d a t e s d i a g n o s e d w i t h DCS Type II must be evaluated by a cardiologist for the presence of a PFO (or ASD functional equiva- lent), with the results documented in the medical record. If a PFO is present, paragraph (4)(e)(10) of this article applies. ( 4 ) E x c e p t i o n s f o r e x p e r i m e n t a l d i v i n g protocols. A small number of Navy research comm- ands, staffed with both expe rienced divers and senior UMOs, conduct equipment testing and human subject research during which ther e is an anticipated, in- creased risk to sub jects of DCS. ( a ) A d e s i g n a t e d d i v e r w h o p a r t i c i - pates in one of these experimental diving protocols and subsequently develops DCS (I or II) may be returned to duty without waiver if: 1 . I n t h e c a s e o f h u m a n s u b j e c t research, the experimental diving protocol is identified by the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) as being of \"greater than minimal risk\" with regards to causing DCS. 2 . I n t h e c a s e o f e q u i p m e n t testing research (e.g., form, fit, and function testing), the experimental test plan is identified by the re-sponsible signing authority as being of \"greater than minimal risk\" with reg ards to causing DCS. 3 . T h e d i v e r ' s D C S s y m p t o m s r e s o l v e c o m p l e t e l y a n d h e o r s h e r e m a i n s a s y m p t o - matic after appropriate hyp erbaric treatment. Divers with residual symptoms do require a waiver. ( b ) T h e r e s e a r c h c o m m a n d ' s U M O - qualified senior medical officer (SMO) may return such a diver to diving duty, consistent with require- ments of paragraphs (4)(n)(2)(a) and (4)(n)(2)(b) of this article. The SMO must make a complete entry in the diver's medical record documenting th e episode, treatment(s), studies or findings, and his or her basis for not seeking a waiver. The medical record entry must also include details regarding the experimental dive profile associated with the DCS episode. ( c ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s d e v e l o p i n g DCS in the context of paragraph (4)(n)(4) of this art- icle do not ipso facto require a cardiology assessment for the presence of a PFO. ( d ) D e s i g n a t e d d i v e r s d e v e l o p i n g recurrent DCS in the context of paragraph (4)(n)(4) of this article do not ipso facto require a waiver; however, the SMO must maintain a low threshold of suspicion to trigger additional medical evaluations in such cases. Note: BUMED recognizes the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) and Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) as research commands suitably staffed to exercise the provisions of paragraph (4)(n)(4) of this article. Any other comm- and seeking to do so must obtain written BUMED concurrence. ( o ) Miscellaneous Disqualifying Conditions ( 1 ) C h r o n i c v i r a l i n f e c t i o n s ( e x c e p t those with manifestations limited to the skin) are dis- qualifying. Divers with chronic viral infections char-acterized by manifestations limited to the skin will not dive with associated active lesions unless covered or until resolved. ( 2 ) A n a c t i v e d i a g n o s i s o f c a n c e r i s disqualifying. A waiver is required to return to the designated diver/candidate to diving duty less than 12 months after the diver/candidate is cured, in remis- sion, or has no clinical evi dence of disease. Divers who are also radiation workers have additional re- quirements per NAVMED P-5055. ( 3 ) C h r o n i c i m m u n e i n s u f f i c i e n c y o f a n y cause, chronic anemia, ab normal hemoglobin (includ- ing sickle cell trait), and defects in platelet function or coagulability are disqualifying. ( 4 ) A l l e r g i c o r a t o p i c c o n d itions which require allergy immunotherapy are disqualifying until completion of desens itization therapy. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 77d Article 15-102 Manual of the Medical Department ( 5 ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f s e v e r e a l l e r g i c reaction or anaphylaxis to environmental substances or any foods is disqualifying. Any allergy with life- threatening manifestations is disqualifying. Note: Because saturation diving evolutions by their very nature impose substantial delays for divers to receive definitive care, should a medical emergency arise, waivers of the food allergy standard for saturation divers will be granted sparingly. ( 6 ) C h r o n i c o r r e c u r r e n t p a i n s y n d r o m e s which may mimic serious disease (e.g., abdominal pain, chest pain, and headache) or mimic diving-related illness are disqualifying ( 7 ) A n y d i s e a s e o r c o n d ition that may be significantly exacerbated by the hyperbaric envir- onment is disqualifying. ( 5 ) Waiver and Disqualification Requests. Waiver and disqualification requests are essentially the same personnel action. The distinction between the two lies with whether the originator is requesting that one or more physical standards be waived or not. The outcome of either request is a determination by the responsible waiver authority as to whether the physical standard(s) is waived or not. BUMED-M95 serves as the senior medical reviewer for the waiver authority. (Certain waiver authorities have delegated adjudication of disqualification cases only to lower echelon commanders). (a) Requests for a waiver of physical stand- ards for DON divers and diving duty candidates must be sent from the member's commander, commanding officer, or officer in charge , via any applicable immed- iate superior in command (ISIC) or type commander (TYCOM) and BUMED-M95, to the appropriate Bureau of Naval Personnel code for Navy divers (enlisted - BUPERS-3; officers - PERS-416), Head- quarters, Marine Corps (HQMC) USMC NAVSEA 00C for civilian GS divers via BUMED-M95. (1) In the case of individuals from sister Services attending U.S. Navy diving training, waivers are not sent via Navy chains of command. Waivers for initial U.S. Air Force divers/candidates will be sent directly to Headquarters, Air Education and Training Command Surgeon's Physical Standards Office (AETC/SGPS). Waivers for U.S. Army Engineer divers/candidates will be submitted directly to Chief, Hyperbaric Medicine, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, GA 30809. Waivers for U.S. Army Special Forces divers/candidates will be sub-mitted directly to Group Sur geon's Office, 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne), Fort Bragg, North Carolina 28310, telephone: (910) 432-3566. Once these individuals have completed U.S. Navy diving training, their fitness for diving duty is deter-mined solely by their respective services' physical standards and diving med ical officers (DMOs). (2) Waivers for USCG divers/candi- dates will be submitted directly to CG Personnel Service Center-Personnel Service Division-Medical (PSC-PSD-MED). Per exis ting agreements, USCG divers continue to follow U.S. Navy diving physical standards after initial training and their ongoing fitness for duty is determined by U.S. Navy UMOs. (b) Excepting personnel belonging to sister Services, originators must use the WEBWAVE 2 sys-tem to securely transmit cases (which contain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and personally identifiable information (PII)-protected information). WEBWAVE 2 expedites case adjudica- tion, allows tracking of cases under review and provides an accessible archive of closed cases. The system's business rules are designed to ensure that all necessary components of a request are submitted and requests are directed electr onically via the proper rout- ing sequence. BUMED-M95's guideline for timely internal review of routine waiver requests is 10 busi- ness days; urgent cases are acted upon with 24 hours of receipt. Access to WEBWAVE 2 is controlled by BUMED-M95. Commands needing to submit requests via WEBWAVE 2 but currently without access may contact BUMED-M95 directly to validate their re- quirement and obtain access/training. (c) For DON divers, interim waivers may be granted by BUMED-M95 for periods of up to 6 months. ( 1 ) I n t e r i m w a i v e r s w ill not normally be considered for diving duty candidates, in as much as their suitability must be established before the Navy incurs the expense of temporary additional duty orders and training. ( 2 ) B ecause interim waivers are not reviewed by the relevant waiver authority, BUMED- M95 will only grant interim waivers for relatively routine, frequently encountered conditions for which it is confident of the waiver authority's eventual dis- position. In any case, interim waivers should be requested sparingly. ( 3 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 m u s t r eceive the final waiver request prior to the expiration of any interim waiver which has been granted (typically 6 months). The final waiver request must include a substantive interval history pertinent to the condition under review. 15-77e Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-102 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-77f Article 15-102 Manual of the Medical Department ( 4 ) I n d i v i d u a l s w i t h l a p s e d i n t e r i m waivers are not physically qualified to dive until the final waiver request has been adjudicated. ( 5 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 ' s f i n a l r e c o m m e n d a - tion will be based on the member's condition at the time the final waiver request is made and may differ from the interim determination, if there has been a change in the member's condition or if information presented in the final request dictates a change in recommendation. (d) The required elements of a waiver or dis- qualification request are: ( 1 ) A s p e c i a l S F 6 0 0 , p r e p a r e d b y t h e UMO, requesting the waiver (or disqualification), referencing the specific standard for which the mem- ber is not physically qualified (NPQ), a clinical syn-opsis including brief history, focused examination, clinical course, appropriate ancillary studies and app- ropriate specialty consultations, followed by an expli-cit recommendation of \"waiver recommended\" or \"waiver not recommended\" with supporting ration- ale. Any ongoing aftercare must be identified. ( 2 ) D D F o r m 2 8 0 7 - 1 / 2 8 0 8 , a n n o t a t e d t o reflect individual's pertinent findings. This may either be a new diving duty examination, a current diving duty examination, annotated as necessary, or a focused examination documenting pertinent positives and negatives. Circumstances will dictate which format is most appropriate. ( 3 ) C o p i e s o f o t h e r , p e r t i n e n t s t u d i e s supporting the waiver/disqualification.

( 5 ) E n d o r s e m e n t b y t h e m e m b e r ' s c o m - manding officer or sponsoring unit. This endorsement should be substantive a nd address whether the condition, diagnosis, or current condition impairs the member's performance of diving duties and is com-patible with the operational environment. Note: Office codes, titles and contact numbers are current as of the time of document release. It shoul d be anticipated that these can and will change prior to the next revision of this article. 15-103 Nuclear Field Duty ( 1 ) Characteristics. Nuclear field duty involves work within the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program . A very high degree of reliability, alertness, and good judgment is required in order for operations to be conducted safely and to maintain the integrity and accountability of these critical programs. ( 2 ) Applicability. Current (designated) and pro- spective nuclear field personnel. For the purposes of this article, this includes Service members assigned to naval reactors (NAVSEA 08) as regional office field representatives. It should be noted that nuclear field duty is not the same as occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (ionizing radiation work). While all Nuclear Field personnel must also be qualified as ionizing radiation workers, not all ionizing radiation workers are Nuclear Field personnel. Examples of the latter category are medical radiology personnel and industrial radiographers. ( 3 ) Examinations ( a ) Periodicity. For candidates, no more than 2 years before reporting for initial nuclear field training. Periodicity between examinations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed every 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Nuclear field duty examinations must be performed no later than 1 month following the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical examination date. For example, for an exam performed on a 20-year-old on the 15th of February 2010, the next examination must be completed by 31 March 2015. A complete physical examination is also required prior to returning to nuclear field duty after a period of disqualification. For the purposes of efficien cy, all nuclear field duty examinations should be performed concurrently with a Radiation Medical Exam (RME), (per MANMED article 15-104 and NAVMED P-5055) and docu- th eir respective forms. 15-78 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-103 ( b ) Scope. The examiner will pay special attention to the mental status, psychiatric, and neuro- logic components of the exa mination, and will review the entire health record for evidence of past impair-ment. Specifically, the individual will be questioned about anxiety related to working with nuclear power, difficulty getting along with other personnel, and his- tory of suicidal or homicidal behavior (ideation, ges- ture, or attempt). The only laboratory tests required are those done for the concurrent RME. The examination must be recorded on DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 2808. Laboratory data and ra diation-specific historical questions documented on the NAVMED 6470/13 for the RME need not be dupl icated on the DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 2808 for the nuclear field duty examination. The following studies are required prior to the exam (unless other-wise specified): ( 1 ) Audiogram (current within last 12 months). ( 2 ) V i s u a l a c u i t y ( w i t h i n l a s t 3 months). ( 3 ) C o l o r v i s i o n t e s t i n g ( c a n d i d a t e s only, upon program entry) following MANMED article 15-36(1)(d)). ( c ) Examiners. Nuclear field duty physical examinations may be performed by any physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner with appro- priate DoD clinical privileges. Examinations not performed by an undersea medical officer (UMO), aerospace medicine specialist (AMS) or graduate of course CIN#: B-6A-2102 (Flight Surgeon Refresher with Nuclear Field Duty Indoctrination module) (FS/NFD) will be reviewed and co-signed by a UMO, AMS or FS/NFD. All reviewing authority signatures must be accompanied by the \"UMO,\" \"AMS\" or \"FS/NFD\" designation, as appropriate. A UMO is defined as a medical officer (or physician employed by DoD who previously served as an UMO) who has successfully completed the entire UMO course con- ducted by the Naval Undersea Medical Institute (NUMI), which includes the diving medical officer (DMO) course conducted at the Naval Diving and S a l v a g e T r a i n i n g C e n t e r ( N D S T C ) , a n d w h o i s currently privileged in undersea medicine. A AMS is a graduate of a Navy Residency in Aerospace Medi- cine (RAM) who is currently privileged in aerospace m e d i c i n e . A F S / N F D i s a f l i g h t s u r g e o n ( F S ) w h o completes CIN#: B-6A-2102, which is tailored to the specific billet each FS is ass igned; those with orders to be senior medical officer on aircraft carriers (CVN) will receive the NFD indoctrination module and an additional qualification designator (AQD). For the purposes of this article, \"mental health professional/ provider\" refers to a doctoral-level provider (psychia-trist/psychologist) unless otherwise indicated. ( 4 ) Standards. The standards delineated in this article define the conditions which are considered disqualifying for nuclear field duty. The standards delineated in Chapter 15, Section III (General Stand- ards) are universally applicable to all nuclear field duty candidates. Certain of the General Standards are applicable to continued qualification for nuclear field duty whereas others are not. UMOs, AMSs and FS/NFDs, based on their specialty training and sub-ject matter expertise, are charged with applying the General Standards to qualified nuclear field personnel w h e n a p p r o p r i a t e t o e n s u r e p h y s i c a l a n d m e n t a l readiness to perform their duties without limitation. Standards in this article t ake precedence over General Standards where conflicts exist. All nuclear field personnel must meet the physical standards for occu- pational exposure to ionizing radiation (see MAN- MED article 15-104 and NAVMED P-5055). Sub-marine designated nuclear field personnel must meet the physical standards for submarine duty (see MAN- MED article 15-106). The reliability, alertness, and good judgment required of N aval Nuclear Deterrence Mission personnel is monitored and ensured by the requirements of the Personnel Reliability Program (SECNAVINST 5510.35 series). ( a ) General. Any condition, combination of conditions, or treatment which may impair judgment or alertness, adversely affect reliability, or foster a perception of impairment is disqualifying. Nuclear field personnel returning to duty following an absence of greater than 7 days due to illness or injury, hospi-talization for any reason, or after being reported on by a medical board must have a properly documented UMO, AMS or FS/NFD evaluation to determine fit-ness for continued nuclear field duty. ( b ) Hearing. Demonstrated inability to eff- ectively communicate and perform duties is dis- qualifying. ( c ) Eyes and Vision ( 1 ) V i s u a l a c u i t y n o t c o r r e c t a b l e t o 20/25 in at least one eye is disqualifying. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-79 Article 15-103 Manual of the Medical Department ( 2 ) D e f e c t i v e c o l o r v i s i o n , a s d e f i n e d by MANMED article 15-36, paragraph (1)(d), is disqualifying. For qualifie d nuclear field personnel, w a i v e r r e q u e s t s m u s t i n c l u d e a s t a t e m e n t f r o m t h e member's supervisor stating that the member is able to perform his or her job accurately and without difficulty. For candidates, the examiner must include evidence that the candidate can discern primary and secondary colors. ( d ) Psychological and Cognitive. Psycho- logical fitness for nuclear fie ld duty must be carefully and continuously evaluated in all nuclear field per-sonnel. It is imperative that individuals working in these programs have a very high degree of reliability, alertness, and good judgment. Any current or history of a diagnosis as defined by the current version of the DSM, unless explicitly excepted, is disqualifying, to include: ( 1 ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f d e l i r i u m , d e - mentia, amnestic and other cognitive disorders, men- tal disorders due to a general medical condition, schi- zophrenia and other psychotic disorders, somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, and impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified are disqualifying. ( 2 ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f m o o d d i s o r d e r and/or anxiety disorders (including adjustment dis-orders lasting longer than 90 days) as listed in the DSM is disqualifying, but may be considered for a waiver once the Service member's condition is stable and asymptomatic. ( a ) N u c l e a r f i e l d c a n d i d a t e s , w h o s e treatment includes psychopharmaceuticals, are dis- qualified and not eligible for a waiver until such medications are no longer required to achieve asymp-tomatic stability. ( b ) N u c l e a r f i e l d d e s i g n a t e d i n d i - viduals, whose treatment includes ongoing use of selected psychopharmaceuticals, may be considered for waiver, provided all of the following stipulations are met: 1 . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r m u s t initially be evaluated by a DoD-privileged psychia- trist. 2 . T h e c o n d ition must be cat- egorized as stable, reso lved, or in remission. 3 . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r m u s t have access to the recommended level of follow-up with their mental health provider and primary care manager (PCM). For submarine duty personnel, the condition must be stable enough to allow follow-up solely with an Independent Duty Corpsman for up to 6 months at a time. Nuclear field duty personnel assigned to CVNs, who have ready access to licensed independent practitioners (physician assistant (PA), nurse practitioner (NP), physician, and psychologist) for follow-up, do not have an equivalent requirement. 4. as bupropion, are well tolerated, with minimal side effects and generally amenable for waiver. Other medications may be considered on a limited, case-by-case basis. It is expected that start- ing medication, titrating up to the optimum dosage, assessing for efficacy, side effects, and demonstrating stability will require about 3 months; however some medications with short biological half-lives may re- quire less time. The UMO, AMS or FS/NFD must certify, when recommending a waiver, that: i . T h e S e r v i c e m e m - ber's underlying condition is well-controlled (asymp- tomatic) on the current dosage of medication. i i . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r is on a stable dosage of medication (i.e., no dose change in the 30 days prior to waiver submission). iii. The Service member demonstrates clinical stability without any military duty performance-impairing side effects. This ass- essment should also be specifically addressed by the individual's command endorsement. 5 . M o o d d i s o r d e r s a n d / o r a n x - iety disorders (including adjustment disorders) com- plicated by suic idal behaviors. i . I n d i v i d u a l s w h o h a v e experienced suicidal ideation in conjunction with their mood and/or anxiety disorder (including adjustment disorders) may still be considered for a psycho-pharmaceutical use waiver in conjunction with a waiver for their underlying psychological condition and their suicidal behavior. 15-80 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-103 i i . I n d i v i d u a l s w h o h a v e displayed suicidality in the form of a suicidal gesture or suicide attempt, as defined by a mental health professional, will not be eligible for a psychopharma- ceutical use waiver. A waiver to return to nuclear field duty after a suicide gesture or attempt will require cessation of medication use in conjunction with complete resolution of their condition, in addition to a recommendation from a the UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider. ( 3 ) P o s t - p a r t u m d e p r e s s i o n o f l i m i t e d duration is not normally disqualifying for nuclear field duty. Cases which resolve quickly, within the 12- week maternity leave peri od, may be found fit for nuclear field duty by the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD. Cases of longer duration and/or requiring psychopharmaceutical use or involving suicidality are disqualifying and waiver will be considered after complete resolution of symptoms. ( 4 ) D i s o r d e r s u s u a l l y f i r s t d i a g n o s e d i n infancy, childhood, or adolescence, are disqualifying if they interfere with safet y and reliability or foster a perception of impairment. ( a ) C u r r e n t a t t e n t i o n d e f i c i t h y p e r - activity disorder (ADHD) which requires medication to control symptoms, is disqualifying, but a history of ADHD which resolved greater than 1 year prior to military service is not disqualifying. ( b ) C o m m u n i c a t i o n d i s o r d e r s , i n - cluding but not limited to any speech impediment which significantly interferes with production of speech, repeating of commands, or allowing clear verbal communications, are disqualifying. ( c ) S l e e p d i s o r d e r s , w h i c h r e s u l t i n daytime fatigue, somnolence or inattention, are dis- qualifying. ( 5 ) G e n d e r d y s p h o r i a . T r a n s g e n d e r i n - dividuals with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, with no other comorbidities, may be returned to nuclear field duty upon the written recommendation of the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD and mental health professional without further recourse to the waiver process. Transgender individuals who have been de- termined to not have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria merely require documentation of that fact in their medical record. Actual gender transition, involving medications and/or treatments, must be considered separately as to the interventions' respective impacts on the individual's suitability for nuclear field duty. ( 6 ) P e r s o n a lity disorders are disquali- fying for nuclear field duty candidates. For nuclear field designated personnel, personality disorders may be administratively disqualifying if they are of signi- ficant severity as to preclude safe and successful per-formance of duties. In these cases, administrative processing should be pursued per the Military Per- sonnel Manual (MILPERSMAN). ( 7 ) A d j u s t m e n t d i s o r d e r s a n d b r i e f s i t - uational emotional distress, such as acute stress reactions or bereavement, are not normally disquali- fying. Individuals with these conditions must be evaluated by the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, in conjunction with formal mental health evaluation. In cases which resolve completely within 90 days, individual may be found fit for nuclear field duty by the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD. Conditions lasting longer than 90 days are disqualifying; a waiver may be considered after complete resolution of symptoms. ( 8 ) S u i c i d a l B e h a v i o r s ( a ) H i s t o r y o f s u i c i d a l g e s t u r e o r attempt is disqualifying. These situations must be taken very seriously and require formal evaluation by a mental health provider. Waivers will be considered based on the underlying condition as determined by the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health professional. Any consideration for return to duty must address whether the Service member, in the written opinions of the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider, can return successfully to the specific stresses and environment of nuclear field duty. ( b ) S u i c i d a l i d e a t i o n ( S I ) , w h e t h e r active or passive, is a significant risk factor for suicide and is associated with several mental health diagnoses. Any individual with SI requires a thorough suicide risk assessment by a mental health provider. However, SI is a symptom rather than a diagnosis. As such, if the individual does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a disqualifying condition, then the individual may be return to nuclear field duty upon the written recommendation of the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider without further recourse to the waiver process. ( 9 ) H i s t o r y o f s e l f - m u tilation, includ- ing but not limited to cutting, burning, and other self-inflicted wounds, is disqualifying whether occurring 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-81 Article 15-103 Manual of the Medical Department in conjunction with suicidality or as an abnormal coping mechanism. Waivers will be considered based on the underlying condition, and its complete resolu- tion, as determined by the attending UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider. ( 1 0 ) D i s o r d e r s r e l a t e d t o S u b s t a n c e U s e (SUD) ( a ) H i s t o r y o f S U D i s m e d i c a l l y disqualifying for all nuclear field candidates. Waiver requests must include documentation of successful completion of treatment and aftercare. ( b ) All nuclear field designated personnel with SUD will be managed administra- tively per OPNAVINST 5355.3 series and do not re- quire medical disqualification unless a medically dis- qualifying diagnosis is present in addition to SUD. ( c ) I llicit drug use, historical or current, is to be managed administratively per OP- NAVINST 5355.3 series, SECNAVINST 5300.28 series, and any other a pplicable directives. ( 1 1 ) H i s t o r y o f o t h e r m e n t a l d i s o r d e r s not listed above, which, in the opinion of the UMO, AMS, or FS/NFD, will interfe re with or prevent satis- factory performance of nuclear field duty is dis- qualifying. ( 1 2 ) A n y u s e o f p s y c h o p h a r m aceuticals for any indication within the preceding year is dis- qualifying. For the purpose of this article, \"psycho- pharmaceutical\" is defined as a prescription medi- cation whose primary site of activity is the central nervous system (CNS). This includes, but is not limited to, anti-depressant anti- epileptics, sedative or smoking cessation agents other than nicotine, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) scheduled medi- cations, and bipolar agents. Note: Many non-psychiatric medications possess psycho-pharma- ceutical properties and are considered disqualifying ) P e r p a r a g r a p h ( 4 ) ( d ) ( 2 ) , w a i v e r s will be considered for ongoing clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders with specific medi- cations. ( b ) F o r m e d i c a t i o n s w i t h o n l y i n c i - dental activity (i.e., minor side effects occasionally observed in some individuals taking these medica- tions) in the CNS, waivers will be considered on the basis of demonstrated stability of a stable dosage, no impairing side effects impacting duties, and favorable endorsement by UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider, and the individual's command. The c o m m a n d e n d o r s e m e n t m u s t a t t e s t t o b o t h t h e i n d i - vidual's functionality and criticality to mission. ( c ) W a i v e r s w ill be considered, in selected cases, for ongoing use of psychopharma- ceuticals to treat non-psychiatric conditions. Requests for such waivers must meet a high threshold of documentation; waivers will be considered on the basis of demonstrated stability of a stable dosage, no impairing side effects impacting duties, and favorable endorsement by UMO, AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider, and the individual's command. The c o m m a n d e n d o r s e m e n t m u s t a t t e s t t o b o t h t h e i n d i - vidual's functionality and criticality to mission. ( d ) W a i v e r s w ill be considered, upon discontinuation of psy chopharmaceuticals, after a period of time considered s ufficient to metabolize or eliminate the medication from the individual's body (generally, five biological half-lives, less for single d o s e o r t r a n s i e n t c o u r s e s o f t r e a t m e n t ) . T h e U M O , AMS or FS/NFD, and mental health provider must specifically comment on the presence or absence of any withdrawal, discontinuation rebound, or other such symptoms attributable to the episode of psy-chopharmaceutical use. Ind ividuals who experience any of these symptoms must be symptom free for 60 days before a waiver will be considered. ( e ) U s e o f a n y D E A S c h e d u l e I drug for any reason, including religious sacraments, is disqualifying. ( f ) Exceptions. Zolpidem (Am- bien) prescribed for jet lag, medications prescribed or administered for facilitation of a medical or dental surgery or procedure, narcotic and synthetic opioid pain medications prescribe d for acute pain manage- ment, anti-emetics for acute nausea, and muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine or diazepam) for acute musculoskeletal spa sm or pain are not dis- qualifying. Acute treatment is limited to 2 weeks of continuous medication usage. Episodic use of sero- tonin receptor abortive treatment, is not disqualifying. 15-81a Cha nge 164 22 May 2 018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-103 (e) Miscellaneous ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f c h r o n i c p a i n ( e . g . , a b - dominal pain, chest pain, and headache) which is recurrent or incapacitating such that it prevents com-pletion of daily duty assignments or compromises reliability is disqualifying. ( 2 ) R e c u r r e n t s y n c o p e i s d i s q u a l i f y i n g . Waiver will be considered on the basis of a definitive diagnosis and demonstration of effective prophylactic treatment. (5) Waiver and Disqualification Requests. Waiver and disqualification requests are essentially the same personnel action. The distinction between the two lies with whether the originator is requesting that one or more physical standards be waived or not. The outcome of either request is a determination by the responsible waiver authority as to whether the p h y s i c a l s t a n d a r d ( s ) i s w a i v e d o r n o t . B U M E D Undersea Medicine and Radiation Health (BUMED-M95) serves as the senior medical reviewer for the waiver authority. (Certain waiver authorities have delegated adjudication of disqualification cases only to lower echelon commanders). (a) Requests for a waiver of physical stand-ards for nuclear field personnel and candidates must be sent from the member's commander, commanding officer, or officer in charge, via any applicable im- mediate superior in command (ISIC) or type com- mander (TYCOM) and BUMED-M95, to the appro-priate Bureau of Naval Personnel code (enlisted - PERS-403; officers - PERS-421). (b) Originators must use the WEBWAVE 2 system to securely transmit cases (which contain HIPAA and PII-protected information). WEBWAVE 2 expedites case adjudication, allows tracking of cases under review and provides an accessible archive of closed cases. The system's business rules are designed to ensure that all necessary components of a request are submitted and requests are directed electronically via the proper routing sequence. BUMED-M95's guideline for timely internal review of routine waiver requests is 10 business days; Urgent cases are acted upon with 24 hours of receipt. Access to WEBWAVE 2 is controlled by BUMED-M95. Commands needing to submit requests via WEBWAVE 2 but currently without access may contact BUMED-M95 directly to validate their requirement and obtain access or training. (c) For nuclear field personnel, interim waivers may be granted by BUMED-M95 for periods of up to 6 months. ( 1 ) I n t e r i m w a i v e r s w ill not normally be considered for nuclear field candidates, in as much as their suitability must be established before the Navy incurs the expense of TAD orders and training. ( 2 ) B ecause interim waivers are not reviewed by the relevant waiver authority, BUMED- M95 will only grant interim waivers for relatively routine, frequently encountered conditions for which it is confident of the waiver authority's eventual disposition. In any case, interim waivers should be requested sparingly. ( 3 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 m u s t r e c e i v e t h e f i n a l waiver request prior to the expiration of any interim waiver which has been granted (typically 6 months). The final waiver request must include a substantive interval history pertinent to the condition under review. ( 4 ) I n d i v i d u a l s w i t h l a p s e d i n t e r i m waivers are not physically qualified to stand engi- neering spaces watches or perform maintenance on NNPP-related equipment until the final waiver re-quest has been adjudicated. ( 5 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 ' s f i n a l r e c o m m e n d a - tion will be based on the member's condition at the time the final waiver request is made and may differ from the interim determination, if there has been a change in the member's condition or if information presented in the final request dictates a change in recommendation. (d) Individuals with conditions which are also disqualifying for occupational exposure to ioniz- ing radiation require consideration by the Radiation Effects Advisory Board per MANMED article 15-104 and NAVMED P-5055. (e) The required elements of a waiver or dis-qualification request are: ( 1 ) A s p e c i a l S F 6 0 0 , p r e p a r e d b y t h e UMO, requesting the waiver or disqualification, referencing the specific standard for which the mem- ber is NPQ, a clinical synopsis including brief history, focused examination, clinical course, appropriate ancillary studies and appropriate specialty 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 81b Article 15-103 Manual of the Medical Department consultations, followed by an explicit recommenda- tion of \"waiver recommended\" or \"waiver not recom-mended\" with supporting rationale. Any ongoing aftercare must be identified. ( 2 ) D D F o r m 2 8 0 7 - 1 / 2 8 0 8 , a n n o t a t e d t o reflect individual's pertinent findings. This may either be a new nuclear field duty examination, a current nuclear field duty examination, annotated as necessary, or a focused examination documenting pertinent positives and negatives. Circumstances will dictate which format i s most appropriate. ( 3 ) C o p i e s o f o t h e r , p e r t i n e n t s t u d i e s supporting the waiver or disqualification. ( 4 ) C o p i e s o f p e r t i n e n t , s p e c i a l t y c o n - sultation clinical notes supporting the waiver or disqualification. ( 5 ) E n d o r s e m e n t b y t h e m e m b e r ' s c o m - manding officer or sponsoring unit. This endorse- ment should be substantive and address whether the condition or diagnosis/current condition impairs the member's performance of nuclear field duty and is compatible with the operational environment. Note: Office codes, titles and contact numbers are current as of the time of document release. It should be anticipated that these can and will change prior to the next revision of this article. 15-104 Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation ( 1 ) General. NAVMED P-5055, Radiation Health Protection Manual, is the governing document for the Navy's Radiation Health Protection Program. To ensure that the requirements of NAVMED P-5055 are met and to eliminate any potential for conflicting guidance, the specific standards and examination pro- cedures for occupational exposure to ionizing radia-tion are found only in NAVMED P-5055, Chapter 2. The current version of NAVMED P-5055 is available on the Navy Medicine Web site at http://www.med. navy.mil/directives/Pages/Publications.aspx . 15-105 Special Operations Duty ( 1 ) Characteristics. Special operations (SO) duty takes place in every part of the world under harsh conditions at the extremes of human physical capabilities. Medical austerity and the presence of armed opposition are common. SO personnel, de- pending on service and warfare community, routinely engage in high-risk operations including parachuting, high angle activities, high-speed boat and unconven- tional vehicle operation, weapons operation, demoli- tions employment, and waterborne activities, to include SCUBA diving. As such, SO duty is among the most physically and m entally demanding assign- ments in the U.S. military. Only the most physically and mentally qualified personnel should be selected, and those who are or may b e reasonably expected to become unfit or unrelia ble must be excluded. ( 2 ) Applicability . Current and prospective mem- bers of the following communities (whether Navy, U.S. non-Navy, or foreign national): (a) Navy sea, air, and land personnel (SEAL). (b) Special warfare combatant craft crew- men (SWCC). (c) USMC Reconnaissance Marine (RE- CON). (d) USMC Forces Special Operations Com- mand (MARSOC); special operations officer (SOO), critical skills operators (CSO), and Special Amphi-bious Reconnaissan ce Corpsman (SARC). (e) Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel. Note: To be physically qualified for military parachuting (including basic, military free-fall, and high altitude low opening), Army Regulation 40-501 (AR40-501), applies. Article 15-105 standards are presumed to encompass AR40-501/5 standards; therefore, an individual meeting physical standards or possessing a valid waiver for special operations duty from BUPERS-3 or PERS-416 is medically qualified to participate in military parachuting. 15-82 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-105 Note: SEAL, Navy EOD, and other SO personnel whose duties involve military diving or maintain ing diving duty status must also be qualified under MANMED Chapter 15, article 15-102 (diving duty). Personnel who are SO qualified but do not dive or require dive qualification are not required to be qualified under MANMED Chapter 15, article 15-102. ( 3 ) Examinations applica- tion for initial training. Periodicity between exami-nations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Special operations duty examinations must be performed no later than 1 month following the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical exami- nation date. For example, for an examination per- formed on a 20-year old on 15 February 2018, the next examination must be completed by 31 March 2023. A complete physical examination is also required prior to returning to special operations duty after a period of disqualification.

( 2 ) I n a d d ition to any applicable BUMEDINST 6230.15 series (Immunization and Chemoprophylaxis) requirem ents, all special tions candidates and current operators must be immu- nized against both Hepatitis A and B. Special Opera- tions candidates must have completed the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B series prior to the start of training. If documentation of completed immunization is lacking or in doubt, demonstration of serological immunity is sufficient to meet this requirement. ( c ) Examiners . Examinations may be per- formed by any physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner with appropriate DoD clinical privileges. Examinations not performed by an undersea medical officer (UMO) must be reviewed and co-signed by a UMO. All reviewing authority signatures must be accompanied by the \"UMO\" designation. A UMO is defined as a medical officer (or physician employed by DoD who previously served as a UMO) who has successfully completed the entire UMO course con- ducted by the Naval Undersea Medical Institute (NUMI), which includes the diving medical officer (DMO) course conducted at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC), and who is curr- ently privileged in undersea medicine. For the purposes of this article, \"mental health professional/ provider\" refers to a doctoral-level provider (psychia-trist/psychologist) unless otherwise indicated. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-83 Article 15-105 Manual of the Medical Department ( 4 ) Standards . The standards delineated in this article define the conditions which are considered disqualifying for SO duty. The standards delineated in MANMED Chapter 15, Section III (General Stan- dards, some of which are restated below for emphasis) are universally applicable to all SO duty candidates, unless specifically addressed in this article. UMOs, based on their specialty training and subject matter expertise, are charged with applying the General Standards to qualified SO personnel when appropriate to ensure that they are physically and mentally ready to perform their duties without limitation. ( a ) General. Any condition or combination of conditions which may be exacerbated by SO duty, impair the ability to safely and effectively work in the SO environment, or increase potential for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) is disqualifying. Any dis- ease or condition causing chronic or recurrent dis- ability or frequent health care encounters, increasing the hazards of isolation, or having the potential for significant exacerbation by extreme weather, stress, hypobaric or hyperbaric environments, or fatigue is disqualifying. Conditions and treatments causing a significant potential for disruption of operations are disqualifying. Further, any condition, combination of conditions, or treatment which may confound the dia-gnosis of a heat, cold, or brain injury is disqualifying. Note: SO personnel reporting for duty following an absence of greater than 14 days due to illness or injury, hospitalization for any reason, or reported on by a me dical board must have a properly documented UMO evaluation to determine fitness for continued SO duty. ( b ) Ear, Nose, and Throat ( 1 ) S l e e p a p n e a w i t h c o g n itive impair- ment or daytime hypersomnolence is disqualifying. ( 2 ) H i s t o r y o f i n n e r e a r p a t h o l o g y o r surgery, including but not limited to vertigo, Meni- ere's disease or syndrome, endolymphatic hydrops, or tinnitus of sufficient severity to interfere with sat- isfactory performance of duties is disqualifying.

( 6 ) D e f i c i e n t c o l o r v i s i o n , a s d e f i n e d b y MANMED article 15-36(1)(d), is disqualifying. Waiver requests for color vision deficiency will not be considered for EOD personnel or candidates. Other special operation communities will consider waivers.

Candidate or SO designated personnel refusing to receive recom-mended vaccines (preventive health or theatre speci-fic vaccines recommended by the Combatant Com- mand (COCOM)) based solely on personal or reli-gious beliefs are disqualified. This provision does not pertain to medical contraindications or allergies to vaccine administration. (4) Waiver and Disqualification Requests. Waiver and disqualification requests are essentially the same personnel action. The distinction between the two lies with whether the originator is requesting that one or more physical standards be waived or not. The outcome of either request is a determination by the responsible waiver authority as to whether the physical standard(s) is waived or not. BUMED-M95 serves as the senior medical reviewer for the waiver authority. (Certain waiver authorities have delegated adjudication of disqualification cases only to lower echelon commanders). (a) Requests for a waiver of physical stand- ards for SO personnel and candidates must be sent from the member's commander, commanding officer, or officer in charge, via any applicable immediate superior in command (ISIC) or type commander (TY-COM) and BUMED-M95, to the appropriate Bureau of Naval Personnel code (enlisted - BUPERS-3; offi-cers - PERS-416); or Headquarters, USMC (POG-40). (b) Originators must use the WEBWAVE 2 system to securely transmit cases (which contain HIPAA and PII-protected information). WEBWAVE 2 expedites case adjudication, allows tracking of cases under review and provides an accessible archive of closed cases. The system's business rules are designed to ensure that all necessary components of a request are submitted and requests are directed electronically via the proper routing sequence. BUMED-M95's guideline for timely internal review of routine waiver requests is 10 business days ; Urgent cases are acted upon with 24 hours of receipt. Access to WEBWAVE 2 is controlled by BUMED-M95. Commands needing to submit requests via WEBWAVE 2 but currently without access may contact BUMED-M95 directly to validate their requirement and obtain access/training. ( c ) For SO personnel, interim waivers may be granted by BUMED-M95 for periods of up to 6 months. ( 1 ) I n t e r i m w a i v e r s w ill not normally be considered for SO candidates, in as much as their suitability must be established before the Navy incurs the expense of TAD orders and training. ( 2 ) B e c a u s e i n t e r i m w a i v e r s a r e n o t r e - viewed by the relevant Waiver Authority, BUMED- M95 will only grant interim waivers for relatively routine, frequently encountered conditions for which it is confident of the waiver authority's eventual disposition. In any case, interim waivers should be requested sparingly. ( 3 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 m u s t r e c e i v e t h e f i n a l waiver request prior to the expiration of any interim waiver which has been granted (typically 6 months). The final waiver request must include a substantive interval history pertinent to the condition under review. ( 4 ) Individuals with lapsed interim wai- vers are not physically qualified to parachute or deploy until the final waiver request has been adjudicated. ( 5 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 ' s f i n a l r e c o m m e n d a - tion will be based on the member's condition at the time the final waiver request is made and may differ from the interim determination, if there has been a change in the member's condition or if information presented in the final request dictates a change in recommendation. (d) BUMED-M95 will perform 'courtesy screening' for SO candidat es, who are potential Navy accessions, referred by their local Navy Recruiting Districts (NRD); however, these screens are not waivers. (e) The required elements of a waiver or disqualification request are: ( 1 ) A special SF 600, prepared by the UMO, requesting the waiver (or disqualification), referencing the specific standard for which the member is NPQ, a clinical synopsis including brief history, focused examination, clinical course, appro- priate ancillary studies and appropriate specialty 15-90 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 consultations, followed by an explicit recommenda- tion of \"waiver recommended\" or \"waiver not recommended\" with supporting rationale. Any on- going aftercare must be identified. ( 2 ) D D F o r m 2 8 0 7 - 1 / 2 8 0 8 , a n n o t a t e d t o reflect individual's pertinent findings. This may either be a new SO duty examination, a current SO duty examination, annotated as necessary, or a focused examination documenting pertinent positives and negatives. Circumstances will dictate which format is most appropriate. ( 3 ) C o p i e s o f o t h e r , p e r t i n e n t s t u d i e s supporting the waiver/disqualification. ( 4 ) C o p i e s o f p e r t i n e n t , s p e c i a l t y c o n - sultation clinical notes supporting the waiver or dis- qualification. ( 5 ) Endorsement by the member's com- manding officer or sponsoring unit. This endorse- ment should be substantive and address whether the condition, diagnosis, or current condition impairs the member's performance of SO duty and is compatible with the operational environment. Note: Office codes, titles and contact num bers are current as of the time of document release. It should be anticipated that these can and will change prior to the next revision of this article. Note: An individual who does not meet Article 15-105 physical standards and is denied a waiver by BUPERS- 3/PERS-416, and still wishes to participate in military parachuting, must be examined and meet standards per AR40-501. Waiver authority for the Air-borne School is the Commandant, U. S. Army Infantry School in coordination with U.S. Total Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM). 15-106 Submarine Duty ( 1 ) Characteristics. Submarine duty is charact- erized by geographic isolation, austere medical support, need for personnel reliability, prolonged habitation of enclosed spaces, continuous exposure to low level atmospheric contaminants, and psycho-logical stress. The purpose of submarine duty stand- ards is to maximize mission capability by optimizing mental and physical readiness of members of the submarine force. ( 2 ) Applicability. Current and prospective sub- mariners and UMOs. Non-submarine designated per- sonnel embarked on (\"riders\") with series. ( 3 ) Examinations ( a ) Periodicity. For candidates, no more than 1 year prior to reporting for initial submarine training. Periodicity between examinations will not exceed 5 years up to age 50. After age 50, periodicity will not exceed 2 years, e.g., an individual examined at age 46 would be re-examined at age 51, an individual examined at age 47, 48, 49, or 50 would be re-examined at age 52. Beginning at age 60, the examination is required annually. Submarine duty examinations must be performed no later than 1 month following the anniversary date (month and year) of the previous physical examination date. For example, for an examination performed on a 20-year old on 15 February 2010, the next examination must be com-pleted by 31 March 2015. A complete physical exami- nation is also required prior to returning to submarine duty after a period of disqualification. ( b ) Scope. The examiner will pay special attention to the mental status, psychiatric, and neu- rologic components of the examination, and will review the entire health record for evidence of past impairment. Specifically, the individual will be ques- tioned about difficulty getting along with other per- sonnel, history of suicidal or homicidal ideation, and anxiety related to tight or closed spaces, nuclear power, or nuclear weapons. The examination must be recorded on the DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 2808. For female examinees, the NAVMED 6420/2 (Health and Reproductive Risk Counseling for Female Submariners and Submarine Candidates) is also re-quired. If within required periodicity, portions of the examination typically performed in conjunction with the annual women's health e xam (e.g., breast, geni- talia, pelvic, anus and rectum) may be transcribed with proper attribution rather than repeated, and need not be performed by the examiner performing the submarine duty exam. The following studies are required within 3 months prior to the exam unless otherwise specified: ( 1 ) P A a n d l a t e r a l x - r a y s o f t h e c h e s t (candidates only, upon program entry).

Note: NAVMED P-5055 may specify different, more restrictive, periodicities for breast cancer screening. ( c ) Examiners. Submarine duty physical examinations may be performed by any physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner with appro-priate DoD clinical privileges. Examinations not per- formed by a UMO must be reviewed and co-signed by a UMO. All reviewing authority signatures must be accompanied by the \"UMO\" designation. A UMO is defined as a medical officer (or physician employed by DoD who previously served as a UMO) who has successfully completed the entire UMO course conducted by the Naval Undersea Medical Institute (NUMI), which includes the diving medical officer (DMO) course conducted at the Naval Diving and S a l v a g e T r a i n i n g C e n t e r ( N D S T C ) , a n d w h o i s currently privileged in undersea medicine. For the purposes of this article, \"mental health professional/ provider\" refers to a doctoral-level provider (psychia-trist/psychologist) unless otherwise indicated. ( 4 ) Standards. The standards delineated in this chapter define the conditions which are considered disqualifying for submarine duty. The standards de- lineated in Chapter 15, Section III (General Stand- ards) are universally applicab le to all submarine duty candidates. Certain of the General Standards are applicable to continued qualification for submarine duty whereas others are not. UMOs, based on their specialty training and subject matter expertise, are charged with applying the General Standards to qualified submarine personnel when appropriate to ensure physical and mental readiness to perform their duties without limitation. Standards in this article take precedence over General Standards where conflicts exist. Submariners who operate or maintain equip-ment under the purview of the Naval Nuclear Pro- pulsion Program must also meet the physical standards for nuclear field duty and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (MANMED articles 15-103 and NAVMED P-5055). Ship's company divers must also meet the diving duty and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation standards (MANMED articles 15- 102 and NAVMED P-5055). For the purpose of this article, \"submarine duty candidates\" and \"candidates\" refer to submarine designated personnel who have yet to report to their first s ubmarine. \"Submariners\" or \"submarine qualified\" personnel are those individuals who have reported to their first submarine. ( a ) General. Any condition or combination of conditions which may be exacerbated by sub- marine duty or increase potential for MEDEVAC is disqualifying. Also, any condition, combination of conditions, or treatment which may impair the ability of one to safely and effectively work and live in the submarine environment is disqualifying. Submari-ners returning to duty following an absence of greater than 7 days due to illness or injury, hospitalization for any reason, or after being reported on by a medical board must have a documented UMO evaluation to determine fitness for continued submarine duty. ( b ) Ears and Hearing ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f c h r o n i c i n a b ility to equalize pressure across the tympanic membranes is disqualifying. Mild Eustachian tube dysfunction that can be controlled with medication is not disquali- fying. ( 2 ) C a n d i d a t e s m u s t m e e t a u d i t o r y acuity standards of MANMED article 15-38. For submarine-qualified personnel, diminished unampli-fied auditory acuity which impairs swift, accurate communication and performance of duties is dis- qualifying. ( c ) Dental ( 1 ) DoD dental Class 3 or 4 is dis- qualifying for candidates. Submariners assigned to operational submarines must maintain DoD Dental Class 1 or 2. ( 2 ) Indication of, or currently under treatment for, any chronic infection or disease of the soft tissue of the oral cavity is disqualifying. 15-92 Ch ange 164 22 May 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 ( 3 ) D e n t a l c o n d itions requiring follow- up which significantly interferes with a member's performance of duty, including going to sea, are disqualifying.

For submarine qualified per- sonnel, waiver requests must include a statement from the member's supervisor stating that the member is able to perform his or her job accurately and without difficulty. ( 3 ) A l l f o r m s o f c o r n e a l s u r g e r y a r e disqualifying except for PRK, LASEK, and LASIK. Waivers are not required for members who have had successful surgery if stable postoperative vision meets the criteria of MANMED article 15-106 paragraph (4)(d)(1) of this article a nd the following are met: ( a ) C a n d i d a t e s f o r s u b m a r i n e d u t y must have a 3-month waiting period following their most recent corneal surgery prior to their qualifying submarine duty examination. ( b ) F o r q u a l i f i e d s u b m a r i n e r s : 1 . P r i o r a u t h o r i z a t i o n f o r s u r - gery is required from the member's commanding officer. 2 . M e m b e r s m u s t b e o n s h o r e duty or in a shipyard or in-port maintenance period of at least 3 months and have at least 30 days remaining after surgery before any scheduled submarine opera-tions. 3 . A U M O i n t e r v i e w a n d medical record entry is required after completion of surgery before the member can return to submarine duty.

( 3 ) H i s t o r y o f p n e u m o t h o r a x i s d i s q u a - lifying. Waiver may be cons idere d f or tra um atic or surgical pneumothorax if chest CT and pulmonology consultation support a waiver request. Waiver will not be considered for spontaneous pneumothorax. ( 4 ) I n d i v i d u a l s w i t h e i t h e r p o s itive TST or positive IGRA (e.g., QuantiFERON-TB Gold test) must be removed from submarine duty pending further clinical investigation. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-93 Article 15-106 Manual of the Medical Department ( a ) A c t i v e t u b e r c u l o s i s d i s e a s e i s disqualifying; however, a waiver request will be considered upon completion of all treatments resulting in sterilization of the infectious lesion, and demonstra- tion of normal pulmonary function. Individuals diag-nosed with LTBI are non-infectious, but have the potential to progress to active disease. ( b ) L T B I i s d i s q u a l i f y i n g f o r c a n - didates. A waiver request will be considered upon completion of all indicated LTBI therapy. ( c ) S u b m a r i n e - q u a l i f i e d p e r s onnel diagnosed with LTBI will be evaluated by their attending UMO. The UMO may return the individual to submarine duty, without waiver, 8 weeks after ini- tiating LTBI antibiotic therapy, provided the indivi- dual remains asymptomatic, is compliant with ther-apy and has no adverse reaction to the medication(s). Completion of treatment must be documented in the medical record. ( f ) Cardiovascular. Any condition that chronically, intermittently, or potentially impairs ex- ercise capacity or causes debilitating symptoms is disqualifying. Specific disqualifying conditions in- clude, but are not limited to: ( 1 ) C a r d i a c d y s r h y t h m i a ( s i n g l e e p i - sode, recurrent, or chronic) other than 1st degree heart block. ( 2 ) A t h e r o s c l e r o t i c h e a r t d i s e a s e . ( 3 ) P e r i c a r d itis, chronic or recurrent. ( 4 ) M y o c a r d i a l i n j u r y o r h y p e r t r o p h y o f any cause.

( 7 ) H i s t o r y o f d e e p v e n o u s t h r o m b o s i s is disqualifying. Waivers may be considered for un- complicated cases after com pletion of anti-coagula- tion therapy and 6 months without recurrence off medication. Cases complicated by pulmonary embol-ism or predisposing coagulation disorder (Protein S or Protein C deficiency, Factor V Leiden, etc.) will not be considered for waiver. ( 8 ) U n c o n t r o l l e d h y p e r t e n s i o n , d u e either to the refractory nature of the disease or patient non-compliance, is disqualifying. Hypertension which requires complex medical management to achieve control is disqualifying. Hypertension associated with evidence of end organ d amage is disqualifying. ( 9 ) H i s t o r y o f c a r d i a c s u r g e r y o t h e r than closure of patent ductus arteriosus in infancy. ( 1 0 ) H i s t o r y o f v e n t r i c u l a r p r e - e x c i t a - tion conditions, to include, but not limited to Wolf- Parkinson-White and Lown-Ganong-Levine synd-romes. Waiver may be considered for personnel who have undergone successful ablation of accessory pathway(s) and are recommended for return to sub- marine duty by a cardiologist and the attending UMO. Waivers will also be considered for personnel with a ventricular pre-excitatio n electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern who: ( a ) H a v e n e v e r h a d a d o c u m e n t e d dysrhythmia. ( b ) H a v e n e v e r h a d a s y m p t o m a t i c episode consistent with a paroxysmal dysrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, loss of consciousness).

( g ) Abdominal Organs and Gastrointes- tinal System ( 1 ) A h i s t o r y o f g a s t r o i n t e s t i n a l t r a c t disease is disqualifying. Sp ecific examples include: ( a ) H i s t o r y o f g a s t r o i n t e s t i n a l b l e - eding, including positive occult blood testing, if the cause has not been corrected. Minor rectal bleeding from an obvious source (e.g., anal fissure or external hemorrhoid) does not require immediate disquali- fication, but must be evaluated and treated by a physician as soon as practicable. ( b ) H i s t o r y o f o r g a n p e r f o r a t i o n . ( c ) H i s t o r y o f c h r o n i c o r r e c u r r e n t diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting.

( 1 0 ) G a s t r o e s o p h a g e a l r e f l u x d i s e a s e that is adequately controlled and under appropriate follow-up care is not disqualifying. ( 1 1 ) E o s i n o p h i l i c e s o p h a g itis is disqual- ifying. ( 1 2 ) H i s t o r y o f a b d o m i n a l s u r g e r y i s n o t disqualifying, once released by the attending surgeon and provided there are no p ersisting complications. ( a ) A h i s t o r y o f u r o lithiasis is dis- qualifying for candidates. ( b ) A f i r s t e p i s o d e o f u n c o m p l i - cated urolithiasis is not disqualifying for submarine designated personnel provided that there is no pre-disposing metabolic or anatomic abnormality and there are no retained stones. The attending UMO may return the member to full duty after resolution of symptoms and a thorough evaluation, including a urology consultation. ( c ) A f i r s t e p i s o d e o f u r o lithiasis associated with a metabolic or anatomic abnormality is disqualifying. Waiver may be considered based upon elimination of stones and evidence of correction of the associated abnormality. ( d ) R e c u r r e n t u r o lithiasis is dis- qualifying. A waiver w ill not be considered. ( e ) R a n d a l l ' s p l a q u e s a r e n o t d i s - qualifying.

( f ) P r e g n a n c y i s n o t d i s q u a l i f y i n g , but the pregnant submariner may not get underway on a submarine for the duration of the pregnancy. After a pregnancy, the submariner may not get underway on a submarine until cleared by her attending maternity care provider and UMO. ( i ) Endocrine and or dietary modification is disqualifying. Can- didates will not typically be recommended for waivers except those with well-controlled hypothyroidism. Specifically: ( 1 ) D i a b e t e s m e l l i t u s i s d i s q u a l i f y i n g ( a ) D i a b e t e s m e l l i t u s r e q u i r i n g i n - sulin is disqualifying and will not be considered for a waiver. ( b ) D i a b e t e s m e l litus controlled without the use of insulin is disqualifying. Waiver requests must include documentation of current med- ications, current hemoglobin A1C level, and docu- mentation of the presence or absence of any end organ damage. ( 2 ) P r e - d i a b e t i c c o n d itions requiring treatment with medicati on are disqualifying. ( 3 ) G o u t t h a t d o e s n o t r e s p o n d t o t r e a t - ment is disqualifying. ( 4 ) S y m p t o m a t i c h y p o g l y c e m i a i s d i s - qualifying.

( 6 ) H y p o g o n a d i s m o r o t h e r c o n d itions requiring ongoing use of exogenous testosterone or testosterone analogs are disqualifying. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 93b Article 15-106 Manual of the Medical Department ( j ) Musculoskeletal ( 1 ) C o n d itions resulting in decreased strength, decreased range of motion, or pain sufficient to interfere with ready movement about a submarine or performance of duties are disqualifying. ( 2 ) D i s o r d e r s c a u s i n g a p e r s o n t o b e excessively prone to injury are disqualifying. ( 3 ) A n y d i s o r d e r t h a t p r e c l u d e s q u i c k movement in confined spaces or inability to stand or sit for prolonged periods is disqualifying. ( k ) Psychological and Cognitive. P s y c h o- logical fitness for submarin e duty must be carefully and continuously evaluated in all submarine desig- nated personnel. It is imperative that individuals working in this program have a very high degree of reliability, alertness, and good judgment. Any current or history of a diagnosis as defined by the current version of the DSM, unless explicitly excepted , is disqualifying, to include: ( 1 ) C u r r e n t o r h i s t o r y o f d e l i r i u m , dementia, amnestic and other cognitive disorders, mental disorders due to a general medical condition, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, somato- form disorders, factitious disorders, dissociative dis- orders, eating disorders, and impulse-control dis-orders not elsewhere classified are disqualifying. ( 2 ) Current or history of mood dis- order and/or anxiety disorders (including adjustment disorders lasting longer than 90 days) as listed in the DSM is disqualifying, but may be considered for a waiver once the Service member's condition is stable and asymptomatic. ( a ) C a n d i d a t e s , w h o s e t r e a t m e n t includes psychopharmaceuticals, are disqualified and not eligible for a waiver until such medications are no longer required to achieve asymptomatic stability. ( b ) S u b m a r i n e d e s i g n a t e d i n d i v i - duals, whose treatment includes ongoing use of selected psychopharmaceuticals, may be considered for waiver, provided all of the following stipulations are met: 1 . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r m u s t initially be evaluated by a DoD-clinically privileged psychiatrist. 2 . T h e c o n d ition must be categorized as stable, res olved, or in remission. 3 . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r m u s t have access to the recommended level of follow-up with their mental health provider and primary care manager (PCM). For submarine duty personnel, the condition must be stable enough to allow follow-up solely with an Independent Duty Corpsman for up to 6 months at a time. 4 . M e d i c a t i o n s p e c i f i c s . S S R I and SNRI class medications, as well as bupropion, are well tolerated, with minimal side effects and generally amenable for waiver. Other medications may be con- sidered on a limited, case-by- case basis. It is expected that starting medication, titrating up to the optimum dosage, assessing for efficacy, side effects, and dem- onstrating stability will require about 3 months; however some medications with short biological half-lives may require less time. The UMO must certify, when recommending a waiver, that: i . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r ' s underlying condition is well-controlled (asympto- matic) on the current dosage of medication. i i . T h e S e r v i c e m e m b e r is on a stable dosage of medication (i.e., no dose change in the 30 days prior to waiver submission). iii. The Service member demonstrates clinical stability without any military duty performance-impairing side effects. This ass- essment should also be specifically addressed by the individual's command endorsement. 5 . M o o d d i s o r d e r s o r a n x i e t y disorders (including adjustment disorders) compli- cated by suicidal behaviors. i . I n d i v i d u a l s w h o h a v e experienced suicidal ideation in conjunction with their mood and/or anxiety disorder (including adjustment disorders) may still be considered for a psycho-pharmaceutical use waiver in conjunction with a waiver for their underlying psychological condition and their suicidal behavior. i i . I n d i v i d u a l s w h o h a v e displayed suicidality in the form of a suicidal gesture or suicide attempt, as defined by a mental health professional, will not be eligible for a psycho- pharmaceutical use waiver. A waiver to return to submarine duty after a suicide gesture or attempt will require cessation of medication use in conjunction with complete resolution of their condition, in addi- tion to a recommendation from a mental health provider and the UMO. 15-93c Cha nge 164 22 May 2 018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 ( 3 ) P o s t - p a r t u m d e p r e s s i o n o f l i m i t e d duration is not normally disqualifying for submarine duty. Cases which resolve quickly, within the 12- week maternity leave peri od, may be found fit for submarine duty by the attending UMO. Cases of longer duration and/or requiring psychopharmaceu- tical use or involving suicidality are disqualifying and waiver will be considered afte r complete resolution of symptoms. ( 4 ) D i s o r d e r s u s u a l l y f i r s t d i a g n o s e d i n infancy, childhood, or adolescence, are disqualifying if they interfere with safet y and reliability or foster a perception of impairment. ( a ) C u r r e n t ADHD which requires medication to control symptoms, is disqualifying, but a history of ADHD which resolved greater than 1 year prior to military service is not disqualifying. ( b ) C o m m u n i c a t i o n d i s o r d e r s , i n - cluding but not limited to any speech impediment which significantly interferes with production of speech, repeating of commands, or allowing clear verbal communications, are disqualifying. ( c ) S l e e p d i s o r d e r s , w h i c h r e s u l t i n daytime fatigue, somnolence or inattention, are dis- qualifying. ( 5 ) G e n d e r d y s p h o r i a . T r a n s g e n d e r i n - dividuals with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, with no other comorbidities, may be returned to submarine duty upon the written recommendation of the attend- ing UMO and mental health professional without further recourse to the waiver process. Transgender individuals who have been determined to not have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria merely require docu-mentation of that fact in their medical record. Actual gender transition, involving medications and treat- ments, must be considered separately as to the inter-ventions respective impacts on the individual's suit- ability for submarine duty. ( 6 ) P e r s o n a lity disorders are disquali- fying for submarine duty candidates. For submarine qualified personnel, personality disorders may be ad-ministratively disqualifying if they are of significant severity as to preclude safe and successful perform- ance of duties. In these cases, administrative process-ing should be pursued per the Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN). ( 7 ) A d j u s t m e n t d i s o r d e r s a n d b r i e f s i t - uational emotional distress , such as acute stress reac- tions or bereavement, are not normally disqualifying. Individuals with these conditions must be evaluated by the attending UMO, in conjunction with formal mental health evaluation. In cases which resolve completely within 90 days, individual may be found fit submarine duty by the attending UMO. Conditions lasting longer than 90 days are disqualifying; a waiver may be considered after complete resolution of symptoms. ( 8 ) S u i c i d a l B e h a v i o r s ( a ) H i s t o r y o f s u i c i d a l g e s t u r e o r attempt is disqualifying. These situations must be taken very seriously and require formal evaluation by a mental health provider. Waivers will be considered based on the underlying condition as determined by the attending UMO and mental health provider. Any consideration for return to duty must address whether the Service member, in the written opinions of the attending UMO and mental health provider, can return successfully to the specific stresses and environment of submarine duty. ( b ) S u i c i d a l i d e a t i o n ( S I ) , w h e t h e r active or passive, is a significant risk factor for suicide and is associated with several mental health diagnoses. Any individual with SI requires a thorough suicide risk assessment by mental health provider. However, SI is a symptom rather than a diagnosis. As such, if the individual does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a disqualifying condition, then the individual may be return to submarine duty upon the written recomm- endation of the attending UMO and mental health pro- vider without further recourse to the waiver process. ( 9 ) H i s t o r y o f s e l f - m u tilation, includ- ing but not limited to cutting, burning, and other self-inflicted wounds, is disqualifying whether occurring in conjunction with suicidality or as an abnormal coping mechanism. Waivers will be considered based on the underlying condition, and its complete resolution, as determined by the attending UMO and mental health provider. ( 1 0 ) Disorders relating to Substance Use (SUD) ( a ) History of SUD is medically disqualifying for all submarine candidates. Waiver requests must include documentation of successful completion of treatment and aftercare. ( b ) All submarine qualified per- sonnel with SUD will be managed administratively per OPNAVINST 5355.3 series and do not require medi-cal disqualification unless a medically disqualifying diagnosis is present in addition to SUD. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 93d Article 15-106 Manual of the Medical Department ( c ) I llicit drug use, historical or current, will be manage administratively per OPNAV- INST 5355.3 series, SECNAVINST 5300.28 series, other app licable directives. ( 1 1 ) H i s t o r y o f o t h e r m e n t a l d i s o r d e r s not listed above, which, in the opinion of the UMO, will interfere with or prevent satisfactory performance of submarine duty is disqualifying. ( 1 2 ) A n y u s e o f p s y c h o p h a r m a c e u t i c a l s for any indication within the preceding year is disqualifying. For the purpo se of this article, \"psycho- pharmaceutical\" is defined as a prescription medica- tion whose primary site of activity is the central nervous system (CNS). This includes, but is not tics, cessation agents other than nicotine, DEA scheduled medications, and bipolar agents. Note: Many non-psychiatric medications possess psychophar- maceutical properties and are A s p e r p o l i c y d e f i n e d i n M A N - MED article 15-106, paragraph (4)(k)(2)(b) of this article, waivers will be considered for ongoing clinical treatment of mood and anxiet y disorders with specific medications. ( b ) F o r m e d i c a t i o n s w i t h o n l y i n c i - dental activity (i.e., minor side effects occasionally observed in some individuals taking these medica-tions) in the CNS, waivers will be considered on the basis of demonstrated stability of a stable dosage, no impairing side effects impacting duties, and favorable endorsement by a mental health provider, UMO and the individual's command. The command endorse- ment must attest to both the individual's functionality and criticality to mission. ( c ) W a i v e r s w ill be considered, in selected cases, for ongoing use of psychopharma- ceuticals to treat non-psychiatric conditions. Requests for such waivers must meet a high threshold of documentation; waivers will be considered on the basis of demonstrated stability of a stable dosage, no impairing side effects impacting duties, and favorable endorsement by a mental health provider, UMO, and the individual's command. The command endorse-ment must attest to both the individual's functionality and criticality to mission. ( d ) W a i v e r s w ill be considered, upon discontinuation of psy chopharmaceuticals, after a period of time considered s ufficient to metabolize or eliminate the medication from the individual's body (generally, five biological half-lives, less for single dose or transient courses of treatment). The mental health provider and UMO must specifically comment on the presence or absence of any withdrawal, dis- continuation rebound, or other such symptoms attribu- table to the episode of psychopharmaceutical use. Individuals who experience any of these symptoms must be symptom free for 60 days before a waiver will be considered. ( e ) U s e o f a n y D E A S c h e d u l e I drug for any reason, including religious sacraments, is disqualifying. ( f ) Exceptions. Zolpidem (Am- bien) prescribed for jet lag, medications prescribed or administered for facilitation of a medical or dental surgery or procedure, narcotic and synthetic opioid pain medications prescribe d for acute pain manage- ment, anti-emetics for acute nausea, and muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine or diazepam) for acute musculoskeletal spasm and/or pain are not disqualifying. Acute treatment is limited to 2 weeks of continuous medication usage. Episodic use of sero-tonin receptor agonists (\"triptans\"), disqualifying. ( l ) Neurologic. Any chronic or recurrent condition resulting in abnormal motor, sensory, or autonomic function or in abnormalities in mental status is disqualifying. ( 1 ) M i g r a i n e ( o r o t h e r r e c u r r e n t h e a d - ache syndrome) which is frequent and debilitating, or is associated with changes in motor, sensory, auto- nomic, or cognitive function is disqualifying. ( 2 ) C u r r e n t s e i z u r e d i s o r d e r o r h i s t o r y of a seizure after the 6th birthday is disqualifying. Waiver requests must include mitigating circum-stances if any, complete seizure and environment description, pertinent family history, and neurological evaluation. Member must be at least 2 years seizure free without medication before waiver will be considered. Waiver may be considered earlier for isolated seizures of known cause (e.g., toxic, infec- tious, post-traumatic). 15-93e Cha nge 164 22 May 2 018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 ( 3 ) P e r i p h e r a l n e u r o p a t h y d u e t o s y s - temic disease is disqualifying. Impingement neuro- pathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome) is not dis- qualifying if a surgical cure is achieved. Small, iso- lated patches of diminished sensory function are not disqualifying if not due to a systemic or central pro- cess, but must be thoroughly documented in the health record.

( m ) Skin (1) Any skin disease, including pilo- nidal cysts, which may b e aggravated by the sub- marine environment or inter fere with the performance of duties is disqualifying until resolved. (2) Acne vulgaris, which is nodulo- cystic or severe, is disqualifying but may be waived with successful treatment. For the purposes of this publication, isotretinoin (A ccutane) is considered a psychopharmaceutical and the provisions of MAN-MED article 15-106, paragraph 4(k)(11) apply. ( 3 ) P s o r i a s i s , eczema, recurrent rashes, or atopic dermatitis that may be worsened by the submarine environment to the extent that function is impaired or unacceptable risk of secondary infection is incurred are disqualifying. ( 4 ) A h i s t o r y o f s k i n c a n c e r ( i n c l u d i n g malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma) is disqualifying. A waiver may be considered after definitive treatment is completed; in some instances, definitive treatment may be limited to surgical ex- cision with clear margins. Actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma are not disqualifying provided either is adequately treated and the member is considered fit for submarine duty by a dermatologist and the attending UMO. ( n ) Miscellaneous ( 1 ) C h r o n i c v i r a l illnesses, except those limited to skin, which pose any risk of contagion are disqualifying. ( 2 ) C a n c e r t r e a t m e n t ( e x c e p t s k i n c a n - cer, per MANMED article 15-106, paragraph (4)(m) (4)) within the preceding year is disqualifying.

Any require- ment for a medication that necessitates close moni-toring, regular tests, refrigeration, or parenteral ad- ministration on a biweekly or more frequent basis is disqualifying. ( 5 ) Standards for Pressurized Submarine Escape Training (PSET). This provides guidance on the medical screening to be completed within 72 hours prior to undergoing PSET. These standards and procedures are intended to identify those trainees at increased risk of gas embolism and barotrauma and to exclude them from PSET. Any condition that may be worsened by the hyperbaric environment is con- sidered disqualifying for PSET. (a) Candidates for PSET must meet sub- marine duty physical standards and have a valid sub- marine duty examination on record. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15-93f Article 15-106 Manual of the Medical Department (b) Failure to meet the physical standards for PSET does not medically disqualify an individual from submarine duty\u2014these standards are no longer applicable once PSET is completed or discontinued. (c) Female candidates must be tested for pregnancy (urine HCG - dip) at the time of the medical screening. (d) If successfully screened medically, can- didates will complete a Driver Candidate Pressure Test, as defined by the U.S. Navy Diving Manual. Individuals unable to successfully complete the test will be excluded from PSET. (e) The additional physical standards for PSET follow: ( 1 ) Ear, Nose, and Throat ( a ) T h e s i n u s e s , d e n tition, dental fillings, and tympanic membranes must be examined, and the tympanic membranes must be mobile to valsalva. ( b ) C u r r e n t u p p e r r e s p i r a t o r y i n f e c - tion, upper airway allergies, middle or inner ear disease, or sinus disease is disqualifying. Trainees with recently resolved or resolving symptoms may proceed with PSET training upon a favorable oto- laryngeal examination by the attending UMO and objective evidence of norma l eustachian tube function (e.g., Diver Candidate Pressure Test). ( 2 ) Pulmonary ( a ) A u s c u l t a t i o n o f t h e l u n g s a n d inspection of the chest wall for abnormalities of movement, symmetry, and development must be performed.

( b ) P r e g n a n c y w i t h i n t h e p r e c e d i n g 6 weeks is disqualifying unless cleared for PSET by the attending women's health provider and UMO. (6) Waiver and Disqualification Requests. Waiver and disqualification requests are essentially the same personnel action. The distinction between 15-93g Cha nge 164 22 May 2 018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-106 the two lies with whether the originator is requesting that one or more physical standards be waived or not. The outcome of either request is a determination by the responsible waiver authority as to whether the physical standard(s) is waived or not. BUMED Un-dersea Medicine and Radiation Health (BUMED-95) serves as the senior medical reviewer for the waiver authority. (Certain waiver authorities have delegated adjudication of disqualification cases only to lower echelon commanders). (a) Requests for a waiver of physical stand- ards for submariners and submarine duty candidates must be sent from the member's commander, comm-anding officer, or officer in charge, via any applicable ISIC , or type commander (TYCOM) and BUMED-M95, to the appropriate Bureau of Naval Personnel code (enlisted - PERS-403; officers - PERS-421). (b) Originators must use the WEBWAVE 2 system to securely transmit cases (which contain HIPAA and PII-protected information). WEBWAVE 2 expedites case adjudication, allows tracking of cases under review and provides an accessible archive of closed cases. The system's business rules are designed to ensure that all necessary components of a request are submitted and requests are directed electronically via the proper routing sequence. BUMED-M95's guideline for timely internal review of routine waiver requests is 10 business days; urgent cases are acted upon with 24 hours of receipt. Access to WEBWAVE 2 is controlled by BUMED-M95. Commands needing to submit requests via WEBWAVE 2 but currently without access may contact BUMED-M95 directly to validate their requirement and obtain access/training. (c) For submariners, interim waivers may be granted by BUMED-M95 for periods of up to 6 months. ( 1 ) I n t e r i m w a i v e r s w ill not normally be considered for submarine duty candidates, in as much as their suitability must be established before the Navy incurs the expense of TAD orders and training. ( 2 ) B ecause interim waivers are not reviewed by the relevant waiver authority, BUMED- M95 will only grant interim waivers for relatively routine, frequently encountered conditions for which it is confident of the waiver authority's eventual disposition. In any case, interim waivers should be requested sparingly. (3) BUMED-M95 must receive the final waiver request prior to the expiration of any interim waiver which has been granted (typically 6 months). The final waiver request must include a substantive interval history pertinent to the condition under review. ( 4 ) I n d i v i d u a l s w i t h l a p s e d i n t e r i m w a i - vers are not physically qualified to get underway, stand watches aboard ship or perform maintenance on submarine systems until the final waiver request has been adjudicated. ( 5 ) B U M E D - M 9 5 ' s f i n a l r e c o m m e n d a - tion will be based on the member's condition at the time the final waiver request is made and may differ from the interim determination, if there has been a change in the member's condition or if information presented in the final request dictates a change in recommendation. (d) The required elements of a waiver or dis- qualification request are: ( 1 ) A s p e c i a l S F 6 0 0 , p r e p a r e d b y t h e UMO, requesting the waiver or disqualification, ref- erencing the specific standard for which the member is NPQ, a clinical synopsis including brief history, focused examination, clinical course, appropriate ancillary studies and appropriate specialty consulta- tions, followed by an explicit recommendation of \"waiver recommended\" or \"waiver not recommended\" with supporting rationale. Any ongoing aftercare must be identified. ( 2 ) D D F o r m 2 8 0 7 - 1 / 2 8 0 8 , a n n o t a t e d t o reflect individual's pertinent findings. This may either be a new submarine duty examination, a current submarine duty examination, annotated as necessary, or a focused examination documenting pertinent posi- tives and negatives. Circumstances will dictate which format is most appropriate. ( 3 ) C o p i e s o f o t h e r , p e r t i n e n t s t u d i e s supporting the waiver or disqualification. ( 4 ) C o p i e s o f p e r t i n e n t , s p e c i a l t y c o n s u l - tation clinical notes supporting the waiver or dis- qualification. ( 5 ) E n d o r s e m e n t b y t h e m e m b e r ' s c o m - manding officer or sponsoring unit. This endorsement should be substantive and address whether the con-dition, diagnosis, or current condition impairs the member's performance of submarine duty and is compatible with the operational environment. Note: Office codes, titles, and contact numbers are current as of the time of document release. It should be anticipated that these can and will change prior to the next revision of this article. 22 May 2018 Change 164 15- 93h Article 15 -107 Manual of the Medical Department 15-107 Explosives Motor Vehicle Operator and Explosives Handler Examinations and Standards (1) Background. Military personnel were pre- viously exempt from the requirements of the Commer - cial Motor Vehicle (CMV) Safety Act of 1986, and, in particular, from the physica l examination require - ments to obtain a commercial driver 's license. DoD policy requires civilian and military explosives motor vehicle operator s to meet physic al qualification re- quirement s as listed in 49 CFR \u00a7 391, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administr ation (FMCSA) regulations. Explosives are considered as \"hazardous material s\" with regard to FMCSA regulations related to vehicle operator medical certification . FMCSA regulations re - quire CMV driver physical examinations be perfor - med by licensed providers listed on the National Re - gistry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME). DON c ivilian CMV driver examinations are to be per - formed and reported to the FMCSA by NRCME providers. Military CMV driver examinations are not to be reported to the FMCS A, and may be performed by NRCME or non- NRCME certified providers; how - ever, non -NRCME providers must use D epartment of Transportation standards and be as knowledgeable about these standards as NCRME providers. BU- MEDINST 1500.30, Training and Certification Re - quirements for Healthcare Practitioners Performing Commercial Driver Examinations, describes responsi - bilities related to CMV examinations. (2) Scope. These special duty certification exam - inations are required for all military , DON civilian , and contract personnel assigned as explosives motor vehicle operators and explosives handlers . Medical examinations are not provided for civilian contractor personnel unless stipulated in contract terms or agree- ments. Contractors must obtain their examination and qualification d ocumentation (MCSA -5876) from a civilian provider who meets the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7391. Exceptions to the medical standard s for explosives motor vehicle operators are described in paragraph (8) of this article and require review via the waiver process established by the Naval Ordnance Safety and Security Activity (NOSSA) . The two qual - ifications as explosives motor vehicle operator and explosives handler ar e separate . Those qualified as explosives motor vehicle operators are concurrently qualified as explosives handlers . However, explosives handler qualification does not confer qualification for explosives motor vehicle operator . (3) Periodicity. The Explosives Motor Vehicle Operator (720) examination for both military and c ivi- lian workers is required every 2 years (or less, based on medical factors and 49 CFR \u00a7 391). For Explosives Handlers (721), the examination interval is no longer than 5 years for military and civilian employees, and no longer than 2 years for contract employees . (4) Concordance with other examinations . Ex- aminers using another comprehensive special duty examination, such as a Special Duty examin ation con - tained in MANMED c hapter 15, s ection IV, as the basis for th e explosives motor vehicle operator qualifi - cation must review the findings against the standards of this program as identified in 49 CFR \u00a7391. For example , qualification for submarine duty does not automatically imply qualification for explosives motor vehicle operator , as vision in both ey es is not a require - ment for submarine duty , but is required for explosives motor vehicle operation . (a) Personnel assigned to Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal units must meet the requirements of MANMED chapter 15, article 15 -102 (Diving Duty) as well a s the requirements delineated in this article . (b) Personnel assigned within the jurisdic - tion of United States Marine Corps (USMC) comm - ands must additionally meet requirements of Marine Corps TM 11240- 15, Motor Vehicle Licensing Offi - cial's Handbook. (c) Military members must meet the quali - fication standard s for any applicable programs de - scribed elsewhere in this chapter, in addition to the standards described here . (5 ) Reporting of Medical Status Changes . Per- sonnel assigned to duties as explosive s motor vehicle operators or explosives handlers are responsible to report to their supervisor or the medical department any physical or mental condition, or any change in their medical status, which may impact their ability to operate a motor vehicle or h andle explosives or other - wise pose a health or safety hazard to self, co -workers, or the public. Supervisors are responsible to direct such personnel to the appropriate medical department for evaluation. 15-94 Change 166 20 Dec 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -107 (6) Explosives Motor Vehicle Operators/DOT (720) (a) The purpose of this program is to ensure military members and DON c ivilians who operate vehicles or machinery which transport explosive s or other hazardous material on public roa ds are physi - cally qualified. Personnel who are explosives motor vehicle operators must com ply with the physical ex - amination requirements in 49 CFR \u00a7 391 and FMCSA guidance (and other DoD instructions , as applicable) . (b) Civilian p ersonnel who are medically qualified as explosives motor vehicle operators under this article must be issued only an FMCSA Medical Examiner's Certificate (MC SA-5876). Military per - sonnel who are medically qualified as explosives motor vehicle operators must be issued only an OPNAV 8020/6, Department of the Navy Medical Examiner 's Certificate . (c) Personnel must not handle explosives or operate a motor vehicle containing explosives unless physically qualified to do so. An explosives motor vehicle operator must have , on his or her person , the original or photographic copy of the appropriate com - pleted medical examiner's certificate stating that he or she is physically qualified. (d) Physical Qualifications . The physical qualification standards for explosives motor vehicle operators are set forth in 49 CFR \u00a7391.41, Subpart E, Physical Qualifications and Examinations . A person is physically qualified as an explosives motor vehicle opera tor if that person: (1) Has no loss of limb that impairs per - formance of assigned duties. (2) Has no impairment of: (a) A hand or finger which inter - feres with prehension or power grasping. (b) An arm, foot, or leg limitation which interferes with the ability to perform normal tasks associated with operating a CMV (or equiva - lent). (3) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus currently requir ing insulin for control. (4) Has no current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, or any other cardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syn - cope, dyspnea, collapse, or congestive heart failure. (5) Has no esta blished medical history or clinical diagnosis of a respiratory dysfunction likely to interfere with his or her ability to operate a CMV (or equivalent) safely. (6) Has no current clinical diagnosis of high blood pressure (over 140 systolic or 90 diastol ic) likely to interfere with his or her ability to operate a CMV (or equivalent) safely, according to guidelines contained in 49 CFR \u00a7 391.43 . Shorter qualification intervals apply to person s with high blood pressure . (7) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of rheumatic, arthritic, ortho - pedic, muscular, neuromuscular, or vascular disease which interferes with his or her ability to operate a CMV (or equivalent) safely. (8) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnos is of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a CMV (or equivalent). (9) Has no mental nervous, organic, or functional disease or psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with his or her ability to safely drive a CMV (or equivalent). ( 10) Has distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye separately and in both eyes together with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye, and the ability to recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber. (11) First perceives a forced whisper in the better ear at not less than 5 feet with or without the use of a hearing ai d or, if tested by use of an audio- metric device, does not have an average hearing loss in the better ear greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or without a hearing aid. (12) Does not use a controlled sub - stance or drug identified a s Schedule I, a n amphe - tamine, a narcotic, or any other habit -forming drug. Exception: A driver may use such a substance or drug, if the substance or drug is prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner who is familiar with the driver's medical history and assigned duties, and has advised the driver and provided to the examiner a written 20 Dec 2018 Change 166 15-95 Article 15 -107 Manual of the Medical Department statement certifying that the prescribed substance or drug will not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a CMV (or equivalent). ( 13) Has no current clinical diagnosis of alcoholism. Note. For Explosives Motor Vehicle Operators/DOT (720), additional specific quantifiable parameters for certain medical conditions can be found in the FMCSA medical program guidelines (http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules -regulations/administration/ medical.htm ). (7) Explosives Handlers (721). The purpose of this program is to ensure those who handle explo- sives, with or without industrial material handling equipment, are physically qualified. This examination may be conducted and signed by any Navy medical provider , including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and (for military members only) Independent Duty Corpsmen. (a) Physical Qualifications . Military explo- sives handlers must meet the qualifications for re - tention per section III of this chapter, and be evalu - ated per the guidance below. Civilian explosives hand - lers must b e evaluated per the following guidance ; the examiner must determine if the applicant or employee can safely perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. As with all medical qualification examinations, the explosives handler medical qualification exam ination is a risk - based assessment, not a diagnostic exam ination . For each applicant or employee, determining medical qualification requires a case- by-case, individualized assessment. In order to make an accurate medical qualification determination, the examiner must be knowled geable of the specific functional requirements and environmental factors of the job (per the job de - scription and the Optional Form (OF) 178, Certificate of Medical Examination) . A list of essential job func - tions common to most D ON explosives handler posi- tions is available at the NOSSA Web site, https://go. usa.gov/xQCnf . This list provides a sample of essen - tial job functions and is not all- inclusive of DON civilian positions. Local management should tailor these functions for each specific explosives handler job or job class as needed. (b) Per 5 CFR \u00a7339.304, once the provider has performed the initial history, physical exam, and required testing, he or she will make a determ ination as to the examinee's medical qualification. Occu - pational health providers having questions or needing assistance with unusual circumstances should contact their regional occupational medicine program mana - ger or human resources representative. ( c) For DON civilian explosives handler positions, OF 178, or other appropriate form will be used by the examining physician to document the exam and the assessment of medical qualification. The examiner will identify work restrictions or limitations, if a ppropriate, and may suggest practices, aids, or devices that would allow the individual to safely perform the essential job functions under rea - sonable accommodation. (d) The medical guidelines listed here are not all- inclusive. Many disorders not menti oned here can interfere with safe job performance and, therefore, would be medically disqualifying for explosives han- dler duties. Each case must be evaluated individually on its own merits. (e) The purpose of the explosives handler medical evaluation is to identify evidence of medical conditions that would reasonably be expected to im - pair the ability to safely perform the essential func - tions of the job. The examiner should focus on finding medical conditions associated with sudden or gradual incapacitation, visual or hearing deficiency, or signi - ficant orthopedic or psychiatric impairments. The following conditions potentially interfere with safe explosi ves handler job performance: (1) Visual Impairment . Unless more stringent vision requirements are specified on the OF 178, a n explosives handler should generally have a distant visual acuity of 20/40 or better in each eye separately and in both eyes tog ether with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye, and the ability to recognize colors adequately to perform explosives handler duties. Some explosives handler jobs may, by reason of the specific work place (i.e., physical layout, presence or absence of co -workers, signage, etc.), allow for poorer visual acuity or require greater visual acuity. (2) Hearing impairment that interferes with the ability to adequately communicate on the job and to sense hazards in the workplace. (3) Musculoskeletal condition that im - pairs performance of explosives handler duties. (4) Cardiac disease associated with po - tential for syncope, dyspnea, collapse, or heart failure (e.g., uncontrolled or sev ere hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, etc.). 15-95a Change 166 20 Dec 2018 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -107 (5) Respiratory dysfunction likely to in - terfere with safe performance of explosives handler job duties, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease (COPD) or severe asthma. (6) Metabolic conditions such as severe or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. (7) Neurologic conditions associated with sudden or gradual incapacitation, such as epi - lepsy or seizure disorders, severe migraine headaches, narcolepsy, history of severe head trauma, cranial defects, or multiple sclerosis. (8) Psychiatric, mental, nervous, org- anic, or functional disorder likely to interfere with safe performance of explosives ha ndler duties. Psychia - tric disorders that could affect the ability to perfor m essential job functions require additional evaluation. The presence of any of the following specific psychia - tric disorders, or a history of such signs or symptoms, may warrant further evaluation by a mental health professional. Other psychiatric disorders not listed here also may warrant further evaluation. (a) Delirium, dementia, amnesia , or other cognitive disorders. (b) Major depressive disorder. (c) Manic -depressive disorder (bi - polar). (d) Dissociative disorders. (e) Panic diso rder and other anxi - ety disorders (depending upon cause, duration, and severity of clinical expression). (f) G ambling disorder . (g) Disruptive, impulse -control, and conduct d isorders, to include, but not limited to kleptomania, pyromania, and inter mittent explosive disorder. (h) Schizophrenia and other psy- chotic disorders. (i) Personality disorders. (j) Intellectual disability . (k) Substance use disorder, to in - clude alcohol use disorder . (9) Use of any drug likely to impair alertness or safe explosives handler duty perform - ance. Current alcoholism or drug abuse should be considered disqualifying. (f) Periodicity . For DON military and civi - lian explosives handler s, the usual exam interval i s 5 years. Medical evaluation should be required more frequently if, in the interim, there are medical signs or symptoms suggestive of a medical condition that might interfere with the performance of essential job functions. Certification for less than 5 years is at the discretion of the examining provider. (g) Contract Explosives Handlers . Prior to being assigned to perform explosives h andler duties, all contract personnel will be required to undergo a medical examination; this will be at the contractor's expense unless specified otherwise in the contract. Contract explosives handlers must be examined by NRCME certified examiners, and must meet the medi - cal requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 391. This requirement also applies to contract personne l currently working in such positions. Contract explosives handlers must be issued a n FMCSA Medical Examiner's Certificate (MC SA-5876) , which may be valid for up to 2 years. (h) OPNAV 8020/6 will be issued to quali- fied military or civilian explosives handlers and is available at https://navalforms.documentservices.dla. mil/formsDir/_OPNAV_8020_6_4422.pdf . (8) Exceptions, exemptions, and w aivers of medical standards or physical requirements. Certain CMV drivers who do not meet all physical quali- fication criteria for a position may potentially be considered for exceptions, exemptions, or waivers. (a) Exceptions . An exception is issued by a commanding officer for unique, mission- critical sit - uations in which a military explosives motor vehicle operator is temporarily unable to meet all qualification criteria , but is expected, either because recovery is imminent or because of limited driving or handling requirements, to be able to adequately perform the mission -specific functions. For military explosives motor vehicle operators , a commanding officer may grant a n exception for limited special duty assign - ments to meet critical mission requirements , after consultation with an occupational medicine physician and the i nstallation's explosives safety office r. Excep - tions are valid for the duration of the mission or temporary impairment only. (b) Exemptions are issued by the FMCSA for CMV driver s with certain medical conditions, including insulin -dependent diabetes with excellent blood glucose control , monocular vision with oph- thalmologist or optometrist concurrence, and limb loss or impairment with a skill performance evaluation 20 Dec 2018 Change 166 15-95b Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15 -107 certificate. An exemption indicates a normally dis - qualifying condition is either well- controlled or compensated for such that the driver is capable of safely operat ing a CMV (or equivalent) . If a c ivilian is found not qualified during examination and pro- duces conflicting information from his or her private physician, 49 CFR \u00a7 391.47 provides criteria for sub- mitting documents to the Department of Transporta - tion for determination of qualification. Exemptions are valid for the duration of the certificatio n provided by the examiner (maximum of 2 years). (c) Waivers . For explosives motor vehicle operators, waivers are limited to a small group of drivers who participated years ago in a program de - scribed in 49 CFR \u00a7 391.64. W aivers are not currently issued for explosives motor vehicle operators or any CMV drivers. THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE WAS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 15-95c Change 166 20 Dec 2018 Article 15-108 15-108 Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Medical Examinations (I) To select for LCAC crew duty only the most physically and mentally qualified personnel and to exclude those who may become unfit because of pre\u00ad existing physical or mental defect. Certain pre\u00ad existing disease states and physical conditions that may develop are incompatible with the simultaneous goals of operational safety, mission accomplishment and individual health. LCAC physical standards were established and are maintained to fulfill these goals. (2) All applicants and designated personnel assigned to duty as crew members aboard any U.S. Navy air cushion vehicle must conform to the physical standards in this article. Designated LCAC personnel are considered PQ if they meet applicant medical standards, and demonstrate an ability to tolerate the stress and demands of opera\u00ad tional training and deployment. LCAC crew personnel are divided into three classes: (a) Class I. Crew personnel engaged in the actual control of the LCA,C. These include the craftmaster and engineer, the student craftrnaster, and the student engineer. (b) Class IA. Crew personnel engaged in navigation of the LCAC, but not responsible for actual control of the craft. These include the Navigator and the student Navigator. (c) Class IJ. Crew personnel not engaged in the actual control of the LCAC. These include the I oadmaster and deck mechanic, the student Joadmaster, and the student deck mechanic. (3) The LCAC physical examination is conducted to determine whether an individual is physically qualified to engage in designated LCAC duties. Upon completion of a thorough evaluation, candi\u00ad dates will be designated either: (a) Physically Qualified (PQ). (b) Not Physically Qualified (NPQ), Waiver Not Recommended. (c) NPQ, Waiver Recommended. Manual of the Medical Department (d) Temporarily Dlsq11alijjling Medical Con\u00ad ditions. For any temporary medical condition that precludes the LCAC crew member from the full performance of their LCAC duties, the following procedures shall be followed: ill .For medical conditions less than 90 days duration, a complete physical examination is not required, but a DD 2808 should be submitted that details the medical condition and all pertinent clinical infonnation. Ensure, as a minimum, blocks 1-16 and 42-46 are complete. ill For medical conditions that last between 90 days and 6 months or require a Limited Duty Medical Board, submit a complete physical examination per articles 15-4 and 15-5. ( 4) The scope of the physical examlqation will be adequate to effectively determine if the individual meets the appropriate medical standards. A complete physical examination shall be conducted per Section I of this Chapter. In addition, the following question shall he added to the DD 2808: \"Have you ever been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, alcohol abuse or dependency?\" Any positive answer shall be evaluated and documented. (a) LCAC crew applicants and designated personnel must meet the standards in article 15-109. (b) Conditions listed as disqualifying may be waived on an individual basis following article 15- 108. However, additional medical specialty evalua\u00ad tions may be required to confirm no. functional impairment is present or likely to occur. (5) Examination Requirements (a) All Class I (Crafimaster, Engineer) and Clasg IA (Navigator) applicants will undergo an initial applicant physical examination no more than I year before acceptance into phase l of the LCAC training program. In addition to an applicant physi\u00ad cal examination, all Class l applicants require psychomotor testing consistent with stand\u00ad ards established by Naval Operational Medicine Institute (Code 341 ), Operational Psychology Division. (b) Class II (Loadmas:ter Deck Mechanic) applicants must meet current medical standards for transfer and surface fleet duty following guidelines in the Enlisted Transfer Manual and MANMED article 15-!09 (as indicated). 15-96 Change 126 12 Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards ( c) Designated LCA C Personnel The extent of the examination is detennined by the type of duty to be perfonned, age, designation status, and any dis\u00ad qualifying medical conditions. If a crew member fails to )Ileet applicant standards and is found NPQ, yet stiU'\u00b7 wishes to perform LCAC duties,, a waiver may be.requested for each NPQ medical condition from tile Commander, Navy Personnel Command (NPC-409). In all such cases, the Surface Warfare Medici~e Institute (SWMI) shall be an addressee on the waiver request. lnfonnation about the medical condition or defect must be of such detail that reviewing officials should be able to make an informed assessment of the request itself, and also be able to place the request in the context of the duties to be performed. Authorization to request a waiver resides with the crew member, their commanding officer, or the examining or responsible medical provider. All waiver requests shall be eitherinitiated or endorsed by the applicant's commanding officer. (6) A.II changes in the status of Class I and IA LCA C drew members shall be immediately entered into the'iSpecial Duty Medical Abstract (NAVMED 6150/2)0 \"\u00b7 (7) Mandatory Requirements for LCAC Crew Members Medically Suspended from LCAC Duty. If an LCAC crew member is found to be NPQ, or is suspended from duty for greater than 60 days for any medical condition, a '~fitness to continue\" physical examination (completed forms DD 2807-1/2808) shal.l be completed before resuming duties. The report of that examination shall then be submitted to the SWMI for waiver consideration or recommendation for a medical board. Submit to SWMI a copy ofany examination permanently disqualifying designated LCAC personnel for archival purposes. (8) Medical Waiver Requests (a) Class I and Class IA LCAC Crew appli\u00ad cants mid Designated Personnel. Forward medical waiver requests for all Class I crew members and applicants to the Commander, Navy Personnel Command (NPC-409C) via SWMI. A copy of all approved waivers must be sent from NPC-409C to SWMI for archival purposes. Article 15-108 (b) Class JI LCAC Crew Applicants. For\u00ad ward medical waiver requests for all Class Il crew applicants to NPC-409C via the TYCOM medical officer, a copy of all Class 11 approved waivers must be sent from NPC-409C to SWMI for archival pur\u00ad poses. ( c) Medically-Suspended Designated LCA C Crew Members. Forward medical waiver requests for LCAC crew personnel who are medically sus\u00ad pended to the TYCOM medical officer via the chain of command. The TYCOM medical officer must evaluate and approve medical waiver requests for designated LCAC crew personnel (as opposed to LCAC crew applicants). A copy of the TYCOM medical officer's final decision concerning the waiver request will be forwarded to SWMI for archival pur\u00ad poses. (9) Periodicity of Examinations (a) All LCAC Class I and Class IA crew personnel will undergo a complete physical examination (see 15-4 and 15-5) within 30 days of their birthday at ages 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and annually thereafter. (b) All LCAC Class II personnel will undergo a complete physical examination within 30 days of their birthday every 5 years. (10) Reporting Attrition of LCAC Crew Per\u00ad sonnel. Development of an accurate personnel database is critical to the evolution of the LCAC crew selection and evaluation process, and of particular importance is information on the attrition ofLCAC crew personnel. Therefore report details on such attrition, medical and non-medical, to SWMI for analysis and archival purposes. 12Aug 2005 Change 126 15-97 Article 15 -109 Manual of the Medical Department 15-109 Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Medical Standards (1) The presence of any of the following will be considered disqualifying for all LCAC duties: (a) Ears, Nose, and Throat and Hearing (1) Seasonal aero -allergic disease of such severity to prevent normal daily activity (frequent bouts of sinus infection, nasal obstruction, ocular disease, etc.) not controlled with oral or nasal medication. (2) Recurrent attacks of vertigo or Meniere's syndr ome or labyrinthine disorders of sufficient severity to interfere with satisfactory per - formance of duties uncontrolled with medication. (3) Chronic, or recurrent motion sickness, uncontrolled with medication. (4) Untreated sleep apnea with cognitive impai rment or daytime hypersomnolence. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment may be permissible if it does not impact the function or safety of the vessel, unit, or crew. (5) Tracheal or laryngeal stenosis of such a degree to cause respiratory embarrassment on mod - erate exertion. (6) Unaided hearing loss which adversely effects safe and effective performance of duty in the Surface Fleet/LCAC environment. (7) Hearing Test. An audiogram is required for all LCAC applicants. It will be per - formed within 90 days of reporting to the assigned assault craft unit, and annually thereafter. Audio - metric loss in excess of the following limits for each frequency disqualifies the LCAC applicant. Desig - nated crew members already assigned to a craft shall be NPQ with waiver consideration. TABLE - MAXIMUM HEARING LOSS (ANSI 1969) Frequency (Hz) Better Ear (dB) Worse Ear (dB) 500 35 35 1000 30 50 2000 30 50 (8) Equilibrium. Use the self -balancing test (SBT). The examinee stands erect, without shoes, with heels and large toes touching. The examinee then flexes one knee to a right angle, closes the eyes then attempts to maintain this position for 15 seconds. The results of the test are recorded as \"steady,\" \"fairly steady,\" \"unsteady\" or, \"failed.\" Inability to pass this test for satisfactory equilibrium disqualifies the candidate. (b) Eyes and Vision (1) Any ophthalmologic disorder that causes, or may progress to, significantl y degraded visual acuity beyond that allowed in Section III of this Chapter. (2) Any disorder which results in the loss of depth perception or diminished color vision. (3) Night blindness of such a degree that precludes unassisted night travel. (4) Glaucoma, with optic disk changes, not amenable to treatment. (5) A history of refractive corneal surgery. Photorefractive keratectomy and laser in situ kerato - mileusis are permitted for the surface warfare community if vision is stable for at least 6 mo nths post procedure. Radial keratotomy is disqualifying but may be waived. Intracorneal ring implants are not approved and are disqualifying. (6) Distant Visual Acuity. Determine visual acuity by using a 20 foot eye lane with standard Sloan letter crowded eye chart letters and lighting. The Armed Forces Vision Tester (AFVT) is an acceptable alternative. If corrective lenses are necessary for LCAC duty, the LCAC crew personnel must be issued the approved lens -hardened eye wear for pro per interface with operational headgear (i.e., aviation frames/gas mask). A spare pair of corrective lenses must be carried at all times during operations. 15-98 Change 155 1 Feb 2016 Physical Examinations and Standards Article 15-109 (a) For Class I and IA personnel student applicants, minimum distant visual acuity shall be no less than 20/100 uncorrected each eye and correctable to 20/20 each eye. For previously designated Class I and Class IA personnel, minimum distant visual acuity shall be no less than 20/200 uncorrected each eye and correctable to 20/20 each eye. (b) For Class II personnel, there are no uncorrected limits, but shall correct following the standards in article 15 -35. If correction is necessary for LCAC personnel, corrective lenses shall be worn at all times during LCAC operations. (7) Near Visual Acuity. Either the AFVT or the near vision testing card shall be used to test near vision. A minimum near visual acuity of 20/200 in each eye, correctable to 20/20, is acceptable. For Class II there are no uncorrected limits. If correc- tion is necessary, corrective lenses shall be worn at all times during LCAC operations. (8) Refraction. Refraction of the eyes is required on the initial screening examination if the applicant requires corrective lenses to meet visual acuity standards. (a) For Class I and IA personnel , acceptable limits are +/ - 6.0 diopters in any meridian. Cylinder correction may not exceed 3.0 diopters. (b) Class II applicants shall meet accession standards for refraction (article 15 -35). (9) Depth Perception. This test should be performed using a Stereopter or, if unavailable, the AFVT lines A -D for Class I and lines A -C for Class IA and II. Pass -Fail standards per article 15 -85(1)(d) shall be followed. Normal depth perception (aided or unaided) is required. If visual correction is necessar y for normal depth perception, corrective lenses must be worn at all times during LCAC operati ons. (10) Oculomotor Balance. The vertical and lateral phoria may be tested with the horopter or with the AFVT. Any lateral phoria greater than 10 prism diopters is disqualifying (greater than 6 prism diopters requires an ophthalmologic evaluation). Any vertical phoria greater than 1.5 prism diopters is dis - qualifying and requires an ophthalmologic consulta - tion, for Class II, no obvious heterotopias or sympto - matic heterophia (NOHOSH) is acceptable. (11) Inspection of the Eyes. Follow guidelines within article 15 -85(1). The examination must include a funduscopic examination. Any patho- logical condition that might become worse, interfere with the proper wearing of contact lenses or function - ing of the eyes under fatigue, night vision goggle use or LCAC operating conditions shall disqualify all LCAC crew candidates. (l2) Color Vision. After 31 December 2016, all applicants for LCAC duty involving actual control or navigational observation duties must achieve at least 10 out of 14 on the Pseudo -Isochro - matic Plates (PIP). Personnel who were selected for actual control or navigational observation duties before the end of 2016 can continue to demonstrate adequate color vision by scoring 9/9 on the FALANT. (13) Night Vision. Any indicators or his - tory of night blindness disqualifies the applicants due to the importance of night vision and night vision supplemental to LCAC operations. (14) Field of Vision. Fields should be full to simple confrontation. Any visual field defect should receive ophthalmologic referral to pursue underlying pathology. (15) Intraocular Tension. Schiotz, non - contact (air puff), or applanation tonometry must be used to measure intraocular tension. Tonometric readings consistently above 20 mm Hg in either eye, or a difference of 5mm Hg between the two eyes, should receive an ophthalmologic referral for further evaluation. This condition is disqualifying until an ophthalmologic evaluation, including formal visual field determination has been compl eted. (c) Lungs and Chest Wall (1) Active asthma. (2) Chronic or recurrent bronchitis that requires repeated medical care. (3) Chronic obstructive pulmonary dis - ease, symptomatic with productive cough, history of recurrent pneumonia and/or dyspnea with mild exertion.

Manual of the Medical Department (I) Psychiatric. Because of the nature of the duties and responsibilities of each LCAC crew mem\u00ad ber, the psychological suitability of members must be carefully appraised. The objective is to elicit evi\u00ad dence of tendencies which might prevent satisfactory adjustments\u00b7\u00b7 to surface fleet life. A mental health review covering the psychiatric items in this article and any other pertinent personal history items, must be conducted by the examining medical officer. A psychiatric referral is not required to obtain this history. This general mental health. review will detennined the applicant's basic stability, motivation, and capacity to maintain acceptable performance under the special stresses encountered during LCAC operations. ill Any history of an Axis I diagnosis as defined by the current DSM is disqualifying (no waivers are typically given). Adjustment disorders are NPQ only during the active phase. (2) Axis II personality disorders, includ\u00ad ing mood, anxiety, and somatofonn disorders, and prominent maladaptive personality traits are dis\u00ad qualifying. They are waiverable if the individual has been symptom free without treatment for I year. ill Substance-related disorders (alcohol or controlled substance) are disqualifying. Upon satisfactory completion of an accepted substance abuse program, and total compliance with an after\u00ad care program, a waiver may be considered when I year has elapsed post-treatment. Continuation of a wavier would be contingent upon continued com\u00ad pliance with the after-care program and continuing total abstiflence. \u00ae Claustrophobia, questionable judg\u00ad ment or affect, poor coping skills, or any other evi\u00ad dence for poor adaptation to LCAC duty conditions, is considered disqualifying and requires a mental health consultation for waiver consideration. ill The taking ofa psychotropic medica\u00ad tion of low toxicity such as low dose selective seritonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRl) is not reason in itself for disqualification from service in the surface fleet force. Low-toxicity prescription psychotropics are acceptable as long as the underlying conditions will not become life or function threatening, will not pose a risk for dangerous disruptive behavior, nor 15-102 Change 126 12Aug 2005 Physical Examinations and Standards create a duty-limiting, medical evacuation, early return situation should medication use cease or the medication become ineffective. .(Q) It must be stressed that any considera\u00ad tion for return to duty in psychiatric cases must address the issue of whether the service member, in the opinion of the medical officer (unit or type command) and the member's commanding officer, successfully return to the specific stresses and environment of LCAC duty. (m) Systemic Diseases and Miscellaneous Conditions. Any acute or chronic condition that affects the body as a whole and interferes with the successful performance of duty, adversely impacts the member's safety, or presents a hazard to the member's shipmates or the mission: ill Spondylopathy. ill ;~arcoidosis (progressive, not responsive to theiapy or with severe or multiple organ involvement).' \u00b7 (;ll Cancer treatment within 5 years (except testicular, cervical or basal cell).

(d) Cerv ical Ca ncer Screeni ng: Each patient should be evaluated at her annual examination to see if she is due for cervical cancer screening, as this test is no longer needed annually in most wom en. The following subparagraphs and attached charts summarize the recommended cervical cancer screening schedule. Cervical cancer screening is defined as the use of the pap -test and/or Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) -test to identify pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions of the female cervix. Once a patient has an abnormal result, she will be referred for evaluation and surveillance until cleared to return to routine screening . Detailed guidan ce is available as www.asccp.org . (1) First scr een. Cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21 years. Women younger than 21 years should not be screened regardless of the age of sexual initiation or the presence of other behavior -related risk factors . ( 2) Women ages 21-29. Cerv ical cytology alone should be performed every 3 years for wom en betw een 21 and 29 y ears of ag e. HPV testing should not be used for screening in this age group . (3) Women age s 30 and older. Women 30 years and older should be screened every 5 years by cytology and HPV co -testing (preferred) or every 3 years by cytology alone if HPV testing is not available. (4) Additional Risk Factors . Wom en with the following r isk factors may require more f requen t cervical cytol ogy scr eening: (a) Women who are inf ected with the hu man immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should have cervical cytology screening twice in the first year afte r diagnosis and a nnual ly there- after.

Regular screening is defined as screening every 3 years with cytology alone or 5 years with cytology and H PV co -testing depending on the patient's age group . (5) Women who have had a total hysterectomy (cervix removed ) and have no history of CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS, or cervical cancer can discontinue cervical cancer screening . Women who have had a total hysterectom y (cervix removed ), but who have a history of CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS, or cervical cancer should be screened with vaginal cytology alone every 3 years for 20 years after the initial post- treatment surveillance period . 15-106 Change 14 5 16 Dec 2013 Article 15- 112 Manual of the Medical Department (6) Women who have been immun - ized against HPV -16 and HPV-18 should be screen ed by the sam e regim en as non-immuniz ed women.

A pelvic exam consists of three parts: an external inspection, internal speculum exam, and an internal bimanual exam. (e) Breast Cancer Screening (1) Women age s 21 and up. Women should have an annual clinical breast exam, receive education about breast self -exam, and should be encouraged to follow -up if they detect persistent changes in their breast tissue. Additionally, if a woman reports other risk factors for breast cancer, such as a family history of breast cancer or has a personal history of breast cancer or other abnormal breast tissue, she shou ld be referred for further evaluation of her breast cancer risk. (2) Women age s 40-75. Clinical breast exam and screening mammography shoul d be performed annually. Note: Evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging. (f) Other Screenings. As indicated by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. (g) Immunization status.
