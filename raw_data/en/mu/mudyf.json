The purpose was to find research on the effect of interventions with user involvement, aimed at promoting se lf-efficacy or coping, for people with long-term health challenges. Method We have conducted two systematic lite rature searches; one to identify systematic reviews, and one to identify Nordic primary studies. We searched in several research databases up to March 5 th 2015. Two researchers have, independently, screened all titles and abstracts and extracted information from each re levant publication about the aim, population, intervention, outcomes, user involvement, method and the authors' conclusions. We have not analysed or quality assessed the included systematic reviews or primary studies. Results Search for systematic reviews Out of a total of 6900 referenc es, we included 43 systematic reviews The English term to describe what we here define as interventions to promote self-efficacy or coping, varies. In 21 of 43 systematic reviews the English term \"self-management interventions / programs / education\" is used In all the systematic reviews at least one of the included primary studies have a form of user involvement as part of the intervention. The user involvement is described by the authors in 12 of the 43 systematic reviews In 26 of 43 systematic revi ews the authors conclude that interventions with user involvement to promote self-efficacy or coping have a positive effect, in 13 of 43 uncertain effect, and in two of 43 little or no effect We have not analysed or quality assessed the included systematic reviews Title: Interventions with user involvement to promote self- efficacy or coping, for patients with long term health challenges ------------------------------------------ Type of publication: Systematic reference list A systematic reference list is the result of a search for relevant literature according to a specific search strategy. The references resulting from the search are then grouped and presented with their abstracts. ------------------------------------------ Doesn't answer eve- rything: - No critical evaluation of study quality - No analysis or synthesis of the studies - No recommendations ------------------------------------------ Publisher: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services ------------------------------------------ Updated: Last search for studies: March, 2015. 5 Summary Search for Nordic primary studies We identified two relevant Nordic pr imary studies out of a total of 3479 references One of the interventions with user involvement is a Norwegian patient education course for people with morbid obesity. Th e second is a Danish adaptation of the patient education program, \"Chronic Pain Self-Management Programme\" for people with chronic pain The effects of the interventions were measured using different outcomes, and in both studies, the authors re ported positive effects We have not analysed or quality assessed the included primary studies 6 Innhold Innhold SAMMENDRAG 2 SUMMARY 4 INNHOLD SveMed+ Cochrane Library 2013, management for older people: an integrative review\" (1) 2.

Anuruang 2013, \"Community-based interventi ons to promote management for older people: an integrative review\"(1) Aim: To review community programs promoting self-care or self-management for older people with chronic disease in Thailand. Population: Older people (65 years or older) in Thailand, but the authors included studies with participants in the age range 28-88 years. Intervention and comparison: The studies included in this review used a variety of self-care and self-management strategies. The most common intervention strategy was providing information to promote knowledge about their ill- ness and signs and symptoms. Comparison was usual care, waiting list or no intervention. Outcomes: No predefined. They report the outcomes presented in the included studies such as self-care/self- management behaviors related their chronic conditions, patient satisfaction, quality of life, severity of symptoms and health status. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The integrative review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer or lay people. Author's conclu- sion: Shared decision-making and mutual goal setting between interventionists and patients improved health behaviors and outcomes. Moreover, the flexibility to adopt the intervention to local character- istics demonstrated positive results. Relevance to clinical practice. Promoting effective self-care and self-management behaviors is critical to improving outcomes for chronic conditions. The tailor-ing and targeting of interventions appropriate to individuals and communities are likely to be most effective in leveraging behavior change. This review has identified that mutual goal setting im-proved health behaviors. The flexibility to adopt self-care interventions to community-based settings showed improved patient outcomes. 2. Attridge 2014, \" Culturally appropriate health education for people in ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus\" (2) Aim: To assess the effectiveness of culturally appropriate health education for people in ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Population: People over 16 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus from named ethnic minority groups resid- ing in upper-middle-income or high-income countries. Intervention and comparison: Intervention: The effects of culturally appropriate (or adapted) health education for ethnic minority communities with type 2 diabetes mellitus were considered, both separately and in comparison, with conventional diabetes health education. One of the interventions should be culturally appropri-ate to the intervention group or groups. The authors also considered interventions that compared two different types of culturally appropriate health education. 'Culturally appropriate' health educa-tion is defined here as education that is tailored to the cultural or religious beliefs and linguistic skills of the community being approached, taking into account likely literacy skills (Overland 1993). It could include adapting established health education to innovative delivery methods, such as using community-based health advocates, delivering the information to same-gender groups or adapting dietary advice to fit the likely diet of a particular community. Comparator: The authors anticipate that 'conventional' diabetes education varies from one country to another, also acknowledging the different models of health education interventions. Therefore the authors are defining 'conventional' diabetes health education as 'any mode of delivery of health education that does not take into account the cultural background and context of the individual or group to whom the intervention is directed.' Thus conventional diabetes health education should be the 'usual' health education offered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the country being in- vestigated. Educational intervention(s) could include any of the following: dietary advice; healthy lifestyle; information on smoking, exercise and weight reduction; and information on the use of screening services, foot care and self-monitoring of blood sugars and blood pressure. Outcomes: Important clinical outcome measures for diabetes health education include morbidity and mortality rates, incidence and progression of diabetic complications and improvements in patient empower- ment and health-related quality of life. However, the priority attached to these may vary, both among patients and within the healthcare system, fo r example, after the introduction of new guide- lines in diabetes care, new treatments for diabetes are provided, along with additional financial incentives for healthcare staff for improving care provided to patients with diabetes. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders/people. 42 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Author's conclu- sion: Culturally appropriate health education has short- to medium-term effects on glycaemic control and on knowledge of diabetes and healthy lifestyles. With this update (six years after the first publica-tion of this review), a greater number of RCTs were reported to be of sufficient quality for inclusion in the review. None of these studies were long-term trials, and so clinically important long-term out- comes could not be studied. No studies included an economic analysis. The heterogeneity of the studies made subgroup comparisons difficult to in terpret with confidence. Long-term, standardised, multi-centre RCTs are needed to compare different types and intensities of culturally appropriate health education within defined ethnic minority groups, as the medium-term effects could lead to clinically important health outcomes, if sustained. 3. Baradaran 2010, \" Effectiveness of Diabetes Educational Inte rventions in Iran: A Systematic Re- view\"(3) Aim: To conduct a systematic review of reports published a bout educational interv ention on Iranian pa- tients with diabetes Population: Iranian patients with diabetes. Intervention and comparison: Education of patients with diabetes is considered a fundamental aspect of diabetes care and aims to empower patients by improving knowledge and skills. Structured educational programs for diabe-tes self-management are often multifaceted interventions, providing patients with information not only about diabetes but also management issues such as diet, exercise, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and medication use. They could be individual or group based. The authors in-cluded studies with multicomponent interventions only if the effects of the educational details could be examined separately. Training interventions were classified based on the following categories: knowledge or information; lifestyle behaviors, including diet and physical activity; skill development, including skills to improve glycemic control such as SMBG and cardiovascular disease risk factors, as well as skills to prevent and identify complications (e.g., foot care); and coping skills (to improve psychosocial function), including interventions using stress management. Comparison not de-scribed, only referred to as \"control group\". Outcomes: Not predefined by the review authors. They report outcomes reported by the primary studies (such as HbA1c, biomedical outcomes, physical outcomes, hospitalisation, knowledge, quality of life etc.). User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer education. Author's conclu- sion: There are insufficient and conflicting findings to obtain any firm conclusions regarding diabetes edu- cation in Iran. However, the appropriate diabetes health education appears to have short-term effects on glycemic control and knowledge of diabetes. The heterogeneity of studies made sub-group comparisons difficult to interpret with confidence. There is a need for long-term, more rigorous methodology. It is also highly recommended to health policy makers in Iran that a special course for training diabetes educators be designed because it would enable them to tailor appropri-ate education intervention for people with diabetes. 4. Barnason 2012, \" An integrative review of interventions pr omoting self-care of patients with heart failure\"(4) Aim: To examine the interventions used to improve self-care of heart failure patients. The specific objec- tives were to examine the efficacy of interventions to improve heart failure self-care (self-maintenance and self-management behaviors) and patient-related factors such as knowledge about heart failure, self-efficacy for heart failure self-care (confidence) and beliefs regarding heart failure self-care. Population: Patients with heart failure Intervention and comparison: Interventions promoting self-care of patients with heart failure. Due to limited description of the pa- tient education provided in the studies, it was not possible to determine if the education was inclusive of all of the components as recommended by national guidelines of the Heart Failure Soci-ety of America. Comparison was described as \"usual care practice\". Outcomes: Not predefined by the review authors. They report outcomes reported by the primary studies (self- care maintenance and management behaviors, levels of knowledge pertaining to heart failure and heart failure related self-care, healthcare utilisation, quality of life, functional status, heart failure symptoms etc.). User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders or peer involvement. Author's conclu- sion: This integrative review of research uniquely contributes to the current state of knowledge of the effi- cacy and types of interventions used to promote self-care by patients with HF. Patient education for patients with HF may be improved by incorporating nationally recognised educational components. Furthermore, assessment of patient-related factors influencing self-care (e.g. knowledge, self-effi-cacy) by clinicians may be helpful. The use of cognitive-behavioral strategies to improve self-care and associated patient-related factors influencing self-care to augment HF patient education may be useful until further research can guide intervention specificity and dosage. 43 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews 5. Brady 2013, \"A Meta-Analysis of Health Status, Health Behaviors, and Health Care Utilization Out- comes of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program\" (5) Aim: The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the short-term (4-6 months) and longer-term (9-12 months) effect of the Stanford CDSMP. The authors examined changes in health behaviors, physical and psychological health status (including self-efficacy), and health care utiliza- tion reported in CDSMP studies in English-speaking countries. A secondary objective was to determine whether program effect differed by delivery mode. Population: People with various chronic conditions. Intervention and comparison: The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) in English-speaking countries. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a 6-week community-based, self-man-agement education program designed to help participants gain the confidence (self-efficacy) and skills to better manage their chronic conditions. It is taught by trained leaders who follow a struc-tured protocol and given to participants who have various chronic conditions. Developed at Stanford University. Comparison not described, only referred to as \"control group\". Outcomes: Health behavior, psychological hea lth status, physical health status and health care utilization. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on the intervention CDSMP which is based on the principle of peer-led or mediated group interventions. Author's conclu- sion: Small to moderate improvements in psychological health and selected health behaviors that remain after 12 months suggest that CDSMP delivered in small English-speaking groups produces health benefits for participants and would be a valuable part of comprehensive chronic disease manage-ment strategy. 6. Brown 2011, \"Patient education in the management of coronary heart disease (Review)\" (6) Aim: 1. To assess the effects of patient education compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity, health-related qu ality of life (HRQofL) and health care costs in patients with CHD. 2. To explore the potential study level predictors of the effects of patient education in patients with CHD (e.g. individual ve rsus group intervention, timing with respect to index event). Population: Adults who had suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), who underwent revascularisation (coronary artery bypass percutaneous trans luminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) artery stenting), or who had angina pectoris or CHD defined by angiography. Intervention and comparison: For the purposes of this review, patient education was defined as the following: (1) Instructional ac- tivities organised in a systematic way involving personal direct contact between a health professional and CHD patients with or without significant others: e.g. spouse , family member; (2) Delivered as an inpatient, outpatient in a community-based intervention setting or program; (3) In-clude some form of structured k nowledge transfer about CHD, its c auses, treatments or methods of secondary prevention; (4) Delivered in a face-to-face format, in groups or on a one-to-one basis. The authors also included alternative interactive methods of educational delivery such as \"tele- health\" (telephone, e-mail, Internet and teleconference between educator and patient). The authors included only study interventions that met all the above criteria. Comparison was in most studies \"usual care\". Outcomes: Primary outcomes included mortality and cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes included re- vascularisations, hospitalisations, quality of life, withdrawals, healthcare costs and cost- effectiveness. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders. Author's conclu- sion: The authors did not find strong evidence that education reduced all-cause mortality, cardiac mor- bidity, revascularisation or hospitalisation compared to control. There was some evidence to suggest that education may improve HRQofL and reduce overall healthcare costs. Whilst our find-ings are generally supportive of current guidelines that CR should include not only exercise and psychological interventions, further research into education is needed. 7. Carnes 2012, \" Effective Delivery Styles and Content fo r Self-management Interventions for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain A S ystematic Literature Review\" (7) Aim: The objective was to report the evidence for effectiveness of different self-management course characteristics and components for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Population: The primary condition was chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults (18 years or older). The authors defined chronic as pain lasting longer than 3 months. Intervention and comparison: Self-management Interventions. The authors defined a self-management program as a structured, taught, or self-taught course with distinct components principally aimed at patients (rather than car-ers) with the goal of improving the participants' health status or quality of life by teaching them skills to apply to everyday situations. The program had to contain at least 2 components from the follow-ing 5 groups identified and agreed by our steering group: psychological (including behavioral or 44 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews cognitive therapy), mind-body therapies (including relaxation, meditation, or guided imagery), physi- cal activity (including any form of exercise), lifestyle (such as dietary advice and sleep management), and pain education (such as understanding their condition and how to take medica-tion effectively). Comparison was waiting-list or usual care. Outcomes: Pain intensity, physical function, self-efficacy, global health, and depression. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay leaders. In about 13 % of the included studies the intervention was delivered by healthcare professionals and lay people, and in the intervention was 9 % were lay-led. Author's conclu- sion: These results provide some useful information to the clinician deciding what type of self-manage- ment approach might help patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Group-delivered courses with HCP input had potential to produce better outcomes than other types of courses. Longer courses did not necessarily give better outcomes. There was mixed evidence of effectiveness for the differ- ent course components. Serious consideration should be given to the development of short, group, and HCP-delivered interventions but more research is required to establish the most effective con-tent and cost-effectiveness. 8. Cartin 2010, \"Community etes self-management education\"(8) Aim: To analyse the research literature on the effects of community health workers on the outcomes of HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, lipids, and diabetes knowledge for people with type 1 or type 2 diabe-tes. Population: Community-dwelling adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Intervention and comparison: Community health workers in diabetes self-management education. Community Health Worker: A non-healthcare professional community-dwelling adult who interacts with clients with diabetes. He or she provides education, support, and serves as a link between healthcare professionals and cli- ents. (Community health workers were known by many titles including lay health workers, community health advocates, lay health educators, community health representatives, peer health promoters, community health outreach workers, peer support, indigenous healthcare workers, lay leaders). Comparison was \"standard provider care\". Outcomes: HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, lipids and diabetes knowledge. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on the definition of CHW (see Intervention and comparison). Author's conclu- sion: While the use of the community health worker programs showed promising outcomes, the existing evidence is insufficient and additional research is needed to determine its efficacy. In the future, community health worker interventions should be standardised creating consistent programs with consistent outcomes, and training for the community health workers. 9. Clark 2010, \"Educational and behavioral interventions for asthma: who achieves which out- comes? A systematic review\"(9) Aim: This review of interventions aimed at (a) describing the outcomes of clinical trials of asthma educa- tional and behavioral interventions undertaken by different types of providers in the past decade and (b) exploring differences in program components employed by them. Population: Children and adults with asthma. Intervention and comparison: Asthma educational and behavioral interventions. They may include self-management education and support, information giving, behavioral change techniques, and efforts to enhance communica- tion between the person with asthma and health care professionals. These diverse interventions have been provided by an equally diverse range of individuals from physicians to nurses, multidisci-plinary teams, pharmacists, and lay educators. Comparison not described, only referred to as \"control group\". Outcomes: Asthma symptoms, pulmonary function, medicine use, psychosocial factors, days absent from work or school, days of restricted activity due to asthma, self-management, self-efficacy, quality of life, emergency department use, hospital in-patient stays, and office visits. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay leaders/people. Author's conclu- sion: The extent to which and how different providers achieve asthma outcomes through educational and behavioral interventions is emerging from recent studies. Health care use and symptom control are evolving as the gold standard for intervention outcomes. Development of self-management and cli-nician-patient communication skills are program components associated with success across outcomes and providers. 10. Concha 2009, \" Review of Type 2 Diabetes Management Interventions for Addressing Emotional Wel l-Being in Latinos\" (10) Aim: (1) To investigate if type 2 diabetes management programs with Latino participants address emo- tional well-being in addition to the standard diabetes self-care behaviors and (2) to describe the approaches taken to improve psychological and diabetes management outcomes. 45 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Population: Not clearly stated, but primarily Latinos with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Intervention and comparison: Type 2 Diabetes Management Interventions. Intervention approaches varied across all 13 T2D management programs. The majority of the studies in this review took place in community health centers/ clinics and neighborhood centers/spaces (eg, churches or adult day care). Six studies re-ported using a psychocognitive theory as a framework for their intervention. Not all studies indicated that they used a specific theory; however, they did include cognitive outcomes common in most cognitive theories. Specific surface structure approaches reported in most of the interventions included the use of bilingual/bicultural materials and staff, the modification of materials to address low literacy, and the use of promotoras (ie, lay health workers) and peer leaders to relay infor- mation. The most common deep structure approaches included the assessment of diabetes health beliefs and highlighting the family as an important aspect of T2D management. In addition, some studies incorporated collective approaches toward T2D. Management by implementing group prob-lem solving, positive socializations, group discussions, and maintaining frequent contact with participants to maintain relationships. Comparison not described. Only referred to as 'control group'. Outcomes: Psychological outcomes (emotional and cognitive outcomes), behavioral outcomes (physical activ- ity, self-management etc.) and physiological outcomes (blood glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure). User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders. Author's conclu- sion: Few type 2 diabetes interventions address emotional well-being in Latinos. More attention has been directed toward designing culturally sensitive community-based programs for improving behavior and physical outcomes. Because some Latino groups believe that negative emotions cause diabe-tes and because depression and anxiety are associated with poor self-management, programs should address emotional well-being as an important aspect of diabetes management. 11. Coulter 2015, \"Personalised care planning for adults with chronic or long-term health conditions\"(11) Aim: The authors carried out this systematic review to find out whether a personalised approach, in which patients are encouraged to participate in setting goals and action plans and determining their support needs, leads to better outcomes than when these decisions are taken by health profession- als alone. Population: Adults (18 years or older) with any long-term physical, psychological, sensory, or cognitive condi- tion or combination of conditions affecting their health, treated in any setting. Intervention and comparison: Personalised care planning aims to ensure that individuals' values and concerns shape the way long-term conditions are managed. Instead of focusing on a standard set of disease management processes determined by health professionals, this approach encourages patients to select treat-ment goals and to work with clinicians to determine their specific needs for treatment and support. In personalised care planning, patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition(s), giving due consideration to both clinical tests and treatments and the practical, social, and emotional effects of their condition(s) and treatment(s) on their daily lives. They then engage in a shared decision-making process involving goal setting and action planning, focused on determining priorities, agreeing realistic objectives, solving specific problems, and identifying relevant sources of support. In some cases a family member, carer/caregiver or friend may also be included in the discussion. Management options and support needs under dis-cussion might include any or all of the following: clinical tests and treatments, self-management information, education or support, strategies for modifying health-related behaviours, managing stress, or solving practical problems. Comparison was usual care. Outcomes: Primary outcomes 1. Changes in health and well-being, including each of the following three dimen- sions measured separately: i) physical health: measured instrumentally (e.g. pressure, blood lipids, body mass index, HbA1c, urinary albumin, etc.) or by observation or self report (including symptom scales, pain scores). ii) psychological health: observation or self-report scales (e.g. de- pression or anxiety scores). iii) subjective health status: patient-reported scales (including health- related quality of life, fatigue, self esteem, coping, activities of daily living, etc.) or proxy reports (cli-nicians' observations or family member/carer reports). 2. Changes in patients' self-management capabilities or indicators relevant to those capabilities: measured by self reports or observations (knowledge of their condition and its treatment or management options, self efficacy, activation, confidence or perceived competence, and ability to access relevant support). We included validated measures where possible. Non-validated measures were recorded but excluded from the meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes 1. Changes in health-related behaviours: diet, exercise, smoking, use of relaxation techniques, self-management actions, condition-relevant self monitoring, adher- ence to treatment recommendations, attainment of personal goals. 2. Changes in use of formal 46 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews health services: number and length of hospital admissions, number of outpatient, emergency de- partment, or primary care visits, and, where recorded, effects on the costs of care. We also recorded any reports of harms or adverse events associated with personalised care planning. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer coaches. Author's conclu- sion: Personalised care planning leads to improvements in certain indicators of physical and psychologi- cal health status, and people's capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care. The effects are not large, but they appear greater when the intervention is more comprehen- sive, more intensive, and better integrated into routine care. 12. Dale 2012, \" What is the effect of peer suppor t on diabetes outcomes in adults? A systematic review\" (12) Aim: To systematically review evidence of the impact and effectiv eness of peer support in adults living with diabetes. Population: Adults diagnosed with and being treated for diabetes Intervention and comparison: Peer support interventions that aimed at improving the care or management of diabetes. A broad range of models of peer support have been described in the context of diabetes, including face-to-face management programmes, peer coaching, telephone-based peer support, and web- and email-based support. These models vary in the extent to which they offer one-to-one or group sup-port. They also differ in their focus, how they build on the shared knowledge and experience that peers can offer each other, and in the ways that they provide one or more of the following: 1. Emo- tional support, including expressions of care, encouragement, active listening, reflection, reassurance and usually the absence of criticism. 2. Appraisal support, including communication of information that is relevant to self-evaluation and the appropriateness of emotions, cognitions and behaviours; for example, motivation and encouragement to persist in problem solving. 3. Informa-tional support, including provision of knowledge relevant to problem solving. Comparison was usual or routine care, another intervention or delivery of intervention, referred to as 'control group' or not described. Outcomes: Not predefined by the review authors. They report the outcomes selected by the primary studies which include clinical outcomes (HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, symptoms of hypo- and hy-perglycaemia, weight/BMI or body fat, fatigue), health behavior outcomes (physical activity, glucose monitoring, diet, insulin therapy, clinic and communication visits), empowerment outcomes (self-efficacy, perceived barriers, knowledge), psychological outcomes (depression/health distress, per-ceived social support, acceptability). User involve- ment: Yes, the authors highlight this: \"The interventions varied in the extent to which peer support was in- tended as an adjunct to routine clinical care, or were less formal, user-initiated interventions that patients might selfselect or volunteer into. The importance of establishing a strong theoretical un-derstanding of how a complex intervention, such as peer support, causes change is recognized as a prerequisite to optimizing its design and implementation. In addition to addressing the issue, user involvement is, to some extent, a part of every intervention included in this review. Author's conclu- sion: Peer support appears to benefit some adults living with diabetes, but the evidence is too limited and inconsistent to support firm recommendations. There remains a need for further well-designed eval-uations of its effectiveness and impact. Key questions remain over its suitability to the needs of particular individuals, populations and settings, how best to implement its specific components and the sustainability of its effects. 13. Du 2011, \" Self-managemen t programs for chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions: A systematic review and meta-analysis\" (13) Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of self-management programs on pain and disability for chronic mus- culoskeletal pain conditions by systematic review. Population: Adults (18 years or older) with chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions include arthritis (OA, RA, or fibromyalgia), back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, etc., and the symptom of pain persists for more than 3 months. Intervention and comparison: Interventions that integrated systematic therapies into a self-management or self-care program were included. Qualified self-management programs should lay emphasis on following 8 essential elements: (a) self-efficacy building; (b) self-monitoring; de-cision-making; (e) problem-solving; (f) self-tailoring; (g) partnership between the views of patients and health professionals; and (h) community-based and close to home. What's more, only the trials in which interventions primarily focused on managing pain and minimizing disability were qualified for inclusion. Comparison was usual care or waiting-list control. Outcomes: Each eligible trial should take pain intensity and disability as its primary outcomes. Those trials in which pain and disability were not considered as primary outcomes of interest would be excluded. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay leaders/people. 47 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Author's conclu- sion: The encouraging evidence of this study indicates that it is recommended to provide self-manage- ment programs to adult patients with arthritis. Further research is needed on self-management for chronic back pain. Practice implications: Self-management is a safe, community-based and effec-tive way for patients with arthritis to manage pain and disability. Core skills of self-management should be delivered using multiple approaches. 14. Effing 2014, \" Self managemen t for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Review)\" (14) Aim: 1. To evaluate whether self management interventions in COPD lead to improved health outcomes. 2. To evaluate whether self management interventions in COPD lead to reduced healthcare utilisa- tion. Population: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD with symptoms and meeting agreed spirometry criteria. Intervention and comparison: Self management interventions were defined as structured interventions for individuals with COPD aimed at improvement of self health behaviours and selfmanagement skills. These interventions required at least an iterative process of interaction between participant and healthcare provider, and ideally also included formulation of goals and provision of feedback. Interventions with fewer than two contact moments were therefore excluded. Furthermore, at least two of the following com-ponents had to be part of the intervention: smoking cessation, self recognition and self treatment of exacerbations, an exercise or physical activity component, advice about diet, advice about medica- tion or coping with breathlessness. Content could be delivered to study participants verbally, as written material (hardcopy or digital) or via audiovisual media. An action plan was defined as a guideline for participants describing when and how to change medication in case of worsening COPD-related symptoms, indicating (the start of ) an exacerbation. Explicitly, interventions involv-ing solely participant education were excluded. Disease management programmes classified as pulmonary rehabilitation offered in a hospital or rehabilitation centre, as well as community- or home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programmes solely directed towards exercise, were also ex- cluded. Studies with usual care as a control group and those with an active intervention as a control group were included in this review. Comparison was usual care or active intervention. Outcomes: Primary outcomes 1. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores. 2. Number of hospital admis- sions. Secondary outcomes 1. Hospitalisation days. 2. Number of exacerbations requiring emergency department visits. 3. Use of (other) healthcare facilities. 4. Number of exacerbations re- quiring a course of oral corticosteroids or antibiotics. 5. Use of rescue medication. 6. Symptom scores. 7. Anxiety and depression. 8. Self-efficacy. 9. Days lost from work. 10. Lung function. 11. Exercise capacity. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer leader. Author's conclu- sion: Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improved health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, a reduction in respiratory-related and all cause hospital admissions, and improvement in dyspnoea asmeasured by the (m)MRC. No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters. However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures makes it difficult to formulate clear recom-mendations regarding the most effective form and content of self management in COPD. 15. Fitzpatrick 2013, \" Problem solving interventions for diabetes self-management and control: A systematic review of the literature\"(15) Aim: Problem solving is deemed a core skill for patient diabetes self-management education. The pur- pose of this systematic re view is to exami ne the published literature on the effect of problem- solving interventions on diabetes self-management and disease control. Population: Children, adolescents and adults with diabetes type 1 or 2. Intervention and comparison: Problem-solving interventions. Comparison: In studies with control group: usual care or waiting-list control or another intervention. iors, comes. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders/ involvement Author's conclu- sion: Studies varied greatly in their approaches to problem-solving use in patient education. To date, 36% of adult problem-solving interventions and 42 % of children/adolescent problem-solving inter-ventions have demonstrated significant improvement in HbA1c, while psychosocial outcomes have been more promising. The next phase of problem- solving intervention research should employ in-tervention characteristics found to have sufficient potency and intensity to reach therapeutic levels needed to demonstrate change. 16. Foster 2007, \"Self-management education programmes by lay leaders for people with chronic conditions (Review)\" (16) 48 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Aim: To assess systematically the effectiveness of lay-led self-management programmes for people with chronic conditions. Population: Participants of all age groups with established chronic conditions. Intervention and comparison: Self-management education programmes. These led by lay leaders (rather than health profession- als such as doctors or nurses) are becoming common as a way of trying to promote self care for people with chronic conditions. Lay-led self-management education programmes for people with chronic conditions were defined as structured programmes for people with chronic conditions which were judged by the authors to be primarily educational, primarily addressing self-management of disease, and where the majority of the course content was delivered by lay people. Comparison was usual care. Outcomes: Primary outcomes were: health status (including self-rated health and health-related quality of life, disability, pain, fa tigue, shortness of breath, psychological well-being), clin ical measures (such as blood pressure, lung function). Secondary outcomes were: knowledge of the chronic condition, so- cial role or activities, perceived support., attend ance at courses, communication with a physician, costs of delivering the programme, cost effectiveness, effects on carers/family, adverse outcomes, such as complaints, health behaviour (including exercise, cognitive symptom management, adher-ence), healthcare use (including doctor visits, emergency room visits, hospital admissions and length of stay) and self-efficacy (confidence) to self care. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay/peer leaders. The interpretation of who exactly qualifies as a lay leader may vary between self-management education programmes but they are all trained and accredited and adopt a philosophy of self-management rather than the medical model. Lay-led (or peer-led) educa-tion may differ from professionally-led education in important ways including: 1) lay leaders commonly, but not invariably, themselves have a chronic disease, which may or may not be the same as that affecting programme participants; thus leaders in such programmes may act as role-models for the participants; 2) the format may be less formal than education from a health profes- sional, perhaps encouraging discussion of ways of self-care that participants find helpful which they might not feel able to raise in a professionally-led programme; and 3) lay-leaders, particularly for programmes for specific ethnic groups, may provide subtle but important interpretations of health advice that reflect particular health beliefs or explanatory models for that group. Author's conclu- sion: Lay-led self-management education programmes short-term improvements in participants' self-efficacy, self-rated health, cognitive symptom management, and frequency of aer- obic exercise. There is currently no evidence to suggest that such programmes improve psychological health, symptoms or health-related quality of life, or that they significantly alter healthcare use. Future research on such interventions should explore longer term outcomes, their effect on clinical measures of disease and their potential role in children and adolescents. 17. Franek 2013, \"Self-Management Support Interventions for Persons With Chronic Disease: An Evidence- Based Analysis\"(17) Aim: To systematically assess the clinical effectiveness of self-management support interventions for persons with chronic diseases Population: Adults (18 years or older) with chronic disease. Intervention and comparison: Self-Management Support Interventions for Persons With Chronic Disease. They typically consists of components such as: communication with providers, lifestyle (diet, exercise), medication man-agement, psychological, symptom management, self-management, social support This review focuses on interventions meant to support the self-management of chronic disease in general (i.e., interventions that are not disease-specific). Comparison was usual care. Outcomes: Pain, disability, fatigue, dyspnea, depression, health distress, self-rated health, quality of life, exer- cise, cognitive symptom management, communication with health care professionals, self-efficacy, healthcare utilization. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay/peer leaders. Also, typically, the intervention might be CDSMP, which is based on lay-leaders. Author's conclu- sion: Low quality evidence showed that the Stanford CDSMP led to statistically significant, albeit clini- cally minimal, short-term (median 6 months) improvements across a number of health status measures, in healthy behaviours, and self-efficacy compared to usual care. Very low quality evi-dence showed no significant difference between the CDSMP and usual care in short-term (median 6 months) health care utilization and across some health-related quality of life scales. Moderate quality evidence showed that the CDSMP led to statistically significant, albeit clinically minimal, short-term (median 6 months) improvement in EQ-5D score compared to usual care. More re-search is needed to explore the long-term (12 months and greater) effect of self-management across outcomes and to explore the impact of self-management on clinical outcomes. Exploratory evidence suggests that some subgroups of persons with chronic conditions may respond better to 49 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews the CDSMP; however, there is considerable uncertainty, and more research is needed to better identify responders and non-responders. 18. Fuhr 2014, \"Effecti veness of peer-delivered interventions for severe mental illness and depression on clini- cal and psychosocial outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis\" (18) Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of peer -delivered interventions in impr oving clinical and psychosocial outcomes among individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) or depression. Population: Adults with severe mental illness or depression diagnosed according to ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria. Intervention and comparison: A broad range of differe nt pee- delivered interventions to improve clinical and psychosocial out- comes among individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) or depression was studied (group or individual). Comparison was usual care or treatment delivered by a health professional. Outcomes: Clinical (e.g. change in symptoms) or psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life, social functioning, hope and loneliness). User involve- ment: Yes. Peers were defined as non-professional health workers who possess knowledge of a disease or a specific stressor from personal experience rather than formal training and who may share sali-ent target population similarities such as gender or age with the recipient. Interventions were included which placed service users in direct contact with at least one peer who provided a conven-tional service in an intentional, one-directional relationship. They included only studies that studied the effects of peer-delivered interventions. Author's conclu- sion: The limited evidence base suggests that peers may have a small additional impact on patient's out- comes, in comparison to standard psychiatric care in high-income settings. Future research should explore the use and applicability of peer-delivered interventions in resource poor settings where standard care is likely to be of lower quality and coverage. The positive findings of equivalence tri-als demand further research in this area to consolidate the relative value of peer-delivered vs. professional- delivered interventions. 19. Hawthorne 2010, \"Culturally appropriate health education for Type 2 diabetes in ethnic minority groups: a systematic and narrative review of randomized controlled trials\"(19) Aim: To determine if culturally appropriate health education is more effective than 'usual' health educa- tion for people with diabetes from ethnic minority groups living in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Population: People with diabetes from ethnic minority groups living in high- and upper-middle-income countries Intervention and comparison: 'Culturally appropriate health education' was defined as health education that had been tailored to the cultural or religious beliefs and linguistic and literacy skills of the community being studied. It could include adaptations of established health education to innovative delivery methods, such as using community-based health advocates, conforming to cultural requirements for same gender ed-ucation groups, or adapting dietary advice to the likely dietary needs of a community. Comparison was 'conventional' diabetes health education Outcomes: Patient-oriented measure of quality of life as measured using validated tools, and biomedical measures of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood pressure (BP). Our secondary outcome measures included changes in body mass index (BMI), lipid levels, recorded long-term diabetic complications, mortality rates, acute hospital admissions, and episodes of hypoglycaemia. The au-thors also looked for measures of patient attitude and satisfaction, empowerment and self-efficacy, validated questionnaires of knowledge of diabetes and its management, and for health economic assessments. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with non-clinician leaders/people. Author's conclu- sion: Culturally appropriate health education was more effective than 'usual' health education in improv- ing HbA1c and knowledge in the short to medium term. Due to poor standardization between studies, the data did not allow determination of the key elements of interventions across countries, ethnic groups and health systems, or a broad view of their cost-effectiveness. The narrative review identifies learning points to direct future research. 20. Health Quality Ontario 2009, \"Behavioural Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes\"(20) Aim: The objective of this report is to determine whether behavioural interventions are effective in im- proving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Population: Adults with type 2 diabetes (>18 years) Intervention and comparison: All of the interventions examined in the studies were mapped to the 2007 Self-management Map- ping Guide. The interventions most often focused on problem solving, goal setting and encouraging participants to engage in activities that protect and promote health (e.g. modifying behaviour, change in diet, and increase physical activity). All of the studies examined comprehensive interven- tions targeted at least two self-care topics (e.g. diet, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, etc.). Despite the homogeneity in the aims of the interventions, there was substantial clinical heterogeneity in other intervention characteristics such as duration, intensity, setting, mode of deliv-ery (group vs. individual), interventionist, and outcomes of interest. Comparison was usual care. 50 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Outcomes: Primary outcome: pressure (SBP) control, lipid control, change in smoking status, weight change, quality of life, knowledge, self-effi-cacy, managing psychosoc ial aspects of diabetes, assessing dissati sfaction and readiness to change, and setting and achieving diabetes goals. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders or community workers. Author's conclu- sion: Based on moderate quality evidence, behavioural interventions as defined by the 2007 Self-man- agement mapping guide (Government of Victoria, Australia) produce a moderate reduction in HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care. Based on low quality evi-dence, the interventions with the largest effects are those: in diabetics with higher baseline HbA1c (9.0) and in which the interventions were of at least 1 year in duration. 21. Henderson 2011, \"The effectiveness of culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent chronic disease in culturally and linguistically diverse communities: a systematic literature review\"(21) Aim: To assess the effectiveness of culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent chronic disease in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Population: Broad group of people (mostly adults) from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Intervention and comparison: Culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent chronic disease in culturally and linguisti- cally diverse communities. Broad group of comparisons. Outcomes: The outcomes examined included changes in consumer health behaviours, utilisation satisfaction with the service, and the cultural competence of healthcare providers. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with non-clinician leaders/people. Terms used to describe community workers included, lay health advisors, lay health educators, lay tutors, Aboriginal health workers, bi-lingual community mentors, peer educators and promoters. The term community health worker (CHW) re-fers to these collective roles that have been used in this review. Author's conclu- sion: The review supported the use of trained bi-lingual health workers, who are culturally competent, as a major consideration in the development of an appropriate health service model for culturally and linguistically diverse communities. 22. Jensen 2014, \"Effectiveness and characteristics of multifaceted osteoporosis group education\u2014a system- Aim: on osteoporos is multifaceted group educa- tion. The purpose was to investigate the characteristics as well as the effectiveness of this form of osteoporosis patient education. Population: Adults aged 45 years and older with or without vertebral fracture. Intervention and comparison: The multifaceted educational programmes all consisted of three overall themes: (1) Knowledge of osteoporosis, (2) Medication and diet and (3) Exercise, but with different foci across the studies. Comparisons were no intervention, usual care or another type of intervention. Outcomes: (1) Health-related quality of life, (2) Psychosocial function, (3) Pain, (4) Physical activity, (5) Knowledge and (6) Medication and diet. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with non-clinician leaders/people Author's conclu- sion: Multifaceted group education may have a positive impact on the patients' ability to engage in pre- venting and managing osteoporosis. Further research directed towards the complexity of multifaceted group education is needed. In addition, research investigating the educational needs of specific groups of osteoporotic patients is required. 23. Jones and Riazi 2011 \"Self-efficacy and self-management after stroke: a systematic review\"(23) Aim: The purpose of this review is to examine (1) the influence of self-efficacy on rehabilitation outcomes post-stroke, and (2) the evidence to support self-management interventions based on self-efficacy principals for stroke survivors. Population: Primary population of stroke (no restriction on age). Intervention and comparison: Self-management interventions based on self-efficacy principals for stroke survivors. Comparison referred to as control group, no further description by authors. Outcomes: Not predefined. Report the outcomes reported in the primary studies. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with non-clinician leaders/people. Author's conclu- sion: There is a need for researchers, to work together with other stakeholders to develop and test inter- ventions that can support self-management skills and confidence to make continued progress after stroke. This could help to reduce some of the negative consequences of stroke such as reduced quality of life and social isolation. 51 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews 24. Jonker 2009, \"Promotion of self-management in vulnerable older people: a narrative literature review of out- comes of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP)\"(24) Aim: The aim of this study was to review intervention studies focusing on the CDSMP and to draw con- clusions on the benefits of the program. Population: Vulnerable older people. The authors do not define what they mean by \"vulnerable\". Intervention and comparison: The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP). The main aim of the CDSMP is to as- sist people to cope with multiple chronic diseases. Three principal assumptions that underlie the CDSMP are: 1. People with different chronic diseases have similar self-management problems and disease-related tasks. 2. People ca n learn to take responsibility fo r the day-today management of their diseases. 3. Confident, knowledgeable patients practicing self-management will experience improved health status and will utilize fewer health care resources. Two additional requirements are: 1. Self-management education should be inexpensive and widely available. 2. Trained layper-sons with chronic conditions can effectively deliver a structured patient education program. The CDSMP focuses on several topics, including physical exercise, nutrition, breathing, emotions, communication and medication, which are discussed during 6-weekly sessions of 2 h each in groups of 10-15 participants The groups are su pervised by two trained leaders. The underlying mechanism that explains the positive effects on health behaviour, health status, self-management behaviour and health care utilization, is assumed to be self-efficacy. This is defined as 'believing in one's own capability to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given at- tainments' (Bandura 1997). Comparison was waiting list and/or care as usual. Outcomes: Self-efficacy, Health behaviour, Health status and Health care utilization as main categories. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders. Author's conclu- sion: The authors found that the CDSMP was consistently beneficial for Health behaviour, especially with regard to the variables of exercise and self-care. For Health status, the majority of studies only showed improvement in the domain of health distress. Most of the studies that investigated Self-efficacy showed convincing improvement in self-efficacy, cognitive symptom management and mental stress management. In Health care utilization, there was no significant decrease. On the whole, the studies showed that CDSMP led to an increase in physical exercise, a decrease in health distress, an improvement in self-care, and it had a beneficial effect on self-efficacy. 25. Kroon 2014, \"Self-management education programmes for osteoarthritis\" (25) Aim: To assess the effectiveness of self-management education programmes for people with osteoar- thritis. Population: People of all age groups diagnosed with OA as defined in the included trials Intervention and comparison: Self-management education programmes are distinct from simple patient education or skills train- ing, as they encourage people with chronic disease to take an active role in the management of their own condition. Self-management education programmes aim to improve outcomes for patients by supporting, not replacing, medical care. Self-management education programmes are complex behavioural interventions comprising a package of interventions specifically targeted at patient edu-cation and behaviour modification. Programmes vary in the content used to educate patients about their condition and to explain how they can best manage their symptoms. Some programmes spe-cifically focus on managing the chronic condition itself, whereas other programmes may take a more holistic approach to managing the overall general well-being of the individual. Substantial var- iation exists in the delivery of self-management education programmes, such as the mode (face-toface, Internet, telephone), the audience (group, individual), the duration (single session, several months, ongoing), the frequency (once a week, once every two months) and the personnel (healthcare professionals, lay leaders). Structured self-management education programmes that were judged as being primarily educational and that addressed self-management of OA, arthritis in general or living with chronic disease. Programme components that directly address self-manage-ment may include fostering skills in managing OA, such as problem solving, goal setting, decision making, self-monitoring and coping with the condition, as well as providing interventions to manage pain or improve physical and psyc hological functioning. Structur ed programmes delivered by healthcare professionals, lay leaders or both were included, irrespective of whether the programme was delivered to a group of participants or on an individual basis. Included studies were grouped and assessed according to whether they compared self-manage- ment education programmes versus: 1) an attention control group (i.e. participants received the same contact hours with programme providers, but the content delivered was unrelated to self-management of their condition); 2) a group that received no treatment or usual care or were placed on a waiting list to attend the self-management programme at a later date; 3) an information-only group (i.e. educational materials, programme handbook); 4) a group that received an alternate in- tervention that was not a self-management education programme (i.e. exercise or diet plan); or 5) a group that received acupuncture. This intervention was considered separately from other studies 52 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews comparing self-management programmes versus alternative interventions (i.e. comparison de- scribed in the previous bullet) because, unlike alternative interventions in the other trials, this comparison is not a behavioural intervention. We considered the first two comparisons to be the most important for addressing the objectives of this review Outcomes: Primary outcomes: Participant's positive and active engagement in life, Pain, Global OA scores, Self-reported function, Quality of life and Withdrawals. Secondary outcomes: Emotional distress, Health-directed activity, Social integration and Health service navigation User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders. Author's conclu- sion: Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that self-management education programmes result in no or small benefits in people with osteoarthritis but are unlikely to cause harm. Compared with at-tention control, these programmes probably do not improve self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms, function or quality of life, and have unknown effects on positive and active engagement in life. Compared with usual care, they may slightly improve self-management skills, pain, function and symptoms, although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance. Further studies investigating the effects of self-management education programmes, as delivered in the tri-als in this review, are unlikely to change our conclusions substantially, as confounding from biases across studies would have likely favoured self-management. However, trials assessing other mod-els of self-management education programme delivery may be warranted. These should adequately describe the intervention they deliv er and consider the expanded PROGRESS-Plus framework and health literacy, to explore issues of health equity for recipients. 26. Larsen 2014, \"Limited evidence of the effects of patient education and self-management interventions in psoriasis patients: A systematic review\" (26) Aim: To describe the contents of educational and self-management programmes for patients with psoria- sis, and to evaluate their effects. Population: Patients aged over 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis, regardless of the type or stage. The authors included studies from all settings where all types of health-care professionals could provide the interventions. Intervention and comparison: The programme content had to include at least one face-to-face meeting with a health-care profes- sional. The intervention had to include psoriasis education, or focus on one or more aspects of living with psoriasis, such as symptom management, cognitive problem solving, communication skills, stress management or lifestyle change. Self-management interventions had to emphasize key elements such as engagement in self-care, self-efficacy strengthening, action planning and problem solving (i.e., education only, self-management only or education and self-management combined). Comparison was different intervention, usual care or a waiting list control. Outcomes: To measure the effects of education and self-management interventions, the authors decided to use a holistic approach and considered all relevant parameters such as disease severity, symptom relief, illness perception, quality of life, self-efficacy and psychological status. They also decided to include studies that measured knowledge, regardless of the type of questionnaire, as well as inter- ventions with self-customized questionnaires, provided they referred to any of the topics mentioned above. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer provider. Author's conclu- sion: This review showed that little evidence is available to support the effects of educational and self- management interventions in patients with psoriasis that are studied in RCTs. There is a significant lack of focused self-management and, compared with other chronic conditions, there appear to be few effective disease-specific tailored educational programmes for psoriasis. 27. Lennon 2013, \" Self-management programs for people post stroke: a systematic review\" (27) Aim: To examine the evidence base underlying self-management programmes specific to stroke survi- vors. Population: People who have had a stroke (post stroke recruitement) Intervention and comparison: Self-management programmes are distinct from patient education or skills training in that they are designed to enable people to take an active part in managing their own condition, including the psy- chosocial consequences and lifestyle adjustments required to enhance quality of life. Programmes can include a number of different methods of delivery, they can be lay or professionally led, disease specific, or generic, using a group or one to one formats. Comparison was normal/standard care, standard post discharge rehabilitation/care, written information, wait-listed control or placebo tele-phone call. Outcomes: Not predefined. The authors reported on the outcomes measured in the primary studies. Outcomes measured physical, psychological, and social health status; knowledge; self-management behav- iour; satisfaction with intervention; adverse events or complications; health resource utilisation; and feasibility. 53 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer leaders. Author's conclu- sion: This review provides some preliminary support for the potential importance of self-management in- terventions after stroke. The most appropriate content and best approach for delivery of these interventions remains to be determined. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of stroke self-management programmes. 28. Lew 2014, \" State of the Science: Diabetes Self-Management Interventions Led By Nurse Principal Investiga- tors\" (28) Aim: The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the state of the science regarding diabetes self-management (DSM) interventions led by nurse principal investigators. Population: People with diabetes. Intervention and comparison: Diabetes self-management interventions. Comparison was mostly usual care. Outcomes: Clinical outcomes (HbA1c), knowledge, quality of life, self-care, self-efficacy etc. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peers involvement in the delivery of the nurse-led interventions. Author's conclu- sion: The conclusion is not presented separately, but rather fragmented into the result and discussion section. 29. Lloyd-Evans 2014, \"A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of peer support for people with severe mental illness\" (29) Aim: This paper systematically reviews trials of community based, peer-provided supp ort for people with severe mental illness. Population: Adults with severe mental illness. Intervention and comparison: Included interventions were community-based peer support designed to facilitate recovery from se- vere mental illness. Peer support has been organised in three pre-defined subgroups, which are theoretically distinct, and which include comparators that would be inappropriate to combine (e.g. in meta-analysis). i) Mutual support groups in which relationships are thought to be reciprocal in nature, even if some participants are viewed as more experienced or skilled than others; ii) Peer-support services in which support is primarily uni-directional, with one or more clearly de- fined peer supporters offering support to one or more programme participants (support is separate from or additional to standard care provided by mental health services); iii) Peer mental health service providers: people who have used mental health services and are em- ployed to provide part or all of the standard care delivered by a mental health care service (i.e. the difference from standard care should be the provider rather than the role). Peer mental health providers are thus explicitly aiming to provide services which are also be pro- vided by clinicians; the content of mutual support groups is largely unspecified and peer support per se is the intervention; peer support services are designed as a peer-provided addition to standard care. Outcomes: 1) Hospitalisation, 2) Employment, 3) Overall psychiatric symptoms, 4) Symptoms of psychosis, 5) Depression and anxiety, 6) Quality of Life,7) Recovery (self-rated), 8) Hope, 9) Empowerment, 10) Satisfaction with services User involve- ment: Yes, they discuss different types of peer interventions, and the importance of segregating them (see 'Intervention and comparison'). They included only studies which studied the effects of peer- delivered interventions. Author's conclu- sion: Despite the promotion and uptake of peer support internationally, there is little evidence from cur- rent trials about the effects of peer support for people with severe mental illness. Although there are few positive findings, this review has important implications for policy and practice: current evidence does not support recommendations or mandatory requirements from policy makers for mental health services to provide peer support programmes. Further peer support programmes should be implemented within the context of high quality research projects wherever possible. Deficiencies in the conduct and reporting of existing trials exemplify difficulties in the evaluation of complex inter-ventions. 30. Mason 2008, \"Educational Interventions in Kidney Disease Care: A Systemat ic Review of Randomized Tri- als\" (30) Aim: To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at empow- ering chronic disease management in people with kidney disease. Population: Adult (18 years or older) patients with kidney disease who were in the categories of early CKD, pre- dialysis, or dialysis care. 54 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Intervention and comparison: Structured interventions that involved both informational and psychological components. Interven- tions involved components aimed at improving both knowledge and motivation. These components were used in various combinations and formats ranging in terms of complexity. Comparison was usual or routine care. Outcomes: One or more of the following outcomes: clinical (eg, blood chemistry and weight), knowledge, be- havioral (eg, decision making), and psychological (eg, quality of life). User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer teacher or mentor. Author's conclu- sion: Multicomponent structured educational interventions were effective in predialysis and dialysis care, but the quality of many studies was suboptimal. Effective frameworks to develop, implement, and evaluate educational interventions are required, especially those that target patients with early stages of chronic kidney disease. This could lead to possible prevention or delay in progression of kidney disease. 31. McGillon 2014, \"Impact of self-management interventions on stable angina symptoms and health-related quality of life: a meta-analysis\"(31) Aim: To examine comprehensively the overall effectiveness of self-management on angina symptom profile and related SL nitrate use, functional aspects of HRQL, and psychological well-being. Population: Adult outpatients of all ages with ischemic heart disease. Intervention and comparison: Interventions employing a combination of cognitive and behavioural angina self-management tech- niques were included such as: supportive coaching, anxiety and stress management or counselling, incremental exercise program, nutrition planning, medication review, relaxation training, and energy conservation. Comparison received routine or usual care and were not exposed to the intervention during the study period. Outcomes: 1. Angina symptom profile including angina frequency and stability and related SL nitrate use 2. HRQL dimensions including physical limitation, disease perception, and treatment satisfaction 3. Psychological well-being, reflected by anxiety and depression. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with lay facilitator. Author's conclu- sion: Self-management interventions significantly improve angina frequency and physical limitation; they also decrease the use of SL nitrates and improve depression in some cases. Further work is needed to make definitive conclusions about the impact of SM on cardiac-specific anxiety. 32. Millard 2013, \"Self-Management Education Programs for People Living with HIV/ AIDS: A Systematic Re- view\"(32) Aim: The objective of this systematic review was to (1) provide a synthesis of the literature on disease- specific self-management interventions for people living with HIV, (2) summarize the evidence of the effectiveness of health educ ation interventio ns on physical and psychos ocial health outcomes and health-related knowledge and behaviors among people living with HIV, and (3) to provide rec-ommendations for future research and intervention development efforts. Population: Adults living with HIV/AIDS Intervention and comparison: Self-management education programs. Self-management, as described by Lorig and colleagues involves three tasks: medical management, role management, and emotional management, and encompasses six skills: problem solving, decision making, resource utilization, formation of a pa-tient-provider partnership, action planning and self-tailoring. In order to be a successful self-manager, motivation, healthy behaviors, and effective collaboration with health professionals is re-quired. Comparison varied among included studies: usual care, waiting list, another intervention, information material etc. Outcomes: Physical, psychosocial, and health knowledge and behavioral outcomes. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer leader. Author's conclu- sion: The review found randomized controlled trials (RCT) evidence sufficient to infer that self-manage- ment programs for people living with HIV/AIDS result in short-term improvements in physical, psychosocial, and health knowledge and behavioral outcomes. Statistically significant improve-ments were reported for intervention participants compared to control participants across most outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to provide conclusions regarding the long-term outcomes of HIV-specific self-management interventions. 33. Nolte and Osborne 2013, \" A systematic review of outcomes of chronic disease self-management interven- tions\" (33) Aim: To carry out a systematic review of program outcomes used in the evaluation of group-based self- management interventions aimed at people with arthritis and other chronic conditions. Population: Adults with arthritis and other chronic conditions. 55 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Intervention and comparison: Inclusion of studies evaluating disease-specific or generic self-management interventions compara- ble with the Stanford curricula. If studies did not directly refer to Stanford, studies were selected that evaluated interventions that included at least two of the three keywords 'problem-solving', 'ac-tion planning', and 'relaxation'. To be included in the review, four characteristics had to be met by the self-management program: a. Interventions were delivered in a group setting; b. Interventions were based on a formal syllabus; c. Interventions ran between four and ten sessions within a period of 3 months; d. Interventions did not include any additional components such as exercise lessons, reinforcement techniques, individual consultations, and/or home visits. Comparison only referred to as control group, with no further explanation. Outcomes: The most often reported outcomes, with pain, disability, depression and self-efficacy being the most commonly assessed outcome. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study being reported with peer leader. Author's conclu- sion: This paper is consistent with other reviews in this area, suggesting that people with arthritis receive only marginal benefits from participating in chronic disease self-management interventions. When looking at the types of outcomes that trials are based on, however, alternative explanations for these results seem probable. As evaluations heavily rely on patient self-report, current approaches to program evaluation may not be sufficient to assess the intended impact of self-management edu-cation. An in-depth investigation of the types of outcomes assessed is provided in a separate paper. 34. Panagioti 2014, \"Self-management support interventions to reduce health care utilisation without compro- mising outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis\" (34) Aim: What models of self-management support are associated with significant reductions in health ser- vices utilisation without compromising outcomes, among patients with long-term conditions? Population: Adults (18 years or older) with a long-term condition, defined generically as 'one that cannot be cured but can be managed through medication and/or therapy.' This included common physical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, coronary heart disease, and mental health conditions such as depression. Intervention and comparison: For the purposes of the review, the authors defined a self management support intervention as: 'An intervention primarily designed to develop the abilities of patients to undertake management of health conditions through education, training and support to develop patient knowledge, skills or psychological and social resources'. The authors included all studies, which included a significant component of self-management support. After initial screening of a proportion of the studies, they distinguished 2 categories: 1. 'Self-management' including provision of materials and support from a health professional or trained peer. We coded the amount of support as in three categories for descriptive purposes: 'pure' self-management (no support), 'supported self-management' (up to 2 hours of additional support for the total durationof the study) and 'intensively supported self-man-agement' (more than 2 hours of additional support). 2. 'Case management' (with more than 2 hours of additional support, and including input from a multidisciplinary team). Comparison was usual care alone, or where the self-management support intervention was compared against a more in-tensive 'usual care' intervention (e.g. self-management versus conventional hospital use). Outcomes: Core types of health care utilization, outcomes relating to patient quality of life and health out- comes, including standardised measures of disease specific quality of life outcomes, generic quality of life, and depression/anxiety. The authors excluded measures of psychological or clinical varia-bles which did not provide a direct assessment of health or quality of life, such as self-management behaviour, self-efficacy, HbA1C or forced expiratory volume (FEV), as these are likely to be unrelia-ble indicators of health related quality of life. User involve- ment: Yes, in the inclusion criteria both professional-led and self-management interventions were of interest. Author's conclu- sion: Self-management support interventions can reduce health service utilization without compromising patient health outcomes, although effects were generally small, and the evidence was strongest in respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. Further work is needed to determine which components of self-management support are most effective. 35. Quinones 2014, \"Educational group visits for the management of chronic health conditions: A systematic review\" (35) Aim: Review the effectiveness of group visits (appointments of multiple patients) on quality of life, func- tion, self-efficacy, utilization, and biophysical outcomes in randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic conditions. Population: Adults with chronic conditions. Intervention and comparison: Educational group visits for the management of chronic health conditions: The authors defined content delivered as follows: 1) self-management education: in addition to providing disease-spe-cific information to patients, these programs teach patients self-management skills, such as goal- 56 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews setting and contracting, and build skills to reinterpret symptoms. These interventions are often char- acterized by motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques; 2) didactic education: content is informational and format is usually lecture-based (e.g., pathophysiology of dis-ease); 3) experiential education: instruction based on demonstrations (e.g., cooking). Comparison was usual care or another intervention. Outcomes: Many outcomes such as physical, psychological, functional, symptomatic, social, knowledge, self- efficacy. User involve- ment: Yes, the authors extract the interventions which were peer-led and discuss the findings for those types of interventions. In multiple studies lay persons or peers were part of or led the intervention. Author's conclu- sion: Group visits may improve self-efficacy and glycemic control. There was little consistent evidence of improved quality of life, functional status, or utilization. Practice implications: Group visits represent a reasonable alternative for educating patients with chronic illness, though varied participation/re- tention suggests they should not be the sole alternative 36. Ricci-Cabello 2014, \"Characteristics and effecti veness of diabetes self-management educational programs targeted to racial/ethnic minority groups: a systemat ic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression\" (36) Aim: To systematically review the ef fectiveness of educational progr ams to promote the self-manage- ment of racial/ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes, and to identify programs' characteristics associated with greater success. Population: Racial/ethnic minority groups with type 2 diabetes. Racial/ethnic minority group was defined as a population group with a race or ethnicity different from that of the majority population group of the host country. Groups at higher risk of diabetes complications were identified based on available lit-erature Intervention and comparison: Disease management educational programs. Interventions had to be exclusively educational, with- out including any other component such as financial incentives, clinician education or case management. Comparison was usual care. Outcomes: 1) diabetes knowledge, 2) diabetes self-management behavior, and 3) clinical outcomes User involve- ment: Yes, they have reported on the use of peer providers in the descriptions of the interventions. Author's conclu- sion: Diabetes self-management educational programs targeted to racial/ethnic minority groups can pro- duce a positive effect on diabetes knowledge and on self-management behavior, ultimately improving glycemic control. Future programs should take into account the key characteristics identi-fied in this review. 37. Siantz 2014, \"Chronic disease self-management interventions for adults with serious mental illness: a sys- tematic review of the literature\"(37) Aim: To identify and appraise chronic disease self-management studies tested with samples of US adults living with serious mental illness. Population: Adults with serious mental illness. Intervention and comparison: Chronic disease self management (CDSM) was defined as behavioral interventions that alleviate the consequences of chronic care conditions (CCs) through medical management, maintenance or creation of new meaningful behaviors or life roles and management of emotional reactions to CCCs. CDSM programs systematically fa cilitate acquisition of lifestyle behav iors that minimize dis- ability resulting from disease and delay the progression of chronic disease. These activities can include monitoring one's health, improving medication adherence, changing the way one carries out expected roles and activities, finding and utilizing resources, or otherwise improving self-efficacy in illness management, including working collaboratively with health care providers. CDSM programs can occur singularly or in combination with other health activities, such as nutrition groups or pri- mary care visits, and often occur in collaboration with peer providers. Comparison was usual care Outcomes: Functional, attitudinal (knowledge, empowerment, self-efficacy etc.), behavioral medication adher- ence, health service use, questions on physical activity etc.), anthropometric (BMI, HbA1c, cholesterol etc.) User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer leaders/involvement Author's conclu- sion: Given the high chronic disease burden experienced by individuals with SMI combined with our na- tions health care reform, emphasis on self-management to improve population health, coupled with advancing the quality of research to evaluate CDSM programs for adults with SMI, is critically needed. 38. Steinsbekk 2012, \"Group based diabetes self-management education compared to routine treatment for peo- ple with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A systematic review with meta-analysis\" (38) Aim: To assess effects of group-based DSME compared to routine treatment on clinical, lifestyle and psychosocial outcomes in type-2 diabetes patients. Population: Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. 57 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Intervention and comparison: Group-based education specific for people with type 2 diabetes. The duration of education had to be at least one session lasting for one hour. Comparison was routine treatment (standard of care recommended). Outcomes: The main outcomes were Clinical (metabolic control measured by glycated haemoglobin and fast- ing blood glucose), Lifestyle (d iabetes knowledge a nd self-management sk ills) and Psychosocial (quality of life and empowerment/self-efficacy). The secondary outcomes were; Body weight; Body mass index (BMI); Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic ); Lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL choles- terol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides); Patient treatment satisfaction and Death. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with lay leaders/people. Author's conclu- sion: Based on current evidence, there are indications that interventions delivered by a single educator, delivered in less than ten months, with more than 12 hours and between 6 and 10 sessions give the best results but more research is needed to confirm this. In general it can be concluded that group- based DSME in people with type 2 diabetes results in improvements in clinical, lifestyle and psy-chosocial outcomes. 39. Tang 2011, \"A Review of Voluntee r-Based Peer Support Interventions in Diabetes\" (39) Aim: To review volunteer-based peer support interventions and examine the implementation strategies and diabetes-related health outcomes associated with them. Population: Adults with diabetes Intervention and comparison: Self-management rather than prevention that include an explicit training component for peer sup- porters. Comparison included usual care, waiting list or another intervention or delivery style of intervention. Some studies referred to comparison as 'control group' or was not described. Outcomes: Clinical, behavio ral, knowledge, and/or psychosocial outcomes User involve- ment: Predefined as a criterion to be included. All included studies have user involvement in the delivery of the intervention, either as sole provider (mostly) of intervention or in combination with a profes-sional. Community workers, peers and patients are the terms used. Author's conclu- sion: No separate conclusion was found in the document. The discussion and conclusions are part of the result presentation. 40. Thorpe 2013, \"Facilitating Healthy Coping in Patients With Diabetes A Systematic Review\" (40) Aim: To summarize recent literature on approaches to supporting healthy coping in diabetes in 2 specific areas: (1) the impact of different approaches to diabetes treatment on healthy coping and (2) the effectiveness of interventions specifically designed to support healthy coping. Population: Adults with type 2 Diabetes. Intervention and comparison: A variety of healthy coping interventions, including diabetes self-management education, support groups, problem-solving approaches, and coping skills interventions. Outcomes: Psychosocial and QOL outcomes. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with lay leader. Author's conclu- sion: Healthy coping in diabetes has received substantial attention in the past 5 years. A variety of ap- proaches show positive results. Research is needed to compare the effectiveness of different approaches in different populations and determine how to overcome barriers to intervention dis-semination and implementation. 41. Yehle and Plake 2010, \" Self-efficacy and Educational Interventions in Heart Failure. A Review of the Litera- ture\" (41) Aim: To conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate which components of structured educa- tional interventions are associated with improvement in self-efficacy for self-care behaviors in heart failure patients. Population: Heart failure patients Intervention and comparison: Each of the reviewed studies used an intervention plus education to improve self-efficacy. Compari- son was usual care with or without additional intervention (such as written information), a different intervention or a different delivery style of the same intervention. In studies with a comparison group, they included usual care, another intervention, waiting list or just described as 'control group'. Outcomes: Knowledge, self-efficacy and self-management behavior were the three main outcomes. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on pri- mary studies with peer mentors. Author's conclu- sion: Existing evidence suggests that it is not the amount of education (number of sessions/length of ses- sions) that improves self-efficacy, but some other factor or factors that remain unknown at present. Education delivery costs, flexibility, and the ability to more easily integrate new discoveries need to 58 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews be explored. Interventions that include components specifically geared toward increasing self-effi- cacy for self-care in patients with heart failure are needed. Learning activities need to be incorporated into patient education programs to provide practice time that may result in behavior changes. The opportunity to practice self-care behaviors within the context of the education pro- vided to those with heart failure, along with ongoing support, needs to be explored in future studies. 42. Zeh 2012, \"The impact of culturally competent diabetes care interventions for improving diabetes-rela ted outcomes in ethnic minority groups: a systematic review\" (42) Aim: To examine the evidence on culturally competent interventions tailored to the needs of people with diabetes from ethnic minority groups. Population: People with Diabetes. Intervention and comparison: The interventions varied, but they were all defined as culturally competent individual or group based diabetes education. Comparison were usual care or other interventions (all were not described). Outcomes: Specific outcomes were not predefined, but the primary studies reported on 22 outcomes including: 12 clinical, five psychosocial, three lifestyle and two healthcare utilization. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with patients as part of the provider team. Author's conclu- sion: Benefits in using culturally competent interventions with ethnic minority groups with diabetes were identified. The majority of interventions described as culturally competent were confirmed as so, when assessed using the culturally competent assessment tool. Further good quality research is required to determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of culturally competent interventions to influence diabetes service commissioners. 43. Zwerink 2014, \" Self managemen t for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" (43) Aim: 1. To evaluate whether self management interventions in COPD lead to improved health outcomes. 2. To evaluate whether self management interventions in COPD lead to reduced healthcare utilisa-tion. Population: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD. Intervention and comparison: Self management interventions were defined as structured interventions for individuals with COPD aimed at improvement of self health behaviours and self management skills. These interventions required at least an iterative process of interaction between participant and healthcare provider, and ideally also included formulation of goals and provision of feedback. Furthermore, at least two of the following components had to be part of the intervention: smoking cessation, self recognition and self treatment of exacerbations, an exercise or physical activity component, advice about diet, advice about medication or coping with breathlessness. Content could be delivered to study partici-pants verbally, as written material (hardcopy or digital) or via audiovisual media. An action plan was defined as a guideline for participants describing when and how to change medication in case of worsening COPD-related symptoms, indicating (the start of) an exacerbation. Comparison was usual care or an active intervention. Outcomes: Primary outcomes: 1. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores, Number of hospital admis- sions. Secondary outcomes: 1. Hospitalisation days, 2. Number of exacerbations requiring emergency department visits, 3. Use of (other) healthcare facilities, 4. Number of exacerbations re-quiring a course of oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, 5. Use of rescue medication, 6. Symptom scores, 7. Anxiety and depression, 8. Self efficacy, 9. Days lost from work, 10. Lung function, 11. Exercise capacity. User involve- ment: No detailed information about user involvement. The systematic review is included based on one primary study with peer leader. Author's conclu- sion: Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improved health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, a reduction in respiratory-related and all cause hospital admissions, and improvement in dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC. No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters. However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures makes it difficult to formulate clear recom-mendations regarding the most effective form and content of self management in COPD. 59 Informasjon innhentet fra de nordiske prim\u00e6rstudiene Information extracted from the included systematic reviews deltakerne. at med prospective evaluation of the chroni c pain self-management programme in a danish population of chronic pain patients\" Aim: This study evaluates the feasibility and changes in pain, pain cognition, and distress during a pa- tient education course and a 5-month follow-up period. The Chronic Pain Self-Management Programme (CPSMP) is a lay-led patient education consisting of six manualized sessions. Population: Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, spoke Danish, had pain lasting more than 3 months, rated their pain intensity >5 on a 10-point scale. 60 Information extracted from the included systematic reviews Method: A Danish adaptation of the CPSMP was tested in four municipalities. The sample consisted of 74 women and 13 men between 26 and 80 years with a long pain history (+10 years). Participants completed questionnaires before the CPSMP, immediately after and 5 months after the program. Intervention and comparison: The CPSMP consisted of six 2.5 h weekly workshops focusing on how to manage pain in daily life. Two trained workshop leaders facilitated the workshops in groups of 8-16 chronic pain patients. At least one of the workshop leaders suffered from a long term pain condition. No comparison group. The study had a within-subject design' with pre-post intervention measures by use of a question-naire. Outcomes: Outcomes reported were pain, physical disability, pain catastrophizing, symptoms of depression and anxiety, illness worry and physical symptoms. User involve- ment: No detailed information or discussion about user involvement. However, based on the description of the intervention (CPSMP), user involvement is a prerequisite. One of two providers (leaders) had to suffer from a long term pain condition. What type of user involvement this was (i.e. involved in planning, implementation and evaluation) is not described. Author's conclu- sion: A consistent pattern of stable improvements in pain, pain cognition and distress was observed but the scope of changes was modest. Practice implications: The Danish version of "}
