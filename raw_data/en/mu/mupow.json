Got a headache? Here's what you need to know about natural remedies for headaches and migraines. A Brief Overview of Headaches and Migraines Arguably, headaches are one of the common reasons why most people visit hospitals globally \u2014 about 80 percent of Americans will experience a headache at some point in their lives. Conversely, migraines affect an estimated 20 million Americans annually and are more prevalent among women than men. Some headaches are often caused by underlying medical conditions like sinusitis or tension headaches, while others are triggered by stress or even irritation of the neck muscles. However, you should note that [headaches are different from migraines](https://elevationspinecenter.com/blog/headaches-migraines-your-pillow-can-help-or-hurt-you/). Precisely, migraines are headaches that are throbbing and more severe to the extent of lasting hours to days. They are either unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral migraines typically occur on one side of the head, while bilateral migraines occur simultaneously on both sides of the head. Natural Headaches and Migraines Remedies The best headache remedy is prevention, so it's important to know what triggers your headaches and how to avoid them. There are several natural [remedies for headaches that you can try at home](https://elevationspinecenter.com/blog/6-top-home-remedies-for-sciatica-pain/). Here are some of our favorite natural headache remedies: Drink plenty of water Water is a natural diuretic that can help flush out your system and reduce pressure in your head, which is often associated with headaches. In addition to drinking lots of water, make sure you're getting enough sleep each night! If you suffer from frequent migraines or head pain, getting too little sleep can play a big role in causing these symptoms. Yoga Regular yoga practice provides relief from headaches and migraines. Yoga will strengthen your muscles, increase flexibility and improve your overall circulation. It also has the added benefit of helping you relax and clear your mind, which is crucial to dealing with stress. Hot/Cold Packs Hot or cold packs applied to the back of your neck can help reduce inflammation and tension in your neck muscles, which can cause pain. Wrap a hot pack in a towel before applying it to the back of your neck for 10 minutes until you feel relief from your headache symptoms. You can also apply a cold pack directly on top of your head for 20 minutes until you feel relief from your headache symptoms. Ginger Ginger is one of the best natural remedies for headaches and migraines because it contains anti-inflammatory properties to help alleviate pain. It's also effective in reducing nausea, which can help reduce the severity of your headache or migraine. Cayenne Pepper Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, which is known to cause inflammation in the body when applied topically on the skin or taken internally as an infusion or capsule. When applied topically, cayenne pepper helps relieve pain by warming up muscles while they relax and contract less frequently during your headache or migraine attack.
