The masked ego remains dominant, no accurate perception of self is present in that moment. The word dreaming refers to our sleeping dreams and the awake dreamtime, our life when our physical bodies are awake. We are the creators of both. Today's Mayan Daykeeper is Ben ~ The essence of Ben is our connection to our ancestral lines. Ben is that feeling of family, the warm cozy one. I know that is not true for all of you, however families are created in many ways, through blood, through choice, through friendship. In all cases you have an opportunity to learn from your interactions with your families. Ben holds the energy of interdependent family relationships not co-dependent ones. (Full info at bottom of post) In this 20 day cycle you are invited to use Trance Dreams/Day-dreams which occur through intent or sometimes spontaneously through meditation as a discovery tool. Every day You are invited to play with the theme presented. You may choose to intend on having a new awareness around this theme that day and just allow your subconscious mind to present you with an awareness during the day, or you may choose to do a meditation on the theme and see what comes. You may choose to do nothing and that's okay too. Whatever you choose, I invite you to not make this 'work' but rather something to play with, something to explore. What you do with your findings? ...... Well you decide the answer to that one. The daily themes may be used to illuminate different aspects of your ego; the places where your masked ego is 'on point' and the places where your ego has become the transcended ego. Uncovering the masks that you took on to survive, and the places where you have taken off your mask and discovered the beauty of impermanence. Impermanence is the nature of reality. Everything is impermanent, plants, animals, rocks, our bodies, Grandmother Earth, stars, our moods, and yes even our ego. Living in Impermanence is the state of being that is called the transcended ego. As you heal and change, integrating impermanence into your life, you gain freedom. Living from a place of impermanence, you are no longer at the Effect of Life and Others. You stand in the moment and take action, flexible and in control of your choices. In everything there are positive and negative energies. The masked and transcended ego are just the ying and yang of that particular energy we call the ego. Neither is right or wrong, they are both just states of being where you can understand and learn more about yourself. With that understanding you are at choice, what action you take is up to you. Your dream creation, Your symbols, Your interpretation, affecting Your life. qw`s There are many types of dreams for various reasons. Some of which are Recapitulation Dreams which provide information for us to problem solve issues and questions about our daily lives. Prophetic dreams which give us information about the future. Trance Dreams/Day-dreams which occur through intent or sometimes spontaneously through meditation. Epic Dreams that show us other worlds, some are life changing and some magickal. The ultimate dream goal, is the Power Dream, where we have gained enough knowledge and ability to control our sleeping dream in order to manifest what we will in both the sleeping and awake dreams. Mayan Daykeeper Ben ~ The essence of Ben is our connection to our ancestral lines. Ben is that feeling of family, the warm cozy one.

In all cases you have an opportunity to learn from your interactions with your families. Ben holds the energy of interdependent family relationships not co-dependent ones. Ben expresses in the human experience as the awareness of family, including both ancestors and the future potential of the family. On a Ben day, there may be a general focus on the family or other dependent relationships. You may feel more intimate with others around you. Be careful not to engage those close to you in obsolete family patterns. Those born with Ben as their Daykeeper are often responsible and devoted family members. They may assume the responsibility of being the caretaker of the family This is an exerpt from Mayan Calendar Voice of the Galaxy by Raymond Mardyks and Stacia Alana-Leah Should you wish to know your Birth Daykeeper, [Contact me](https://healingthroughceremony.com/contact/) with your birth date. Your interpretation and experience is your own. I can only share my personal understanding, I invite you to find your own truths and their relevance in your life. This is really important.

The juice and healing comes from within your own understanding, it is pivotal for your healing journey and manifesting what you want. Like this: Like Loading... "}
