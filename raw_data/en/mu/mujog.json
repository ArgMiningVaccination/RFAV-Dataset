Known for the light touch and subtle manipulations, CST techniques are safe and suitable for all ages including new-born babies. Treatments occasionally involve therapeutic images and conversation for enabling the client to gain more understanding about the origin and the meaning of the illness or discomfort. Client can remain dressed during the therapy session, and the rooms of Anderida Practice provide a calm and homely environment, which is ideal for this therapy. Somato Emotional Release\u00ae becomes a part of the CranioSacral Therapy process in some cases. Recalling past experiences and forgotten memories, or a visualisation with an imaginary journey and emotional processing can lead to a profound change in one's understanding of how some events and feelings contributed to the development of an illness. In many cases this realisation can activate self-healing. CranioSacral Therapy with Somato Emotional Release\u00ae integrates light structural and fascia release techniques with the discovery of mind and body connections and with the intention of finding those inner resources, which may be needed for moving towards a positive change. This treatment modality was pioneered in the USA by Dr John E Upledger Osteopathic Physician. In the 1970s he researched the tenets of Cranial Osteopathy - originally established by William G Sutherland - and then continued developing CranioSacral Therapy. His book: Your Inner Physician and You, first published in 1997, describes many significant cases, and the discoveries, which inspired his teaching and therapeutic work at the Upledger Institute Clinic in Florida.
