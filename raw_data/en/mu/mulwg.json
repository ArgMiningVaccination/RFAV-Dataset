Some believe that crystals can also stimulate spiritual growth and bring about a positive transformation in life experience. Is it O.K. to be actively involved with crystal healing and crystal power? What counsel does the Bible give in this matter? Crystals certainly are beautiful objects, for they were created by God. Portions of God's glorious heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, will be constructed from crystal. It's in the Bible, Revelation 21:11, & 18-20 NIV. \"It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. \" When evaluating the appropriateness of using crystals for healing purposes, it is important to be aware of the fact that the majority of experts who promote crystal healing are involved in the occult. The word occult means 'hidden'. Occultism concerns itself with the study and utilization of supernatural influences, powers and phenomena that are normally hidden from the regular physical senses, and are generally considered to be outside the realm of traditional scientific observation. Occultists believe that human beings, and the world in which we live, are permeated by invisible mystical energies. They believe that these energies can be focused and directed by 'sacred stones', such as crystals and other talismans, so as to induce physical healing and spiritual enlightenment. In addition to involvement with crystal power, occultism is associated with other mystical practices such as astrology, numerology, divination, tarot cards, psychic healing, mediumship, spirit channeling, Eastern religions, ritual magic and sorcery. What does God say about involvement with the occult? He warned the Israelites against it when they were about to enter the Promised Land of Canaan. It's in the Bible, Deuteronomy 18:9-12 NIV. \"When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord.\" The use of 'sacred stones' for mystical purposes was common among the pagan peoples of the Bible Lands. Called amulets, these magical charms were made in the form of small pendants attached to a necklace or bracelet. They were worn to protect a person from negative energies, evil and injury, and also to bring good luck. God uttered a stern warning to the false prophetesses of Israel, who in their apostasy had adopted the pagan practice of wearing amulets. It's in the Bible, Ezekiel 13:18, 20 & 21 NIV. \"This is what the Sovereign Lord says: 'Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own? I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds, and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds. I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power.' \" The Bible categorizes the use of amulets as a form of pagan magic. Modern proponents of crystal power regard crystal healing to be 'benevolent magic', also known as 'white magic'. Occult magic can sometimes produce spectacular manifestations of power. Instances of this are described in the Bible. For example, Exodus 7:10-12 NIV, \"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers; and the Egyptian magicians also did the same thing by their secret arts. Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake.\" From a description of the two other miracles performed by Pharaoh's sorcerers, we know they were using occult powers, not sleight-of-hand stage-type magic. Miracles, signs and wonders can often be the work of Satan. It's in the Bible, 2 Thessalonians 2:9 & 10 NIV. \"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing.\" Under the command of Satan and his principalities, demonic spirits manifest these miraculous signs. Revelation 16:13 & 14, \"Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs.\" Spirits are angelic beings. Hebrews 1:14.NIV, \"Are not all angels ministering spirits...?\" Occult magic was practiced during the era of the Early Church. It's in the Bible, Acts 8:9-13 NAS. \"Now there was a certain man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city, and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. And they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, 'This man is what is called the Great Power of God.' And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts. But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. And even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip; and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.\" Simon discovered that the power of God was far greater than the power of the Occult, and that true healing comes from the Lord. It's in the Bible, Psalm 103:2-4 NIV. \"Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits\u2014who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion.\" In the Early Church at Ephesus, practitioners of occult magic become acquatinted with the Gospel through the ministry of the apostle Paul. They were converted, and then destroyed their occult textbooks. It's in the Bible, Acts 19:17-19 NKJV, \"...the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds. Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver.\" At the Second Coming of Jesus, practitioners of the occult will be prohibited from entry into the glorious New Jerusalem. It's in the Bible, Revelation 22:14 & 15 NIV. \"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.\" Failing to inherit eternal life, those who practice magic arts will, tragically, find themselves condemned to experience the second death. Revelation 21:2, 7 & 8 NIV, \"I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
