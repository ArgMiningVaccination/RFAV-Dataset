Traveling in South America is different than traveling in the first world. Even though the rewards are infinitely larger than the risks, you must be aware of the potential inherent risks that do exist. [A Safe and Effective Healing Experience](/safety-protocol) Heading to the birthplace of Ayahuasca in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest is no easy task. It's a pilgrimage that's just as much part of the healing as the plant medicines we work with. As part of the Ayahuasca Safety Association, we maintain the highest security standards, making sure your time with us is safe and worry-free, giving you the mental freedom and space to have a transformative experience in a secure, trusted, authentic environment. [In The Ceremony](/safety-protocol) - Ensure you avoid recreational drugs and antidepressants containing SSRIs for at least three weeks before you consume ayahuasca. - Keep an LED flashlight in your pocket during the ceremony. Sometimes ayahuasca can impair motor skills and make it difficult to find your light. - Keep your bucket close. Vomiting can come on unexpectedly. - Stay close to the malloca (ceremonial building). This is where you are safe. Do not wonder into the surrounding brush, no matter how connected you feel to nature. Snakes, ants and other biting insects are present in the jungle. - Have confidence in the process and be calm and present. Your best interests are our top priority. If things get heavy, understand that it's only temporary and within a short time you will feel normal again. Tomorrow you will feel better than ever before.
