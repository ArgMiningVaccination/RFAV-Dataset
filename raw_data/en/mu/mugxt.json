In my country, there are alternative ways of treating disease that medical doctors term congenital, including the use of herbal medicine, which is allowed under the laws of Kenya. When I was young, my parents tried to treat my condition through herbs prescribed by traditional medicine men, but without success. When I grew up, I took on the task of finding a cure myself. I consulted medical doctors, and an X-ray was done on my chest. They found my lungs were in order but recommended ointments to control the pain. The doctors told me that the condition was \"in the tissue,\" and also prescribed painkillers that did reduce the pain during cold seasons. But this did not cure problem. I was staying with my sister in one of the coldest parts of Nairobi City, known as Kikuyi Town. I feared that my chest problem was a hereditary disease. My elder brother had passed on with a condition involving similar symptoms, and so had my father . While living in Nairobi, I joined one of the evangelical Christian churches, having decided to trust God for healing through prayer. The Bible's story about the woman who was diseased with an issue of blood for 12 years, and yet was healed by Christ Jesus, gave me hope (see Matt. 9:20\u201426). I knew that one day I would be healed through prayer. Then after I got married, I moved with my husband from Nairobi to Suna-Migori in southern Kenya in 2001. There I learned about Christian Science. This was a new town to me, and finding a good church was part of my settling in the town. One Sunday my husband came home with a book, Science and Health, and a magazine, the Christian Science Sentinel, both of which he had obtained from a friend. While reading the magazine, I came across a page titled \"News of Healing,\" which greatly interested me. I wondered how people were healed just by reading the book Science and Health. I expressed to God in prayer my desire for healing, and I also told husband about my interest in reading this book, and how I longed for the healing that would come prayer and from reading it. He encouraged me to act on my desire. So I started with the chapter on \"Prayer.\" A line on p [age 12](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=SH+12%3A18-19) challenged me: \"The drug does nothing, because it has no intelligence.\" I knew much about prayer, but this statement implied to me that I had to give up faith in drugs when praying about my chest pain. After I'd read the book for two days, the pain disappeared. At that time, it was the cold rainy season in Kenya\u2014when the pain usually would be most persistent. I waited for two weeks to confirm that the condition had actually disappeared. I have been permanently healed of the chest pains. And I no longer believe that people must inherit diseases, because God does not give disease to His daughters and sons. I am grateful to say that I joined the Christian Science Society in Suna-Migori. And in the year 2004, I also united with The Mother Church . SUNA-MIGORI, KENYA "}
