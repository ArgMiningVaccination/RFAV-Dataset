During its first four decades of existence, the college had one primary objective: education leading to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree. In the 1990s, the college expanded its mission to include the training of other natural healthcare practitioners. In line with its classical approach to principles that guide naturopathic care, the college developed curricula emphasizing the holistic spirit of the classical teachings of Chinese medicine. With its shift to a multi - purpose institution, a new name was ch osen - National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) - and announced at its 50th Anniversary in 2006. In 2016, following Oregon HECC and NWCCU approval to offer undergraduate education, the institution changed its name again to reflect its status as a univer sity. In June 2016, in honor of its 60th Anniversary, NCNM became known as National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM). The ND program and its affiliated certificate programs are housed within the university's College of Naturopathic Medicine. The College of Classica l Chinese Medicine offers two degree programs, the Master of Science in Oriental Medicin e (MSOM) and the Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM), as well as embedded certificate programs. Profession -wide discussions are currently underway as regards the use of the word \"Oriental\" in degree titles. NUNM is monitoring that discussion closely and will consider requesting changes to the titles of the MSOM and DSOM utiliz ing input resulting from the national deliberations . In 2012, the School of Graduate Studies (S GS) was developed to house programs supporting health and natural medicine themes central to the institution's core programs in naturopathic and classical Chi nese medicines . SGS currently offers the following six master's programs: Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSiMR); Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN); Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH); Master of Science in In tegrative Mental Health (MSiMH) ; Master of Ayurveda (MScA); and Master of Science i n Sports Medicine (MScSM) . The first class of MScSM st udents matriculated in fall 2017 . The first class of MScA students matriculated in winter 2018. The S GS master's programs deliver education that either complements a clinical degree, such as the ND, MSOM, and DSOM or leads to non - clinical career paths. NUNM students may apply for admission into two graduate or first professional degree programs concurrently. In fall 2016, the School of Undergraduate Studies (SUS) matriculated its first cohorts to the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health ( BSiHS ) and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition ( BScN ) programs. These programs are tailored to our graduate level offerings and provide the final t wo years of study for undergraduate students interested in pursuing careers or further training and/or research in the natural health sciences . In fall 2017, the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Therapeutics - Massage Therapy Track was approved by the NWCCU with its educational offerings beginning fall 2018. Since 1956, NUNM has awarded 2752 degrees, with many graduates receiving more than one degree. The table below provides an overview of programs including progra m length, identification of the first year the institution matriculated students into the program, and the number of graduates as of July 1, 2017 , our most recent commencement. The campus is located one mile south of downtown Portland, close to both Ore gon Health & Science University and Portland State University. As of fall 2017 , NUNM is home to 626 full- and part -time students and 312 employees . Buildings within the campus footprint consist of the following: NWCCU Year One Report Page 2 of 28 March 2018 Institutional Overview The Academic Building, a tot al of 60,000 square feet, provides classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, the library, a f ew offices, and the NUNM Store. The Administration Building , a total of 22,000 square feet, provides the bulk of the university's office space . Radelet Hall is a large lecture s pace named in honor of Betty Radelet, ND, DC, the first woman t o graduate from the institution. NUNM Health Center -Lair Hill includes 18,000 square feet of consultation, examination, and treatment rooms, and a lab and medicinary . Three houses owned by NUNM are located within the campus footprint, two of which are rental properties. T he third, Spaulding House , houses the NUNM Institutes (excluding Helfgott Institute). A new building adjacent to the Lair Hill Health Center is in the early construction stages and will be completed at the end of summer 2018 as outlined in the facilities section below . Also part of the campus but outside the campus footprint is the Helfgott Research Institute and Community Education Center, home to NUNM's research activities and Charlee's Teaching Kitchen , named for a founder of Bob's Red Mill, who donated funding for the kitchen . Helfgott was established in 2003 wi th the mission of conducting rigorous, quality research on the art and science of healing, specifically working to understand natural forms of medicine . The institute includes a classroom, clinical research laboratory, and office space. In addition to purs uing grants funded by sources such as the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Helfgott pursues collaborative grants with other institutions such as Oregon Health & Science University, as well as compa ny-funded research. Through the institute, students are provided the opportunity to participate in and pursue their individual research under the guidance of faculty mentors. In addition to the Health Center within the campus footprint, the university oper ates a clinic in Beaverton, Oregon and 17 community clinics in the Portland area. The community clinics offer low -cost medical care to medically underserved populations and provide our medical students with an expanded patient base. In October 2012, the City of Portland approved the university's Campus Master Plan that provides a blueprint for future campus development and growth. The goals outlined in the plan are designed to allow for flexibility and incremental improvement, providing a framework that w ill grow the campus in a manner that serves NU NM's long -term academic needs. In executing the master plan, some facilities changes have occurred since the Year Seven Report and are detailed under Changes to Facilities in the Preface.

Dr. El -Hashemy came to NUNM from CCNM, where he served as associate dean of ac ademic delivery for 10 years. NWCCU Year One Report Page 4 of 28 March 2018 Preface With the early retirement of interim vice president of academic affairs and provost Sandra Snyder in October 2017 , Dr. Glenn Smith assumed the position of interim provost . As of January 1, 2018, Dr. Glenn Smith assumed the permanent position of vice president of academic affairs and provost with a search for a new dean of students beginning immediately. With the retirement of VP of advancement, Susan Hunter, o n December 31, 2017, MiKayla Ryan, MBS, director of development, assumed responsibility for supporting President Schleich in NUNM's development efforts . MiKayla comes to NUNM with experi ence in development and fundraising as the Director of Development at Newspace Cente r for Photography and as a program manager for S.M.A.R.T. (Start Making a Reader Today), New leadership in Continu ing Education as of November 15, 2017 , is provided by Jeremy Sloan, Continuing Education Manager. Jeremy comes to NUNM with partnership cultivation and collaboration experience from working with Portland Public Schoo ls and the Oregon Disability Community Collaboration. A new associate dean of graduate medical education, Dr. De e Saunders, was hired to lead the ND residency program starting October 2017. Dr. Leslie Fuller, who has held this role for three years, stepped into the position of associate dean of academics to help facilitate the rollout and ongoing assessment of the new ND curriculum. On January 1, 2018 , Dr. Charles Kune rt began his new role as the dean of the school of graduate studies. Dr. Kunert has a 30+ year career in higher education, in a variety of teaching and academic administrative roles at Concordia University - Portland, as well as the University of Oregon. Dr. Ryan Bradley was promoted from assistant director to director of NUNM's Helfgott Research Institute. Ayasha Shamsud -Din, MSEd was promoted from Intercultural Engagement and Support Manager position to the director of equity and inclusion . Ms. Shamsud -Din oversees the Office of Equity and Inclusion which moved from the Office of Student Life to the Human Resources Office to reflect the nature of the work for the entire university - both students, employees, and patients. Nora Sande, executive admini strator of the NUNM Health Centers was pro moted to AVP of Health Centers and auxiliary operations as of February 1, 2018. AVP Sande oversees all health center operations and the auxil iary services of the NUNM Store and Information Center. AVP Sande returned to NUNM after being away for a few years in March 2017. Her previous tenure working with NUNM was from 2007 to 2015 serving as the director of ancillary services. Changes to Facilities : The former administration building storage annex was repurposed into a new, sustainable office wing named the Stone -Bleything Wing. The Wing houses the clinic billing and community health clinic business services divisions of the university. NUNM demolished the former Services Building (storage warehouse with some offices) to create a new parking lot. The lot will serve the new addition being built adjacent to our Lair Hill Clinic. The new addition will house a second campus teaching kitchen ( made possible through a donation of $350K from the Barlean's company), new classrooms, clinic conference rooms, space for the newly -approved graduate sports medicine program, a small student lounge, and faculty offices. The addition is scheduled for comple tion in fall, 2018. Additional student space was an area identified for improvement in our recent self - evaluation process as well as by the site visitors. NWCCU Year One Report Page 5 of 28 March 2018 Preface In summer 201 7, the front area of t he library was redesigned to increase study areas. NUNM is mov ing forward with a city -approved street vacation of lower Hooker Street, a cul-de-sac located adjacent to the Spaulding house . NUNM is working with the city to comply with upgrades and zoning requirements . The outcome will be to transform the vacated stree t into a sustainable food forest/park -like setting within the grounds of the university . New Programs : The following programs were approved by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) in 2017: In May 2017 a n application was submitted to the NWCCU for a Master of Science in Ayu rveda , and it was approved in July 2017. In August 2017, NUNM submitted an application for a BS Integrative Therapeutics - Massage Therapy Track . The program was approved in October 2017. This program was designed to serve as a feeder to our graduate and first professional degree programs as well as provide training toward entry into a professional massage practice. The anticipated first entering class will be fall 2018 . The Budget for AY 2017 -18: NUNM engages in prudent financial planning by maintaining and expanding a diversified revenue stream for continued financial stability and capacity enhancement (see appendix A, Financial Audit Letter and Statement) . Financial planning , for the use and allocation of financial resources, flows from the board approved \"Framework for Action III\" (appendix B), an internal document outlining the university's strategic plan. Within the Framework, the board endorses strategies for achieving var ious goals and objectives to further the mission of the university. Also , NUNM develops an \"annual business plan\" (appendix C), which contains the budgets of all cost centers, enrollment projections, and budget assumptions including assessment of physical resources, classrooms , and clinical rooms, faculty needs to deliver curriculum, and personnel to provide services. The annual business plan is approved by the Board of Directors at the June board meeting. In addition to the NUNM annual business plan, the institution is subject to and responsive to the City of Portland's master planning process and requirements. NUNM ended the 2016 -2017 academic year with a surplus. This was the fifth year in a row with a surplus. Additionally, the uni versity has had a surplus every year since 2004 except for 2012. In June 2017, the NUNM Board of Directors approved the business plan for the 2017 -2018 fiscal year which accounts for continued financial support for current programs, new program implement ation s, risk management, short -term solvency and other financial obligations. NUNM works to sustain a minimum of three -month short -term investment cash in reserve should unrealized financial risks occur. Due to a downturn in projected enrollment and patient revenue in our teaching health centers , NUNM took austere proactiv e measures to ensure that the university realized a balance d budget for the 2017 -2018 fiscal year . In the month of May 2017, a workgroup composed of the vice president of human r esources, the interim provost, the chief financial o fficer, and the president met to generate a balanced budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The work group invited other employees to join them to provide input into the impact of potential cuts in budget r equests which were a projected $2.5 million more than the prior year. NWCCU Year One Report Page 6 of 28 March 2018 Preface Five criteria were used for determining which areas to prioritize in the budget for 2017 -18. These criteria were as follows : 1. Continue to deliver high -quality programs 2. Continue to deliver excellent patient care 3. Satisfy contractual obligations 4. Support a reas that produce revenue 5. Support strategic initiatives in areas identified by institution's strategic plan, the Framework for Action III (FFAIII). It is noteworthy that 70-75% of ou r budget support our human resources. The following budget adjustments were made to create a balanced budget. All requests for CE and travel were removed from the budgets of individual department s. Funds t hat were included in the budget for AY 2017 -18 were moved to HR for ov ersight so that institutional priorities could be taken into consideration in eff icient ly utilizing limited CE and travel funds . Nine positions were eliminated , six of which were currently staffed and three unfilled. Prudent r eductio ns were made in several department budgets, including the library , marketing, and student life, and the health centers. The institutional contribution toward r etirement benefit s of eligible employees was reduced from 4% t o 1%. Previously , 100% the cost of medical and dental benefits for eligible employees was paid by the institution . In AY 2017 -18 employees pay 10% of their medical and dental. Previously paid in full by the institution, in AY 2017 -18 employees contribute toward the cost of a TriMet (regional public transit ) pass. The amoun t of contribution is $8 per month for employees and $ 25 per quarter from students . This annual pass provides unlimited travel throughout the Portland transit system, for any desired use by the individual holder of the pass. As a price comparison, i ndividual s may purchase a 30 day (1 month) pass for $100 per month ($28 per month for Honored Citizens) directly from Tri -Met. The salaries of seven individuals were reduced including the president, vice presid ents, and program deans. The hours of 14 individuals were reduced . Eight positions requested during the budget preparation process were not funded Two employee s retired early. The hours of five faculty who were full-time in AY 2016 -17 were reduced, resulting in their move to adjunct status. These changes were communicated to the NUNM community through several meetings as well as in personal meetings with individuals experiencing a reduction in hours or separat ion from the university. On June 5, 2017, a meeting was held to which all budget unit heads ( a total of approximately 44 people ) were invited . On June 6, an all -staff meeting covered the same areas, as did a meeting with Faculty Senate on June 7. Due to the proactive measures were taken in May and June of 2017, NUNM was able to maintain stability in service to patients and students. The reduction in spending and improved revenues allowed for some benefits to be restored in fall 2017/winter 2018. NUNM was able to provide employees with a three percent (3%) cost of living pay increase in January 2018 , several positions which were previously unfilled have begun the hiring process, and employees who had their hours reduced will have their hours returne d. NWCCU Year One Report Page 7 of 28 March 2018 Preface The AY 201 -18 budget did account for t he implementation of several projects which were accommodated in the budget. These include: Construction of a new building adjacent to the clinic funded through money from a SNAP bond issued through the State of Oregon Facilities Authority, in collaboration w ith Pacific Continental Bank. The new b uilding will be a modern, multi -purpose, educational facility to house new programming and to expand support for existing programming, providing increased revenue opportunity and services. The d emolition of service building will provide parking for the Lair Hill Health Center and the new building. The rollout July 1, 2017 , of a new f aculty compensation system developed in consultation with the Fa culty Senate that is uniform for all schools and colleges and, in addition to work units for teaching, includes work units for scholarly act ivity such as research. (Note this change is supportive of addressing Recommendation 6 from the Year Seven Peer - Evaluation Report. ) An Instructional Design and Technology department was created . This department will support the institution in the design and rollout of online distance education programs providing services to current and potential students , and includes educational offerings for faculty in support of Recommendation 4. RESPONSE TO TOPICS PR EVIOUSLY REQUESTED B Y THE COMMISSION (I.E., ADDENDA ) Following the NWCCU Year Seven Peer -Review Report, NUNM received continued accreditation with eight recommendations. Below are the eight recommendations: 1. The evaluation committee recommends that program assessment plans be implemented to identify achie vement of student learning outcomes that reflect norms and equivalencies in higher education [Standard 2.C.1 and 2.C.3]. 2. The committee recommends that program assessment plans be made more conducive to continuous improvement by including baselines/tar gets, clarifying faculty involvement, and incorporating data in program assessment [Standards 2.C.1; 4.A.1; 4.A.5; 4.A.6; 4.B.1]. 3. The committee recommends that the institution provide assessment support at the institutional level, including implementa tion, evaluation, and feedback to promote continuous improvement [Standards 3.A.3, 4.A.2, 4.A.3, 4.A.4, 4.B.2]. 4. The committee recommends that the University provide appropriate training opportunities in instructional design, instructional delivery, an d assessment of student learning in support of faculty in their roles, duties, and responsibilities [Standard 2.B.3]. 5. The committee recommends that the National University of Natural Medicine devote purposeful attention and planning focused on multicu lturalism, cultural competency, and inclusion throughout the institution to respond to the emerging patterns, trends, and expectations of the internal and external environments [Standard 5.B.3]. 6. The committee recommends that the University provide ins titutional support for faculty to pursue research and grant opportunities commensurate with the institution's expectations [Standard 2.B.5]. NWCCU Year One Report Page 8 of 28 March 2018 Preface 7. As a continuation of Recommendation 2 of the Year Three Report (Spring 2014), the committee recommends the Boa rd review and revise the Bylaws' Article VIII.3.(b) to reflect financial practices [Standard 2.A.6]. 8. The committee recommends that the University review fiscal planning to ensure adequate resources are available for the institution to demonstrate fina ncial stability with sufficient cash flow and reserves to support its ongoing programs and services in addition to program expansion [Standard 2.F.1]. In addition to the eight recommendations, the NWCCU has requested Ad -Hoc progress reports and a Mid-Cycle Report over a three year period. Here are the required reports and time frames. NUNM has submitted the first requested Ad Hoc Report for Recommendation 8 for review in November 2017 . Fall 2017: Ad Hoc Report without a visit to be submitted by December 1, 2017, to address Recommendation 8 of the Spring 2017 Year Sever Peer -Evaluation Report; Spring 2018: Ad Hoc Report without a visit in spring 2018 to address Recommendation 7 of the Spring 2017 Year Seven Peer -Evaluation Report; Spring 2019: Ad Hoc Re port without a visit in spring 2019, to address Recommendations 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Spring 2017 Year Sever Peer -Evaluation Report; Spring 2020: Ad Hoc Report without a visit in Spring 2020, to address Recommendation 5 of the Spring 2017 Year Sever Peer -Evaluation Report; Mid-Cycle Report with an addendum to address Recommendations 6 of the Spring 2017 Year Sever Peer -Evaluation Report. NUNM has considered these recommendations in the development of our new Seven Year Self - Evaluation core themes, indica tors, and objectives in support of these recommendations. NUNM has formed an Institutional Assessment Committee (IAC), to provide guidance in the development of new indicators, objectives , and thresholds which reflect addressing concerns from Recommendatio ns 1, 2, & 3 . Members of the IAC include program deans, associate deans, managers , and di rectors from student and alumni support functions, admissions, and finance. Also , the Student Government Association and the Board of Directors have shared information regarding objectives and indicators in the development of the next Seven Year Self -Evaluation cycle. Several of the recommendations, specifically Recommendations 4, 5, and 6, are reflected in the newly developed objectives and indicators and are include d in the AY 2017 -18 budget. Plans for the implementations for programmatic assessment committees, composed of faculty , staff, and students are in the process of being formed. Recommendations 4 & 6 are reflected in Core Theme 2, Objective 1: Provide compr ehensive and effective support to faculty in continuously improving their competency as educators. In July 2017, NUNM rolled out a new faculty compensation system which provide s compensation for research and other scholarly activities. In addition , NUNM ha s budget ed to hire a curriculum designer for online and on ground curriculum development. The curriculum designer will educate and train faculty on instructional design, instructional delivery, and assessment of student learning outcomes. NWCCU Year One Report Page 9 of 28 March 2018 Preface Recommendation 5 is supported by a new objective to Core Theme 3: Foster a culturally safe environment that creates a sense of belonging. There are three indicators chosen for the new objective which include recruitment, retention , and infrastructure that support faculty , staff , students , and patients . NUNM has begun to address Recommendation 5 by moving the Office of Equity and Inclusion from the Student Life department to Human Resources Office . The goal of this move is to ensure that the Office of Equity and Inclusion has a broader influence on the NUNM community. In addition to a change in reporting structure , the intercultural engagement and support manager received a position title change to the director of equity and inclusion . The director of equity and inclusion , working in conjunction with the VP of human resources, has disseminated online training to all employees to introduce them to the new initiatives and education on equity and inclusion on campus. They are in the process of creating a diversity , equity , and inclusion institutional strategic plan which aims to strengthen the appreciation, celebration and awareness of diversity in race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, disabilities, age and veteran status for stud ent, staff, and faculty . The plan will encourage students, faculty , and staff to take an active role in fostering a sense of belonging and model values that celebrate differences and provide a set of resources that will be helpful in NUNM's journey towards greater cultural awareness. The retention of students and employees component of the Diversity, Inclusion and Equity Strategic Plan has begun with a series of six (6) hour workshops focusing on racial equity. In Spring 2018, NUNM will submit an Ad Hoc Re port for Recommendation 7 stating that the NUNM Board of Directors reviewed their Bylaws' Article VIII.3.(b), and made required changes to reflect their financial practices. In fall 2017, NUNM submitted an Ad Hoc Report to address Recommendation 8 of the Spring 2017 Year Sever Peer -Evaluation Report. Specifically, NUNM provided documentation regarding program -specific financial metrics and assessments, the independ ent auditor's report and the NUNM Fram ework for Action III and Business Plan. The Ad Hoc Repo rt for Recommendation 8 was accepted by the NWCCU as of February 2018 and is considered fulfilled. NUNM created new pro forma tools to prioritize programmatic rollout and implementation work to ensure adequate resources and financial viability of new programs and initiatives based on the rigor of planning, the timing of implementation, and the close monitoring of actuals: the University Review and Approval Process (URAP) (appendix D) and the New Initiatives for This Year (NIFTY) worksheets (appendix E). The URAP replaces the previous Pre -Program Questionnaire as a pro forma in evaluating and implementing new program opportunities. The URAP is a planning and management process that assess es the development of all university initiatives that affect cash flow, capital planning, and long-term fiscal viability. Chief among the URAP's foci are new programming offerings to ensure mission fit and fulfillment, multi -year budgetary expense and projected revenue implications and evaluation outcomes of new programs. Any new institutional initiatives require coordinated support from a number of moving parts and must align with the university's mission, vision, purpose , and values. There are several re quired approval stages of new programmatic initiatives, including a budget analysis for the first four years of enrollment. One aspect of the URAP involves the use of the NIFTY forms, which allow programmatic planning to unfold. The NIFTY form s provide fo r the assembling of verified data and sign -offs that cumulatively assess the viability of specific projects, including programmatic goals from a holistic perspective by involving key stakeholders, including the faculty, students, deans, facilities, and fin ance and administration. It is through this process that systemic fiscal and facilities planning and evaluation occur NWCCU Year One Report Page 10 of 28 March 2018 Preface based on university -defined standards to meet the institutional mission. The NIFTY process requires a budget outline which sets the expect ation for new programs to be verifiably self -funded by the fourth year of operation. NUNM understands the complexity of funding new programs, which is why NUNM is in the process of establishing a new program development fund. The new fund will be designed to cover the rollout costs of new programs in the first three years. During the fourt h year, any tuition surplus from the new program will be placed back into the development fund, which will then be used to help establish new program development rollout. The goal of the new program development fund is to set aside between $100,000 - $300,00 0 over the next 3 -5 years. NWCCU Year One R eport Page 11 of 28 March 2018 Mission, Core Themes, and Expectations STANDARD ONE - MISSIO N, CORE THEMES, AND EXPECTATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 2 AND 3 2. AUTHORITY NUNM is authorized by the State of Oregon , HECC Office of Degree Authorization, to offer and confer degrees through oversight of the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

Conferred degrees in this state under the same control for a t least five consecutive years; and 3. Is accredited by a regional accrediting association or its national successor.\" As an independent university in Oregon that has met the conditions stated here above, a license was issued to NUNM to grant degrees in the state of Oregon. This license shall remain in effect as long as NUNM continues to meet the conditions listed above. See appendix F. 3. MISSION AND CORE THEMES The mission of NUNM is \"to educate and train physicians, practitioners , and pre-professionals i n the art, science and research of natural medicine .\" The NUNM Board formally adopted three Core Themes that provide further definition of the mission statement : Supporting Student Success - support successful learning; Teaching and Learning - deliver ed ucation that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research; and Professional Vitality - promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors. The institution currently offers the following graduate or first professional degrees: Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) , Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM) , Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) , Master of Science in In tegrative Me dicine Research (MSi MR), Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN), Master of S cience in Global Health (MScGH), Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH ), Master of Science in Sports Medicine (MScSM) , and Master of Science in Ayurveda (MScA) . NUNM offers two undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health. In fall of 2018, NUNM will offer a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Therapeutics - Massage Track. Virtually all revenues generated at NUNM are budgeted and expended for the education, research, and patient care activities contemplated by its mission statement. Institutional policies preclude the use of funds for unbudgeted expenditures unless approved by the appropriate board and execut ive officers. Such policies ensure the utilization of institutional resources solely for the advancement of the mission of the institution. Bylaws preclude the board of directors from receiving compensation for their services on the b oard. NWCCU Year One Report Page 12 of 28 March 2018 Standard 1.A Mission STANDARD 1.A. MISSION NUNM Mission Statement: To educate and train physicians, practitioners, and pre-professionals in the art, science, and research of natural medicine. The board holds the ultimate responsibility for the NUNM mission statement. The statement is posted throughout campus and documented within the university catalog (page 1) and on the university website: http://nunm.edu/about/getting -to-know/vision -mission/ . (1.A.1) All institutional planning , as guided by our strategic plan, the Framework for Action III (appendix B ) originates with the NUNM mission, vision, and core values. Accordingly, the mission statement for NUNM is a regular topic of board planning retreats. If the board , in its ongoing discussions, believes that the mission would benefit from revision in guiding t he direction of the institution, it initiates a review process. The most recent community review took place in fall 2010 and was formally approved at the June 2011 plenary meeting after a participatory review process that included students, faculty, staff, and the full board. Similar processes were followed in 2004 -05 for the mission revision approved in 2005. (1.A.1) The prior mission statement - To educate and train physicians and practitioners in the art and science of natural medicine - was revised in 2011 to reflect programmatic and institutional expansion in research activities. The addition of pre-professionals was indicative of the institutional decision to develop undergraduate degree programs that support the core medical programs of the instituti on, as well as our movement toward university status, which u nder Oregon Administrative Rule 583 -030-0016, is a term reserved for institutions authorized to offer bachelor together with graduate or first professional degrees . (1.A.1) The 2010 -11 mission review was preceded by a review that began in 2008 of examining and aligning NUNM's purpose, vision, values, and mission. The rationale of this process was to create an Alignment Model (see next page) that ensures consistency, congruency, clarity, and effective communication, decision -making, and problem -solving . The model, which continues to guide the institution, has an upper and lower level, similar in shape to an hourglass. (1.A.2) In the upper level (the purview of the board) are the overarching product, purpose, vision, and valu es of the institution. 1. The Product of our Product is HealThySelf (or Healthy Self). 2. The purpose statement is: \"Promote and exemplify health, sustainable living, and self -healing through education, research, and service.\" 3. The NUNM vision is: \"NUNM is the known leader in natural medicine education.\" 4. Below the vision are the institutional values: respect, integrity, creativity/innovation, commitment, and excellence. The lower level is the realm of NUNM's Schools and Colleges, administrative committ ees, councils, teams, and departments. The mission and the strategies to accomplish the mission are in the lower level of the hourglass. (1.A.2) This model includes the premise that to solve a problem, one needs to use a higher level of thinking than that which caused the problem. To resolve an issue, it is addressed in a higher level of the alignment model than where the issue is occurring. (1.A.2) NWCCU Year One Report Page 13 of 28 March 2018 Standard 1.A Mission NWCCU Year One Report Page 14 of 28 March 2018 Standard 1.A Mission In the planning processes that led to NUNM's Year One Report, the steering committee, with i nput from student and faculty constituencies, reviewed the three Core Themes identified by the community to guide the prior seven -year process. The committee recommended no core theme changes . The steering committee then utilized input from the prior Seven Year Comprehensive Self -Evaluation, and campus constituents reviewed the objectives and indicators for alignment with the core themes and the programming offered at NUNM. The feedback and revi ew process for the objectives , indicators , and recommendations resulted in modifications to improve assessment of the level of achievement of the core themes as well as mission fulfillment. The revised mission fulfillment indicators were ratified by the AAC and approved by the full board on November 3, 2017. (1.A.2) The graphic below reflects a pictorial overview of the core themes and objectives derived from these themes. Changes from the prior cycle are in italics. (1.A.2) These are the selected in dicators for mission fulfillment: Student attrition data (Core Theme 1, Objective 2) First-time pass rates on clinical entrance , exit exams , or capstone projects (see individual program details under Core Theme 2, objective 2 First-time pass rates for g raduates of the first professional degree programs for the NPLEX (Naturopathic Medicine) and NCCAOM (Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine) examinations Indicators from Core Theme 3, Objective 2, ensuring philosophical roots of natural medicine in curricula One-year-from -graduation placement data Indicators addressing Core Theme 3, Objective 3, \"Foster a culturally safe environment that creates a sense of belonging .\" NWCCU Year One Report Page 15 of 28 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes STANDARD 1.B.

Indicators: a. Accepted applicants in all programs meet or exceed target ed non-cognitive admissions criteria. o For clinical programs : All accepted applicants will score a minimum of a 3 on a 1 -5 assessment scale for each of the six non-cognitive indicators and more than 50% of accepted applicants will achieve a total score of at least 24 points. o For non -clinical progra ms: Applicants are scored on a scale of 1 -5 on seventeen non - cognitive criteria for a total of 85 possible points. All accepted applicants will achieve a total scor e of at least 51 points. b. On average, accepted applicants meet or exceed targeted GPA standar ds for admissions with a threshold of 3.3 GPA in college courses for graduate -level programs and 3.0 in college courses for undergraduate programs. Non-cognitive Admissions Criteria The first objective reflects our commitment to ensuring that all accepted applicants are prepared for the rigors awaiting them in medical, graduate or undergraduate study. NUNM practices a holistic application review process, which evaluates academic prepa redness as well as non -cognitive skill sets. Indicators were selected to assess the efficacy of both the academic and non -academic standards used during the admissions process. For our clinical programs, NUNM utilizes a set of six non -academic , which are evaluated on a 1 -5 scale during the interview process for a maximum total score of 30 points (see appendix G ). Success will be achieved in this indicator when all accepted applicants score a minimum of a 3 on each of the six indicators , and when more than 50% of accepted applicants achieve a total score of at least 24 points. We have not met our goal of 100% for this part of the indicator. Because this indicator is only one part of the holistic application review, these non -cognitive skills do not solely inform admission decisions. For fall 2017, 89.6% scored a total of at least 24 points on the assessment scale which does meet our indicator. ACCEPTED APPLICANTS S CORING 3 OR HIGHER IN EVERY N ON-COGNITIVE CRITERION 2014 2015 2016 2017 93.9% 97.5% 94.7% 95.17 Starting with our fall 2018 application cycle, we will be rating all other applicants in non -clinical programs on a set of non -academic criteria as well. NUNM will utilize a set of seventeen non -academic criteria . These criteria were implemented as faculty for other programs requested more comparable, measurable information on their applicants. The Office of Admissions researched methods utilized in the industry and presented these criteria for faculty approval. Applicants are ranked b y their references on a form submitted along with their letters of recommendation (see appendix H ). Each portion of the rubric is rated on a 1 -5 scale, for a maximum total score of 85 points. This scale is asking the reference to rank the applicant in comp arison to others the reference has known in a similar capacity. The threshold for this chosen non - academic indicator is as follows: All accepted applicants will achieve a total score of at least 51 points. GPA Standards for Admissions The second tenet of preparedness is previous academic success. NUNM's holistic application review includes consideration of four different GPAs: cumulative, prerequisite, science, and extended science. Each of the four is seen as an indicator of past academic success. Of th ese, science GPA is seen as the best NWCCU Year One Report Page 17 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes predictor of academic readiness for the core curricula of the Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine. NUNM determined an average science GPA of 3.3 to be an appropriate indicator of academic success; t his goal was established based on historical trends. We have met our goal for this indicator. Of the accepted applicant pools from fall 2014 to fall 2017, the mean science GPA is 3.36. AVERAGE SCIENCE GPA OF ACCEPTED NATUROPA THIC AND CLASSICAL CHINESE MEDICINE APPL ICANTS 2014 2015 2016 2017 3.39 3.34 3.37 3.34 The degree programs in the School of Graduate Studies require prerequisite courses in math, biology, and psychology. Three of the five programs also require some form of chemistry . Success in these courses is an indicator of a foundation for coursework. The School of Graduate Studies degree programs do not require admission interviews, but rather place emphasis on experience, rationale for interest in the program, and the intention for the degree, among others. NUNM has determined an average cumulative GPA of 3.3 to be an appropriate indicator of success in graduate school. We have met our goal for this indicator. Of the accepted appl icant pools from fall 2014 to fall 2017, the mean cumulative GPA among classes is 3.36. AVERAGE GPA OF GRADUATE STUDIES APPLICANTS 2014 2015 2016 2017 3.32 3.39 3.36 3.37 The two undergraduate degrees offered, a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences and a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, are designed to prepare graduates for careers in integrative health. We have determined a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be an estimated appropriate indicator of success. NUNM transfers in credits of courses with a GPA of 2.0 or higher, while evaluating courses in the general education curriculum to ascertain future academic success. We have GPA data for two entering clas s, the cohorts that matriculated in fall 2016 and 2017, provided below. We will continue collecting information and looking at student performance to determine the appropriate standards for this population. CUMULATIVE GPA OF UNDERGRADUATE INCOMING CLASS 2016 2017 3.26 3.20 We are separately looking at each applicant's foundation in the natural sciences, collecting data to aid us in determining whether this is a mark of future success at NUNM. Core Theme I, Objective 2 : Foster systems that support stud ent success Indicators : a. Students who use specific interventions have a lower rate of probation than the overall student population. The rate of probation is 4% for students who use specific interventions. b. On the student satisfaction survey, satisfaction with targeted support services meets or exceeds specified thresholds. No targeted area will have a mean response of lower than 7.5 and the overall mean will be 8.0 or higher on a 10 -point satisfaction scale. c. Student attrition is 5% or less overall and in specific, targeted demographics: gender, age, racial/ethnic identity, disabilities, English as a second language, international student status, distance education, concurrent enrollment in more than one program, recipients of Oregon opportunity grant (unde rgraduates only) and Pell grants. NWCCU Year One Report Page 18 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes Rate of Probation NUNM provides a wide range of academic and non -academic support services to support student success, retention , and persistence . The following support services were identified as key interventions in s tudent success and retention: tutoring, counseling, and intercultural support. Students who use these services are expected to show a lower rate of probation then the overall rate. Considering NUNM's annual probation rate of 6%, a threshold was established of 4% probation for students who use tutoring, counseling, and intercultural support. Student satisfaction with targeted support services Student satisfaction with targeted support services was chosen as an indicator of meeting the objective of supporting student success. The annual student satisfaction survey captures the level of student satisfaction on a 10 point scale with 1 reflecting low and 10 a high level of satisfaction. In targeted areas , the goal is that no area will have a mean respon se of lower than 7.5 and that the ove rall mean will be 8.0 or higher. Thresholds were established by taking into consideration our prior performance in these areas, requiring the institution to stretch to meet the thresholds. See appendix I for an overvie w of mean results in targeted areas since 2013 . Student attrition data each year is 5% or less Student attrition data was chosen as the second indicator for this objective. Due to the complexities of students enrolling in more than one degree program and sometimes moving from program to program or taking a leave from only one program, a specific formula was created for the purposes of this indicator: comparing fall student headcount numbers with the number who separated from the institution by the end of summer quarter. Initially, the numbers are inflated in that some students are on a one year leave and may return. Numbers are later corrected if students return. The target is that each year attrition for the institution as a whole will be 5% or less. The table below provides data for the last three years. We have met our goal to-date through 2015 -16. The numbers for 2016 -17 are not yet final. NUNM INSTITUTIONAL ATTRITION 2013 -2017 Year Separated from NUNM Fall Enrollment (Headcount) Institutional attrition rate 2013 -14 16 570 2.8% 2014 -15 29 617 4.7% 2015 -16 26 635 4.1% 2016 -17 45 653 6.9% Student attrition and related data is a good indicator of mission fulfillment, as well as planning for the future. For example, compiled data indicated that transfer students and minority students are more likely to wind up on academic probation than their peers, which can lead to dismissal or voluntary withdraw al. Student Life tracks the reasons students have left NUNM, which supports examination of the patterns that can lead to academic and behavioral challenges and, potentially, separation from the institution. Analysis of patterns of comments in response to surveys such as the annual student satisfaction survey augments data such as attrition statistics. A number of expanded services for which we first planned, then projected into the budget, and finally implemented, were discussed in the NUNM Year Seven Rep ort, and it is our intention to continue to utilize data in the coming cycle to improve supports to student learning success. In the prior cycle, NUNM generated an internal suggestion that we expand this indicator to include regular analysis of data to in clude identifications of patterns within separation as well as academic probation data. NUNM will break out attrition into the following demographics to identify patterns of separation: gender, age, racial/ethnic identity, disabilities, English as a second language, international student status, distance education, concurrent enrollment in more than one program, recipients of Oregon opportunity grant (undergraduates only) and Pell grants. NWCCU Year One Report Page 19 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes CORE THEME II - TEACHING AND LEARNING Deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research Rationale for Core Theme II : Teaching and Learning NUNM strives to deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research. The objectives chosen provide further clarification to this core theme. The first objective assigned to the theme of Teaching and Learning aims to strengthen the academic integrity of our instruction al design and a ssessment practices. The second identifies measures toward ensuring that all graduates achieve the minimum competency standards of their individual program. The third objective seeks to ensure that these competencies and practices hold true to the philosophical roots of natural medicine as defined by each of our degree programs. Core Theme II, Objective 1 : Provide comprehensive and effective support to faculty in continuously improving their competency as educators. Indicators : a. 95% of full -time and 50% of adjunct faculty will have completed a faculty development workshop in comprehensive instructional design and delivery within three years. b. 25% of courses taught by full -time faculty will be observed and evaluated each academic y ear c. An in -depth analysis, including evaluation of course syllabi and documents, will be completed for any faculty member with a score of 3.5 or less on a course evaluation. d. 95% of full time and 50% of adjunct faculty will have created an instructional design and delivery action plan within three years. This objective replaces, \"Provide support to faculty in improving their teaching skills.\" Our internal recommendations from the Year Seven Comprehensive Self -Evaluation Report included a revision to the indicators for this objective. Academic researchers have found that student learning is heavily dependent on the quality of the instruction students receive in the classroom. NUNM is committed to supporting faculty in continuously improving teaching an d research skills. In the July 2017, NUNM created a new department focused on instructional design. The purpose of this department is to help faculty with curriculum design and implementation, in on -ground and online learning environments that incorporate active learning techniques in the classroom, writing clear and meaningful learning outcomes, helping students develop critical thinking skills, assessing student learning, and more. In spring 2018, a curriculum designer is scheduled to be hired to assist in this process. In addition, NUNM will be continuing to fund its IAMSE membership for the coming academic year ($600 annually), which could provide support for faculty training. These efforts, coupled with efforts from the faculty senate on gauging facul ty interest in teaching , learning, research, and grant -writing topics will help guide these efforts. Training and professional development opportunities will include pre/post evaluations to assess faculty satisfaction and improvement in delivery , researc h, and teaching skills, effectiveness and improvement, and classroom applicability over time. Faculty will be evaluated in an overall assessment through an observation -based course delivery evaluation, a program dean evaluation, and specifically -targeted questions on the student course evaluations. A standardized rubric will be created to be used pull together a cumulative assessment of faculty in their continuous teaching skills. The information gathered will be used to assist the faculty members in the cr eation of their instructional design and delivery action plan. NWCCU Year One Report Page 20 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes Core Theme II , Objective 2 : Deliver curricula that enable students to achieve clearly articulated program outcomes. Indicators : a. First-time pass rates on clinical entrance and exit exams with an 85% success threshold; 70% warning threshold. This indicator applies to with a clinical component: MScA, MSiMH, ND, DSOM, MSOM, and NPLEX (School of ND) and NCCAOM (School of CCM) license board exams. 90% success thr eshold; 75% warning threshold. c. In programs without a clinical component, student achievement is measured by pass rates in final projects with the following thresholds: o MSiMR first oral defens e: 90% student pass rate; warning of 80%. o MScN case based final report: 80% of students pass with a grade of 80% the first time; warning threshold of 75% o MScGH written and oral presentation of practical fieldwork: 80% of students pass with a grad e of 80% the first time ; warning threshold of 75% o MScSM capstone project: 80% of students pass with a grade of 80 % the first time ; warning threshold of 75% o SUS capstone project: 80% of students pass with a grade of 80% the first time ; warning threshold of 75% This objective replaces, \" Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure that all graduates achieve the minimum competency standards\" to be more inclusive of clinical and non -clinical degree offerings and to take into consideration the utilization of da ta to make changes to curricula or the evaluation process. The central focus of this objective is to ensure our classroom and clinical instruction provides students with the competencies needed for a successful career in their chosen profession. Through the use of collected data on student results, we will be able to make changes to the curricula that are reflective of the standards expected of students upon completion of their degree(s). For the clinical programs, the success of our students in achieving the programmatic competencies assessed in relation to the es sential outcome for first professional medical graduates and prepares them for a career as a medical practitioner. For our non -clinical programs, producing high -quality educational end -products such as capstone projects demonstrates the program outcomes through critical thinking and reasoning. Though evaluation of student end -products, we are able to assess the delivery of curriculum that culminates in skills such as ethics, personal and professional responsibility, research and information literacy, comm unication and teamwork. Measuring the percentage of students who pass the key program outcome milestones provides needed feedback for assessing where students need additional support and what aspects of the curriculum are in need of improvement. Core Theme II, Objective 3 : Ensure the inclusion of natural medicine philosophical roots in curricula design Indicators : a. 25% of courses have competencies that map to a philosophical roots program outcomes b. Mean agreement on exit survey questions related to philosophical roots. A mean response of 1.5 on a four-point agreeme nt scale where 1=strongly agree NWCCU Year One Report Page 21 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes This objective replaces, \"Ensure the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines \".to be more inclusive o f our non -clinical degree. The first objective assigned to the theme of Teaching and Learning aims to strengthen the academic integrity of our instructional design and assessment practices through curriculum mapping. The second objective ensure s that these competencies and practices hold true to the essential mission of the college \u2014 \"To educate and train physicians, practitioners and pre-professionals in the art, science and research of natural medicine .\" For our clinical programs, the inclusion of the philosophical roots is incorporated at numerous points throughout the curriculum. For the naturopathic medicine program, since its founding in 1956, it has prided itself as a vanguard of the nature cure princ iples upon which the medicine was founded. This is reflected in the following education outcome of the program: \"Historical/Scientific Knowledge Base - Draw on the wisdom of ancient medical traditions and historical knowledge; and contribute to and apply emerging scientific research to serve the needs of the patient, the profession, and society.\" In the 1990s with the Chinese medicine program was introduced, its expressed intention was to revive the ancient wisdom and practices of the medicine, largely lost in Chinese medicine education worldwide during the 20th century. The mission of the School of Classical Chinese Medicine expresses this commitment \"to transmit the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine to cultivate clinical practitioners rooted in t he ancient tradition of the medical scholar.\" For our non -clinical programs, specific courses a re identif ied to be inclusive of natural medicine philosophical roots. For example, in the School of Graduate Studies, the Master of Science in Integrative Medi cine Research program includes a course called: Introduction to Integrative Health and Medicine. The course description includes the following statement: \"This course explains the basic philosophies and practices of Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, homeopathy, shamanic healing, and other integrative medicine practices.\" In the School of Undergraduate and Part -Time Studies the course, the Introduction to Integrative Medicine introduces students to a variety of modalities including botanical medicine and world systems such as Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines. The Helfgott Research Institute aims to use the latest scientific thinking and methodologies to investigate natural medicines in a manner that honors their foundational principles. Progr ammatic level results from annual exit opinion surveys of the graduating classes will be used for capturing data for these indicators. NWCCU Year One Report Page 22 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes CORE THEME THREE - PROFESSIONAL VITALITY Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and res earch endeavors Core Theme III , objective 1 : Prepare and support our graduates to work within the professions for which they are trained. Indicators : a. Indicator: Employment data o In survey results, 85% of alumni are employed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree. o 85% of graduates are employed one year a fter graduation in their fields (excluding those who are still enrolled in a degree program at an accredited college or university ) o One year after graduation, 50% of graduates from bachelor degree programs go on to enroll in a graduate or professional program. b. Indicator: Students and graduates have access to career support services o Each year, NUNM will produce enough continuing education to meet the annual license renewal requirements for any professional license in which obtaining the license is identified as an object ive of a NUNM academic program. o Attendance of alumni events by graduates three years out. 30% of three -year-out alumni will attend at least one CE event each year. o When surveyed, 85% of CE participants report that they agree with the following statements: My skills or knowledge have increased as a result of this seminar/workshop. I will be able to apply what I learned in my profession. o 10% of currently enrolled students have resumes uploaded to the My Career database. Employment data This objective includes three indicators toward measuring succ essful employment within their field of study. The first captures data from alumni s urveys, which occur s every two-three years with a 20 -30% response. Survey results are augmented with data collected by the office of Career Services, with a response rate o f close to 100%. The career service manager contacts graduates of the prior academic year to capture one-year employment information. As students complete bachelor's degrees programs, the office will also begin to collect data on the number of bachelor deg ree graduates that enroll in post -graduate programs. Career Support Services The second indicator for this objective is designed to ensure the adequacy of career support services to students and alumni. The first identified support service is continuing education to meet professional licensing requirements of alumni. Graduates who wish to pr actice naturopathic or Chinese medicine must meet annual requirements of 50 or 15 hours of CE, respectively. The CE department will provide enough CE hours to meet these requirements, with a threshold of at lea st 1000 hours of naturopathic credits and at least 150 hours of acupuncture credits per year. This indicator was updated from a recommendation in the previous cycle to track hours rather than a number of events, which are not comparable in length. To determine whether CE offerings are meeting the ne eds of NUNM graduates , the department will also look at the satisfaction with events and the percentage of alumni in attendance, with a threshold of 30% attendance by alumni in the first three years after graduation. This threshold was developed to account for the fact that not all alumni remain in Oregon. Those outside of Oregon have access to online offerings but are generally excluded from in -person events. This new threshold will be adjusted if necessary after the first year of data collection. Satisfac tion with events will be determined through post -event satisfaction surveys with a rate of 85% agreement to identified questions. Since developing our first s et of Core Themes in 2011, NUNM has grown to include several programs that are not expected to lead to professional licensing. This indicator has been expanded to include job - NWCCU Year One Report Page 23 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes seeking support provided through the MyCareer database , which is hosted by the offices of Career Services and Alumni Services . MyCareer connects students with easy online access to career resources such as jobs, internships, and other exper iential learning opportunities. The number of uploaded student resumes will provide an indicator as to the utility of this newly acq uired system, with a threshold of 10% utilization rate by currently enrolled students. Core Theme III, Objective 2 : Prepare students to engage in scholarly activities that contribute to a culture of inquiry. Indicators : b. Indicator: Students are prepared to design and conduct research. o 25% of courses will have one or more research competencies. c. Indicator : Advance the exposure to scholarly research and evidence -based medicine (EBM) on campus. o 80% of graduate students believe they are proficien t in reading research literature and interpreting study findings. o 80% of graduate students believe they are able to use online databases to access medical literature. o 80% of undergraduate s believe they are proficient at finding and reading primary and seco ndary sources of information o 80% of undergraduate s believe they are able to use online databases to access medical literature. d. Indicator: Engagement in the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity. o 75% of the SGA scholarship fund is used. o The Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chine se Medicine will each offer a forum per quarter. o The School of Graduate Studies will each provide a Speaker Series that ensures that the educational content of each program w ithin the School is supported by a minimum of one presentation per quarter. o The School of Undergraduate S tudies will host at least 3 outside guest lecturers a year per program. Students are prepared to design and conduct research. Each program has developed a set of research competencies aligned to courses in each curriculum. At least 25% of all courses are expected to map to at least one programmatic research competency in each program . See res earch competencies in appendix J . This indicator was de veloped to ensure that scholarly research and inquiry continue to be fundamental element across the fabric of every curriculum. Advance the exposure to scholarly research and evidence -based medicine (EBM) on campus. Central to the success of natural medic ine professionals is the ability to access, read and critically evaluate research literature. Competencies around research literacy are mapped throughout each program's respective curriculum. As they near graduation, students are asked on exit surveys to rate their attainment of research proficiencies, according to the level of study. A threshold was set for a positive response of 80%, where students either agree or strongly agree to attainment compet encies. Engagement in the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity. The Student Government Association of NUNM offers funding for students to attend conference s and professional development events. The goal of success is that 75% of this total fund be applied annually. In the 2015 -16 academic year, 94% of the scholarship fund was used. However, in the subsequent year, only 52% of the fund was used. More research is needed to understand the recent drop in inte rest. In addition to these opportunities, the Schools and Colleges of NUNM provide regular forums for enhancing the intellectu al curiosity of our students. Each school/ college will host a forum or lecture series to support the educational outcomes of its programs. These indicators were chosen to support the expansion of activities throughout the institution and are a simple accounting of whether the Colleges and Schools of NWCCU Year One Report Page 24 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes NUNM offer scholarly forums at which students can engage with peers and professional s in scholarly debate. The threshold for success is that there is at least one forum per qu arter during each academic year. Core Theme III, Objective 3 : Foster a culturally safe environment that creates a sense of belonging Indicators : a. Indicator: Students, faculty , and staff participate in regular trainings to promote a safe and inclusive environment. o 85% of current employees (faculty and staff) participate in webinar training o 100% of new hires participate in the on-boarding process o Trainings will be available to students, staff and faculty on the subjects of diversity, equity, inclusion, conflict resolution, safe disagreement, implicit bias and racism 101. NUNM will provide 5 -8 in-person training events. Each full -time faculty and staff member will attend at least one in -person event each year. A mean response of at least 4.5 on a set of post-event survey questions (see appendix K). b. Indicator: On the student cultural climate survey: a mean response of at least 4.5 on a six -point agreement scale for questions ti ed to a sense of belongingness (see appendix K). The evaluation team for our Year Seven Self-Evaluation Report suggested that we would b enefit from an institutional plan fo r our multiculturalism agenda. As discussed in our response to recommendation 5 (see pg. 10) , NUNM 's director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion has responded to the recommendation with a strategic plan on diversity, equity , and inclusion. Working with the director, t he Assessment Committee and the NWCCU Year One Steering Committee assigned a task force to create an objective that would support purposeful attent ion in this area. The task force identified \"fostering of a culturally safe environment that creates a sense of belonging \" as a good direction for our planning eff orts. Indicators reflect the populations targeted by the Office of Equity and Inclusion: students, staff , and faculty. Students, faculty and staff par ticipate in regular trainings The retention of students is a core principle in the Office of Equity's strategic plan, with a focus on employee training. The first component of training happens during the onboarding process, with targeted training sessions around diversity, equity, inclusion, conflict resolution, safe disagreement, implicit bias and racism 101. All new employees are expected to participate in this process with a threshold of 100%. The second component is required webinar trainings around the same concept, which employees are expected to complete annually, with a threshold of 85% participation. More in-depth workshops will also be made available for employees, as well as students, with a threshold of at least 5 -8 in-person training events pe r year, and with attendance of at least one training per year for full-time faculty and staff. A survey will gauge the impact of events with a threshold of 4.5 on six -point scale for targeted questions (see appendix K). Student Cultural Climate Survey A series of questions were developed for the student Cultural Climate Survey to gauge a sense of belongingness across student demographics including race, ethnicity , religion, natio nal origin, sexual orientation , body size, disabil ities, age and political aff iliation. The concept of belongingness is a well - researched concept often cited in academic research as a fac tor in student academic success (Hausmann et al., 2007 ; Hurtado & Carter, 1997 ; Osterman, 2000 ). Furthermore, a negative relationship can be seen between racial prejudice and a sense of belonging, leading to a negative effect on academic success. (Hurtado & Carter, 1997 ; Locks et al., 2008 ). Questions for this indicator were chosen based on research showing a direct or indirect effect on a sense of belongingness ( Glass & Westmont, 2014 ; Hurtado & Carter, 1997 ), and a thres hold of 4.5 was developed based on previous results of t he NUNM Cultural Climate Survey. See targeted questions in appendix K. NWCCU Year One Report Page 25 of 26 March 2018 Standard 1.B Core Themes CONCLUSION As a result of the Year Seven Self -Evaluation and growth of the university, new initiatives will be launched in the next seven -year cycle. The Year One report outlines these new initiatives with benchmarks for success towards mission fulfillment . Mission review NUNM's mission currently compasses our move toward university status which was obtain ed in 2016 as well as our move to include undergraduate education. The message of inclusion of all of our programs is evident in our mission statement, \"To educate and train physician and pre - professionals in the art, science and research of natural medicine .\" New strategic planning document that aids in goals and objectives for planning areas The board confirmed the goals and objectives outlined in the university's strategic plan document, the Framework for Action III, which serves as s guide in achieving the major themes for the self - evaluation process: Student Success, Teaching and Learning, and Professional Vitality. The self - evaluation team has created realistic overarching goals and objectives and selected indicators to measure achievements and iden tify areas of needed growth. NUNM's planning and self -evaluation processes are inclusive , with participation from students, faculty, staff, a lumni, and board members. As discussed in Chapter One, Section I, NCNM has implemented an Alignment Model that h as been widely distributed, discussed, and utilized throughout campus. This model guides our decision making and planning pro cesses as we work toward the fulfillment of our mission . It also provides direction in times of miscommuni cation or difference of opinion. We have implemented a planning structure that will facilitate the integration of changes identified through the self -evaluation process and continue to utilize our campus master planning process that is expected to identify the needs of the inst itution for the next 10 -20 years.
