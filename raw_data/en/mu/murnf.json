Here is a list of recommended supplements to help boost...", "sitename": "Gluten Free Society", "date": "2022-08-18", "cleaned_text": "Protecting Yourself During Cold & Flu Season Supporting your immunity during cold and flu season can have extremely high benefits. I will share that my family and I are not necessary fans of flu shots, and we opt to not receive them. Instead, we focus on natural ways to support our immune systems. Below is a list of nutrients, their functions, and supplements that I recommend you concentrate on when looking to support your immune system naturally. It also works very well for those with active viral and bacterial infections. You can use this protocol at the first sign of cold and/or flu like symptoms, or for general maintenance support. Vitamin C - I recommend [Detox C Powder](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/detox-c-gluten-free-vitamin-c-detox-powder/) or [Detox C Tabsules](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/detox-c-gluten-free/) Hundreds of research studies illustrate the important role that vitamin C plays in immune function. Many of these studies show benefit and protection of vitamin C in those infected with different viral types. Research has shown that vitamin C can help reduce the duration of the common cold. Detox C is a high potency vitamin C formula for those looking to boost their immune system. How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take 2 grams (2,000mg) of vitamin C per day. That would be either 2 Detox C Tabs/day with food OR 3/4 tsp of Detox C Powder/day with food. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Take 5 grams (5,000mg) of vitamin C per day. That would be either 5 Detox C Tabs/day, in divided doses, with food OR 1 3/4 tsp of Detox C Powder/day, in divided doses, with food. Zinc - I recommend [Ultra Zinc](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/ultra-zinc/) This mineral has more than 300 enzymatic functions in the human body. Many of these functions revolve around the immune system. Some of them include regulating the immune cells that help destroy viruses and bacteria, some include regulating the maturation and response of immune cells as a whole. Studies have shown that zinc supplementation shortens the duration of the common cold. The effect of zinc supplementation is enhanced when given with other vitamins and minerals. How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take between 25-50mg of zinc per day. That would be 1-2 Ultra Zinc Tabs/day, in divided dosed, with food. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Take between 75-100mg of zinc per day. That would be 3-4 Ultra Zinc Tabs/day, in divided dosed, with plenty of food. N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine - I recommend [Ultra NAC 500](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/general-health/ultra-nac-500/) NAC is an essential Amino Acid and it is a critical building block for the master antioxidant glutathione. It has been known to help reduce the symptoms of respiratory issues by loosening the mucus in your air pathways. This powerful amino acid is one of the most effective ways to potentially help reduce the symptoms of the cold or flu, and can even help shorten the length of time you're under the weather.* How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take 1,000mg of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine per day. That would be 2 Ultra NAC 500 caps/day, preferably on an empty stomach. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Take 2,000mg of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine per day. That would be 4 Ultra NAC 500 caps/day, in divided doses, preferably on an empty stomach. Quercetin - I recommend [Ultra Q](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/ultra-q/) The quercetin dihydrate in Ultra Q is the most absorbable and bioavailable form of quercetin available. It is a plant based bioflavonoid that supports healthy allergic & inflammatory responses, and it is well known for its antiviral and antioxidant benefits. One of the unique research proven properties of Quercetin is that it acts as a zinc ionophore. That means that it helps push zinc into cells where it can inhibit viral replication. How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take between 1,000-2,000mg of quercetin per day. That would be 1-2 Ultra Q Tabs/day, in divided dosed, with or without food. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Take between 3,000-4,000mg of quercetin per day. That would be 3-4 Ultra Q Tabs/day, in divided dosed, with or without food. Botanical + Nutrient Blend - I recommend [Virid](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/virid/) Using a powerful combination of key nutrients and botanical extracts can help provide immediate support for immune challenges. Immune boosting nutrients include L-lysine, Vitamins A, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Pantothenic Acid, and Zinc. Combined with a synergistic blend of botanical extracts black elderberry, astragalus, echinacea, and andrographis, all of which have been used traditionally for their clinically effective immunomodulating properties. Virid helps soothe throat irritations and promotes healthy inflammatory balance by increasing antioxidant levels throughout the body. How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take 2 capsules of Virid per day, with or without food. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Take 2 capsules every 2 hours, with or without food. Do not exceed 8 capsules/day. Vitamin D - I recommend [Liquid D3](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/liquid-d3-gluten-free-vitamin-d/) Numerous scientific studies show the benefit of vitamin D on immune function. A research review recently published in the [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/study-confirms-vitamin-d-protects-against-cold-and-flu/) showed that vitamin D helped to protect against both colds and flu. How Much to Take: For Immune Support & Maintenance - Take between 2,000-5,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 2-5 drops of Liquid D3/day. For those with cold or flu symptoms - Consider a higher dose, like 10,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 10 drops of Liquid D3/day, in divided doses. Or, Consider a Vitamin D Therapy Protocol - I recommend [Ultra D3](https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/shop/supplements/immune-support/vitamin-d3-50/) This is a high dose vitamin D therapy that lasts for 6 days. It works very well to help support natural immune function and is best used at the first sign of cold or flu. You should consider seeing your doctor to have your 25 OH D levels (a simple blood test) measured as well. This therapy has been used for years by doctors for many years and is very safe. However; it is contraindicated in people with kidney disease, sarcoidosis, or high blood calcium levels. If you have a kidney disease or abnormally high blood calcium, you should contact your doctor before attempting this therapy. You should also not perform this therapy more than 3 times per year without consulting your doctor. How Much to Take: For adults that weigh 150 pounds or more: - Day 1, 2, and 3 - Take 150,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 3 capsules/day of Ultra D3. - Day 4, 5, and 6 - Take 100,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 2 capsules/day of Ultra D3. - Discontinue... For adults that weigh less than 150 pounds: - Day 1, 2, and 3 - Take 100,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 2 capsules/day of Ultra D3. - Day 4, 5, and 6 - Take 50,000IU of vitamin D per day. That would be 1 capsule/day of Ultra D3. Conclusion I hope that you find this information helpful.
