In Taoism negative emotions - anger, sadness, depression, fear, and worry - are seen as low-grade energy that causes chronic disease and steals our major life force by creating energy blockages.

Complementary therapy involves a shift in the fields of body, mind and spirit matrix, so as to bring about a rectification of a state of disease that has gone out of balance. Consequently complementary healing involves interweaving all the strands of healing modalities: oncological treatments, qigong, meditation, nutrition, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, converging into a tidal force of cleansing against this most insidious dark assassin, cancer. If I have gone further it is by standing on the shoulders of great pioneers of Qigong healers and thus, it is with a deep sense of gratitude and humility that I share with you my own healing journey on the macabre battleground of cancer. May this book benefit all beings in their struggle with the darkness of disease and may they emerge victorious into the light of healing.

I have laboriously trudged through an interminable chain of hyperbolic sentences that beat around the bushes of the subject of cancer (What he felt when he was diagnosed with cancer, the history of western medicine's treatment, how he felt when he started having chemotherapy, etc etc on and on) without getting to what is supposed to be the core subject of this book: how he used QiGong to help himself get better. His style of writing is very bad so the whole thing is boring and un-engaging. maybe he does not want to share his secret? maybe he wants you to pay him for the classes?
