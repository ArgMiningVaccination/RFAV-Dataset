Out of them shines healing. They must create inner justice, peace, and conviction in the darkness of our time.\" ~ Karl K\u00f6nig The medieval initiation story of Parzival (also written Percival, Perceval, Parsifal and Peredure), a knight who goes in search of the Holy Grail, has been an archetypal and spiritual inspiration for many great thinkers, including Rudolf Steiner. There are several retellings of this story, most famously Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval epic poem and Richard Wagner's opera Parsifal. Wagner's Parsifal does not include Feirefiz, the Black brother of Parzival, as Eschenbach's story does. Why is this? It appears to be the tragic outcome of a worldview that places the white European narrative first - at the cost of other experiences, cultures, and races. Using the Parzival narrative as a foundation, and an exploration of themes of light and dark within music and art, this workshop series will explore questions around brother and sisterhood, inclusion, and race. We will also explore how ritual can be a healing structure to connect with the ostracized Other and build wholeness and inclusion in our society. Seen through this lens, the story of the quest for the Holy Grail can be reimagined more as a collective or collaborative social process, a journey to the Other, than as a singular quest for individual enlightenment. What: Exploring the Grail mysteries over the course of three workshops (plus a bonus performance session!). We will hear presentations on themes of color, tone, sound, ritual and more. We will also have the opportunity to explore our biographies and converse in pairs and groups. See below for the schedule and more details! When: May 22, June 5, and June 19, at 1pm Eastern/10 am Pacific for 75 min. via Zoom Can't join us live? Each gathering will be recorded and posted in our Participant Portal (link emailed upon registration). \"There is a knighthood of the 21st century whose riders do not ride through the darkness of forests, but through the forests of darkened minds.
