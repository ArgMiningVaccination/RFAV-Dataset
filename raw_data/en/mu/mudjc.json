Choking hazard Some Apple Watch bands may present a choking hazard to small children. Keep these bands away from small children. Skin sensitivities Some people may experience reactions to certain materials used in jewelry, watches, and other wearable items that are in prolonged contact with their skin. This can be due to allergies, environmental factors, extended exposure to irritants like soap, sweat, or other causes. You may be more likely to experience irritation from any wearable device if you have allergies or other sensitivities. If you have known skin sensitivities, please take special care when wearing Apple Watch. You may be more likely to experience irritation from Apple Watch if you wear it too tightly. Remove Apple Watch periodically to allow your skin to breathe. Keeping Apple Watch and the band clean and dry will reduce the possibility of skin irritation. If you experience redness, swelling, itchiness, or any other irritation or discomfort on your skin around, or beneath, your Apple Watch, please remove Apple Watch and consult your physician before resuming wear. Continued use, even after symptoms subside, may result in renewed or increased irritation. Apple Watch models with a stainless steel or aluminum case, the stainless steel portions of some Apple Watch bands, the metallic portions of Herm\u00e8s bands, and the magnets in the watch and bands contain some nickel. Nickel exposure from these materials is unlikely, but customers with known nickel allergies should be attentive when wearing them until they can determine they are not experiencing an allergic reaction. The Apple Watch case and the Apple Watch bands contain trace amounts of acrylates and methacrylates. Acrylates and methacrylates are found in many consumer products that come in contact with the skin, such as adhesive bandages. Some people may be sensitive to them, or may develop sensitivities over time. Apple Watch and its bands are designed so that parts containing acrylates and methacrylates are not in direct contact with your skin. The materials used in Apple Watch and the Apple Watch bands meet the standards set for jewelry by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, applicable European regulations, and other international standards.354 Apple Watch User GuideImportant handling information for Apple Watch Exposure to liquid Apple Watch is water resistant but not waterproof. You may, for example, wear and use Apple Watch during exercise (exposure to sweat is OK), in the rain, and while washing your hands. If water splashes onto the watch, wipe it off with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth. Try to minimize exposing Apple Watch to perfume, soap, solvents, detergent, acids or acidic foods, soapy water, insect repellent, lotions, sunscreen, oil, or hair dye. Follow the instructions below in the \"Cleaning and care\" section if Apple Watch comes into contact with them. Apple Watch Series 3, Apple Watch Series 4, Apple Watch Series 5, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation), and Apple Watch Series 8 have a water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010.

However, Apple Watch Series 3, Apple Watch Series 4, Apple Watch Series 5, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation), and Apple Watch Series 8 should not be used for scuba diving, water skiing, or other activities involving high velocity water or submersion below shallow depth. Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch Series 8 are also rated IP6X dust resistant. Water resistance is not a permanent condition and may diminish over time. Apple Watch cannot be rechecked or resealed for water resistance. The following may affect the water resistance of Apple Watch in particular and should be avoided: Dropping Apple Watch or subjecting it to other impacts. Exposing Apple Watch to soap or soapy water, for example while showering or bathing. Exposing Apple Watch to perfume, solvents, detergent, acids or acidic foods, insect repellent, lotions, sunscreen, oil, or hair dye. Exposing Apple Watch to high velocity water, for example while water skiing. Wearing Apple Watch in the sauna or steam room. Not all bands are appropriate for water use.

To help avoid damaging Apple Watch, observe the following: Don't clean Apple Watch while it's charging. Don't dry Apple Watch or the bands using any external heat source (for example, a hair dryer). Don't use cleaning products, ultrasonic cleaners, or compressed air when cleaning your Apple Watch. The front of Apple Watch is made of Ion-X glass (strengthened glass) or sapphire crystal, each with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic (oil repellent) coating. This coating wears over time with normal usage. Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the coating, and may scratch the glass or the sapphire crystal. Using buttons, Digital Crown, connectors, and ports Never apply excessive pressure to a button or the Digital Crown on Apple Watch, or force a charging connector into a port, because this may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. If the connector and port don't join with reasonable ease, they probably don't match. Check for obstructions and make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have positioned the connector correctly in relation to the port. Certain usage patterns can contribute to the fraying or breaking of cables. The cable attached to a charging unit, like any other metal wire or cable, is subject to becoming weak or brittle if repeatedly bent in the same spot. Aim for gentle curves instead of angles in the cable. Regularly inspect the cable and connector for any kinks, breaks, bends, or other damage. Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable. Apple Watch magnetic charging accessories Discoloration of the charging surface of Apple Watch magnetic charging accessories may occur after regular use due to dirt and debris that come in contact with the magnetic surface. This is normal. Cleaning the magnetic charging surface may reduce, or prevent, such discoloration, and will help to prevent damage to your charger and Apple Watch. To clean the charging surface, disconnect the charger from both Apple Watch and the power adapter and wipe with a damp, nonabrasive cloth. Dry with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth before resuming charging. Do not use cleaning products when cleaning the charging surface.356 Apple Watch User GuideOperating temperature Apple Watch is designed to work best in ambient temperatures between 32\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 F (0\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 C) and be stored in temperatures between -4\u00b0 and 113\u00b0 F (-20\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 C).

Unauthorized modifications to watchOS (also known as \"jailbreaking\") bypass security features and can cause numerous issues such as security vulnerabilities, instability, and shortened battery life to the hacked Apple Watch. Security vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking your device eliminates security layers designed to protect your personal information and your Apple Watch. With this security removed from your Apple Watch, hackers may steal your personal information, damage your device, attack your network, or introduce malware, spyware, or viruses. Instability. Unauthorized modifications can cause frequent and unexpected crashes of the device, crashes and freezes of built-in apps and third-party apps, and loss of data. Shortened battery life. Hacked software can cause an accelerated battery drain that shortens the operation of Apple Watch on a single battery charge. Unreliable voice and data. Unauthorized modifications can cause dropped calls, slow or unreliable data connections, and delayed or inaccurate location data. Disruption of services. Services such as iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Visual Voicemail, Weather, and Stocks may be disrupted or no longer work on the device. Additionally, third-party apps that use the Apple Push Notification Service may experience difficulty receiving notifications or may receive notifications intended for a different device. Other push-based services, such as iCloud and Exchange, may experience problems syncing data with their respective servers. Inability to apply future software updates. Some unauthorized modifications may cause damage to watchOS that is not repairable. This can result in the hacked Apple Watch becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple-supplied watchOS update is installed. Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that modifies watchOS. It is also important to note that unauthorized modification of watchOS is a violation of the watchOS Software License Agreement and because of this, Apple may deny service for an Apple Watch that has any unauthorized software installed.
