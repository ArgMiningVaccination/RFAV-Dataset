Negative results do not exclude TB disease, as false negatives may occur for several reasons, including illness-induced anergy. [1](#ref-1) Therefore, TSTs and IGRAs should be avoided in adults in whom TB disease is suspected. The primary goal of testing for TB infection is to identify people who would benefit from preventive treatment Testing should be considered among people with an increased risk of progression to TB disease (e.g., people living with HIV, before starting immunosuppressive therapy). [1](#ref-1), [2](#ref-2) A positive test result should prompt additional investigations (e.g., chest imaging) to exclude TB disease before offering preventive treatment. The positive predictive values for progression to TB disease for TSTs and IGRAs are similar, and the tests can be used interchangeably, with some exceptions Tuberculin skin tests require a second visit for reading 48-72 hours after placement and may be falsely positive due to previous bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination. Interferon- release assays are not affected by BCG vaccination and require only 1 visit, but their cost and availability vary by province. Interferon- release assays are preferred (but TSTs are still acceptable) for people who may not return for TST reading or may have false-positive TST results (i.e., the patient is 2-9 yr of age and previously received a BCG vaccine; the patient is at least 10 yr of age and previously received a BCG vaccine after age 1 yr; the age of BCG vaccination is unknown; multiple BCG vaccinations were received). [1](#ref-1) To enhance diagnostic certainty, TSTs and IGRAs may be performed sequentially If the initial test result is negative, but the suspicion for infection remains high, the other type of test may be performed to improve sensitivity. If a TST result is suspected to be falsely positive, then an IGRA may be performed to improve specificity.
