To a greater or lesser degree, the costs reported always reflect work in progress, as theintention is to refine and improve estimates wherever possible, drawing on a wide variety ofsources. The aim is to provide information that is detailed and comprehensive, and toimprove unit cost estimates over time, drawing on material as it becomes available, includingongoing and specially commissioned research, and quoting sources and assumptions sousers can adapt the information for their own purposes. In putting the volume together, there are a large number of individuals who have provided direct input in the form of data, permission to use material, and background informationand advice. Grateful thanks are extended to Ann Netten and Jennifer Beecham who have been an invaluable source of support in the preparation of this report. I would also like to extend aspecial thanks to Glen Harrison and Nick Brawn for taking expert charge of the design andtypesetting.

Many figures in this report have been rounded and therefore occasionally it may appear that the totals do not add up. This report may be downloaded from our website: http://www.pssru.ac.ukEditorial Lesley Curtis In this section, traditionally we have introduced new information and identified improvements and other changes that have been made to the Unit Costs publication sincethe previous year. However, given that we have reached the end of a decade, it is a timelyopportunity to look back at improvements over the past ten years - to see how we haveimproved our estimates and how the volume has expanded in response to government policyinitiatives. We begin with a summary of what we have always aimed to do in this publicationand then continue in more detail with an overview of how our information sources havechanged and how we have improved the quality and accuracy of our costs in specific areas.We then address new inclusions in this year's volume and provide a brief outline of all newschemata and information. The aims of the publication The publication, funded by the Department of Health and now in its eighteenth year wasfirst developed with the aim of bringing together information about the costs of health andsocial care in a way that, as far as possible, is transparent and compatible. Supported by anAdvisory Group comprising Department of Health personnel, SCIE representatives as wellas some of the foremost academics working in health and social care economics, we havebeen able to bring together information from a variety of sources to estimate the mostup-to-date nationally-applicable unit costs for a wide range of health and social care servicesin England. Based in economic theory, the volumes present the unit costs and theestimation methods used, provide references for data sources and other cost-relatedresearch, as well as short articles and commentaries. The basis has always been to identify,as closely as possible the economic cost (long run marginal opportunity cost), by drawingon research and occasional specific analyses. Wherever data are available bottom-upestimates have been provided allowing users to tailor the costs calculations to suit theperspective and purposes of their particular costing exercise. The transparency of theestimates has also meant that the information can be used to interpret other costs:identifying whether variations are attributable to differential wage rates or overhead costs forexample. Moreover, long-term components have been included which are not appropriate toestablish on a local level, such as costs of qualification for health service workers.We have always favoured research and specific surveys as a source of cost information in which the data are collected, analysed and investigated in more depth than is possible inroutine data collections. However, the problem with research and occasional survey sourcesis that they get outdated as practice changes so it has been an important exercise every yearto check whether the costs and services from such sources are still representative of currentservice providers. Clearly services change and develop over time and likewise the roles andtitles of staff may change, perhaps to meet national or local policy requirements. Our rulehas always been that if a service or professional role is still available, but the costs are out ofdate, current salary information and inflators are employed to adjust the costs to the presentyear. However, if a schema is ten or more years old and the service is no longer relevant, wedelete the schema from the publication until new research or other data are available. Another important exercise where direct information is not available is to test the sensitivity of results of any cost estimation to changes in assumptions. For example one importantassumption made with respect to capital costs is the level of the expected rate of return onthat capital (discussed later in this editorial). At the beginning of 2000, the Unit Costs volume included about 82 service types which at the end of the decade have risen to more than 130. Circulation figures have increased and ameasure of the volumes' use is shown by the fact that a search on the Web of Sciencedatabase showed that more than half (56 per cent) of all economic evaluations orcost-effectiveness studies published in English journals between 2003 and 2008 cited the Unit Cost of Health and Social Care as a source for their unit cost estimates. Below we have taken the opportunity to review our information sources over the years in specific areas and then discuss new inclusions in this year's volume. The volumes havetraditionally been divided into subsections, section I which covers services used by aparticular client group and sections II, III and IV which deal with the unit costs ofprofessionals. Section V is a miscellaneous section which presents information on inflationindices, Agenda for Change salary bands and other useful information such as a list ofarticles provided in previous volumes and also a list of other useful sources of information.This section is not discussed in any more detail in this editorial. Section 1 Services for older people Estimates for nursing homes and residential care homes have traditionally been drawn from Laing and Buisson. These have been supplemented each year, as are many of the services,by the Personal Social Services Expenditure Information (PSS EXI) data provided by theNHS Information Centre. We have also drawn on specific studies, for example theinformation on day care includes the results of a survey carried out by Age Concern. Services for people with mental health problems Since Chisholm et al.'s Mental Health Residential Care Study was published in 1997, wehave continued to draw on this information over the years and to uprate it to current values.The Survey of Day Activity Settings for People with Mental Health Problems (Beecham etal., 1998) has been the main source of information for day care. This year schemata on bothresidential and day care have been supplemented by PSS EX1 data or the NHS ReferenceCost data discussed below in more detail. Other schemata include sheltered work schemes,12 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010cognitive behaviour therapy and counselling services all of which have been drawn from specific surveys. Services for people who misuse drugs/alcohol Based on the National Treatment Outcome Research Study: NTORS (1997), we havecontinued through the decade to include information on people who misuse drugs/alcohol.This year, we are providing updated costs for residential rehabilitation, inpatientdetoxification and specialist prescribing using information provided by the NationalTreatment Agency (NTA) (Personal communication with the NTA, 2010). Services for people with learning disabilities Throughout the decade until 2009, we have drawn on estimates for people with learningdisabilities which were provided by Emerson and colleagues (1999). In last year'spublication, this information was replaced with new estimates using information from astudy carried out by Felce and colleagues (2005) and funded by the Wellcome Trust. Services for disabled adults The 2002 Unit Costs report saw the introduction of costs of services for disabled adults, anarea of increasing policy importance. With the National Service Framework for Long-termConditions focusing on the needs of people with neurological conditions and brain andspinal injury, we took the opportunity to include cost estimates for a variety of rehabilitationand independent living services, as well as nurse-led rehabilitation wards. Services for children In 2001, the Children in Need (CiN) Census provided some of the first information on howsocial services money was spent on children. Although data on looked after children hadbeen available for many years, there had previously been no reliable information on thenumber of children living with families or independently who received support. The Censusalso had the signal advantage of combining information on the needs of children, the serviceresponses and expenditure data. Analyses of these data provided information such as socialservices costs per child per week by region, by need category, by placement type and also bychild protection register status. Iterations of this have allowed us to update the informationin the Unit Costs volumes on a regular basis. Unfortunately since 2005, the unit costs ofservices children receive have not been collected and information in this publication hasbeen uprated where appropriate. In the 2004 volume, we introduced several new children's services as well as including four articles on children's services (adoption, cost of undertaking core assessments, home-startand costs of family support services). In 2007, when responsibility for many children'sservices and routine data collections was transferred to the Department for Children,Schools and Families (DCSF), unit costs for these services had to be excluded from thesevolumes. For this volume (2010), some funding was provided by the Department forChildren and Families (now the Department for Education) and several new services havebeen included and are discussed later in this editorial.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 13Hospital costs and other services This section has always been headed with a table of information taken from the NHS Reference Costs. This shows details of unit cost, average length of stay and activity levels ofa wide range of hospital services and describes how and on what NHS expenditure is used.Reporting over the last decade has become more reliable and the Department of Health, inpartnership with the Audit Commission, is currently reviewing its Reference Cost collectionprocess, with the objectives of improving the accuracy of submissions and increasing theusefulness of the information provided. In this section too, we have continued to add other information relating to services used by all client groups. These include intermediate care, discussed in the 2000/01 NHS Plan as'the bridge between hospital and home' which would ultimately eliminate 'bed blocking',and more recently the costs of the Expert Patients Programme research carried out by theUniversity of York. Other schemata such as those providing equipment costs have beenregular items over the past decade. Care packages In 2007, national policies such as the NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000), the NHSImprovement Plan (Department of Health, 2004) and Our Health, Our Care, Our Say(Department of Health, 2006) placed an emphasis on self directed care using DirectPayments and Individual Budgets/Personal Budgets and consequently there was anincreasing interest in the cost of care packages. Whereas our usual approach in thispublication is to present unit costs as the cost of providing a particular service orprofessional, for self-directed care the unit of interest should be the individual and thecombination of services they use, rather than a single service. For the last few years,therefore we have included cost information for community care packages for older people.Each care package schema reports service inputs identified in specific research studies andcombines these with unit costs drawn from this publication or estimated as part of theresearch. Information on accommodation and living costs for those living in their ownhomes is taken from the most recent Family Expenditure surveys and is included so acomprehensive picture is provided of the costs of supporting individuals with specificcharacteristics. The coalition government has since placed further emphasis on personalisation in outlining its vision for personalised social services with the announcement that the aim is to 'extendthe greater roll-out of personal budgets to give people and their carers more control andpurchasing power' (HM Government, 2010). This year, these 'care packages costs' have been presented in a new chapter. Sections II, III & IV These sections present the costs for professionals and teams of professionals who can provide support for all client groups and are divided in the volume according to whetherstaff are health or social care professionals and whether they are hospital or communitybased. There is also a chapter (12) which provides information on multi-disciplinary teamsfor adults with mental health problems. All these sections provide the costs associated withsalaries, direct and indirect overheads and capital. All unit costs are desegregated to hourlycosts and care is taken to keep the number of working days current by deducting the correct14 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010number of days for annual, statutory and sick leave using survey data from the Information Centre for NHS staff and the Local Government Association for local authorityprofessionals. Our basic unit cost for health and social care professionals is the cost per working hour, however for many purposes, in both research and commissioning, other 'units' are moreuseful, perhaps an hour of patient contact or for all-patient-related activity. To calculatethese costs, we need a breakdown of the professional's time. Wherever possible thisinformation has been drawn from specific research studies, or from national data collectionssuch as the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) or the Social Workers'Workload Survey (Baginsky et al., 2010) discussed in more detail below. Below, we review our current and past sources over the last decade for these sections. Data sources Salary and oncosts (NI contributions and employers contribution to superannuation) At the beginning of the decade, salaries of NHS staff were set by The Whitley Councils but these were phased out and in 2006 the Unit Cost volume included the Agenda for Changedata for the first time. The aim of this new system was to modernise the NHS pay systemand create fair, harmonised conditions of service. Each role was also mapped as closely aspossible to new generic profiles created as a result of the Agenda for Change job evaluation.This resulted in many adjustments to salary costs and consequently to the unit costs of theprofessionals. Also under the Agenda for Change reforms, changes to the working week andannual leave were made. In the same year (2006), the rate the NHS contributed tosuperannuation rose from 4 per cent to 14 per cent. All these changes in staff policy andpractice were reflected in new calculations for the costs of health service professionals. Prior to the year 2000, salaries for local authority staff were based on information from a survey of English local authorities conducted in 1993 (Local Government ManagementBoard and Association of Directors of Social Services, 1994) and were uprated each year.Concerns about the index used for uprating and length of time since the survey promptedthe PSSRU to carry out their own surveys of local authority staff and we used the mid-pointof salary ranges and weighted them to reflect the national numbers of social workers in eachtype of authority. In 2004 however, we were able to use the Social Services WorkforceSurvey 2003, published by the Employers' Organisation for Local Government. Currentlythis and the Local Government Earnings Survey and National Minimum Dataset for SocialCare (NMDS-SC) forms the basis of the salary cost component for staff who work for localauthorities. Unlike the rate contributed by NHS employers to superannuation which isfixed, the rate for local authorities varies from year to year and from council to council. Wetherefore carry out a survey each year of around 30 local authorities to determine theaverage. For both NHS and local authority staff, national insurance contributions have beencalculated according to HMS Revenue and Customs guidelines. The Social Workers'Workload Survey (2009) this year provided detailed information on how social workers (andteam leaders) spend their time and using this we have been able to provide multipliers fortime spent on client related work and on face-to-face contact.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 15Qualifications With the increased demand for health and social care service professionals and increased flexibility in ways of working, training the workforce has become an important issue. Toincorporate the resource implications of maintaining a trained and skilled workforce into thecosts of care delivery, the costs of training and education have to be valued explicitly. TheReady Reckoner project (Netten et al., 1998b) commissioned by the Department of Healthover a decade ago, provided the methods on which to do this. In the past ten years, we havecarried out work in order to improve our estimates of training health care staff and alsoAllied Health Professionals (Curtis & Netten, 2005; 2007), and this year the qualificationcosts for social workers have been included for the first time. This inclusion has increasedthe unit costs by 35 per cent. As with all the unit costs of professionals in these volumes, wepresent the estimate with and without training costs. The calculations are based on a 2008/09 analysis of the working lives of social workers and the cost of qualifying a social worker(Curtis et al., 2010; Curtis et al., forthcoming). We have also taken account of the major reforms to postgraduate training for medical officers and doctors implemented under the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC)government initiative. Under this scheme, all doctors in training could apply for flexibletraining after first entering a Foundation Programme for two years, where they gainedgeneric skills in caring for the acutely and critically ill. This meant that there was no longerentry into the Pre-Registration House Officers grade and entry into the Senior HouseOfficer (SHO) grades and Specialist Registrar (SPR) grades were closed. Again the costs ofpolicy and practice changes are reflected in our calculations. Overheads In the publication, we have always distinguished between two types of overhead. Directoverheads are those resources required to deliver the service and which are related directlyto the level of service activity. Indirect overheads include the costs of support services thatare required for services to carry out their main functions, such as human resources andfinance departments. The level of overheads required to support any one type of professional is very difficult to establish with any accuracy. Wherever possible, we have used data from individual researchstudies however there has been a dearth of information about these costs. Throughout thedecade, for NHS staff, we have based our estimates on returns to the Department of Healthand information provided by Trusts participating in the Ready Reckoner project mentionedabove. For local authority staff, information has been based on a study by Knapp et al.(1984). However long-standing concerns about the limited information available on localauthority overheads have been addressed this year. We have drawn on two new research studies in order to improve estimates for local authority overheads. The first study was carried out at the University of Bristol by Selwyn et al.(2009) and is based on data from seven local authorities. The second study was carried outat the PSSRU at the University of Kent and forms part of our evaluation of re-ablementservices and uses data from a further four local authorities. The estimates have been combined and a weighted average calculated. Total overheads (excluding travel and capital) as a percentage of direct salary costs have been estimated at45 per cent of direct payroll with a range of 42 per cent to 56 per cent. Indirect overheads16 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010(cost of central functions such as finance, general management and human resources, including indirect running costs) were 16 per cent of direct salary costs (range of 1 to 20 percent), direct overheads (administration and supervision) were 22 per cent of direct salarycosts (range of 14 to 41 per cent) and premises (all office costs, uniforms, stationery etc.)were 7 per cent of direct salary costs (range of 2 to 9 per cent). Of course this figure is much higher than that used in earlier volumes and has therefore, also raised the unit cost of many social care services compared to previous estimates. The sizeand sample precluded any analysis of regional variations. As the number of LocalAuthorities providing these data grows in future years, then so will the confidence in theoverhead value. Capital overheads In order to allow for the opportunity cost of buildings and equipment used in theproduction of services we have to make assumptions about both the length of time that the'investment' will be tied up in the service and the rate of return on that investment. The costof land is an important element of the capital costs of many services and is also taken intoaccount in the calculation using information provided previously by the Housing StatisticsDivision of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and latterly the Communitiesand Local Government. Information on the cost of buildings and offices has continued tobe taken from the Building Cost Information's Survey of Tender Prices and annuitizedusing the discount rate provided on Treasury guidance. A major shift in assumptions about the rate of return on changes in guidance from the Treasury had implications for the annual capital estimation in 2003, when the differentfactors comprising the discount rate were 'unbundled' in the 'Green Book' (HM Treasury,2003). On the basis of this analysis, Treasury advice has since been to use 3.5 per cent formost purposes. The method we use therefore is either to obtain a valuation of the buildingwhen available or in the absence of any specific information, the new build value from datafrom the Building Cost Information Service (BSIC). These values are then annuitized over60 years at 3.5 per cent (see Netten, 2003, for discussion about the discount rate). The period over which equipment and adaptations should be annuitized is open to debate. Ideally it should be annuitized over the useful life of the aid or adaptation and in many casesthis is linked to the length of time the person using the appliance is expected to remain athome. Where it is expected that the house would be occupied by someone who would alsomake use of the adaptation, a longer period would be appropriate. Clearly, this is difficult todo in practice. For the purpose of the Unit Costs volumes, wheelchairs have been annuitizedover five years and equipment and adaptations have been annuitized over ten years (seeNetten, 2003). Health and social care teams In 1992, the Mental Health Service Mapping programme was developed to address aninformation gap in mental health services and from 2002, Service Mapping data wascollected from NSF Local Implementation Teams (LIT) and was used in the Unit Costsreport for the first time in 2004. The standardised format allowed local data describing thecontent and scale of mental health services to be brought together to provide a nationalpicture of provision. This enabled us to include the costs of services aimed to treat adults intheir own environments such as Crisis Resolution, Assertive Outreach and EarlyUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 17Intervention. Similarly the Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) Mapping was developed for the Department of Health to contribute to monitoring the expansion anddevelopment of mental health service provision for children and adolescents and thisenabled us to include information on dedicated, generic, targeted and specialist child andadolescent mental health teams in the report from 2006. This year however the CAMHSmapping cost collection has been discontinued and currently there are no further plans tocollect this information. What's new in the publication this year? This year as previously mentioned, as a result of some funding provided by the Departmentfor Education for this year's publication, we have been able to include costs for servicesrelating to children and families. We have also included new schemata for individualplacement and support and for re-ablement services. These new items are listed in moredetail below. Articles This year we have included four articles, the first by Lisa Holmes and Samantha McDermidwhich presents the costs of short break provision for disabled children. This article outlinesthe need to understand both the costs of services and also the costs of the different referraland assessment routes to access the service. The second by Karen Windle and colleagues discusses the costs of the Partnerships of Older People Project (POPP) which was launched in 2005 to develop and evaluate servicesand approaches for older people. It was aimed at promoting health, well-being andindependence and preventing or delaying the need for higher intensity or institutional care. The third article has been written by Nika Fuchkan and colleagues and discusses the cost of a specialised form of cognitive behavioural therapy used to treat post-traumatic stressdisorder. We have also included an article by Adelina Comas-Herrera and Raphael Wittenberg on the costs of funding long term care. This discusses estimates which have been made on life-timecosts of care and the methodologies used in their calculation. New schemata Individual placement and support (page 79) A schema for providing evidence-based employment support in a mental health team has been included in this latest volume. Re-ablement service (page 126) The need for greater investment in preventative and rehabilitation services was recognised adecade ago and since then we have seen the introduction of various kinds of intermediatecare services designed to support people in their own homes. Unlike intermediate careservices, which were developed in the context of policy concerns about inappropriatehospital bed use by older people, reablement services are usually available to adults of all18 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010ages. This year, we have included the costs which have been collected as part of a study to evaluate the re-ablement service. The costs for young adults with acquired brain injury (page 148) This year we have included the costs for young adults with acquired brain injury followingresearch carried out by the PSSRU (Beecham et al., 2009) in response to two policyemphases (transition to adult services and support for long-term conditions). In thisschema, we provide estimates of the health and social care costs of supporting young adultswith neurological conditions after transition to adult services. Four groups were identifieddepending on their location at the community care stage. We present the average cost foreach group. Hospital costs for children (page 105) This year we have included a schema which provides a selection of costs for children'sservices from the NHS Reference Costs (6.1). As with the hospital costs for adults (7.1),wherever possible we have also provided average costs for groups of services which havebeen calculated by PSSRU and weighted according to the number of submissions received.For information about the way in which reference cost estimates are constructed, pleaserefer to a previous article in the 2003 volume by Andrew Street (Street, 2003). Key worker for disabled children (page 113) This year, following the recommendation by the National Service Framework for Children,Y oung People & Maternity Services (Department of Health & Department for Educationand Skills, 2004) for the provision of key workers to help families obtain the services theyrequire, we have included the costs of support for disabled children from a key worker (6.7). The Incredible Years (page 115) Following the success of the Incredible Years parenting programme developed by ProfessorCarolyn Webster-Stratton, director of the Parenting Clinic at the University of Washington,we are including a schema (6.9) which provides a bottom up costing provided by theIncredible Years Welsh Office. This programme is designed to help parents deal withproblem children. Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care (page 114) Following research carried out by the Centre for Child and Family Research atLoughborough University, we have included information on a programme of interventiondesigned for young people who display emotional and behavioural difficulties (6.8). Thisprogramme provides intensive support in a family setting where foster carers aim to changebehaviour through the promotion of positive role models. The schema provides the costs ofthe multi-dimensional treatment and also comparative costs for other types of provision foryoung people with similar needs. The cost of autism (pages 134-138) Given the growing evidence of the high costs of supporting people with autism spectrumdisorders (ASD), this year we are able to include information on their current support.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 19Schema 8.2.1 reports the service and wider societal costs for the six months prior to interview for pre-school children with autism. Taken from Barrett et al. (2010), we includecase studies of low and high cost cases. Schemata 8.2.2-8.2.4 are taken from Knapp et al.(2007; 2009) and show the full costs of autism spectrum disorders using data on 146children and 91 adults. Finally, we would like to thank all those who have called or e-mailed to comment on estimates or to let us know of new studies or estimates which will help to improve on theaccuracy of the unit costs. This information is invaluable and will help to ensure that we areproviding information which is as current as possible.

Short breaks canbe delivered in the form of overnight stays, day, evening and weekend activities and can takeplace in the child's own home, the home of an approved carer or a residential or communitysetting. The study aimed to calculate the costs of services, provided by both local authorityand voluntary service providers, along with the costs of the referral routes by which familiesaccess short break provision, and any ongoing social care activity carried out to support thechild and family once in receipt of short break services. Methodology The unit costs of short break provision were calculated using a 'bottom up' methodology(Beecham, 2000; Ward et al., 2008). This approach uses social care activity as the basis forbuilding up costs. Activities are organised into social care processes, linked to dataconcerning salaries, overheads (calculated using the framework developed by Selwyn et al,2009) and other types of expenditure. Three local authorities and two voluntary service providers were recruited to participate in this study. The authorities provided data on the short break services they offered and data inrelation to the social care activity for key processes. These included the CommonAssessment Framework, Initial and Core assessments, Child in Need reviews, and ongoingsocial care activity. The two service providers supplied expenditure and service data. The information underlying the unit cost estimations was gathered through five focus groups, comprising 37 professionals. Questionnaires were also distributed to the authorities 1 Assistant Director, Centre for Child and Family Research, Department of Social Science, Loughborough University, Leicestershire LE11 3TU. 2 Research Associate, Centre for Child and Family Research, Department of Social Science, Loughborough University, Leicestershire LE11 3TU.where panel procedures were in place for short break provision. The focus groups and questionnaires explored the time spent on various activities associated with the social careprocesses, to estimate an average total time for each process. Costs were then calculated,based on out of London and London salary and overhead information. Unit costs of short break provision: social care activity Access to short break services Each of the participating authorities had developed, or were in the process of developing, a 'tiered' referral process, whereby the assessment undertaken with families was determinedboth by the presenting needs and the intensity of service likely to be required. Short breakservices could be accessed via a local 'core offer' route for families with lower levels of need,and a referral and assessment route for those with higher need. The two types of access routes were costed for comparison: the 'traditional' assessment and referral route, which includes an Initial or Core assessment, Resource Allocation Panels, andassessments carried out as part of the Common Assessment Framework; and a local 'coreoffer' model whereby a local authority offers the provision of a standardised package ofshort break services to a specific population of disabled children and young people, whomeet an identified set of eligibility criteria. The 'traditional' referral and assessment route was undertaken in the participating authorities when it was considered that the services provided as part of the local 'core offer'would not adequately meet the needs of the child and their family. In such cases a more indepth assessment was undertaken, most commonly an Initial assessment. One authority wasalso using the Common Assessment Framework where appropriate. Participating authoritiesreported that a Core assessment was only undertaken with those families whose need isgreatest, or when a more intensive service, such as an overnight short break, is required. Ongoing support In addition to the assessment of disabled children and their families and the delivery ofservices, children's social care departments provide ongoing support to families in receipt ofshort break provision. This ongoing activity includes regular support visits to the family andreviews. Social care personnel across the three participating authorities identified that a support visit would on average last for one hour. However, travel time varied substantially between theauthorities, ranging between 40 minutes and three hours. Activities carried out to completereviews included: preparation prior to the meeting, including updating and collatingrelevant paper work and contacting other professionals; travel to and attendance at themeeting; and any administrative tasks after the meeting, including the completion ofminutes and updates to the child's care plan. The unit costs of the short break social care process are outlined in Table 1.24 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010Table 1 Costs of short break social care processes Process Out of London cost (\u00a3) 2009/2010 valueLondon cost (\u00a3) 260.63a a Per process per child. b Per month per child. Short break services Disabled children and their families are not a homogenous group. The population ofdisabled children within any one local authority may represent a wide range of needs andpersonal circumstances. The research identified a wide range of services provided by thelocal authorities, each designed to meet local need. A range of locations, staffing andfunding arrangements were in place. It was possible to identify some generic service typesunder which the services identified could be categorised. However, a wide variety of serviceswere found within each service type. As such, costs of each service type also varied withinand across participating authorities according to the provider; the type and number of staff;the length of the activity; the number of children attending; the needs of the child orchildren accessing the service. Table 2 summarises the costs of each service type.

Data from voluntary service providers As with the participating local authorities, the nature of the finance data supplied by thevoluntary service providers (VSPs) varied. The costs of overnight services calculated fromthe data obtained from the local authorities were comparatively similar to those calculatedUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 25from data supplied by the VSPs. Calculated costs of local authority provided residential services ranged from \u00a3223 - \u00a3419 per child per night for local authorities, compared to\u00a3229 - \u00a3500 per child per night for VSPs. Family based overnights ranged from\u00a3140 - \u00a3226 per child per night for local authorities compared with \u00a397 - \u00a3265 for theVSPs. A greater diversity in the unit costs was identified across the other services types. Key findings Social care activity and need This study highlighted that in the majority of cases the level of social care activity was determined by the needs of family. The referral routes used in each of the authoritiesreflected the level of need of each family as were the frequency of visits to children and theirfamilies. For instance, children receiving support as part of the local 'core offer' were subjectto lower levels of ongoing support, determined on a case-by-case basis in each of theauthorities. Children with higher levels of need accessed services through Initial or Coreassessments and received a higher level of ongoing support. However, in each of the participating authorities, when a family had made a request for direct payments, an initial assessment was required, regardless of the needs of the child andtheir family. As a result of the initial assessment, a family in receipt of direct payments issubject to regular visits and reviews. Social care professionals in each of the authoritiesnoted that this level of intervention was not always appropriate for the needs of the families,which in many cases, may be comparable to those receiving services as part of the local 'coreoffer'. Additional costs Some of the services required additional activity before a child could access them. Forinstance, in addition to the costs of an overnight short break placement, costs areattributable to the time spent by social workers to introduce the child to the placement. Thetime that social workers spent introducing a child to a new overnight short break placementvaried according to the needs of the child. Social workers reported that it took on average7\u00bc hours at an average cost of \u00a3288.04. This included visits to the new foster carers orresidential unit prior to placement, a pre-placement meeting, and the completion ofnecessary paperwork. Commissioning and setting up services The study also identified that additional costs may be incurred when commissioning andcontracting services. Service managers from the participating local authorities and theservice providers reported that setting up and maintaining contracts takes up a substantialproportion of their time. Service providers reported that the tendering and negotiating forcontracts was a time consuming process. Further work to identify the time spent on theseactivities would enable accurate and more comprehensive calculations of the full cost ofcommissioning services. It was also noted by participants across the three local authorities that a considerable amount of time was spent on the development and implementation of various services andreferral routes. Two of the participating authorities reported that they actively sought outfamilies who would be eligible for local 'core offer' services. This involved contacting special26 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010schools, GPs, specialist nurses and other professionals working with disabled children. These activities also incur costs. Conclusion This study highlights the range and variability of short break services being offered todisabled children and their families. The research also outlines that some of the services aresome of the most costly provided by Children's Services Departments for children notlooked after. Some disabled children and their families require high levels of social caresupport. However, research suggests that short break services produce positive outcomes forsome of the most vulnerable families. Some research has suggested that the provision ofshort break services can prevent children from being placed in more costly permanentplacements (Beresford et al., 1994; Chan & Sigafoos, 2001).

Theprogramme began in May 2006 and completed in March 2009, with a total of \u00a360 millionavailable to 29 pilot sites. The pilot sites covered a diverse spectrum of activity to meetvarying levels of need. Each pilot site put forward a programme of innovative projectsdesigned to improve the health, well-being and independence of older people. In total, the29 pilot sites implemented 146 core local projects and 530 lower-level or upstream projects,their type, focus and extent determined by local priorities. Each pilot site put in place a localevaluation to measure their outcomes, whilst a national evaluation of the programme as awhole was commissioned by the DH and provides the evidence base for this article. The individual POPP projects were expected to deliver three objectives: to provide a person-centred and integrated response to the needs of older people, encourage investmentin approaches that promoted health, well-being and independence for older people andprevented or delayed the need for high intensity or institutional care. Over the time-frame ofthe POPP programme, it was the later objective that came to dominate the nationalevaluation. In particular, one underlying question was drawn out: Did the projects reduceparticipants' use of the more intensive and thus, expensive services? 1 PSSRU, University of Kent, Canterbury. 2 School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton.3 PSSRU, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, and University of Kent, Canterbury.4 PSSRU, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science.5 School of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems, University of Kent, Canterbury.6 Visiting Professor, PSSRU, London School of Economics and Political Science.This article concentrates on exploring whether change in service use was found across the POPP programme. It first discusses how such service change was identified, details that costassigned to service provision and explains how the disparate projects were grouped orcategorised. We then provide the findings, demonstrating the changes in service use andthus costs that the different projects were able to achieve. Finally, a brief discussion sectionconsiders the implications of such outcomes for the national health and social careeconomy. Methods The tool to measure the change in individual service use was that of a standardisedquestionnaire used across 23 of the 29 POPP pilot sites and within 62 of the 146 coreprojects. The questionnaire was administered at two time points, at initial contact with thePOPP intervention and either three or six months afterwards to allow changes in outcomesto be measured. The challenges of ensuring adoption of this questionnaire across the pilotsites and selected projects have been described elsewhere and are not intended to berepeated here (see Windle et al., 2009). The questionnaire incorporated four sections. The first was a measure of health-related quality of life (Dolan, 1995), the second asked users to rate their quality of life as a wholeusing a seven-point Likert-type scale (Bowling, 1995), whilst the fourth and final sectionrecorded the necessary demographic data. It was the third section of the questionnaire thatallowed participants' use of health and social care services to be captured. Using the clientservices receipt inventory (Beecham & Knapp, 1992), respondents recorded the type andtotal usage of: secondary care, or hospital, services, interventions received within their localsurgery or health centre and those services delivered within their own home, e.g, home care,meals on wheels. Thus, respondents were asked to first record whether they had used aparticular service and secondly the number of times they may have received this over a threemonth time-period. Identifying and setting service costs The type of services and the extent of such use were then costed. Unit costs were drawnfrom a number of sources and inflators added to ensure parity with 2008/2009 costs (seeCurtis, 2008; Curtis & Netten, 2006; King 2000; NHS Health & Social CareInformation Centre, 2004/5). Nevertheless, the lack of detail about the exact type of serviceused meant a number of assumptions had to be made. The example given here to explainsuch assumptions is the process of costing hospital bed-days. Further information on thedevelopment of unit costs for services can be found in the full national evaluation reportand appendices (see Windle et al., 2009) To ensure that the questionnaire was as simple as possible to complete, respondents were only asked to indicate whether they had stayed in hospital overnight. No detail wasrequested around service specialty. We did not know whether their hospital overnight staywas in a psycho-geriatric, medical, rehabilitation or general surgery ward and thus could noteasily assign costs. To estimate a unit cost for a bed-day, we first drew on the HospitalEpisode Statistics data to explore the number of bed-days used within each specialty, bythose aged 60 and over (see www.hesonline.nhs.uk). Unit costs were then listed for each anda weighted average applied to provide the composite unit cost, a sum of \u00a3158 per hospitalbed-day (see Table 1).30 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010Table 1 Breakdown of inpatient attendance: per bed-day Area of specialty Cost (National Average) \u00a3Cost with inflator (3.4%) \u00a3Number of bed-days aged 60 and over (2008 HES data) Mental health - elderlyGeriatricGeneral surgeryGeneral medicineCardiologyRehabilitation217 187 93 144.33 149.24 Weighted average 152.65 157.94 This was not the final sum used in costing this service provision. The literature on hospital admission showed that a high proportion of older individuals arrive at hospital viaemergency ambulance transport (see Bentley & Meyer, 2004; Richardson, 1992). Overtwo-thirds of those aged 65 and over (67 per cent) attend secondary care via emergencyambulance, rising to 84 per cent for those aged 85 and over (Cove et al., 2006). The cost ofa single emergency ambulance journey, a further \u00a3246, was therefore included. Thus thefirst bed-day cost was set at \u00a3404 falling to \u00a3158 for subsequent recorded bed-days. The categorisation of the projects The POPP programme was not designed to implement a single service model. The 62projects that used the standardised questionnaire to measure outcomes ranged fromthird-sector led well-being services, (e.g., gardening, small housing repairs, shopping andsocial centres), through to multi-disciplinary health and social care interventions (e.g, rapidresponse teams, medicines management, falls prevention, intensive case management). Thestructure and process of each project was very different, even where projects within differentsites shared titles. For example, one 'Falls Prevention' project employed a multi- disciplinaryhealth and social care team based in secondary care, whilst another sharing the same name,was that of a time-limited exercise programme run by volunteers within village halls. Tomitigate this diversity and ensure a robust analysis could be undertaken, we categorisedthese 62 projects in a number of ways. The grouping reported within this article links to thestratification adopted in the Kaiser Permanente Triangle: primary, secondary and tertiaryprevention. The first category of primary prevention targeted older people in general and included 32 (58 per cent) lower-level, community interventions: gardening, handyperson schemes,information and signposting, learning and leisure opportunities. Secondary preventionencompassed 22 projects (35 per cent) that provided support to those older people 'at risk'of hospital admission: medicines management, falls prevention services, follow-up fallsservices and holistic assessments. The final tier, tertiary prevention, included four projects(7 per cent) that were targeted to support older people at serious risk of imminent hospitaladmission: rapid response teams, hospital at home and case management. Findings The data were analysed to identify any changes in rates of service use and levels of costwithin these three categories of prevention. No changes were found in those projectsfocused toward well-being or primary prevention. Within those interventions focused atUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 31older people at risk of admission, secondary prevention, a 50 per cent reduction was seen in the number of hospital overnight stays and visits to accident and emergency following thePOPP intervention. A reduction of almost half (46 per cent) was found in hospital basedphysiotherapy attendances, with GP appointments showing a small reduction (15 per cent).Assigning costs to these changes, a mean per person cost reduction of \u00a3277 was found,measured over a three month period (see Table 2).

Adjusting for base-line characteristics, a six-fold reductionin the original bed-day usage was demonstrated (see Table 3). No statistically significantincrease or reductions in use were found across any other services in the case of this thirdcategory of prevention. Table 3 Mean self-reported service usage and costs before and after those POPP projects focused toward tertiary prevention Service Time 1 (pre-intervention) mean usageTime 1 (pre-intervention) mean cost \u00a3Time 2 (post-intervention) usageTime Homogeneity Test) Discussion From these findings it would seem that the POPP projects did indeed reduce the use of intensive and more expensive services. Nevertheless, three discussion areas are raised bythese findings. The first concerns reliability: how valid are such findings given that the extent of service use was self-reported? From analysis of missing data within the questionnaire, it was found thatrespondents were generally able to identify the service(s) that they had used. Far fewer wereable to identify the number of times that they had used any specific resource. For example,within the full sample (n=1,529) a total of 1,267 respondents reported visiting their GP, amean frequency of 1.6. The average number of GP consultations for older individuals,(aged 65 and over), is seven per annum (Peckham & Exworthy, 2003). Even adjusting forthe reporting period, there would seem to be an underestimation, particularly given that thePOPP sample reported far poorer health states when compared to the UK older peoplepopulation. Such under-reporting was mitigated to a certain extent by simply costing a32 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010single resource use rather than omitting all such costs, given that we knew the respondent had used the service at least once. Nevertheless, it is likely that the reported service use andthus change, is a conservative estimate of actual usage. The second area encompasses net cost savings: were the cost reductions found through changes in service use, negated by the cost of providing the POPP service? Exploring theper person cost of the POPP projects, it would seem that savings accrue from secondary andtertiary level projects, although there are, as yet, no demonstrable significant savings withinthose lower-level, well-being focused projects (see Table 4). Table 4 Per person cost of the POPP projects and mean cost change in service use by project categorisation Categorisation level Median per person cost of POPP projects (3 months) \u00a3Mean cost change in service use (3 months) \u00a3Cost difference \u00a3 Primary prevention (Well-being) Secondary prevention (At risk of hospital admission) Tertiary prevention (At imminent risk of hospital admission)0 56 1770 277 1,148+50 -221-971 That there is an increased cost to providing well-being services should not be used as an argument for decommissioning or negating such service provision. It was found that thoselower-level services, (gardening, shopping, limited assistive technology and small housingrepairs), increased health related quality of life -as measured through EQ-5D - by 13 percent. Such a positive outcome is likely to affect take-up of services in the long-term,providing future efficiency savings. The POPP programme, set up to test different preventative approaches, demonstrated that prevention and early intervention can 'work' for older people. As has been detailed,preventative projects can help to reduce demand on secondary care services. However, theircost-effectiveness gains cannot be fully realised unless cashable savings can be released andre-invested. No POPP pilot site reported being able to release monies from secondary caretrusts. Primary care trusts (PCT) did recognise that the availability of such projects affectedthe take-up of health services and they contributed to the sustainability of POPP projectswithin all pilot sites, entirely sustaining a fifth (20 per cent) of all POPP projects.Nevertheless, some degree of national financial systems reform is likely to be necessary tosupport the decommissioning of services in one part of the health system alongside there-investment of resources elsewhere.

Brewin2, Jennifer Beecham3and Martin Knapp4 Introduction The London bombing was the largest mass casualty event in the UK since World War Two with 56 deaths and 775 casualties among the approximately 4000 individuals involved. Thesequel of events, from 7th July to 23rd July 2005, included detonated bombs on threeunderground trains (Edgware Road, Kings Cross, and Aldgate) and on a bus in TavistockSquare, as well as unsuccessful bomb attempts and the shooting of an innocent passenger inthe days following the bombings. The NHS mental health response programme was set up within a month of the London bombings incident. Within the first two weeks the Psychosocial Steering Group wasconvened by Camden & Islington Foundation NHS Trust and the London DevelopmentCentre for Mental Health (part of the national Care Services Improvement Partnership),with representation from specialist psychological trauma centres, health commissioners,primary care physicians, the emergency services, first response agencies, the HealthProtection Agency, and survivor groups. Using the available evidence, the Steering Group established that around 30 per cent of the 4000 individuals affected by the incident would need psychological treatment. Existingservices could not meet that need so the Department of Health (DH) funded anevidence-based programme which consisted of a central screening and assessment team andadditional psychological treatment resources based in existing trauma centres. The SteeringGroup retained responsibility for the overall management of the Screen and Treatprogramme over the two-year funding period. 1 PSSRU, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science. 2 Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London.3 PSSRU, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, and University of Kent, Canterbury.4 PSSRU, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science.The Screen and Treat programme Screening and assessment The aim of the Screen and Treat programme was to contact and follow-up as many survivors and affected individuals as possible, to provide them with information aboutpost-traumatic responses and immediate sources of help, to screen them at regular intervalsusing validated instruments to identify those who still had symptoms of PTSD, and todeliver appropriate therapy to that subset of people. The screening team was set up withinthe one of the treatment clinics and consisted of a psychiatrist, two psychological assistantsand an administrator. It ran for two years, from September 2005 until September 2007. The screening team collated information about individuals involved in the bombings, identified those with bombing-related mental disorders, provided advice to professionalsand the public on demand, and coordinated the outreach and screening services. Subjectswere contacted by telephone or letter and sent a brief socio-demographic and screeningquestionnaire which included 10 items from the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (Brewinet al., 2002), and additional questions on depression (2 questions), travel phobia (1) andlevels of distress within the last two weeks (2). Figure 1 shows that a total of 910 peoplewere recruited to the Screen and Treat programme, of whom 596 (65 per cent) werescreened. Those who 'screened positive' on the TSQ or who responded positively to any two of the additional items received a more detailed clinical assessment with Screening Teammembers; there were 334 such people, or 56 per cent of those screened. This assessmentwould establish whether individuals met criteria for a DSM-IV or ICD-10 disorder that wasrelated to being exposed to the bombings and that the disorder was not resolving of its ownaccord. 5These cases were either referred to treatment at one of the three clinics, re-assessed 3, 6, and 9 months later, or referred to appropriate treatment if they were suffering frompre-existing mental health problems. Individuals who did not seem to be in a need oftreatment were followed-up at 3-monthly intervals and, if they showed no symptoms after ayear, were discharged from the Screen and Treat programme. Treatment The treatment offered within the programme was delivered at three specialist,multidisciplinary psychological trauma centres in London by qualified clinical psychologists.It consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitization andreprocessing (EMDR) as advised by NICE guidelines. Most individuals received trauma-focused CBT (80 per cent of patients treated), while the rest received EMDR (10 per cent) or a combination of two therapies (10 per cent). Thelevel of treatment provided was recorded by clinicians on a monthly basis in two separatedata collection systems; as the total number of hours of direct and indirect time spent forthe DH, and in a clinics' own systems that monitored each client's progress and includeddata on the start and end date of treatment, the type of treatment, the total number ofsessions attended and missed, as well as depression and PTSD assessments at the start and36 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 5 The assessment included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID: First et al., 1997), the CAGE alcohol abuse screening instrument (Mayfield et al., 1974), the SF-12 Health Survey (Ware et al., 1996) and, where appropriate, the Short McGill PainQuestionnaire (Melzack, 1987) and the Inventory of Complicated Grief - Revised (Prigerson & Jacobs, 2001).end of treatment. At the end of the Screen and Treat funding, patients still receiving treatment were referred to usual NHS psychological services. Costs Table 1 shows the costs for the 2-year Screen and Treat programme, identifying the start-upcosts, administrative costs incurred for managing the project, the costs of the centralisedscreening team and the treatment costs. The total cost was just under \u00a31.4 million, of which7 per cent went on administration, 33 per cent on screening and assessment, and theremaining 60 per cent on direct (therapist time) and indirect (management, supervision,overheads) treatment costs. If we assume that start-up costs and half of the management costs should be allocated to the screen/assessment part of the programme, these activities absorbed \u00a3523,125.5 at 2007-08prices. Figure 1 shows that 596 people were screened, there were 363 detailed assessments,and that 304 (276 identified by the programme and 28 referred from other places) of themwere considered to be in need of treatment. Unfortunately the data are not sufficientlydetailed to allow us to estimate the costs of screening and assessment separately. Screening,for example, included collecting participant's details through negotiation with organisationsinvolved in the London bombings response such as the Metropolitan Police or NHS,setting-up the contacts database, contacting individuals, sending out screeningquestionnaires at several time points (up to 5 screeners per person) and referralmanagement. Assessment activities included contacting participants, a clinical interviewwhich could last up to 1.5 hours and liaising with treatment centres. We can however,estimate two unit costs from these data: \u0081The cost of finding, screening (up to five times) and assessing a person for PTSDfollowing a traumatic event in 2007/08 prices is \u00a3877.70 (\u00a3523,125.5 / 596) \u0081The cost of identifying a person who requires treatment following a traumatic event in2007/08 prices is \u00a31895.40 (\u00a3523,125.5 / 276). It is important to point out that the cost of identifying a person who needed treatment included identifying, screening and managing their referral, which could be difficult if theylived elsewhere in UK. Better data on time use are available for the treatment component of the Screen and Treat programme. Clinicians spent 68 per cent of their time in direct contact with individuals intreatment, while 32 per cent of their time was accounted for by indirect activities such aspreparation, supervision, travelling to the sites and in vivo therapy that included gradualexposure to the feared stimuli. Thus, on average for each hour of therapist direct contacttime, there was a further half-hour of indirect time. Both direct and indirect time wererecorded in half-hour units, and the duration of the treatment sessions varied from one to12 half-hour units, depending on the stage and type of treatment offered. Although therange of direct-time half-hour units is very wide, on average there were 2.94 direct half-hourunits per session per client. As Table 2 shows, a total of 9658.5 half-hours of direct time and 4627 half-hours of indirect contact time were administered throughout the programme across all three clinics, whichcorresponds to 7143 hours of therapy. Clinic 1 treated more clients with a higher number ofdirect and indirect hours than the other two clinics, and there was some variation betweenthe clinics in the balance of direct and indirect time. Table 2 also shows that in total, 3277therapy sessions were provided through the Screen and Treat programme, an average 13Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 37sessions per client, although this varied slightly between the clinics, as did the number of clients. Clients made decisions on the treatment location based on their personalpreferences, perhaps location or transportation convenience. Treatment cost involved thecosts of getting to and from treatment and parking facilities for individuals living out ofLondon. These data on time use, client numbers and costs can again be combined to allow estimation of unit costs. Using the assumption that half the management costs accrue to thetreatment arm of the programme, the total costs of treatment are \u00a3857,283.60 at 2007-08prices, the following unit costs can be calculated. \u0081Costs per half-hour of direct or indirect time \u00a360.01 \u0081Cost per hour \u00a3120.02 (\u00a3857,283.60 / 7142.75) \u0081Cost per hour of treatment \u00a3180.03 (an hour of direct time, plus 30 minutes indirectactivities) \u0081Average cost per session \u00a3261.60 (\u00a3857,283.6 / 3277) \u0081Average treatment cost per person \u00a33,453.20 (av. cost per session * 13.2) Conclusion When analysing the costs of the Screen and Treat programme one must bear in mind thecontext and novelty of the approach, as well as the difficulties involved in setting-up andrunning the programme. This was the first time a mass mental health response had beenset-up; there was no previous experience on which to build, yet the situation demanded anurgent response. Nor was this programme set-up as a research activity, its main focus was todeliver a mental health intervention. Thus caution is advised in interpreting the costs outside of the context of this programme. In the first place the services, and therefore the associated costs, are not representative orcomparable to routine clinical services. Second, a real challenge for the programme was thenumerous difficulties associated with the identifying those people affected by the bombings.This took about five months; cases were widely dispersed, there was no central register ofaffected persons, and the task was hampered by the Data Protection Act. Were such aprogramme set-up again, these costs could be reduced by allocating this task to a particularorganisation and/or pre-agreeing the data collection mechanisms. Another lesson is that the programme efficiency decreased in the second year of running as the number of referrals to the programme dropped significantly. Although this was reflectedin the treatment costs (which were paid retrospectively for work undertaken) the screeningand assessment costs remained fixed throughout the programme. Therefore, were such aprogramme required again, the screening and assessment component could be made moreresponsive to this reduced service demand. However, it is important to highlight thatalthough the number of referrals to the programme reduced over time, the rate of referral tothe treatment increased, that is, as time went by more of those who were assessed requiredand entered treatment. Finally, there is no doubt that the Screen and Treat programme represents a unique learning experience in applied clinical research approaches, and, perhaps more importantlyrepresents a bench-mark in mental health response programmes following terrorist attacks,both UK and worldwide.38 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010Table 1 Total costs break-down for the Screen and Treat Total number of therapy sessions, hours and direct and indirect half-hours Direct 1/2 hoursIndirect 1/2 hoursTotal 1/2 hoursTotal hours per Treat programme users' flow chartUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 39 Referred to programme N=910 Screened N=596 Detailed assessment N=363 T reatment needed N=304 Referred for treatment N=278 Referred to programme N=248Other referralNot screened Monitoring only No referral made Tre ate d elsewhere Did not enter treatment29 28314 87 2630 28Other referral Outcome unknown3Monitoring only258 Referred elsewhere4 334 276Acknowledgements We would like to thank Zoe Huntley, all clinicians involved in data collection, members of the Screen and Treat programme and all the many individuals who contributed to theTrauma Response Programme and to this report.

This article however reports some analyses of the lifetime costs of social care forolder people. Why should lifetime costs be of policy interest? Estimates of lifetime costs of care are very relevant to the current debate about how best to fund care and support in England. Individuals, especially those whose savings would renderthem ineligible for publicly funded care, will want to know broadly how much long-termcare toward the end of their life may cost. This information could help them make informeddecisions about how much to save or whether to seek private insurance for care costs.Government, and currently the Commission on the Funding of Care and Support, may findsuch estimates helpful information for the development of policy on funding of long-termcare. Private insurers may also find estimates of lifetime costs of care interesting. The insurance sector launched various long-term care products in the 1990s, but most of the providershave subsequently withdrawn from the market. One of the issues in the current debate iswhether private insurance for long-term care could be revived. This raises questions abouthow expensive premiums would be and whether they would be affordable. A useful steptoward estimating long-term care insurance premiums would be to estimate expectedlifetime care costs as from age 65. The lifetime costs of long-term care services can be substantial. The costs in most countries of long-term care services provided in residential facilities can seriously deplete the assets ofservice users who require care for several years, for example as a result of dementia. AUS-based study suggested that the average value of lifetime long-term care expenditures forpeople turning 65 in 2005 was approximately $47,000, with 28 per cent of individualsfacing costs in excess of $100,000 (Kemper et al., 2005). 1 Research Fellow, PSSRU, London School of Economics and Political Science. 2 Senior Research Fellow, PSSRU, London School of Economics and Political Science, and Economic Advisor, Department of Health.This article presents estimates of the expected lifetime costs of social care at age 65 for men and women, under current patterns of use of care services and under an alternative patternof care scenario. It covers total social care costs, public and private. Hotel costs in carehomes have been excluded and so have health care costs. It should be noted that, whileestimates of life-time costs of care are relevant to estimating premiums for long-term careinsurance, premiums cannot simply be equated with life-time costs of care under currentpatterns of care. People purchasing insurance may decide to purchase insurance for onlypart of the costs of care or alternatively may seek cover for hotel costs in care homes as wellas care costs. At PSSRU we have estimated lifetime costs of care using two different methods. Forder & Fern\u00e1ndez (2009) have developed a dynamic microsimulation model of the long-term caresystem for older people in England. Amongst other things, this model simulates into thefuture and at the individual level patterns of service utilisation and associated costs, basedon assumptions about year on year transitions between need, wealth and social supportstates, and about changes in the unit costs of services. These estimates can then beaggregated at the individual level through time to describe the projected distribution oflifetime costs of care. Another approach we have used is to incorporate data drawn from thePSSRU aggregate (or macrosimulation) model (Wittenberg et al., 2006) in an augmentedlife table using Sullivan's method (Sullivan, 1971) to estimate expectation of life withdisability and expectation of life in receipt of home care and residential care. This paper focuses on the estimation of the lifetime costs of care using the PSSRU aggregate model and the Sullivan method (see, for example, EHEMU, 2006) and comparesthe results to those obtained using the PSSRU dynamic microsimulation model. Expected duration of disability at age 65 We have used the prevalence rates of disability estimated from the 2001/2 GeneralHousehold Survey (GHS) and data on the numbers of older people in care homes (seeWittenberg et al., 2006 for more details), in combination with an unabridged life table 3for England produced by the Office for National Statistics, to estimate the expected duration oflife with various levels of disability at age 65. People in care homes are assumed to be unableto perform two or more ADLs without help. Table 1 Expected duration of life with disability at age 65, for different levels of disability, years Men Women Expected duration with any IADL or ADL disabilityExpected duration of difficulties with any ADLExpected duration of difficulties with any ADL (except bathing)Expected duration of inability to perform one or more ADLs without helpExpected duration of inability to perform two or more ADLs without helpTotal life expectancy at 654.2 3.02.51.50.7 16.76.5 5.04.12.71.7 19.3 As shown in table 1, our analysis suggests that men aged 65 can expect on average to live a further 16.7 years of which 2.2 years are with severe disability, where this is defined here asinability to perform without help one or more activities of daily living (ADLs). It alsosuggests that women aged 65 can expect on average to live a further 19.3 years of which 4.442 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 3 Interim Life Table produced by the Office for National Statistics, covering England and based on data for the years 2004-6.years are with severe disability. These estimates are dependent on the data on self-reported disability in the 2001/2 GHS and on data on the numbers of people in care homes. Theyassume that mortality and disability rates by age and gender will remain constant. Expected lifetime costs under current patterns of care Using the same methodology, we have estimated the expected duration of service receipt atage 65 under current patterns of care, using data from the PSSRU aggregate long-term carefinance model (Wittenberg et al., 2006) on the proportion of the older population receivingsocial care (residential and home care) by age and gender. The underlying data sources arefor publicly funded official data from local authorities on the numbers of older peoplereceiving residential care and home care and for privately funded care estimates based onsurveys. Table 2 Estimates of life expectancy and duration of service receipt at age 65, years Men Women Expected duration of residential careExpected duration of local authority home careTotal life expectancy at (5-6 months) 0.47 (5-6 months) 16.71.04 (12-13 months) 0.84 (10 months) 19.3 As shown in Table 2, men in England can expect to spend on average around 6 months receiving publicly funded home care and 6 months receiving residential care. Women canexpect to spend on average around 10 months receiving publicly funded home care and 12months receiving residential care. While the estimates for home care relate to publiclyfunded home care only, those for residential care cover local authority, privately and NHSfunded institutional care. They are similar to those prepared by Bebbington et al. (1999). Itshould be noted that these estimates assume that patterns of care remain constant and thatthey do not take account of any changes in demand for care from changing expectations orreform of the funding system. In order to estimate the lifetime costs of care, we have combined the estimated duration of service receipt with information about the costs of those services. Local authority fundedresidential care for older people cost \u00a3446 per week at 2006/7 prices (EX1 data, includinghotel costs): NHS and privately funded care are more costly. Using the local authority rate,the expected total lifetime costs of residential care for older people is around \u00a310,000 formales and \u00a324,200 for females. Older local authority funded residents contribute some\u00a3145 per week on average in user contributions, which could be treated as a proxy for hotelcosts. If \u00a3145 per week was excluded on the basis that residents will meet this sum fromtheir general income, the residual lifetime costs would be \u00a36,750 for men and \u00a316,350 forwomen. Assuming that these costs take place in the last years of a person's life and that realunit costs of care rise by 2 per cent per year, the lifetime costs of care in care homes wouldbe around \u00a39,400 for men and \u00a323,950 for women, in constant 2006/7 prices. Local authority funded home care for older people cost \u00a3129 per week at 2006/7 prices (EX1 data). Using this rate, the expected total lifetime costs of local authority home care forolder people is around \u00a33,150 for males and \u00a35,650 for females. Total gross local authority expenditure on community-based social care for older people was \u00a32,520 million in 2006/7 (excluding Supporting People), of which \u00a31,690 million related tohome care (EX1). Home care accounted for around 2/3 of the total. Scaling the estimatesUnit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 43for home care by 1.5, suggests that the lifetime costs of all local authority community-based services are around \u00a34,750 for men and \u00a38,500 for women. Assuming these costs takeplace on the last years of a person's life and that the real unit costs of care rise by 2 per centper year, the lifetime costs for local authority community-based care services would be\u00a36,600 for men and \u00a312,450 for women, in constant 2006/7 prices. Expenditure on privately purchased home care for older people is estimated at around \u00a31,000 million per year (PSSRU modelling based on 2001 GHS data). Inclusion of privatehome care increases the estimates of lifetime costs of publicly and privately fundedcommunity-based services to some \u00a39,250 for men and \u00a317,400 for women. These estimates suggest, under patterns of services, total lifetime costs at age 65 of social services - residential and community-based - of around \u00a318,650 for men and \u00a341,350 forwomen. These include publicly and privately funded care but exclude an element for hotelcosts in care homes and exclude costs of assessment and care management. The weightedaverage for men and women together would be around \u00a331,500, at 2006/7 prices. These results compare very well with those obtained by estimating the lifetime costs of care at age 65 using the PSSRU dynamic microsimulation model. Forder & Fern\u00e1ndez (2009, p.26) estimate that the average lifetime expected cost of care for males is \u00a322,300, while forfemales it is \u00a340,400. The average for both genders is \u00a331,700. Their results also show thatthe underlying distribution of those costs is highly skewed, with a small number of casespushing up average costs. Expected lifetime home care costs under alternative carer blind-type of care system PSSRU work on projections of long-term care expenditure has involved the development of a scenario that explores the implications of making services more 'carer-blind' by allowingdisabled people living with others to receive the same level of local authority domiciliaryservices as those living alone (Pickard et al., 2000, Wittenberg et al., 2006). Under thisscenario, the probability of receipt of local authority home care among older people livingwith others would match the current probability of receipt of local authority home careamong those living alone. The scenario does not extend to privately funded care since a change of policy by councils would not increase private purchase of care but could even reduce it as some older peoplewould gain publicly funded care. It has also not been extended to residential care. Olderpeople who are cared for in the community by informal carers might still prefer not to entera care home if publicly funded care became carer-blind but rather choose to benefit fromthe expanded formal home care. Table 3 Expected duration of use of home care at age 65 under a carer blind type of scenario, years Men Women Expected duration of local authority home careTotal life expectancy at 650.73 (8-9 months) 16.71.13 (13-14 months) 19.344 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010The expected lifetime costs of local authority community-based care under this scenario would be \u00a310,250 for men and \u00a316,700 for women. If we assume no changes in the use ofprivate home care or residential care, the total expected lifetime costs of care would be\u00a322,300 for men and \u00a345,650 for women. The weighted average for men and womentogether would be \u00a335,500 at 2006/7 prices. Conclusion This paper has estimated, using data from the PSSRU aggregate model and the Sullivanmethod, that the weighted average lifetime costs of care would be around \u00a331,500 undercurrent patterns of care and \u00a335,500 under a 'carer-blind' system. Comparison withestimates produced using the PSSRU dynamic microsimulation model show that the resultsare remarkably similar. These results can contribute to the current debate in England aboutthe financing of long-term care. Should a system of long-term care insurance be considered,this research suggest that, in order to fully insure for the costs of formal care given today'spatterns of care each individual would need to be insured for at least \u00a331,500. Some limitations of these analyses should be recognised: \u0081The estimates of expected duration of disability are based on current patterns of disability and assume that they will remain as reported in the 2001/2 GHS. \u0081The estimates of expected duration of receipt of services are rooted in recent patterns ofcare. No allowance is made for the potential impact of rising expectations, reform of thefunding system or changes in use of services resulting from insurance. \u0081The analyses assume that the unit costs of care rise by 2 per cent per year in real terms.Trends in the unit costs of care are likely to depend heavily of trends in the wages of carestaff which are inevitably uncertain. Insurance premiums would need to take account of other factors in addition to the expected costs of care. In particular they would need to include allowance for administrative andother costs which have proved substantial in the USA. Moreover, as noted in theintroduction, people purchasing insurance may decide to purchase insurance for only partof the costs of care or alternatively may seek cover for hotel costs in care homes as well ascare costs. Further research on this topic is required. PSSRU are collaborating in a study conducted with researchers from the University of East Anglia, Nuffield Trust and University ofBarcelona, and funded by the AXA Research Fund, on how can private long-term careinsurance supplement state systems: the UK as a case study.

Information was received from 10 centres, and the figures have been inflatedby PSS Pay & Prices index. At 2009/2010 prices, costs ranged from \u00a323 to \u00a352 per client day with amean cost of \u00a336 and median cost of \u00a335. These costs are unchanged since last year. Three of the Age Concern centres responding to the survey accommodated elderly people with dementia, resulting in costs 15 per cent higher than the average. This is largely due to the higher staff/client ratios. A rural centre also reported a high unit cost, with its total vehicle and transport costsaccounting for 25 per cent of the total cost. The cost per client day for Age Concern centres offeringstandard day care (excluding the rural centre and those with specialised needs) was 40 per cent lessthan the average. Using PSS EXI 2008/2009 1uprated using the PSS Pay & Prices inflator, the mean weekly cost per client day for independently provided day care was \u00a357 and the median cost was \u00a360. Costs and unit estimation2009/2010 valueNotes Capital costs (A & B) A. Premises\u00a34.30 per client dayThese costs ranged from \u00a32.80 to \u00a35.80 with a mean cost of \u00a34.30 per day. Many of these costs are very low due to the fact that the venue for many AgeConcern centres is the local village hall. Premises costs based on rental paid as purpose built centres are very rare. B. Vehicle \u00a33.70 per client dayOf the 10 centres, 3 had their own minibus(es) and costs ranged from \u00a31.60 per client day to \u00a36.80 per client day.

It is clearly important to ensure that the models that were operatingduring the research are relevant to any setting to be costed. The models and costs upon which thisschema is based are described in Hallam & Schneider (1999). 3The methodology for costing these work schemes is given in Netten & Dennett (1996, pp 28-31), and can be adapted to innovativesettings. 4 The figures in the table below are averages for the seven schemes and are based on 1994/1995 figuresand uprated using the PSS Pay & Prices index. The costs do not take into account variations in different departments within each scheme due to staffing levels, attendance rates or productivity. Cost per hour ranged from \u00a32.50 to \u00a312.30 at currentprices, with the full-time placements working out least expensive per hour.

(2000) A Randomised Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Counselling with Patients with Chronic Depression , Report to the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme. 4 The Information Centre (2007) 2006/07 UK General Workload Survey, Primary Care Statistics , The Information Centre, Leeds.2.15 Individual placement and support Description of IPS People with severe mental health problems face particular barriers to employment, both in relation to their impairments (McGurk & Mueser, 2004) and as a result of stigma and prejudice (Thornicroft,2006). To overcome these, an approach known as Individual Placement and Support (IPS), has beendeveloped (Department of Health, 2006) and has strong evidence to support it (Bond, Drake &Becker, 2008; Burns et al., 2007). There are 25 criteria for 'fidelity' of IPS to the standards of bestpractice, the management ratio and the caseload sizes used here are within the bounds of 'good toexemplary' scores; most of the other fidelity criteria have little or no direct impact on service costs.Moreover, there is evidence from the US that each place on a caseload serves about 1.8 clients over ayear. Although caseload size is used here to estimate a range of unit costs for IPS, turnover has not beenfactored in because it is likely to vary according to the skills of the post-holder. Necessary conditions for IPS to operate It should be noted that successful operation of IPS requires work-oriented mental health services,through cross-sector engagement and partnership working; this is not a role which should beundertaken exclusively by an IPS service. The specialist skills of IPS staff and managers costed here areintended to provide direct interventions with service users and employers, to place people in work andsupport them as required. Responsibility for the maintenance of work-oriented mental health is sharedmore widely across professionals in the field. Variations in the costs presented The IPS approach requires employment specialists to be integrated into the mental health team.However there is a wide range of levels at which the specialists are currently appointed. Therefore inTable 1, we offer costs for four grades of staff, two with professional qualifications (e.g. psychology,occupational therapy) and two with no particular qualifications. These different levels of pay,combined with a range of caseload sizes, yield a range of unit costs, as shown in Table 2. To the salarycosts are added the usual overheads, plus a management cost for a team leader, who according to IPSwisdom should not supervise more than 10 staff and should be available to provide practical support. Asmall marketing budget is included here, but annual costs for training were not available. We wereadvised by experienced IPS services that no other costs are commonly incurred. The unit cost per year shown in Table 2 ranges from \u00a31,441 to \u00a35,492, depending on caseload size and salary level of the worker. This does not take account of turnover in clients, as they require less supportand is therefore a conservative estimate of unit costs. Comparative costs of day care Unit costs of IPS may be compared to the costs of day care. In Unit Costs of Health and Social Care2009 Schema 2.11 (p. 65) the cost of voluntary sector day care was \u00a342 per day outside of London.Table 3 shows the number of day care sessions at this cost which would correspond to each level of IPScosts from Table 2. This ranges from 34 sessions - less than one day per week, to 131 sessions, less thanthree days per week. Whereas day care is often allocated in perpetuity, IPS is geared to finding a personpaid work, and therefore the amount consumed by a given individual is likely to decrease over time,making IPS likely to be more cost-effective for individuals who move on to work for any length of time.Moreover, there is some evidence that those individuals who attain work also gain in self-esteem(Sesami Research Team and Practice Partnership, 2007) and reduce their reliance on mental healthservices though not necessarily on benefits (Schneider et al., 2009) besides participating more fully inthe economy, with all that this brings in terms of social inclusion.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 79Table 1 Cost components (\u00a3) Unqualified Unqualified Qualified Qualified Band 3 Band 4 Band 5 Band 6 WageSalary oncostsSuperannuationOverheads - indirectOverheads & Becker, D.R.

The most recent NDTMS data (2008-09) show that 210,815individuals are receiving structured drug treatment. This year we have based the unit cost information on new research carried out by the National Treatment Agency (Personal communication with the NTA, 2010). This information provides thecosts of three principle treatment interventions: (a) residential rehabilitation, (b) inpatientdetoxification and (c) specialist prescribing. These interventions are described in more detail in thischapter and in 'Business Definition for Adult Drug Treatment Providers' referenced below (NationalTreatment Agency, 2010). 2 The provider's data was excluded from the national averages for interventions that fell in the top and bottom 5 per cent of unit costs for service users in treatment ORdays in treatment and the top and bottom 10 per cent of unit costs for service users in treatment AND days in treatment. 3.1 Residential rehabilitation for people who misuse drugs/alcohol Drug residential rehabilitation consists of a range of treatment delivery models or programmes to address drug and alcohol misuse, including abstinence orientated drug interventions within thecontext of residential accommodation. Examples include, inpatient treatments for thepharmacological management of substance misuse and therapeutic residential services designed toaddress adolescent substance misuse. See 'Business Definition for Adult Drug Treatment Providers'referenced below (National Treatment Agency, 2010) 3for the full description of residential treatment. Of the 210,815 individuals receiving structured drug treatment in 2008/09, there were 4,711 recordedin residential rehabilitation. It is known however that this has been under reported due to only abouttwo-thirds of residential providers making returns to the NDTMS in 2008/09. Information has been drawn from a sample of 34 residential rehabilitation programmes to produce a unit cost per resident week of \u00a3628 at 2009/2010 prices. This has been uprated from 2007/08 using theHMT GDP deflator. A breakdown of costs has not been calculated for Residential Rehabilitation dueto the method of collection for this service.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 83 1 National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (2009) Annual Report, 2008/09 , http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/ nta_annual_report_08-09_2.pdf, Date Accessed 14 September 2010. 2 National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (2010) NDTMS Dataset G, Definition, Business Definition for Adult Drug Treatment Providers , http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/yptreatmentbusinessdefinitionv7.05.pdf 3 National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (2010) NDTMS Dataset G, Definition, Business Definition for Adult Drug Treatment Providers , http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/yptreatmentbusinessdefinitionv7.05.pdf3.2 Inpatient detoxification for people who misuse drugs/alcohol An Inpatient Unit (IPU) provides care to service users with substance-related problems (medical, psychological or social) that are so severe that they r equire medical, psychiatric and psychological care. The key feature of an IPU is the provision of these services with 24-hour cover, 7 days per week, from amultidisciplinary clinical team who have had specialist training in managing addictive behaviours. Treatment in an inpatient setting may involve one or more of the following interventions: (a) assessment, (b) stabilisation and (c) assisted withdrawal (detoxification). A combination of three maybe provided or, one followed by the other. The three main settings for inpatient treatment are: (a) General hospital psychiatric units, (b) specialist drug misuse inpatient units in hospitals and (c) Residential rehabilitation units (usually as a precursorto the rehabilitation programme).

Specialist prescribinginterventions normally include comprehensive assessments of drug treatment need and the provisionof a full range of prescribing treatments in the context of care-planned drug treatment. The specialistteam should also provide, or provide access to, a range of other care-planned drug treatment. Thespecialist team should also provide or provide access to, a range of other care-planned healthcareinterventions including psychosocial interventions, a wide range of harm reduction interventions,Blood Borne Virus (BBV) prevention and vaccination, and abstinence-oriented interventions. The teams include specialist doctors who are usua lly consultant addiction psychiatrists 'with a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in psychiatry, with endorsement in substance misuseworking exclusively to provide a full range of services to substance misusers'. Such teams sometimeshave other specialists.

The information was drawn from a study of innovative approaches to providing respitecare. 1,2Although each of the schemes in the study was individual, this service typified the pattern of costs associated with such schemes. It should be noted, however, that this scheme did not provide anexclusively one-to-one staff to user ratio during outings and activities. Those schemes that did tendedto have higher hourly unit costs. There is little information about the costs of homes that specialise inshort-term residential care.

Multiple sclerosis and brain injury predominate among the conditions thatare dealt with. All of the residents use wheelchairs and many have communication problems. Theemphasis is to enable people to develop their individuality and lifestyle in an environment that isacceptable to them as their long-term home. Each resident occupies an open-plan flatlet with en-suitefacilities and a simple food preparation area. The objective is to provide a living environment thatoffers privacy and reasonable space in which to live to those who do not have the option of care in thecommunity because of the severity of their condition.

It does not specialise in providing a service for any particular type of disability, but many of theresidents are people with cerebral pa lsy and brain injury. The residents oc cupy individual open-plan flatlets offering en suite and food preparation facilities. Many res idents prepare their own meals, and activities of daily living skills are developed with the goal of enabling resid ents to live independently in the community. The aim is for about 50 per cent of residents to follow this route wh ile the remainder will remain for long-term care. The rate of 'move on' is slow, with one or two people leavi ng to live in the community per year. Dependency of residents is increasing, presenting greater obstacles fo r them in gaining independent living skills and reducing the likelihood of their living independently in the co mmunity. Costs have been inflated to 2009/2010 prices. Using PSS EX1 2008/09 uprated using the PSS Pay & Prices Inflator, mean costs of local authority residential care for adults with a physical disability or sensory impairment were \u00a31,286 and median costs were \u00a3869. 2 Mean costs of residential care provided by others for adult s with a physical disability or sensory impairment were \u00a3817 and median costs were \u00a3822.

The facility providesup to 30 places per day, with a current caseload of approximately 160 people. The centre operates onan outpatient basis and offers a full and intensive rehabilitation programme. The service model relieson strong partnerships with Health and Social Services as well as Addenbrooke Hospital, who providespecialist traumatic brain injury services, and local hospitals and GPs. The service enables people withbrain injury to remain in their own homes and to receive specialist intensive rehabilitation, rather thanbeing referred to specialist residential rehabilitation in other areas of the country. The service hasenabled the development of multi-disciplinary teamwork with a focus on the treatment of people withbrain injury in a non-health care setting.

Theunit costs of these services were also published for a survey week in February 2005 of 234,700children. 1Since 2008/09, the Children in Need Census has been annual, but has contained slightly different information. In 2008/09, although financial information was collected, rather than being for asample week as in previous censuses, the collection covered six months. Further differences betweenthese two surveys are discussed in Mahon (2008). 2 In this schema therefore, we present information collected in 2005 which is based on services receivedby each child seen during a survey week in February.

Three types of expenditure are captured.1) The costs of field and centre staff time carrying ou t social services activities with, or on behalf of, identified children in need and their families. 2) The costs of providing care and accommodation for children looked after (and similar regular, ongoing expenditure that can be treated in the same way). 3) One off or ad hoc payments and purchases for children in need or their families.

Girls between the ages of six and 14 who, within the previoustwo years, had disclosed sexual abuse and had symptoms of emotional or behavioural disturbance thatwarranted treatment, were eligible for inclusion. The girls who consented to participate in the studywere randomly allocated either to individual (n=35) or group psychotherapy (n=36). The individualtreatment comprised up to 30 sessions of focused psychoanalytical psychotherapy. Individual therapists received supervision from a senior child psychotherapist in pairs after every other session.The group treatment consisted of up to 18 sessions with about five girls of similar ages andincorporated psychotherapeutic and psycho-educational components. Various professionals providedtherapy, including child psychiatrists, psycho therapists, nurse practitioners and specialist, occupational therapists and social workers. The girls were assessed at baseline and followed up at oneand two years after treatment had commenced. Research found that these therapies have similar outcomes and although this is a single small study and further work is required to strengthen the evidence-base before change in practice is readilyundertaken, results of the study suggest that group therapy is more cost-effective than individualtherapy. Total mean costs of group therapy uprated to 2009/2010 levels were found to be \u00a32,845 andtotal mean costs of individual therapy uprated to 2009/2010 levels were found to be \u00a34,649. Service use data extracted from case notes and therapists' files were combined with unit costs representing the long-run marginal opportunity costs of the professionals involved in providing the service. Some of these were obtained from Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 1999 2while others were estimated from (national) pay scales and any additional elements were based on similar servicesreported in that publication. These unit costs cons ist of salary, employer superannuation and national insurance contributions, overheads and capital costs. Costs shown in the tables have been up-rated to2009/2010 levels using the appropriate indices.

Both key workers and the families supported see the key worker role as providing information and advice, identifying and addre ssing needs, accessing and co-ordinating services for the family, providing emotional support and acting as an adv ocate. The National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services (Department of Health & Department for Education and Skills, 2004)1 recommends provision of key workers to help families obta in the services they require and research has shown that key worker services appear to generate good outcom es for families and provision is encouraged through central government policy. In 2004/05 research was carried out using seven service si tes providing key worker services in order to explore the effectiveness of different models and also to calculate the unit costs (Greco et al., 2005; Beecham et al.,2007). 2,3In total 205 families returned questionnaires of wh ich there were 189 valid responses. Predominately, key workers included in the sample came from four professi onal backgrounds: health visiting, nursing, teaching and social work. However, parents, paediatricians, die ticians, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and early years workers also acted a s key workers. The children supported by these seven key workers services had a range of diagnoses of which autistic spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy and developmental delay were the most common in the sa mple. Most children had more than one condition. The table below shows that the average cost per working hour for the seven services was \u00a334 ranging This has been calculated by dividing the total cost by the tot al number of hours for which staff members undertook key-working activities. The unit cost is therefore, wei ghted for the staff-mix on each service. Over a three month period, the average and mean cost of contact, taking into account telephone calls and the costs of visits, was \u00a3151and \u00a387 respectively. All costs have been uprated to reflect 2009/2010 prices. Assuming this level of contact to be constant over 12 months, annual average contact costs would be \u00a3700. Using information provided by 11 key workers reporting t ime use, the contact to other activity ratio is 1:2.6 (for each hour spent in contact with the family, two and a hal f hours are spent on activities such as travel, liaison, meetings etc). At 2009/2010 prices, the total cost of all schemes was \u00a32,250,270 and the total caseload was1,237 giving an average annual cost per family across the schemes of \u00a31,820.

(2007) The costs of key worker support for disabled children and their families, Child: Care, Health and Development , 3, 5, 611-618.6.8 Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) is a programme of intervention designed for young people who display emotional and behavioural difficulties. It is based upon social learning and attachment theories and providesintensive support in a family setting. A multidisciplinary team of professionals work with MTFC foster carers tochange behaviour through the promotion of positive role models. Placements are intensive and tailored to the child'sspecific needs, with 24-hour support to carers. The specialised team of professionals is responsible for the planningand delivery of the programme and each practitioner has a clearly defined role. The core team consists of aprogramme supervisor, individual therapist, birth family ther apist, skills worker, administrator, foster carer recruiter and education worker, additional staff may be appointed in some local authorities. Research was carried out by the Centre for Child and Family Research, Loughborough University to calculate the costs of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care 1and to analyse how these costs compare with those of other types of provision for young people with similar needs. This research built on a previous study to explore the costs andoutcomes of services provided to looked after children and the calculation of unit costs of eight social care processes. 2 The process costs shown below align with those in the schema for children in care (8.8.1 - 8.8.4), in particular the high cost children. Costs per hour have been calculated using Curtis (2007)3and include overheads and capital costs. For each process the salary and overhead costs have been multiplied by the time spent by the practitioners involved tocalculate the unit costs. The costs provided below for providing and maintaining the placement account for over 90per cent of the costs of a care episode, but exclude the set-up costs. Cost have been uprated from 2006/2007 to 2009/2010 prices using the PSS Pay and Prices Inflators.

The child and teacher programs span the age range of 3-8 years. The schema below provides the resulting costs of theWebster-Stratton Incredible Years basic parenting programme which were collected in 2003/04 andhave been uprated using the hospital and community health services inflators (HCHS). The costs havebeen calculated by using the weekly cost diaries completed by leaders of four groups and the costinformation supplied by the Incredible Years Welsh Office over a 12 session programme. These figuresincluded costs of weekly attendance at supervision for group leaders. this was required because theseleaders were participating in a randomised controlled trial and were relatively inexperienced and werenot certified leaders. Generally, supervision for inexperienced leaders would be recommended on atermly basis, with encouragement to work for leader certification. Further details of the study areavailable from Edwards et al. (2007). 2 Although set up costs are not included in the table below, the unit costs have been calculated with andwithout these activities. Set up costs include pro ducing the programme kit and also the training of two leaders including travel and supervision time. The total cost for these activities was \u00a34,544 and thetotal time taken was 53 hours. Without these costs, the total cost per child over a 12 week programmebased on 8 and 12 parents per group would be \u00a31,771 and \u00a31,181 respectively. Including theseactivities, the total cost per child based on 8 and 12 parents per group would be \u00a32,339 and \u00a31,559respectively. Costs and unit estimation2009/2010 valueNotes A.

The study information was supplemented with national data not available fromthe sites. Three main types are identified: those propelled by an attendant or self propelled; a lightertype of chair especially designed for active users, and powered wheelchairs. (Active users are difficult todefine, but the term generally refers to individuals who are permanently restricted to a wheelchair butare otherwise well and have high mobility needs). The range of purchase costs is very high for the lattertwo types, ranging from \u00a3175 to \u00a3977 for active user chairs and \u00a3991 to \u00a31,833 for powered chairs(1994/95 prices uprated to current values). The costs have allowed for the cost of modifications in theestimated capital value, but this is a very approximate mid-range figure so specific information shouldbe used wherever possible.

Forty local authorities provided information. Major variations werereported, probably reflecting differences in the scale of work undertaken. The median rather than themean cost was used by Ernst & Young to overcome the spread of reported costs. All costs have beeninflated from 1992 prices using the BCIS/ABI House Rebuilding Cost Index. 2Although this information is rather dated, information contained in the BCIS Access Audit Price Guide, 2002suggested that the uprated figures are in line with current building costs. 3 The period over which equipment and adaptations should be annuitised is open to debate. Ideally itshould be annuitised over the useful life of the aid or adaptation. In many cases this is linked to thelength of time the person using the appliance is expected to remain at home. Where it is expected thatt h eh o u s ew o u l db eo c c u p i e db ys o m e o n ee l s ew h ow o u l da l s om a k eu s eo ft h ea d a p t a t i o n ,al o n g e rperiod would be appropriate. Clearly, this is difficult to do in practice. Many housing authorities haveproblems making sure that heavily adapted dwellings are occupied by people who can make use of theadaptations. According to government guidelines on the discount rate, this table shows the itemsannuitised over 10 years at 3.5 per cent.

For pre-registration courses, we need to consider the costs of tuition, the net cost or value of clinical placement and living expenses over the duration of the course. This table shows the total investment after allowing for the distribution of the costs over time to give the total investment incurred during the working life of the health service professional, and also theexpected annual cost to reflect the distribution of the returns on the investment over time. The investment costs of education should always be included when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different approaches to using health service staff as it is important to include all the costs implicit inchanging the professional mix. For the most part, these investment costs are borne by the wider NHSand individuals undertaking the training rather than trusts, so those costing exercises which areconcerned with narrowly defined costs to the provider organisation would not want to incorporatethese investment costs.

It is managed by a modern matron, but has a strongmulti-professional team approach. The unit is divided into three sections. The first is the 'assessmentarea', where patients go for between 24-72 hours on admission to have their health care needs closelyobserved and identified. They then go to the 'progression area', which is for patients who needmoderate to high nursing support where they undertake a rehabilitation programme. Finally, whenthey are progressing well, they go to the 'independent area' before returning home. In total there are 38beds. These are 2009/10 salary costs, and other costs are uprated to present values by using theappropriate HCHS inflators.

This programme is delivered locally by a network of trainers and around 1400 volunteertutors with long-term conditions. Courses, led by trainers who themselves have a chronic condition,are for an optimum number of 16 people and comprise six weekly sessions. Groups were led by two laytrainers or volunteers. The programme focuses on five core self-manage ment skills: problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, developing effective partnersh ips with healthcare providers and taking action. The programme offers a toolkit of fundamental techniques that patients can undertake to improve theirquality of life living with a long-term condition. It enables patients to develop their communicationskills, manage their emotions, manage daily activities , interact with the healthcare system, find health resources, plan for the future, understand exercising and healthy eating, and manage fatigue, sleep,pain, anger and depression (Department of Health, 2001). 1,2 The information for this schema is based on research carried out by the University of York.3,4The cost per participant is \u00a3285.

Typically, home care re-ablement is a short-term intervention, often free of charge, that aims t o maximise independent living skills. Information on the costs of re-ablement have been collected as part of the e valuation of home care reablement services carried out by the Personal Social Services Research Unit at Kent i n collaboration with researchers at the Social Policy Research Unit, University of York (Glendinning et al., 2010).1 The schema below provides the average costs of four re- ablement services participating in the evaluation.2All the services were based out of London and one service h ad occupational therapists embedded. Cost data was provided for 2008/09 and has been uprated using the Personal Social Services Inflators. Costs per service user for the four sites ranged from \u00a31,631 to \u00a32,215 at 2009/2010 prices. Please note that at 2008/2009 prices, the average cost of the four sites was \u00a32,000.

Autism has life-time consequences with a range of impacts on the health, economic well-being, social integrationand quality of life of individuals with the disorder, their families and potentially the rest of society.Many of those impacts can be expressed as economic costs. Interventions and services currently used to treat or support children and adults with ASD include services provided by medical practitioners, nurses, dieticians, psychologists, speech and languagetherapists, teachers and various providers of complementary and alternative medicine, such as musictherapy, aromatherapy, homeopathic remedies, naturopathic remedies, manipulative body therapies,and spiritual healing. These treatments, services and supports all impose costs either to the state or to acharity or to the families of people with ASD who have to pay for them out of their own pockets. Here we present cost information taken from two research studies, the first of which focuses on pre-school children and provides the service and wider societal costs in the UK (Barrett et al., 2010) 1. It looked at the services received by 152 pre-school children with autism, reported family out of pocketexpenses and productivity losses and explored the relationship between family characteristics andcosts. Service use data were collected using a modified version of the Child and Adolescent Service Use Schedule (CA-SUS), which was developed by the authors in previous studies and adapted for thepurpose of this study on the basis of expert opinion and pilot testing during the start up phase of thestudy. This was used to collect data on the use of specialist accommodation such as foster and respitecare, education or day care facilities attended, all medication prescribed for the individual child, allhospital contacts, and all community health, educ ation and social care services, including non- statutory provision. Education services provided were not recorded in order to avoid double countingthe costs of those services included in the overall cost of the education facility and because parents maynot always be aware of all services received by their child, particularly specialist facilities. In addition,parents were asked to report details of time off work due to their child's illness and expenditure on anyspecialist equipment or other extraordinary costs, such as home adaptations, conference or trainingattendance and overseas travel that were a direct result of their child's autism. Information from thisstudy is found in 8.2.1. The second study provides the annual costs for children (from the ages of 3-17) and adults with low-functioning and high functioning ASD (i.e. with and without an intellectual disability). Theresearch carried out by Knapp et al. (2007; 2009) 2,3estimated the full costs of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the United Kingdom using data on 146 children and 91 adults. In the sample ofchildren with autism, ages ranged from 3 to 17, with a mean of 10.28 years (standard deviation 3.173)and a median age of 10. Data was taken from a variety of sources, including: national surveys,published research, previous studies by the Institute of Psychiatry and expert advice. The purpose ofthe study was to examine the service, family and other economic consequences of autism in the UK,both for children and adults, with ASDs, with and wit hout an intellectual disability.

All costs presented were for 2006/2007 and have therefore been uprated to 2009/2010 using the appropriate inflators. This table reports the service and wider societal costs for the six months prior to interview for pre-school children with autism. The mean total service costs were \u00a32,781, equivalent to \u00a3463 permonth and over \u00a35,500 per year. Almost half the costs (45 per cent) were for education and childcare,41 per cent were for community health and social services and 12 per cent for hospital services. As totalcosts varied substantially between the children in the study (range \u00a3338 to \u00a37,145 over six months),box 1 below presents case studies of low and high cost cases. On average, families spent an additional \u00a3242 as a result of their child's illness over the six months prior to interview (range 0 to \u00a33,574). Fifty-one per cent of families reported taking some time offwork due to their child's illness over the six months, associated with productivity losses of \u00a3293 perfamily. Total costs including all services, family costs and productivity losses were estimated over\u00a33,000 over six months, equivalent to more than \u00a3500 per month.

(2007; 2009)1,2estimated the full costs of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the United Kingdom using data on 146 children and 91 adults. The table below summarises the average cost per child with low-functioning ASD, whether living with their families or living in a residential or foster care placement. Costs are organised under a number ofdifferent service and support headings. Family expenses were also included and where appropriate,costs were imputed for the lost employment of parents. The table distinguishes children in the threedifferent age groups that were used. The annual costs for children with low-functioning ASD who areliving in residential or foster placements are estimated to be \u00a317,693 (if aged 0-3), \u00a344,335 (aged4-11) and \u00a368,325 (aged 12-17). For the two older age groups the largest contributors to these totalsare the care placements themselves, and special education. The authors noted that given theavailability of data, residential special school costs may have been underestimated. Costs for children with low-functioning ASD who live with families are much lower: \u00a34,744 (if aged 0-3), \u00a330,449 (aged 4-11) and \u00a344,221 (aged 12-17). For the two older age groups the largestcontributors to these totals are special education, and health and social care services (includinghospital and respite care).

As in schema 8.6.2, the table below distinguishes costs under a number of different service and support headings.

(2007; 2009)1,2estimated the full costs of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the United Kingdom using data on 146 children and 91 adults. The estimatedannual costs for adults with high-and low-functioning ASD are presented below. Imputed costs for lostemployment are included for both the individuals with ASD and for parents, where these areappropriate. Costs are arranged by place of residence. For an adult with high-functioning ASD, it is estimated that the annual cost of living in a private household (with or without family) is \u00a336,460. A sizeable part of this (\u00a321,617) is the imputed cost oflost employment for the individual with ASD (and hence also lost productivity to the economy). Partof that (not separately identified here) would be lost tax revenue to the Exchequer. Costs for high-functioning adults in supported living settings or care homes are much higher (\u00a393,230 and \u00a396,193 per annum respectively) and the proportion attributable to lost employment is lower.The largest cost element in each case is for accommodation, and includes the costs of staff employed inthose settings or supporting the residents. For low-functioning adults, the mean annual costs (excluding benefits but including lost employment) rise with increased support in the accommodation for those living in private households from\u00a347,014to \u00a3107,934 for those in hospital care.

These case studies weredesigned to illustrate the wide range of medical, nursing and other needs of technology dependentchildren. They are not precise descriptions of any three particular families. Instead of drawing on 'reallife' cases, they are designed to illustrate the wide range of medical, nursing and other needs oftechnology dependent children.

The costs of specialist equipment and associated consumables, home care services and enteral feeding were supplied by staffat two specialist regional hospitals. Information on the costs of community health and local authorityservices were originally obtained from Netten et al. (1998). 3Details of professional salary costs were obtained from the 1999 report of the relevant pay review bodies. These costs have been uprated toreflect the present day costs. Costs borne by families themselves which were similar to those incurredin the care of a severely disabled child were obtained from a study which used budget standardmethods to estimate the costs of childhood disability (Dobson and Middleton, 1998). 4The costs of other extra consumer items needed by families the mselves were obtained from mainstream High Street suppliers. The annual costs of supporting technology-dependent children are presented.

Her divorced m other gave up work as a secretary to care for her and they lived in local authority housing which was adapted to provide a downsta irs bedroom and bathroom. They had no car, so used taxis or pay friends to take A out. She attended a special school and received hom e visits from an outreach nurse from the specialist regional hospital 10 miles away, monthly visits from the local paediatri c nursing team and physiotherapy once a week. A's mother had round the clock help from a team of specially trained hom e carers (who also care for A at school); some home help for housework and to take A's sibling to school; and quarterly vis its from a social worker. She also received counselling and medication to help cope with the stress of caring for A. She h ad extra phone bills and the costs of refreshments for the home carers, over and above those normally associated with a severely disabled child.

She suffered severe anoxia at birth, has a tracheostomy and was fed through a naso-jejunal tube.She was likely to be severely disabled. Her parents owned their house 50 miles from the regional specialist hospital. They had no personal transport. B's father switched from full to part-time wor k to help with her care. They had quarterly visits from a specialist outreach nurse from the hospital and monthly visits from the local d istrict nurse, health visitor, o ccupational and physiotherapists and Portage workers. A weekly service removed clinical waste from the house. Trained home carers provided a break for B's parents three nights a week. A social worker was involved in multi- disciplinary planning/review meetings about B. B's parents used taxis or paid relatives' petrol costs instead of public tran sport, purchased a mobile phone and spent extra on phone calls to hospital.

He recei ved continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis every night and overnight feeding through a gastrostomy. He lived with his younger sibling in an owner-occupied house, which has had some minoradaptations to improve hygiene and storage facilities. His fathe r worked full time; his mother cut her hours and lost promotion opportunities because of C's care. They owned their own car. C lived 20 miles from the specialist hospital, which he attended regularly for outpatient monitoring; both parents therefore need ed extra time off work and incurred associated travel costs. C was visited at home each month by a specialist outreach nurse and also h ad annual visits from the dietician and social worker based at the hospital.

Information from practitioners and managers, gathered in the course of developingunit costs for social work processes, indicated that the prevalence of children within the carepopulation who display the following attributes \u2014 or combinations of them \u2014 is likely to have animpact on the cost of placements: disabilities; emotional or behavioural difficulties; and offendingbehaviour. 1Unaccompanied asylum seeking children compr ise a further group whose circumstances, rather than their attributes, engender a different pattern of costs. In any population of looked afterchildren, there will be some children who have none of these additional support needs. Authoritieswith a higher proportion of children without additional needs will incur lower average costs per lookedafter child. However in reality their overall expenditure on children's services may be greater, for suchauthorities may place a higher proportion of their whole population of children in need away fromhome than do those with better developed family support services. The study by Ward and colleagues identified different combinations of additional support needs. There were five simple groups of children who display none or one of the exceptional needs expectedto affect costs, and six complex groups of children who display two or more additional support needs.In the sample of 478 children, 129 (27 per cent) showed no evidence of additional support needs, 215(45 per cent) displayed one; 124 (26 per cent) children displayed combinations of two; and a very smallgroup of children (2 per cent) displayed combinations of three or more. The care package costs for children described in the schemata illustrate an example of the support received by a child in some of these groups, taken from the study sample. Costs relate to time periodsstated in the individual schemata.Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 143 1 Ward, H., Holmes, L., Soper, J. & Olsen, R.

These costs show the total cost incurred by social services and other agencies from February 2000 to October 2001 uprated using the PSS Pay & Prices inflator. He first became looked after at the age of six, as the result of neglect. Since t hen he has been placed with the same local authority foster carers \u2014 a placement that had lasted eight years by the start of the study. In June 2001, his case was transferred to the leaving care team. Reviews were held at six monthly intervals and his care plan was updated every six months. He attended six monthlydental appointments and an annual looked after child medical. During the time period shown above, this young person attendedweekly, hour-long physiotherapy sessions as a result of a neck injury. A care order was obtained in 1992. He completed hisstatutory schooling in summer 2001 and obtained seven GCSEs. He attended mainstream school until Summer 2000. He thenprogressed to further education to start an A level course. Child A had a relatively inexpensive placement with local author ity foster carers. He incurred some educational costs, in that he attended school, and some health care costs, but there was no exce ptional expenditure. Please note that these figures have been rounded.

She then changed to another placement with local aut hority foster carers within the ar ea of the authority. A care order was obtained for this young person when she first became looked after in March 1995. During the time frame three reviewmeetings were held and her care plan was also updated on three occasions. Child B attended mainstream school during the time period. From December 2000 until June 2001 she received support from a personal teaching assistant for four hours a week. This young person attended six monthly dental appointments and also her annual looked after child medical. Child B received speechtherapy until July 2001. Following a self-harm incident she was take n to the accident and emergency department. As a result of this incident she was referred to a clinical psychologist and began weekly sessions in September 2000. Costs to social services are relatively low, largely because she was placed with local authority foster carers within the area of the authority throughout the study period. Although she did experience a change of placement the costs of this change were relatively low because she was not classified as difficult to place. There wer e relatively high costs to other agencies, designed to meet both her health and educational needs. Please note that these figures h ave been rounded.

He first became looked after at the age of eleven when his parents needed relief. Prior to the start of the study he was placed in secure accommo dation on five separate occasions. He had also been placed in various residential homes, schools and foster placements, many of which had broken down. As a consequence he had beenclassified as 'difficult to place'. During the study period Child C e xperienced ten different placements. He also refused all statutory medicals and dental appointments, furthermore, he refused an y mental health support. Child C did not complete his statutory schooling as a result of numerous exclusions and non-attendance. P rior to the start of the study he had a history of offending, this continued throughout the study with him committing ten further offences. He ceased being looked after in summer 2001 when he refused to return to any placement provided by the local authority. The costs to social services were relatively high, both because of a number of out-of-authority, residential placements provided by agencies and due to nine changes of placement. There were subst antial costs to other agencies (Youth Offending Team and the Police) as a result of his offending behaviour. Additional hea lth care costs were not incurred for this young man because of his refusal to engage in the services offered to him. Please note that t hese figures have been rounded.

Initially he was placed in an agency residential unit with education facilities out of the area of the authority. In March 2000, he was placed with agency foster carers, again out of the area of the authority. He then experienced three further placements, all out of the area of the authority and allprovided by agencies: another residential unit, then another foste r placement, then a third residential placement. In September he was placed overnight in a secure unit within the area of the authority. He was then placed with agency foster carers followed by afurther agency residential unit before moving to a specialis ed one bedded, agency, residential unit in December 2000. This placement was also out of the area of the authority. Review meetings were held six monthly and his care plan was also updatedevery six months. This young person attended the education pr ovision in two different residential units up until summer 2000, when he was permanently excluded. He then started sessions with a home tutor in October 2000. During the given time periodhe attended six monthly dental appointments and his looked after child medical. He also attended weekly sessions with a clinicalpsychologist from October 2000 onwards. In September 2000, he commi tted a criminal offence, the police were involved, but he was not convicted. These costs are markedly higher than for the majority of other ch ildren in the sample. Child D had become 'difficult to place' and increasing amounts of social work time had to be spent on findi ng the rare placements that were prepared to accept him. The costs of changing placements were calculated at over \u00a31,000 pe r move. Please note that these figures have been rounded.

ABI includes a range of diagnoses or causes including strokes or tumours; head injurythrough trauma is a common cause among young adults. ABI is not thought to affect life expectancyafter the initial acute phase, so the prevalence of long-term brain damage is high at 100-150 per 100,000 population, implying a total of 60,000-90,000 people in the UK (www.rhn.org.uk). A study carried out by the Personal Social Services Research Unit was undertaken to identify the health and social care services used by young adults aged 18-25 years with acquired brain injury (ABI)and the associated costs. 1The study identified the annual incidence of ABI in this age group and then tracked the young adults' likely progress through fo ur support-related stages: trauma, stabilisation, rehabilitation and return to the community. By identifying the numbers using different treatmentlocations and services at each stage, a picture of service use and costs could be built up over a notional12-month period following injury. All costs have been uprated to 2009/2010 prices using the HCHSPay and Prices Inflator. Four broad groups of young people with ABI were identified by their location and the community care stage as follows: Group 1 comprises the largest proportion of those sustaining brain injuries and includes those who attend A&E with ABI or spend short periods in a hospital ward and then return home. A sma ll proportion- perhaps just one in five-will have follow-up appointments arranged at an outpatient clinic or with their G P. This group will generally have had a mild head injury and no longer-term disability, although 20 per cent of this group ma y continue to have residual symptoms 6 months after injury. Group 1: Average cost per person = \u00a3289 p.a. People in Group 2 are also likely to have returned to their own homes within a year, but are more seriously disabled and rely on personal care support provided by spouses, parents or other inf ormal carers. This group may inc lude those who are discharged home from longer-term residential rehabilitation (34 per cent of p atients discharged), from acute brain injury units (25 per cent) and from neurosurgery units (23 per cent). It is likely that at lea st 40 per cent of them will require at least part-time support or supervision from informal carers. Group 2: Average costs per person = \u00a320,647 p.a. The third group of young adults with ABI are those whose pathway towards the end of a year will see them living in supported accommodation with formal (paid) personal carers. Some will ha ve been discharged straight from hospital and some will have stayed in a rehabilitation facility prior to their move to supported living. One in four of these young adults will need overnightsupervision and three in four will need at least part-time supe rvision during the day. The number of young adults may be quite high, but some will move on to more independent living. Others will need this type of support for many years to come. For cost estimates, it has been assumed this group will live in community-based housing with low staffing levels during the day and'sleeping-in' staff at night. In addition to personal care the y are also likely to use outpatient clinics and community-based therapists. Personal care costs (estimat ed at an average of 8 hours overnight 'sleep ing-in' and 6 hours during the day) would amount to \u00a3517 per week. Use of community-based therapy and health care services would add another \u00a3601 by the end of thenotional 12 month period. Group 3: Average cost per person = \u00a339,585 p.a The fourth group includes young adults who are likely to be among the most severely disabled. Although some will be supported at home, it is estimated that 310 will be resident in nursing homes fo r young adults, specialist ABI residential units, in longer-stay hospital wards or in mental health units. They are likely to have been the most severely injured. Some of the principal independent providers contacted for this research reported current prices fo r residential placements of up to \u00a33,007 per week, often jointly funded by health and social services. Nursing homes and 'young disa bility units' are likely to be less costly. However nursing home care may not be appropriate for people with severe ABI-related d isability as there tend ot be few qualified staff and low input from local community-based teams or specialist doctors. Group 4: Average cost per person = \u00a340,788 p.a.148 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 1 Beecham, J., Perkins, M., Snell, T. & Knapp, M.

The new General Medical Service contract (nGMS) is designed to improve the way that Primary Care services are funded, and to allow p ractices greater flexibility to determine the range of services they wish to provide, including opting out of additional services and out-of-hours care. Allowing for whole time equivalence (wte). The NHS Information Centre has estimated that the number of FTE practitioners (excluding GP registrars and GP retainers) has decreased to 32,111 in 2009.1 Allowing for expenditure not associated with GP activity. We have excluded expenditure related to dispensing and medication. Direct care staff.1On average in 2009, each FTE equivalent practitio ner (excluding GP registrars & GP retainers) employed 0.58 FTE practice staff. All direct care staf f have been costed at the same level as a band 5 GP practice nurse. Other practice expenses . These are based on payments made for enhancing services such as the Primary Care Modernisation Fund and Childhood Immunisation. It also includes other payments for improved quality such asChronic Disease Management Allowan ces and Sustained Quality Allowances. Prescription costs. Average prescription costs per consultation are \u00a343 (Net Ingredient Cost: NIC). NIC is the basic cost of the drug, while Actual Cost is the NIC less the assumed average discount plus the container allowance(and plus on-cost for appliance contractors). These are based on information about annual numbers of consultationsper GP, estimated by using the number of GPs for 2009 an d the annual number of consultations per GP (5,956 in 2007/08), 2,3number of prescriptions per GP (26,851 in 2008)4and the average actual total cost per GP prescription has remained at \u00a38.80 at 2009 prices or \u00a39.48 per NIC.5The number of prescriptions per consultation (4.56) has hardly changed since 2008/09 but any increase reflects the r eduction in the number of consultations made by GPs and the increase in repeat prescriptions arising from initial consultations. Qualifications. The equivalent annual cost of pre-registration and postgraduate medical education. The investment in training has been annuitised over the expected working life of the doctor.6Postgraduate education calculated using information provided by the London Deanery.7This includes the cost of the two-year foundation programme, two years on a General Practice Vocational Training Scheme (GP -VTS) and a further year as a general practice registrar.8 Costs consist of an amount for the generic curriculum, the postgraduate centres infrastructure costs, study leave and the costs of course organisers, admin support, trainers workshops, vocational training and internal courses for GPtutors. Excluded are the costs of running the library postgraduate centres. See schema 7.4 for further details ontraining for health professionals. Computer equipment. Ideally, this should include an annuitised figure reflecting the level of computer equipment in GP surgeries. However, the figure presented in the schema represents the yearly amount allocated to IT expenditureduring 2008/09. This has been taken from the final expenditu re figures from the Department of Health. PCOs rather than practices now fund the purchase, maintenance, upgrading, running and training costs of computer systems. Overheads . This includes expenditure on centrally managed administration such as recruitment and retention, demand management and expenditure relating to GP allowances such as locum allowances and retainer schemepayments. Activity . The 2006/07 UK General Practice Workload Survey provides an overview of the entire workload and skill-mix of general practices in the UK in 2006/07 and is the first under the new contract. Staff in a representative sample of 329 practices across the UK completed diary sheets for one week in September or December. As the surveywas targeted at work in the practice, it excludes work done e lsewhere as well as any work identified as out-of-hours (OOH) not relating to the GMS/PMS/PCTMS practice contract. In order to convert the annual hours worked intoweeks, the average number of hours worked on GMS duties was used. On this basis wte GMPs work 43.5 weeks a yearfor 44.4 hours per week.168 Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2010 1 The Information Centre (2010) General Practice Staff 2009 , The Information Centre , Leeds. 2 Hippisley-Cox, J. & Vinogradova, Y.

Training \u00a32,343 per year 1996/1997 costs inflated by t he PSS Pay & Prices index. The training consisted of 12 day sessions attended by 14 FSWs. 5The costs included the payments to trainers and their expenses, accommodation in which the training took place and lunches.Allowance was made for the opportunity cost of the FSW's time which otherwisecould have been spent delivering the se rvice. It was assumed that two years was the expected length of time over which the training package would deliver. Half thestaff left during the second year so the total number of 'trained years' that weredelivered from the course was 21. This init ial investment was annuitised over two years and allowed for drop outs to reach an annual cost of \u00a32,343. D.

This a process by which doctors holding registration with a licence topractise will have to demonstrate to the General Medical Council that they are up to dateand fit to practise and are complying with the relevant professional standards. This will haveimplications for their Continuing Professional Development and the cost of this ongoingtraining. The Royal College of General Practitioners is now adopting a CPD credit system(Royal College of General Practitioners, 2007) based on the impact of new learning onpatient care. It will expect a minimum of 50 credits per year for revalidation from 2011,which is estimated to take a minimum of 50 hours. Credits may be awarded for activitiessuch as attending approved courses, publishing scientific papers, presenting research atmeetings, certain teaching duties and participation in audit (quality assurance) exercises.Schemes are still very new, and details vary from college to college. As it is too early to haveany estimated costs, this year we have continued to uprate the costs of this ongoing traininguntil further work has been carried out. Working hours The Working Time Regulations 1998 (WTR) came into force in the UK for doctors intraining from 1 August 2009. The WTR provide for an individual opt-out for all healthcareprofessionals, including doctors, where requested and where there is a well-founded serviceneed, or in an emergency situation. In the opt-out agreement, any reference to additionalhours means hours worked in excess of 48 per week averaged over the relevant referenceperiod.

These doctors usually work i ndependently but will be attached to a clinical team led by a consultant in their specialty. Some of them are listed on the GMC' s specialist register and are eligible to take on a consultant post. The reasons why they do not are variable, and include a wish to concentrate on clinical work and to avoid theadministrative pressures of a consultant post; a desire to have a better work/life balance; and, in some cases, a lack of opportunity to access higher training posts. They do, however, ta ke part in the full range of clinical work, including teaching junior doctors.1,2,3 Costs and unit estimation2009/2010 valueNotes A.

The PCI measures pay inflation in the HCHS. The PCI is itself a weighted avera ge of increases in unit staff costs for each of the staff groups within the HCHS sector. Pay cost inflation tends to be higher than pay settlement inflation because of an element of pay drift within each staff group. Pay drift is the tendency for there to be a gradual shift up the incremental scales, and is additional to settlement infla tion. The estimate of pay inflator for the current year is based on information supplied by the Department of He alth and is based on pay awards of NHS staff. The HSCI is calculated monthly to measure the price change for eac h of 40 sub-indices of goods and services purchased by the HCHS. The sub-indices are weighted together accordi ng to the proportion of total expenditure which they represent to give the overall HSCI value. The pay cost index and the health service cost index are weightedtogether according to the proportion of HCHS expend iture on each. This provides an HCHS combined pay and prices inflation figure.

In a ddition two support groups were identified: admin/office and ancillary staff. As it was not possible to collect de tailed data on all staff working in these groups, it was assumed that their pay increases were in line with the average for England. These pay changes were weighted by the proportion of PSS staff in each group and the different pay levels of each group i.e. that occupation group's share of the total PSS paybill. Pay changes for 2008/09 are projected using an average of the deflated pay changes in the past three years. This assumes that pay increa ses next year will be in line with the previous trend. For non-staff revenue, Her Majesty's Treasury's (HMT) GDP deflator is used to deflate prices. (See table 3above). This index is a measure of general inflation i n the domestic economy. HMT produces the GDP deflator from data provided by the ONS and extends the series to fut ure years by applying forecasts of the inflation rate. The capital element of social care provision of all types is the value of capital annuitised over a reasonable periodand discounted. The index used is the BERR PUBSEC Tender Price Index of Public Sector BuildingNon-housing. This is the index used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to deflate capital expenditure inh e a l t ha n ds o c i a lw o r k ,s oi tw a sc o n s i d e r e dt h em o s ts u i t a b l ei n d e xf o ru s ei nt h eP S SP a y&P r i c e sI n d e x( s e eTable 3 above).

Calculated as mean basic salary, but for all earnings. This includes basic salary, plus hours related pay, overtime, occupation payments, location payments and other payme nts including redundancy pay or payment of notice periods. 3. The median is calculated by ranking individuals FTE basic pay, and taking the midpoint. It is considered a more robust indicator of 'typical' pay than the mean. 4.
