However, naked plasmid DNA is only poorly immunogenic and new effective delivery strategies are needed to enhance the potency of DNA vaccines. In this study, we present a novel approach for the delivery of DNA vaccines using inert poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated polystyrene particles, which greatly enhance DNA immunogenicity. Intradermal injection of plasmid DNA encoding for chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA) complexed with PLL-coated polystyrene nanoparticles induced high levels of CD8 T cells as well as OVA-specific antibodies in C57BL/6 mice and furthermore inhibited tumour growth after challenge with the OVA expressing EG7 tumour cell line. Importantly, vaccine efficacy depended critically on the size of the particles used as well as on the presence of the PLL linker. Our data show that PLL-coated polystyrene nanoparticles of 0.05 microm but not 0.02 microm or 1.0 microm in diameter are highly effective for the delivery of DNA vaccines.
