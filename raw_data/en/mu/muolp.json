Arnetz L, Ekberg NR, Alvarsson M. Sex differences in type 2 diabetes: focus on disease course and outcomes . Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes 2014;7:409-420. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are less likely to reach the goals for hemoglobin A1c compared with men, and have higher all-cause mortality. The risk of cardiovascular disease is elevated among both men and women with T2D, however, the risk has declined among men over recent years while it remains station-ary in women. Reasons for these sex differenc es remain unclear, and guidelines for dia- betes treatment do not differentiate between sexes. Possible causes for varying out- come include differences in physiology, trea tment response, and psychological factors. This review briefly outlines sex differences in hormonal pathophysiology, and thereaf- ter summarizes the literature to date on sex differences in disease course and outcome. METHODS: Systematic searches were performed on PubMed using \"sex\", \"gender\", and various glucose-lowering therapies as keywords. Earlier reviews are summarized and results from individual studies are report ed. Reference lists from studies were used to augment the search. RESULTS: There is an increased risk of missing the diagnosis of T2D when screening women with only fasting plasma glucose instea d of with an oral glucose tolerance test. The impact of various risk factors for complications may differ by sex. Efficacy and side effects of some glucose-lowering drugs differ between men and women. Men with T2D appear to suffer more microvascular complications, while women have higher morbid- ity and mortality in cardiovascular disease and also fare worse psychologically. CONCLUSION: Few studies to date have focu sed on sex differences in T2D. Several questions demand further study, such as wh ether risk factors and treatment guidelines should be sex-specific. There is a need for cl inical trials designed specifically to evalu- ate sex differences in efficacy and outcome of the available treatments.

Abstract: AIMS: To determine the impact on glycaemic control and hypogly- caemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Data were pooled from six randomiz ed clinical trials of insulin glargine or NPH insulin in insulin-naive, inadequately controlled patients. Female [n=1251; mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level 8.99%, age 56.91years, HbA1c 8.9%, age 57.47years, diabetes du- ration 10.13years) were started on and treated with insulin glargine or NPH insulin for 24-36weeks. HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels, percent achieving HbA1c target of <7% and insulin dose ch ange were recorded. RESULTS: For both men and women, HbA1c levels were significantly reduced over time (p<0.001); a significantly greater HbA1c reduction was observed in men than in women (-1.36 vs. -1.22; p=0.002). Significan tly fewer women achieved target HbA1c of <7% (p<0.001). At the study end, women ha d a significantly higher insulin dose/kg than men (0.47 vs. 0.42U/kg; p<0.001). The incidence rates of se vere and severe noc- turnal hypoglycaemia were significantly p<0.05 and 2.24% vs. 0.59%; p<0.001, respectively). Women were more likely to experience severe hypoglycaemia [odds ratio (OR) 1.80; 95% confidence p=0.001). observations confirm studies that found a smaller improve- ment in HbA1c and greater hypoglycaemia in women during insulin treatment. Physi- cians should be aware of the need to determine and closely monitor dosing, particularly in women, to optimize the balance between glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia 11 risk.Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Detemir plus aspart and glulisine induced lipoatrophy: 2015 literature review and report of a new case . Clinical Diabetes and Endocrinolog y 2015;1 (1) (no pagination)(10). Abstract: Background: In the first and only li terature review, conducted in 2009, of hu- man insulin analog- induced lipoatrophy, there were 12 published cases, including 1 with aspart, 1 with detemir, 1 with NovoMix 30 and none with detemir plus aspart. It is perceived that insulin analog induced-lipoatrophy is increasing. We conducted a 2015 literature review of published reports of lipoatrophy induced by aspart, detemir, de- temir plus aspart, and NovoMix30. We also a new case of detemir plus aspart and glulisine induced lipoatrophy. Methods: Our focused literature searches (l imited to 1995-2014) in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, using a combination of insulin analog and lipoatrophy terminol- ogy, was conducted in early January 2015. Results: From the 520 unique citations there were 33 (from 13 papers and 9 abstracts) lipoatrophy cases induced by (n=3), representing 30 new cases since 2009. Many of these reported cases were females (76%), had type 1 diab etes mellitus (T1DM) (94%) and were in young persons (61%). A 41-year-old T1DM woman developed lipoatrophy on her upper thighs, arms and abdomen 14months after in jecting detemir plus aspart at the same sites. Later on, after a year on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using aspart and then glulisine, she developed lipoatrophy at the infusion sites. When CSII insulin was switched to lispro she did no t develop lipoatrophy after 10months. Mean- while, the original lipoatrophy sites significantly improved. Conclusions: Our literature review uncovere d 30 new published cases of aspart, plus since 2009. The larg- est increase in cases was in aspart- induce d lipoatrophy. Recent surveys showed most rapid acting insulin analog-induced lipoatro phy were associated with CSII. In our re- view of the reported cases, 85.7% cases of aspart-induced lipoatro phy were associated with CSII. As in previous reports, we showed lipoatrophy was more common in fe- males, T1DM and young persons. Our pati ent may be the 5<sup>th</sup> published case of detemir plus aspart-induced lipoat rophy and possibly the first case report of glulisine induced lipoatrophy. She believed both detemir plus aspart and Harman-B oehm I, Cukierman-Yaffe T. Effect of intranasal insulin on cognitive function: A systematic review . Journal Clinical Metabolism 2012;97(2):366-376. Abstract: Aim: Epidemiological studies raised the possibility that cog- nitive function may be affected by brain re sponses to insulin. We systematically re- viewed and analyzed existing clinical trials thatassessedthepotential beneficial effectso- fintranasal insulinadministrationoncognitive functions. Methods: Interventional stud- ies measuring changes in cognitive functions in response to intranasal insulin were re- trieved and included if they were in Engl ish and assessed cognitive functions before and after treatment. Cohen's effect size was calculated to allow comparison between studies. Results: Eight studies (328 particip ants) were analyzed. No significant side ef- fects of intranasal insulin administration we re reported. Seven stud ies included healthy subjects' response to intranasal insulin, and three evaluated the cognitive effect among patients with minimal cognitive impairment or overt Alzheimer's disease. In healthy people, Cohen's effect size calculations sugge st that only 160 IU/d intranasal insulin induced potential beneficial effects. Although females, when compared head-to-head, exhibited greater improvements in cognitive tests than men, the composite analysis of all included studies did not support this trend. Among cognitively impaired patients, only lower doses of insulin were assessed, an d 20 IU revealed pote ntial beneficial ef- fects on cognitive functions. This was signif icant in a single study assessing long-term 12 intranasal insulin administration, whereas acut e administration of 20 IU intranasal in- sulin tended to show a beneficial effect on immediate recall in Apo epsilon4(-), but not Apo epsilon4(+), patients. Conclusions: The current limited clinical ex perience suggests potential beneficial cog- nitive effects of intranasal insulin. Analyses provide clinical considerations for future research aimed at elucidatin g whether intranasal insulin may be used to improve cog- nitive functions.

Abstract: Objective: The use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) has been associated with in- creased fracture risk. We performed a comp rehensive literature review and meta-anal- ysis to estimate the risk of fractures with TZDs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database, from inception to May 2014. We included all randomized trials that described the risk of fractures or changes in bone mineral density (BMD) with TZDs. We pooled data with odds ratios (ORs) for fractures and the weighted mean difference in BMD. To assess heterogeneity in results of individual studies, we used Cochran's Q statistic and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Results: We included 24,544 participants wi th 896 fracture cases from 22 randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis showed that the significantly increased incidence of fracture was found in women (OR. =. 1.94 ; 95%CI: 1.60-2.35; P<. 0.001), 0.83-1.27; P=. 0.83 ). For women, the (OR. =. treatment and appeared to be similar for partici- pants aged <. 60. years old (OR. =. 1.89; 95%CI: 1.51-2.36; P<. 0.001) and aged 2.07; 95%CI: 1.51-2.36; P<. 0.001). There was a non-significant trend towards increased risk of fractures in diffe rent cumulative durati ons of TZD exposure. TZD treatment was also associated with si gnificant changes in BMD among women at the lumbar spine(weighted results suggest that TZD tr eatment is associated with an increased risk of fractures in women, effects of rosigl itazone and pioglitazone are similar, fracture risk is independent of age and fracture risk has no clear association with duration of TZD exposure.

Expert Review of Cardiovascular Ther- apy 2012;10(12):1471-1480. Abstract: The emergence of new oral anticoagulants is a major development in cardio- vascular medicine. In this overview, we sought to evaluate the impact of gender, heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes on stroke prevention with war- farin and the new oral anticoagulants by conducting a semisystematic review and meta-analysis including 44,563 patients in rece nt contemporary Phase III trials. The new oral anticoagulants were superior to warfarin irrespective of gender or the presence of diabetes. For nonparoxysmal AF, event rates are similar with warfarin and new antico- agulants. There is some suggestion of the benefit of new oral anticoagulants in patients with paroxysmal AF. For patients without heart failure, the new drugs are superior, whereas in patients with evidence of heart failure the new drugs were similar to warfa- rin. In conclusion, new oral anticoagulants ar e better than warfarin irrespective of gen- der or the presence of diabetes mellitus. Pa tients with heart failure and nonparoxysmal AF seem not to gain additional prognostic benefit from new anticoagulants. Alotaibi GS, Almodaimegh H, McMurtry MS, Wu C . Do women bleed more than men when prescribed novel oral an ticoagulants for venous INTRODUCTION: Bleeding complications occur more frequently in women than men in clinical trials of warfarin an d thrombolytics. It is unknown whether these sex-related differences exist for new oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban. To determine whether women suffer more bleeding complications with these agents, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on new oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism (VTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, trial register on the Cochrane libr ary were searched to identify studies that evaluated novel oral anticoagulants versus any comparator , and reported outcomes, including major bleeding and recurrent VTE, stratified by se x. No language restri ctions were applied. Studies were evaluated according to a priori inclusion criteria and critically appraised using established internal validity criteria. Pooled relative risk was estimated using a random effects model. RESULTS: Eight studies were eligible, comp rising 9417 patients. There was no differ- ence in the primary efficacy outcome of recurrent VTE between men and women [Rela- tive Risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.39]. However, men had less major bleeding with novel oral anticoagulan ts compared to women [RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.97, p=0.03]. All-cause mortality was no t reported by sex in any of the studies. CONCLUSION: Women suffer more bleeding complications than men when receiving novel oral anticoagulants for VTE. Future clin ical trials should report outcomes strati- fied by sex, and further studies are needed to investigate the clinical impact of this sex- related safety difference.Copyright \u00a9 2013.

Gender Dif- ference in Efficacy and Safety of Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation or Venous Thromboem- bolism: A Systematic Meta-Analysis Semi- nars in Thrombosis 2015;41(7):774-787. Abstract: Introduction Limited information exists on gender-related differences in the safety and efficacy of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Aim of 14 the StudyTo assess the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)/NO- ACs in men and women pooling data from randomized controlled trials on the preven- tion of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and on the acute and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE to June 2014. The effi- cacy outcome was defined as the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (AF stud- ies), or as the prevention of recurrent VT E or VTE-related death (VTE studies). The safety outcome was defined as the occurrence of major and/or clinically relevant non- major bleeding. Differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with pertinent 95% co nfidence intervals (95% CI). Results: A total of 13 studies (> 100,000 pa tients) were included. DOACs appeared to have a similar efficacy and safety compared with vitamin K antagonists in female and male patients treated for nonvalvular AF and acute VTE. In the extended treatment of VTE NOACs had a RR of bleeding of 4.97 (95% CI 1.06, 23.41) in males and 1.33 (95% CI 0.63, 2.83) in females compared with pl acebo (subgroup difference chi-square test: 2.25, p=0.13). Conclusions: No gender-related difference in the and safety of NOACs in pa- tients with AF or acute VTE was found. A trend toward an increased risk of bleeding in male patients as compared with female patients was detected in the extended treat- ment of VTE.

Patient Prefer- ence and Adherence 2016;10:73-80. Abstract: such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or endoxaban, have recently become for patients an alternative option to conventional treatment in the therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Thus, we aimed to review the available information on adverse events (AEs) of apixaban com- pared to conventional therapy (heparin or vitamin K antagonists) in randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs) on patients treated for VTE, with a particular attention to sex sub- groups. Methods: An electronic search in MEDLI NE and Embase was performed by using the keywords \"apixaban\" and \"venous thromboembolism\". All RCTs focused on apixaban in the treatment and prevention of VTE were evaluated for the presence of AEs. AEs were classified as serious, bleeding, and cause of disconti nuation. Moreover, we also searched by using the keywords \"gender\" and \"venous thromboembolism\" and \"antico- agulants\". Results: Considering all subjects enrolled in the eleven RCTs as a whole to investigate the occurrence of AEs, we extrapolated an events/subjects rate of 57.8% for AEs (6,445/11,144), 7.7% for serious AEs (9 75/12,647), 9.1% for bleeding events (1,229/13,454), and 3.2% for discontinuation of apixaban (421/13,039). The percentage of AEs was lower in subjects treated with apixaban than in those treated with conven-tional VTE therapy (53% vs 56.3%, respectively). However, only one study provided data on separate analysis by sex of either efficacy or safety of apixaban. Conclusion: Under the patient' s perspective, apixaban could represent a good choice in the treatment of VTE, due to its pharmacologi cal, economical, and safety profile. These positive aspects are certainly present in both sexes, since the available studies include a correct percentage of women, but data with separate analyses by sex are extremely lim- ited. Future clinical trials should include in their results on cl inical impact and out- comes a stratification by sex, and studies aimed to evaluate possible sex-related differ- ences for these drugs should be strongly encouraged.

Abstract: of bleeding on anticoagulation varies between pa- tients. It is uncertain whether sex influences this risk. 15 OBJECTIVES: To determine if the risk of major bleeding differs between men and women receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation or and Cochrane databases, and relevant conference proceedings, until February 2013. We included ra ndomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for atrial fi- brillation or VTE. Two reviewers independently extracted data. The relative risk of bleeding in men compared to women was pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-two studies including 94 293 patients were eligible; 78 044 patients (83%) had atrial fibrillation; 16 156 patients (17%) had VTE; 37 250 patients were women (40%); and there were 4147 major blee ds. The relative risk of major bleeding for men vs. women was 1.02(95% CI 0.95-1.10; P = 0.27 for heteroge niety). The relative risk was 1.02 (95% CI 0.95-1.09) in patients with atrial fibrillation and 0.80 (95% CI 0.65-0.98) in patients with VTE (P = 0.03 for subgroup effect). Type of anticoagu- lant,intensity of anticoagulation, and whether patients began or were already estab-lished on anticoagulants at enrollment did not influence the relative risk of major bleeding in men compared to women. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of major bleeding on anticoagulation appears to be the same in men and women, particularly if patients ha ve atrial fibrillation. This finding is less certain for patients with VTE, in whom the ri sk of bleeding may be marginally lower in men compared to in women. Loffredo L, Violi F, Perri L.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gender differences have been reported in patients with acute VTE treated with antithrombotic drugs. OBJECTIVE: To address the relationship be tween gender and new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), we performed a meta-analysis to ev aluate the incidence of recurrent VTE and major plus clinically relevant non-major bleedings in males and females, with acute VTE, treated with NOACs over the treatment period. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of double blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Coch rane Library of Clinical Trials (up to September 2015). STUDY SELECTION: RCTs that compared the beneficial and harm- ful effects NOAC drugs (apixaban, dabigatran, DATA EXTRACTION: Three authors abstracted data. Study-specific risk ratios (RR) were combined using random-effects model. RESULTS: Nine studies including 16,372 pati ents were selected. No significant differ- ence for the incidence of recurrent VTE was found between men and women. Com- pared to men, women had a higher incidence of major bleedings plus clinically relevant subgroup analysis showed a significant gender difference in incidence of major bleedings and clinically rele to men, a higher risk of bleed- ing in women with acute VTE treated with NOACs. Future trials should evaluate the ef- fect of gender on bleeding in patients with acute VTE treated with NOACs. Meseguer E, Mazighi M, Labreuche J, Ar naiz C, Cabrejo L, Slaoui T, et al. Out- comes of intravenous recombinant ti ssue plasminogen activator therapy according to gender: a clinical regi stry study and systematic review. Stroke 2009;40(6):2104-2110. Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The na tural history of stroke is worse in women than in men. Controversial data have been published on the efficacy of throm- bolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) according to gender. We evaluated gender differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous rtPA using a clinical registry and systematic review. 16 METHODS: Since January 2002, we collected baseline characterist ics and efficacy and safety outcomes for patients who received intravenous rtPA in our center. We per- formed a systematic PubMed literature sear ch for previous observational studies that examined gender effects on outcomes after intravenous rtPA treatment. RESULTS: No gender difference in good outcome at 3 months (adjusted OR for women, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.60) and in 90-day mortality (adjusted OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.59 to 3.19) was found in our registry. We identified 16 studies that evaluated the gender effect among intraven ous rtPA-treated patients. None of these studies sup- ported a gender difference in favorable outcome, and one suggested an increased risk of mortality in men. In unad justed partial meta-analysis in 4074 women and 5840 men including our registry data, we found a tren d toward a lower risk of symptomatic intra- cranial hemorrhage in women (crude OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest no gender difference in outcome among pa- tients treated with intravenous DJ, Marchlinski FE. Meta-analysis of gender differences in residual stroke risk and major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulants . Am J Cardiol 2014;113(3):485-490. Abstract: Studies tion (AF) have cerebrovascular acci- dent/systemic embolism (CVA/SE) or major bleeding outcomes with novel oral antico- agulant (NOAC) use are not known. The goal of this analysis was to perform a system- atic review and meta-analysis evaluating gend er differences in residual risk of CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes in patients with nonvalvular AF treated with either war- farin or \"gen- der,\" \"AF,\" and \"CVA.\" Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analysis method, 6 studies met criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis. CVA/SE and major bleeding outcomes were se parately analyzed in cohorts receiving warfarin and NOAC agents, comparing men with women. Women with AF taking war- farin were at a significantly greater residual risk of CVA/SE compared with men (odds ratio 1.279, 95% confidence in terval 1.111 to 1.473, Z = -3 .428, p = 0.001). No gender difference in residual risk of CVA/SE was noted in patients with AF receiving NOAC agents (odds ratio 1.146, 95% confidence in terval 0.97 to 1.354, p = 0.109). Major bleeding was less frequent in women with AF treated with NOAC. In conclusion, women with AF treated with warfarin have a greater residual risk of CVA/SE and an equivalent major bleeding risk, whereas thos e treated with NOAC agents deemed supe- rior to warfarin are at equivalent residual risk of CVA/SE and less major bleeding risk compared with men. These results suggest an increased net clinical benefit of NOAC agents compared with warfarin in treating women with AF. Blodplatehemmere Adelman EE, Lisabeth L, Brown DL. Gender differences in the primary pre- vention of stroke with aspirin . Women's Health 2011;7(3):341-353. Abstract: Aspirin is used to prevent ischemic stroke and other types of cardiovascular disease. Seven trials of aspirin focusing on the effectiveness of primary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular events have been performed, but three of these did not include women. Data from these trials, and one meta-analysis, suggest that aspirin pre- vents myocardial infarction in men and stro ke in women, although the findings in women were driven by the results of a single large study, and a subsequent meta-analy- sis did not find a gender difference. The reasons for the possible gender differences in aspirin's effectiveness are not entirely clear. \u00a9 2011 Future Medicine Ltd. Berger JS, Bhatt DL, Cannon CP, Chen Z, Jiang L, Jones JB, et al. The relative ef- ficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and men. BACKGROUND: Previous analyses have show n sex-based differences in response to several antiplatelet medications. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and men. METHODS: This study performed a meta-analy sis of all blinded randomized clinical trials comparing clopidogrel and placebo (CURE [Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events], CREDO [Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management , and Avoidance] trials), involving a total of 79,613 patients, of whom 30% were wome n. The relative efficacy and safety of clopidogrel at reducing cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarc- tion [MI], or stroke) in women and men wa s estimated using random-effects modeling. RESULTS: Overall, clopidogrel was associat ed with a highly significant 14% propor- tional reduction in the risk of [CI]: 0.80 to 0.93), with no significant differences in treatment effect between women and men. Among the 23,533 women enrolled, there were fewer cardio- vascular events in the clopidogrel group co mpared OR: 0.93; CI: 0.86 women the risk reduct ion with clopidogrel seemed to be greatest for MI (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.90 to 1.08) not statistically significant. Among the 56,091 men enrolled, there were fewer cardio- vascular events in those receiving clopidogrel 9.0%; OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.91), for MI (OR: 0.83; 0.84 to 0.97). Clopidogre l increased the risk of major bleeding in both women (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.79) CI: 1.05 to 1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in both women and men. Berger JS, Roncaglioni MC, Avanzini F, Pangrazzi I, Tognoni G, Brown DL. Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardio vascular events in women and men: a Abstract: CONTEXT: Aspirin therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in adults who are at increased risk. However, it is unclear if women derive the same bene- fit as men. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the benefits and risks of aspirin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease vary by sex. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases (1 966 to March 2005), bibliographies of re- trieved trials, and reports presented at major scientific meetings. Eligible studies were prospective, randomized controlled trials of aspirin therapy in participants without cardiovascular disease that re ported data on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Six trials with a to tal of 95 456 individuals were identified; 3 trials included only men, 1 included on ly women, and 2 included both sexes. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were reviewed to determine the number of patients ran- domized, mean duration of follow-up, and en d points (a composite of cardiovascular events [nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and card iovascular mortality], each of these indi- vidual components separately, and major bleeding). DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 51,342 women, there were 1285 major cardiovascular events: 625 strokes, 469 MIs, and 364 cardio vascular deaths. Aspirin therapy was asso- ciated with a significant 12% reduction in cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.99; P = 17% reduction in stroke (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.97; P = .02), which was a reflection of reduced rates of ischemic stroke (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93; P = .008 ). There was no significant effect on MI or cardiovascular mortality. Among 44,114 me n, there were 2047 major cardiovascular events: 597 strokes, 1023 MIs, and 776 card iovascular deaths. Aspirin therapy was as- sociated with a significant 14% reduction in cardiovascular events (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 18 0.78-0.94; P = .01) and a 32% reduction in MI (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001). There was no significant effect on stroke or cardiovascular mortality. Aspirin treatment increased the risk of bleeding in women (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13-2.52; P = .01) and in men (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.35-2.20; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: For women and men, as-pirin therapy reduced the risk of a composite of cardiovascular events due to its effect on reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in women and MI in men. Aspirin significantly increased the risk of bleeding to a similar degree among women and men. Boersma E, Harrington RA, Moliterno DJ, Whit e H, Th\u00e9roux P, Van de Werf F, et al. Platelet glycoprotein inhibito rs in corona ry BACKGROUND: Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiac complications in patients un dergoing percutaneous coronary interven- tion. The clinical efficacy of these drugs in acute coronary syndromes, however, is still unclear. We did a meta-analysis of all large randomised trials designed to study the clinical efficacy and safety of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute cor- onary syndromes who were not routinely sche duled coronary revascu- larisation. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were: randomisation of patients with acute coronary syndromes but without persistent ST elevatio n; comparison of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor with placebo or control therapy; non-recommendation of early coronary re- vascularisation during study- drug infusion; and enrollment of at least 1000 patients. Data on individual patients were obtained from all participants in these trials. FINDINGS: Six trials, enrolling 31402 patients , fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 30 days after randomisation, 3530 (11.2%) patients died or developed a myocardial infarction. At 30 days, a 9% reduction in the odds of de ath or myocardial infarction was seen with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors compar placebo or control (10.8% [1980/18297] vs 11.8% [1550/13105] events ; odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.98]; p=0.015). The relative treatment benefit was similar in subgroups of patients according to important clinical baseline characteristics; hence, the absolute treatment benefit was largest in high-risk patients. An unexpected and significant interaction was seen be- tween sex and allocated treatment, with a treatment benefit in men (0.81 [0.75-0.89] but not in women (1.15 [1.01-1.30]). However, once patients were stratified according to troponin concentration, there was no evidence of a sex difference in treatment re-sponse, and a risk reduction was seen in me n and women with raised troponin concen- trations. Major bleeding [0.06%]; p=0.40). INTERPRETATION: Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce the occurrence of death or myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes not routinely sched- uled for early revascularisation. The event redu ction is greatest in patients at high risk of thrombotic complications. Treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor might therefore be considered especially in such patients early after admission, and contin- ued until a decision about early corona ry revascularisation has been made.

Abstract: Background: Accumulating evidence supports an effect of aspirin in reducing overall cancer incidence and mortality in th e general population. We reviewed current data and assessed the benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population. Methods: The effect of aspirin for site-specific cancer incidence and mor- tality, cardiovascular events was collated fr om the most recent systematic reviews. Studies identified through systematic Medline search provided data regarding harmful effects of aspirin and baseline rates of harm s like gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcer. Results: The effects of aspirin on canc er are not apparent unti l at least 3 years af- ter the start of use, and some benefits are sustained for several years after cessation in 19 long-term users. No differences between low and standard doses of aspirin are ob- served, but there were no direct comparisons. Higher doses do not appear to confer ad- ditional benefit but increase toxicities. Excess bleeding is the most important harm as- sociated with aspirin use, and its risk and fatality rate increases with age. For average-risk individuals aged 50-65 years taking aspi rin for 10 years, there would be a relative reduction of between 7% (women) and 9% (m en) in the number of cancer, myocardial infarction or stroke events over a 15-year pe riod and an overall 4% relative reduction in all deaths over a 20-year period. Conclusions: Prophylactic aspirin use for a minimum of 5 years at doses between 75 and 325 mg /day appears to have favourable benefit- harm profile; longer use is likely to have greater benefits. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and duration of use, to identify individuals at increased risk of bleeding, and to test effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori screening-eradication before starting aspirin prophylaxis.

Aspi- rin for prophylactic use in the primar y prevention of cardiovascular dis- ease and cancer: A systematic re view and overview of reviews . Health Technology Assessment 2013;17(43):V-252. Abstract: Background: Prophylactic aspirin has been considered to be beneficial in re- ducing the risks of heart disease and cancer. However, potential benefits must be bal- anced against the possible harm from side effe cts, such as bleeding and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It is particularly important to know the risk of side effects when aspirin is used as primary prevention - that is when used by people as yet free of, but at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease (CVD) or ca ncer. In this report we aim to identify and re-analyse randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-anal- yses to summarise the current scientific evidence with a focus on possible harms of prophylactic aspirin in primary pr evention of CVD and cancer. Objectives: To identify RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs of the prophylactic use of aspirin in primary prev ention of CVD or cancer. To undertake a quality assessment of identified systemat ic reviews and meta-analyses using meta- analysis to investigate study-level effects on estimates of benefits and risks of adverse events; cumulative meta-analysis; exploratory multivariable meta-regression; and to quantify relative and absolute risks and benefits. Methods: We identified RCTs, meta-analy ses and systematic reviews, and searched electronic bibliographic databases (from 2008 September 2012) including MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Ef- fects, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemina tion, and Science Citation Index. We lim- ited searches to publications since 2008, ba sed on timing of the most recent compre- hensive systematic reviews. Results: In total, 2572 potentially relevant papers were identified and 27 met the inclu- sion criteria. Benefits of aspirin ranged from 6% reduction in relati ve risk (RR) for all- cause mortality [RR 0.94, 95% confidence in terval (CI) 0.88 to 0.85 to 0.96) to a reduc- tion in total coronary heart disease (CHD) of 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06). Re- ported pooled odds ratios (ORs) for total cancer mortality ranged between 0.76 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.88) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.03). Inclusion of the Women's Health Study changed the estimated OR to 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.97). Aspirin reduced re- cancer (CRC) incidence (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02). However, in- cluding studies in which aspirin was given ev ery other day raised the OR to 0.91 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.11). Reported cancer benefits appeared approximately 5 years from start of treatment. Calculation of absolute effects per 100,000 patient-years of follow-up showed reductions ranging from 33 to 46 deaths (all-cause mortality), 60-84 MCEs and 47-64 incidents of CHD and a possible avoi dance of 34 deaths from CRC. Reported increased RRs of adverse events from aspirin use were 37% for GI bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.62), between 54% (RR 1.54 , 95% CI 1.30 to 1.82) and 62% (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.00) for major bleeds, and between 32% (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.74) and 38% (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.82) for haemorrhagic stroke. Pooled estimates of increased RR for bleeding remained stable across trials conducted over several dec- ades. Estimates of absolute rates of harm from aspirin use, per 100,000 patient-years of follow-up, were 99-178 for non-trivial blee ds, 46-49 for major bleeds, 68-117 for GI 20 bleeds and 8-10 for haemorrhagic stroke. Me ta-analyses aimed at judging risk of bleed according to sex and in individuals with di abetes were insufficien tly powered for firm conclusions to be drawn. Limitations: Searches were date limited to 2008 because of the intense interest that this subject has generated and the cataloguing of all primary research in so many previous systematic re views. A further limitation was our potential over-reliance on study-level systematic revie ws in which the person-years of follow-up were not accurately ascertainable. However, estimates of number of events averted or incurred through aspirin use calculated from data in stu y-level meta-analyses did not differ substantially from estimates based on individual patient data-level meta-anal- yses, for which person-years of follow-up we re more accurate (although based on less- than-complete assemblies of currently available primary studies). Conclusions: We have found that there is a fine balance between benefits and risks from regular aspirin use in primary preventi on of CVD. Effects on cancer prevention have a long lead time and are at present reliant on post hoc analyses. All absolute ef- fects are relatively small compared with the burden of these diseases. Several poten-tially relevant ongoing trials will be completed between 2013 and 2019, which may clarify the extent of benefit of aspirin in reducing cancer incidence and mortality. Fu- ture research considerations include expanding the use of IPD meta-analysis of RCTs by pooling data from available studies and investigating the impact of different dose regimens on cardiovascular and cancer outc omes.

[Aspirin in cardiovascular prev is effective in th e treatment of acute coronary syndrome and in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease among both men and women, its use in primary prevention remains controve rsial. The gender-specific meta-analysis demonstrates that the specific types of bene fit of aspirin therapy differ between women and men in primary prevention. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women, aspirin therapy significantly reduced the risk of the composite of cardiovascu- lar events primarily by its effect on reducing the risk of stroke. In contrast, in men; as- pirin therapy significantly reduced the risk of the composite of cardiovascular events predominantly by reducing the risk of myoc ardial infarction. The reasons for any sex- based differences in the efficacy of aspirin for primary prevention are unclear and re- quire further exploration. Thorat MA, Cuzick J. Prophylactic use of aspiri n: systematic review of harms and approaches to mitigation in the general population . Eur J Epi- demiol 2015;30(1):5-18. Abstract: A careful assessment of benefits an d harms is required to assess suitability of aspirin as a prophylactic public health me asure. However, comprehensive population- level data on harms are lacking. We collecte d and synthesized age and sex-specific data on harms relevant to aspirin use in average-ri sk individuals aged 50 years or older. We conducted systematic literature searches to identify baseline rate s of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, peptic ulcer, major extra-cranial bleeding, and case-fatality rates due to GI bleeding or peptic ulcer in general population. The magnitude of aspirin-associated increase, the prevalence and attributable risk of Helicobacter pylori infection on these events in aspirin users was also assessed. Ba seline rates of major extracranial bleeding events and GI complications increase with age; an almost threefold to fourfold increase is observed from age 50-54 to 70-74 years. Low or standard-dose aspirin use increases GI bleeding events by 60% leading to an a nnual excess of 0.45 and 0.79 GI bleeding events per 1,000 women and men aged 50-54 years respectively. 5-10% of major GI complications are fatal; a clear age dependence--higher fatality in older individuals, is seen. Eradication of H. pylori infection before aspirin use could reduce the incidence of upper GI complications by 25-30%. GI complications are increased by about 60% due to aspirin use but are fatal only in a very small proportion of individuals younger than 70 years of age. Major bleeding events that are comparable in severity to cancer or 21 CVD, are infrequent. Screening and eradication of H. pylori infection could substan- tially lower aspirin-related GI harms.

Diabetes Res Clin Pract 2010;87(2):211-218. Abstract: BACKGROUND: To systematically review trials concerning the benefit and risk of aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. iazMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Eligible studies were prospective, randomized controlled trials of aspirin therapy for primary cardiovascular prevention in patients with diabetes with follow-up duration at least 12 months. RESULTS: 7 trials included 11,618 individuals with diabetes. Aspirin therapy was not associated with a statistically significant re duction in major cardiovascular events (rel- confidence interval [CI] Aspirin use did not significantly reduce mortal ity (0.95, 95% 95% CI 0.65-1.11; p=0.24). There was no significant increased risk of major bleeding in aspirin group (2.46, 95% CI 0.70-8.61; p=0.16). Meta-regression suggested that aspiri n agent could reduce the risk of stroke in women and MI in men. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes, aspirin therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events without an increased risk of major bleeding, and showed sex-specific effects on MI and stroke.

Response by sex to statin plus ezetimibe or st atin monotherapy: a pooled analysis of 22,231 in Health & Disease 2011;10:146. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite documented benefits of lipid-lowering treatment in women, a considerable number are undertreated, and fewer achieve treatment targets vs. men. METHODS: Data were combined from 27 do uble-blind, active or placebo-controlled studies that randomized adult hypercholesterolemic patients to statin or statin+ezetimibe. Consistency of treatment effect among men (n = 11,295) and women (n = 10,499) was assessed and percent of me n and women was calculated to evaluate the between-treatment ability to achieve sp ecified treatment levels between sexes. RESULTS: Baseline lipids and hs-CRP were generally higher in women vs. men. Be- tween-treatment differences were significant for both sexes (all p < 0.001 except apolipoprotein A-I in men = 0.0389). Men treated with ezetimibe+statin experienced significantly greater changes in LDL-C (p total cholesterol, < 0.0001) and apolipoprotein B (p = 0.0055) compared with women treated with ezetimibe+statin. The odds of achieving LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, apolipoprotein B < 90 mg/dL and the dual target [LDL-C < 100 mg/dL & apoliprotein B < 90 mg/dL] was si gnificantly greater for women vs. men and the odds of achieving hs-CRP < 1 and < 2 mg /L and dual specified levels of [LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and hs-CRP < 2 mg/L] were si gnificantly greater for men vs. women. Women reported significantly more gall-bla dder-related, gastrointestinal-related, and allergic reaction or rash-related adverse events (AEs) vs. men (no differences between treatments). Men reported significantly more CK elevations (no differences between treatments) and hepatitis-related AEs vs. women (significantly more with ezetimibe+simvastatin vs. statin). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that small sex-related differences may exist in response to lipid-lowering treatment and achievement of specified lipid and hs-CRP levels, which may have implications when managing hypercholesterolemia in women. 22 Adams SP, Tsang M, Wright JM. Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin . Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015;3:CD008226. Abstract: BACKGROUND: This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose- related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To quantify th e effects of various do ses of atorvastatin (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focu s of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives * To quantify the variability of e ffects of various doses of ator vastatin.* To quantify due placebo-controlled controlled trials (RCTs). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (196 6 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 20 13), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language re- strictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of differ ent fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood li- pids over a duration of three to 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two re view authors independently assessed eli- gibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials. MAIN RESULTS: In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participan ts. Included 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-res ponse data from both trial designs re- vealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the do se range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings ta- ble 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuva statin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvast atin effect was greate r in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. With- drawals due to adverse effects were not st atistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these sh ort-term trials (risk 1.40). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This update result ed in no change to the main conclu- sions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hyp ercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin be- cause included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although statins reduce the risk of stroke in patients with coronary heart disease, possibl e differing effects of statins on stroke out- comes based on sex remain unce rtain. We investigated the relationships between statin use and sex-specific stroke incide nce, severity, and mortality. METHODS: Data from 3 trials of oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (first and second Sibrafiban versus aspirin to Yield Maximu m Protection from ischemic Heart events postacute cOroNary sYndromes [SYMPHONY] and Blockade of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor to Avoid Vascular Occlus ion [BRAVO]) were pooled and stroke out- comes compared among 8191 baseline statin users versus 14,752 nonusers. Time-to- event data were modeled with proportional hazards regression. Stroke severity was as- sessed retrospectively with the Canadian Ne urological Scale (CNS) based on records with scoreable neurological examinations. RESULTS: A total of 217 subjects had strokes (0.95%). Statin users had a lower risk of stroke in unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.92) and risk-adjusted models (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.97). There was no difference in stroke mortality with statin use (P=0.8). CNS scores could be assigned to 106 of the subjects, with no difference in severity among statin users an d nonusers (median CNS=10.5 in users ver- sus CNS=9.75 in nonusers; P=0.14). Women had more severe strokes than men (me- dian CNS=10.5 in men versus 9.5 in women; Poisson regression P=0.035). Women had more severe strokes after ad justment for statin use (P=0.03) and the combination of statin use, atrial fibrillation, and age (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients included in thes e clinical trials of oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, statin use is associated wi th a reduced risk of stroke but not severity or mortality. Women had more severe stroke s than men, a difference that was not ex- plained by baseline characteristics or statin use. Dale KM, Coleman CI, Shah SA, Patel AA, Kluger J, White CM. Impact of gender on statin efficacy . Curr Med Res Opin 2007;23(3):565-574. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of statin therapy on the combined endpoint of cardiovascular events in women and men separately. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search through May 2006 was conducted to identify randomized, controlled statin trials evaluating the gen-der specific incidence of cardiovascular events. Weighted averages were reported as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence in tervals (CI) calculat ed via random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was a composite end- point of all cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes measured included death, myo- cardial infarction (MI), and stroke. RESULTS: Fifteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Cardiovascular events were reduced in men (RR 0.76 [95% CI 0.70, 0.81]) and women (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.69, 0.90]). Reductions in mortality, MI, and stroke predominantl y contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular events in men taking statins. Women did not have a reduc- tion in mortality or stroke, suggesting that the reductions in cardiac events may have been predominantly due to reductions in ne ed for revascularization and/or unstable angina. CONCLUSIONS: Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women, but women on statins may not have reductions in mortality and stroke like their male counterparts.

Lancet 2015;385(9976):1397-1405. 24 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whether statin therapy is as effective in women as in men is debated, especially for primary prevention. We undertook a meta-analysis of statin tri- als in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database to compare the effects of statin therapy between women and men. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses on data from 22 trials of statin therapy ver- sus control (n=134,537) and five trials of more-intensive versus less-intensive statin therapy (n=39,612). Effects on major vascul ar events, major coronary events, stroke, coronary revascularisation an d mortality were we ighted per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol and effects in men and women compared with a Cox model that ad- justed for non-sex differences. For subgroup analyses, we used 99% CIs to make allow- ance for the multiplicity of comparisons. FINDINGS: 46,675 (27%) of 174,149 randomly assigned participants were women. Al- location to a statin had similar absolute effe cts on 1 year lipid concentrations in both men and women (LDL cholesterol reduced by about 1.1 mmol/L in statin vs control tri- als and roughly 0.5 mmol/L for more-intensive vs less-intensive therapy). Women were generally at lower cardiovascular risk than were men in these trials. The propor- tional reductions per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in major vascular events were similar overall for women (rat e ratio [RR] 0.84, 99% CI 0.78-0.91) and men (RR 0.78, 0.75-0.81, adjusted p value for heterogeneity by sex=0.33) and also for those women and men at less than 10% predicted 5 year absolute cardiovascu-lar risk (adjusted heterogeneity p=0.11). Like wise, the proportional reductions in major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke did not differ significantly by sex. No adverse effect on rates of cancer incidence or non-cardiovascular mortality was noted for either sex. These net benefits translated into all-cause mortality reductions with statin therapy for both women (RR 0.91, 99% CI 0.84-0.99) and men (RR 0.90, 99% CI 0.86-0.95; adjusted heterogeneity p=0.43). INTERPRETATION: In men and women at an equivalent risk of cardiovascular dis- ease, statin therapy is of similar effectiveness for the prevention of major vascular events.

Gutierrez J, Ramirez G, Rundek T, Sacco RL. Statin therapy in the cardiovascular ev ents: a sex-based meta-analysis . The effe ct of statins on the prevention of cardiovascular events is well demonstrated. Whether this protective effect is equal for women and men remains less well established. Our object ive was to evaluate if statin therapy is equally effective in decreasing recurrent cardiovascular events in women and men. DATA SOURCES: Randomized clinical trials were searched in PubMed using as index- ing terms (statins OR cholesterol lowering medications) AND (cardiovascular events OR stroke OR myocardial infarc tion OR cardiovascular death). STUDY placebo-controlled tri- als evaluating statins for secondary preventi on of cardiovascular events. Studies with an open-label design and observational studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: The earliest citation was used to determine the characteristic of the studied population and the methodology. All subsequent citations corresponding to the trial were evaluated for outcome rates by sex. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven trials representing 43,193 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, statin therapy was associat ed with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in all outcomes for women (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.89]) and men (RR, 0.82 0.78-0.85]). Howeve r, they did not reduce all-cause mortality in women vs men (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76-1 .13] vs CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is an effective intervention in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in both sexes, but there is no benefit on stroke and all-cause mortality in women. 25 Kim BH, Cho KI, Jang JS, Park YH, Je HG. Efficacy and safety of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women and men: Sys- temic review The aim of this stud y was to perform a meta-analysis comparing by gender the cardiovascular outcomes relate d to statin therapy in primary prevention including recent large trials. Methods: A systematic search of medical li teratures was performed to identify random- ized placebo and standard-care- controlled en dpoint trials of statins with sex-specific outcome data, which were reported from 1994 to April 2012. Summary estimates of rel- ative risks (RRs) of the therapy were calc ulated by using a random-effects model for women and men without CVD. Results: Total eight studies with 59,744 pa rticipants were included (22,490 women, 37,254 men). Although statin treatment reduced the risk of total mortality (RR 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.93 ), the risks of major coronary events (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04) and cerebrovascu lar events (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03) were not reduced by statin treatment in women without CVD. Although major adverse events and total cancer were not increased in both male and female patients taking statin, the stratified analysis by gender revealed higher risk of development of diabetes mellitus (DM) in female patients ( RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.01). Conclusions: Statin treatment was less beneficial in women without CVD with regard to lowering adverse clinical outcomes when compared to men. Kostis WJ, Cheng Am Coll Cardiol 2012;59(6):572-582. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins in decreasing cardiovascular events in women and men. BACKGROUND: Published data reviews have suggested that statins might not be as ef-fective in women as in men in decreasing cardiovascular events. METHODS: Published data searches and contac ts with investigators identified 18 ran- domized clinical trials of statins with se x-specific outcomes (N = 141,235, 40,275 women, 21,468 cardiovascular events). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events were calc ulated for women and men separately with random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The cardiovascular event rate wa s lower among those randomized to statin intervention than in those randomized to co ntrol (low-dose statin in 4 studies, placebo in 11 studies, usual care in 3 studies) and similar in women and men (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: benefit of statins was statis tically significant in both sexes, regardless of the type of control, baseline risk, or type of endpoint and in both primary and secondary preven- tion. All-cause mortality was also lower wi th statin therapy both in women and men without significant interaction by sex (p for interaction = 0.4457). CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is associated with significant decreases in cardiovascu- lar events and in all-cause mortality in wome n and men. Statin therapy should be used in appropriate patients without regard to sex. Petretta M, Costanzo P, Perro ne-Filardi P, Chiariello M. Impact of gender in pri- mary prevention of coronary heart di sease with statin BACKGROUND: Evidence of lipid-lowe ring from clinical trials that included women is adequate to support their use in secondary prevention in women with known coronary disease. However the role of statin therapy in primary prevention is still con- troversial, in particular for female gender. The aim of our study is to perform a meta- analysis comparing by gender the cardiovascul ar outcomes related to statin therapy in primary prevention. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis including 8 randomized controlled trials (19,052 and 30,194 men, mean follow-up 3. 9 years) that assessed the cardiovascular 26 outcomes related to statin therapy, including studies that provided sex-specific results. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database, were se arched for articles published in English and other languages up to March 2008. RESULTS: Statins do not appear to have a be neficial effect on total mortality for both men and women in primary prevention over the 2.8- to 5.3 year study period (men: 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.83-1.04; 0.61). Statin therapy reduced the ri sk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in men (0.59; CI 0.48-0.74; p = 0.0001), however in women this risk reduction was weakly significant (0.89 CI 0.79-1.00; p = 0.05) and disappeared when in sensitivity analysis, trials not entirely of primary prevention were excluded (HPS, PROSPER) (0.95 CI 0.78-1.16; comparison p = 0.562). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that statin therapy reduced the risk of CHD events in men without prior cardiovascular disease, but not in women. Statins did not reduce the risk of total mortality both in men and women. Wang D, Liu B, Tao W, Hao Z, Liu M. Fibrates for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke . The Cochrane databa se of systematic re- views 2015;10:CD009580. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fibrates are a class of drugs characterised by mainly lower- ing high triglyceride, raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and lowering the small dense fraction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Their efficacy for secondary prevention of serious vascular even ts is unclear, and to date no systematic review focusing on secondary prevention has been undertaken. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of fibrates for the prevention of serious vascular events in people with previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coro-nary heart disease and stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 9, 2014) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to Octo- ber week 1 2014), EMBA SE (OVID, 1980 to 2014 week 41), the China Biological Medi- cine Database (CBM) (1978 to 2014), the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 2014), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP) (1989 to 2014). We also searched other resources, such as ongoing trials registers and data- bases of conference abstracts, to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a fibrate (for example gemfibrozil, fenofibrat e) was compared with placebo or no treat- ment. We excluded RCTs with only laboratory outcomes. We also excluded trials com- paring two different fibrates without a placebo or no-treatment control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two re view authors independently selected tri- als for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We contacted authors of trials for missing data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 trials involving a total of 16,112 participants. Eleven trials recruited participants with history of coronary heart disease, two trials recruited participants with history of stroke, and one trial recruited participants with a mix of people with CVD. We judged overall risk of bias to be moderate. The meta-analysis (in- cluding all fibrate trials) showed evidence for a protective effect of fibrates primarily compared to placebo for the primary compos ite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular de ath (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.94; participants = 16 ,064; studies = 12; I(2) = 45%, fixed effect). Fibrates were moderately effective for pr eventing MI occurrence (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to = 10; I(2) = 24%, fixed effect). Fibrates not effective against all-cause mortalit y (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; partici- pants = 13,653; studies = 10; I( 2) = 23%), death from vascular causes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 13,653; studies = 10; I(2) = 11%, fixed effect), and stroke events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16; partic ipants = 11,719; 6; I(2) = 11%, fixed effect). Excluding clofibrate trials, as the use of clofibrate was discontinued in 2012 due to safety concerns, the remaining class of fibrates were no longer effective in preventing the primary composite outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; participants = 10,320; studies = 7; I(2) = 50%, random effects). However, without clofibrate data, 27 fibrates remained effective in preventing MI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; = 6; I(2) = 47%, fixed effect). There was no increase in adverse events with fibrates compared to control. Subgroup analyses showed the benefit of fi- brates on the primary composite outcome to be consistent irrespective of age, gender, and diabetes mellitus. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, and vascular death. However, this be neficial effect relies on the inclusion of clofibrate data, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 due to its unacceptably large ad- verse effects. Further trials of the use of fibrates in populations with previous stroke and also against a background treatment with statins (standard of care) are required.

Blood pressure response with fixed-dose therapy: comparing hydrochlorothiazide with Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although fixed-do se combination drug therapy is commonly used to treat hypertension, the efficacy of head-to-head comparisons of dual fixed-dose combinations has not been well described. We hypothesized that when used in combi- nation with an angiotensin receptor bloc ker (ARB) olmesartan medoxomil, hydrochlo- rothiazide (HCTZ) will be as effective as the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) amlodipine to lower both clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Fur- thermore, we hypothesized that response to ARB along with HCTZ or ARB along with CCB may be heterogeneous depending on clinical characteristics. METHODS: An individual-level meta-analysis was performed among 559 individuals treated with dual combination therapy in five trials. A forced titration scheme was used in each of these trials and blood BP was me asured both in the clinic and outside using 24-h ambulatory BP monitors. RESULTS: The mean age was 62 years, 55% were men, 46% had diabetes mellitus, 17% were black, clinic BP averaged mmHg and 24-h ambulatory BP 145.0/82.5 mmHg. Overall, baseline-adjusted ring of mean 24-h ambulatory BP was 22.0/11.7 mmHg. BP reductions were similar between ARB along with HCTZ and ARB along with CCB groups. However, clinic BP was lowered 4.3/1.8 mmHg more with ARB along with CCB combination (28.4/13.0 mmHg drop) than with ARB along with HCTZ combination (24.1/11.2 mmHg drop). The white coat effect (WCE) was therefore mitigated 3.8/1.7 mmHg more with ARB along with CCB combination. Heterogeneity in ambulatory BP response was noted. Compared with men, women had a greater am- bulatory and clinic BP lowering with eith er combination. ARB along with HCTZ pro- duced a greater BP-lowering effect among men, elderly, nonobese and nondiabetic. On the contrary, ARB along with CCB produc ed a greater BP-lowering effect among women, young, obese and diabetic individual s. This heterogeneity in response was of- ten undetectable with clinic BP measuremen ts. In multivariable analysis, sex dia- betes mellitus remained independent measures of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Overall, the combination of olmesartan and HCTZ is as effective as olmesartan and CCB in lowering 24-h, dayt ime, and night-time ambulatory BP. How- ever, greater lowering is noted with the olmesartan and CCB combination for clinic BP. Thus, out-of-office BP monitoring is necessary to provide better assessment of overall BP and response to treatment. Women and diabetic individuals may have slightly bet- ter 24-h ambulatory BP response with th e olmesartan and CCB combination therapy. Brown RA, Williams M, Barker CM, Mauri L, Meredith IT, Fajadet J, et cific following angiographic and la te-term clinical outcomes according to sex in recent pe rcutaneous coronary interventi on (PCI) trials involving zo- tarolimus-eluting stents (ZES). BACKGROUND: Differences in outcome between men and women undergoing PCI have been inconsistently described with ba re metal and first-generation drug-eluting stents. METHODS: Clinical and angiographic outcomes among ZES-treated patients were evaluated by sex using propensity score mode ling in a patient-level systematic overview of six trials and were also compared to patients receiving bare metal stents (BMS). RESULTS: Among 2,132 patients, 608 were fe male (28.5%). Compared to men, women were older and more frequently had diabet es, hypertension, and a smaller reference vessel diameter (P < 0.05 for all). For both sexes, the relative reductions in 8-month angiographic binary restenosis and late lume n loss were statistically significant and of similar extent with ZES compared to BMS. By 2 years, treatment with ZES resulted in significantly lower target vessel revasculariz ation (TVR) and target vessel failure (TVF; 10.0% vs. 21.5%, P = 0.0003) among women th at paralleled risk reductions for men. However, among ZES-treated patients, 2-year rates of TVR (8.2% 12.8%, P = 0.004) were si gnificantly lower among women, although rates of death and myocardial infarction were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Despite greater baseline clinical and angiographic risk than men, women undergoing PCI with ZES compared to BMS experienced significant reductions in angiographic restenosis and repeat revascularization yet similar safety. Among all patients treated with ZES, late-term safety and efficacy outcomes are similar, if not lower, among women compared to men.

Clinical Cardiology 2012;35(8):505-511. Abstract: Background: In patients with heart failure (HF), b-blockers reduce mortality. It's not known whether the beneficial effects of the b-blockers were associated with the differing male proportions of study patients. It also remains to be clarified regarding the true beneficial effects of the 3 b-blockers recommended by the guideline on mortal- ity in the real world. Hypothesis: The benefi ts of b-blockers in HF patients were sex- related different. Methods: Randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials were included if they evaluated the beneficial effects of the three b-blocke rs on mortality and on hospital admissions on an intention-to-treat basis, and lasted at least 3 months. Results: Twenty-eighty trials with 14,829 patients were included. The b-blockers signif- icantly reduced all cause mortality by 29.6%, cardiac death by 29.8%, sudden death by 49.4%, respectively. The magnitude of benefi ts of b-blockers in HF patients was in- creased with the increased male proportion . A similar magnitude of reduction in all cause mortality was observed among the thr ee b blockers. A trend toward to reduced cardiac death was observed among the three b blockers, but only in bisoprolol was this statistically different (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, [0 .59-0.87]). was = 0.008) or bisoprol ol (P = 0.034) in reduced sudden death. Conclusions: In patients with HF, the 3 commonly used b-blockers significantly re- duced mortality. Greater benefits of b-blocke rs were observed in the higher male pro- portion studies. The metoprolol was significantl y superior to carvedilol or bisoprolol in reduced sudden death. Additional trials are required to determine whether the benefits of b-blockers will be observed in female HF patients. Periodicals, den Thiazide-Like Diuretics on Cardio- vascular ;65(5):1033-1040. Abstract: Thiazide diuretics are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. According to their 29 molecular structure, thiazide diuretics can be divided diuretics. TL longer elimination half-life compared with TT diuretics and have been shown to exert additional pharmacological effects, which may differently affect cardiovascular risk. In this meta-analysis, we compared the ef- fects of TT and TL diuretics on cardiovascul ar events and mortality. Randomized, con- trolled studies in adult hypertensive patients that compared TT or TL diuretics with placebo or antihyperte nsive drugs and had 1 year follow-up were included. Primary outcome was cardiovascular events; secondary outcomes included coronary events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and a ll-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify confounders and correct for the achieved blood pressure reduc- tions. Twenty-one studies with >480 000 pa tient-years were incl uded. Outcomes were not affected by heterogeneity in age, se x, and ethnicity among included studies, whereas larger blood pressure reductions we re significantly associated with increased risk reductions for all outcomes (P<0.001). Corrected for differenc es in office blood pressure reductions among trials, TL diuretic s resulted in a 12% additional risk reduc- tion for cardiovascular events (P=0.049) an d a 21% additional risk reduction for heart failure (P=0.023) when compared with TT di uretics. The incidence of adverse events was comparable among TT, TL diuretics, an d other antihypertensive therapy. Our data suggest that the best available evidence seems to favor TL diuretics as the drug of choice when thiazide treatment is considered for hypertension.

Reporting on sex-based analysis in clinical trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme in- hibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker efficacy. Can J Cardiol 2008;24(6):491-496. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical practice recommendations for hypertension do not make recommendations specific to men or women. However, the sex hormones appear to modulate differently the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure. Today, li ttle is known about the effects of sex on the efficacy of therapies that antagonize the RA S, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). OBJECTIVE: identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs in preventing major cardiovascular outcomes, determine what proportion of the trial participants were female, and evaluate whether there was any evidence of a sex difference in the efficacy of these agents. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that used either ACEIs or ARBs for the treatment of hypertension. RESULTS: Thirteen ACEI trials and nine A RB trials were identified. Sex-specific out- come data were available in six of the ACEI trials and three of th e ARB trials. These tri- als enrolled 74,105 patients; 39.1% were women. Seven of the nine trials indicated that ACEIs or ARBs may be slightly more benefi cial in men. The magnitude of these differ- ences, in most trials, was small. CONCLUSIONS: Sex-specific data are reported in 43% of large hypertension clinical trials. Review of the trials reporting sex-sp ecific effect sizes indicates that ACEIs and ARBs may be more effective in men. Kreftsykdommer I alt identifiserte vi 14 relevante referanser. Chemotherapy for non small cell lung cancer . se of System- atic Reviews 2000 (2):CD002139. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer was not clear. A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis was therefore undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from all relevant 30 randomised trials. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. To investigate whether or not pre- defined patient sub-groups benefit more or less from chemotherapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches (1963-june 1992) were supplemented by information from trial regist ers and by hand searching relevant meet- ing proceedings and by discussion with relevant trialists and organisations. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials comparing prim ary treatments of surgery, surgery + radiotherapy, radical radiotherapy or suppo rtive care versus the same primary treat- ment, plus chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion provided that they randomised non-small cell lung cancer patients using a method which precluded prior knowledge of treatment assignment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A quantitative meta-analysis using updated in-formation from individual patients from all available randomised trials was carried out. Data from all patients randomised in all elig ible trials were sought directly from those responsible. Updated information on survival, and date of last follow up were obtained, as were details of treatment allocated, date of randomisation, age, sex, histological cell type, stage and performance status. To avoi d potential bias, information was requested for all randomised patients including those who had been excluded from the investiga- tors' original analyses. All analyses were done on intention to treat on the endpoint of survival. For trials using cisplatin-based regimens, subgroup analyses by age, sex, his-tological cell type, tumour stage and pe rformance status were also done. MAIN RESULTS: Data from 52 trials and 93 87 patients were included. The results for modern regimens containing cisplatin favoured chemotherapy in all comparisons and reached conventional levels of significance when used with radical radiotherapy and with supportive care. Trials comparing surger y with surgery plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio of 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death, equivalent to an absolute bene- fit of 5% at 5 years). Trials comparing radi cal radiotherapy with radical radiotherapy plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death equiva- lent to an absolute benefit of 4% at 2 year s), and trials comparing supportive care with supportive care plus chemothera py gave a hazard ratio of 0.73 (27% reduction in the risk of death equivalent to a 10% improvem ent in survival at one year). The essential drugs needed to achieve these effects were not identified. No difference in the size of effect was seen in any subgroup of patients. In all but the radical radiotherapy setting, older trials using long term alkylating agents tended to show a detrimental effect of chemotherapy. This effect reached convention al significance in the adjuvant surgical comparison. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the outset of this meta-analysis there was considerable pessimism about the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung can- cer. These results offer hope of progress and suggest that chemotherapy may have a role in treating this disease. Biaoxue R, Shuanying Y, We i L, Wei Z, Zongjuan M. Maintenance therapy of ge- fitinib for non-small-cell lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy re- gardless of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation: A review in Chi- nese patients . Current Medical Research and Opinion 2012;28(10):1699-1708. Abstract: Purpose: Gefitinib is a well know n therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study was to review clinical reports of gefitinib as maintenance therapy after first-line chemot herapy regardless of epidermal growth fac- tor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and assess its efficacy and safety in Chinese patients. Materials and methods: Systematic computerized searches of the following databases were conducted from the start of each databa se up to July 2012; these include Medline, EMBASE, kinase inhibitors'. A total of 22 studies were re- viewed. Results: In general, the overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and one year survival (OYS) of gefitinib maintena nce therapy were 30.89, 67.5 and 50.6 re- spectively, in addition, the median overa ll survival (OS) and median progression free survival (PFS) were 13.09 and 7.88 months re spectively. Moreover, ORR, DCR, median 31 survival time (MST) and PFS of female, nonsmoking, lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) pa- tients and patients with rash had higher performance than male, smoking, non-LAC patients and patients without rash (p<0.05). The adverse events (AEs) were mainly skin rashes and diarrhea, most of which were grades 1 or 2 and were well tolerated. Conclusion: Gefitinib produced encouraging efficacy, safety and survival when deliv- ered as maintenance therapy for NSCLC in Chinese patients after first-line chemother- apy regardless of EGFR mutation, especially for the patients who were female, non-smokers, LAC and with rash. Key limitation s of this review include limited subgroup data, small sample sizes, and the lack of EGFR/KRAS data. \u00a9 2012 Informa UK Ltd. Bria E, Milella M, Cuppone F, Novello S, Ceribelli A, Vaccaro V, et al. Outcome of advanced NSCLC are effective as first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations (EGFR-M+). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature-based meta-analysis to quan- tify the magnitude of benefit with upfront EGFR TKI in EGFR-M+ patients. Meta-re-gression and sensitivity analyses were also ca rried out to identify additional predictors of outcome and to assess the influence of trial design. RESULTS: Five trials (805 patients) were identified (three trials prospectively enrol- ling EGFR-M+ patients and two retrospective analyses of nificantly con- fidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.58, P < 0.0001] and overall response rate (ORR) (HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.75-2.46, P < 0.0001)] over chemotherapy, while significantly decreasing neu- tropenia. No significant difference was observed in overall survival. The rate of exon-19 mutations, female gender, and nonsmoking status were identified as additional predic- tors of outcome at meta-regression analysis. A significant interaction with trial design was found for both PFS (P = 0.028) and ORR (P = 0.008), suggesting a larger ad-vantage for patients treated within prospective trials. CONCLUSIONS: In EGFR-M+ patients, first-line TKI increase both PFS and ORR by ~25%, while significantly decreasing toxicity. The role of additional predictive factors and the influence of trial design on the ma gnitude of the observed benefit warrant fur- ther investigation.

Individual patient data meta-analysis of random ized trials evaluating IL-2 mono- therapy as remission maintenance therapy in acute myeloid leukemia . Blood 2011;117(26):7007-7013. Abstract: IL-2 the cytotoxic func- tions of T and natural killer cells. IL-2 monotherapy has been evaluated in several ran-domized clinical trials (RCTs) for remission maintenance in patients with acute mye- loid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1), and none demonstrated a sig- nificant benefit of IL-2 monotherapy. The objective of this meta-analysis was to reliably determine IL-2 efficacy by combining all available individual patient data (IPD) from 5 RCTs (N = 905) and summary data from a sixth RCT (N = 550). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression models st ratified by trial, with HR < 1 indicating treatment benefit. Combined IPD showed no benefit of IL-2 over no treatment in terms of leukemiafree survival (HR = 0.97; P = .74) or overall survival (HR = 1.08; P = .39). Analyses including the sixth RCT yielded qualitatively identical results (leukemia-free survival HR = 0.96, P = .52; overall survival HR = 1.06; P = .46). No significant hetero- geneity was found between the trials. Prespecified subset analyses showed no interac-tion between the lack of IL-2 effect and any factor, including age, sex, baseline perfor- mance status, karyotype, AML subtype, and time from achievement of CR1 to initiation of maintenance therapy. We conclude that IL-2 alone is not an effective remission 32 maintenance therapy for AML patients in CR1. \u00a9 2011 by The American Society of He- matology.

Meta- analysis: the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pancre- cancer risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) could inform preventive efforts against this lethal can- cer. While aspirin (ASA) and non-steroida l anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) might protect against several gastrointestinal cancers, their role in the development of PDAC remains unclear. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relation between ASA/NSAIDs exposure and the risk of PDAC. Methods We searched Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane database of systematic re- views and reference lists of identified pape rs and included observational (cohort or case-control) studies and randomized controlled trials examining exposure to ASA and/or NSAIDs and the incidence or mortal ity of PDAC. We defined three categories (low, intermediate, high), based on exposure duration and dose. RESULTS: Eight studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria (four cohort, three case con- trols, and one randomized controlled trial studies) enrolling 6301 patients between 1971-2004; all but one study took place in the US. The pooled OR were 0.99 (0.83-1.19), 1.11 (0.84-1.47) and 1.09 (0.67-1.75) in the low, intermediate and high exposure groups respectively, with considerable hete rogeneity (I(2) ranging 60-86%). Sensitivity analysis by ASA use only, study design or sex did not reveal additional important infor- mation. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show an association between ASA/NSAIDs and PDAC. The large baseline exposure in contro ls in North-America may have obscured an association. There is need for additional studies, especially in Europe, to clarify this is- sue.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of treatment modalities in pri- mary spinal prognostic fac- tors. PSAE are rare tumors of the central ne rvous system with poorly understood clini- cal characteristics and treatment outcomes. We reviewed the literature in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases to identify patients with PSAE. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed on the PSAE patients and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed to evaluate the clinical outcomes. Of the 40 patients with PSAE, the tumors were mostly intramedullary (n = 19; 47.5%) and frequently involved the thoracic cord (n = 25; 62.5%). Eighteen patients suffered recurrence during the follow-up with a me- dian PFS of 24 months. The 1, 2, and 5 year OS rates of the PSAE patients were 91.5%, 82.1%, and 63.1%, R] 0.11; = 0.004) and OS (HR 0.11; = 0.003) in the multivariate analysis. Adjuva nt radiotherapy also conferred improved PFS (HR 0.15; p = 0.008) and OS (HR 0.16; p = 0.022). Age, sex, tumor location and chemotherapy did not influence the outcomes in this group. The results of our study suggest that GTR and adjuvant radiotherapy are strong prognostic indicators in pa- tients with PSAE and the role of chemotherapy is yet to be defined.

Gefitinib or Erlotinib as Maintenance Therapy in Patients wi th Advanced Stage Non-Small Cell 33 Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and erlotinib have tested as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The studies are quite heterogenous regarding study size and populations, and a synopsis of these data could give some more insight in the role of maintenance therapy with TKI. Methods: In September 2012 we performe d a search in the pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases for randomized phase III trials exploring the role of ge- fitinib or erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Through a rigorous selection process with specific criteria, five trials (n = 2436 patients) were included for analysis. Standard statistical methods for meta-analysis were applied. Results: TKIs 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.76, I<sup>2</sup> = 78.1%] and (HR 0.76-0.93, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%) compared with plac ebo or observation. The PFS benefit was consistent in all subgroups including stage, sex, ethnicity, performance status, smoking status, histology, EGFR mutation status, and previous response to chemotherapy. Pa- tients with clinical features such as fe male, never smoker, adenocarcinoma, Asian eth- nicity and EGFR mutation positive had more pronounced PFS benefit. Overall survival benefit was observed in patients with clinical features such as female, non-smoker, smoker, adenocarcinoma, and previous stable to induction chemotherapy. Severe ad- verse events were not frequent. Main limitation s of this analysis are that it is not based on individual patient data, and not all studie s provided detailed subgroups analysis. Conclusions: The results show that maintena nce therapy with erlotinib or gefitinib pro- duces a significant PFS and OS benefit for unselected patients with advanced NSCLC compared with placebo or observation. Given the less toxicity of TKIs than chemother- apy and simple oral administration, this treatment strategy seems to be of important clinical value. \u00a9 2013 Chen et al.

Benefits and adverse events in younger versus older patients receiving neoadju- vant chemotherapy for osteosarcoma: findings from a meta-analysis . Journal of clinical oncology : official jour nal of the American Society of Clinical On- cology 2013;31(18):2303-2312. Abstract: The LIVESTRONG Young Adult Alliance has conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from prospective neoadjuvant chemotherapy osteosarcoma studies and registries to examine the relationships of sex, age, and toxicity on survival. Suitable data sets were identified by a su rvey of published data reported in PubMed. The final pooled data set comprised 4,838 patients from five international cooperative groups. After accounting for important vari ables known at study entry such as tumor location and histology, females experienced higher overall survival rates than males (P = .005) and children fared better than adolescents and adults (P = .002). Multivariate landmark analysis following surgery indicate d that a higher rate of chemotherapy-in- duced tumor necrosis was associated with longer survival (P < .001), as was female sex (P = .004) and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (P = .03). Age group was not sta-tistically significant in this landmark analys is (P = .12). Females reported higher rates of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia relative to males (P < .001). Children reported the highest rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (P < .001) and thrombocytopenia (P < .001). The achievement of good tumor necrosis was higher for females than for males (P = .002) and for children than for adults (P < .001). These results suggest fundamental differences in the way chemotherapy is ha ndled by females compared with males and by children compared with older population s. These differences may influence survival in a disease in which chemotherapy is critical to overall outcomes. 34 Escherich G, Richards S, Stork LC, Vora AJ. Meta-analysis of randomised tri- . Leukemia 2011;25(6):953-959. Abstract: Mercaptopurine has been used in continuing treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia since the mid 1950s. Recent advances in the understanding of thiopurine pharmacology indicated that thioguanine (TG) might be more effective than mercaptopurine (MP). The US and UK cooperative groups began randomised thiopu-rine trials and agreed prospectively to a meta-analysis. All randomised trials of TG ver- sus MP were sought, and data on individual patients were analysed by standard meth- ods. Combining three trials (from US, UK and Germany), the overall event-free sur-vival (EFS) was not significantly improved wi ratio (OR)=0.89; 95% confi- dence interval 0.78-1.03). Apparent difference s in results between trials may be partly explained by the different types of patients studied. The larger treatment effect re- ported in males in the US trial was confirme d in the other trials. There was heterogene- ity between sex/age subgroups (P=0.001), with significant EFS benefit of TG only ob- served for males aged<10 years old (OR=0.70; 0.58-0.84), although this did not result in a significant difference in overall survival (OR=0.83; 0.62-1.10). Additional toxicity occurs with TG. Mercaptopurine remains the standard thiopurine of choice, but further study of TG may be warranted to determin e whether it could benefit particular sub- groups. \u00a9 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. Lesley S, Sarah B. Chemotherapy for high grade glioma . Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002 (3):CD003913. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Trials on the effect of systemic chemotherapy on survival and recurrence in adults with high-grade glio ma have had inconclusive results. We un- dertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of such treatment on survival and recurrence. OBJECTIVES: To compare radiotherapy plus chemotherapy with ra diotherapy alone in completely resected adults with high-grade glioma. To investigate whether or not pre- defined patient subgroups benefit more or less from chemotherapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and CancerLit searches were supplemented with in- formation from trial registers and by hand searching relevant meeting proceedings and by discussion with relevant trialists and organisations. Th ese searches were carried out in June 1997, June 1999, De cember 2000 and August 2003. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials comparing radiotherapy versus radiotherapy + chemo- therapy were eligible for inclusion provided that they randomized adult patients using a method which precluded prior knowledge of treatment assignment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A quantitative meta-analysis using updated in- formation from individual patients from all available randomized trials was carried out. Data from all patients randomized in all elig ible trials were sought directly from those responsible. Updated information on survival and date of follow-up were obtained, as were details of treatment allocation, date of randomization, age, sex, histological cell type, stage and performance status. To avoi d potential bias, information was requested for all randomized patients including those who had been excluded from the investiga- tors' original analyses. All analyses were done on an intention to treat basis on the end- point of survival. For trials using cisplatin- based regimens, subgroup analyses by age, sex, histological cell type, tumour stage and performance status were also done. MAIN RESULTS: Data from 12 randomized trials and 3004 patients were included. The results show a significant prolongation of survival associated with chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0 .91, p=0.00004) or 15% relative decrease in the risk of death. This is equivalent to an absolute increase in one year survival rate of 6% (95% confidence interval 3% to 9%) fr om 40% to 46% and a two-month increase in median survival time (95% confidence interval one month to three months). There was no evidence that the effect of chemotherapy was different in any group of patients de- fined by age, sex, histology, performa nce status or extent of resection. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This small but clear improvement in survival from chem-otherapy encourages further study of drug treatment of these tumours 35 Mancuso A, Mazzola A, Cabibbo G, Perri cone G, Enea M, Galvano A, et al. Survival of patients treated with sorafeni b for hepatocellular carcinoma recur- rence after liver transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis . Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the St udy of the Liver 2015;47(4):324-330. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on survival and safety of sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant are still equivocal. AIM: We performed a meta-analysis of published studies, with the aim of estimating the 1-year rates of sur-vival, analysing the variability in survival rates and, finally, identifying the factors asso- ciated with a longer survival. METHODS: Data from 8 of the 17 selected studies were pooled, while the other 9 were excluded because survival rates were missing. All included studies were retrospective. RESULTS: Overall, the 1-year survival rang ed from 18% to 90%. Tumour progression was the main cause of death. The second cause was bleeding, reported only in patients undergoing m-Tor inhibitor therapy. The pool ed estimate of 1-year survival was 63%. There was a significant heterogeneity amon g studies (P<0.0001). Among the 34 varia- bles assessed by univariate meta-regression, 5 were associated with an increase in the 1-year survival rate: (1) male gender (P=0. 001); (2) Time to progression (P=0.038); and adverse drug events, divided in (3) gastro intestinal (P=0.038), (4) cardiovascular (P=0.029), and (5) dermatological (P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Additional data from multicentre prospective studies are required to clearly determine if sorafenib is a safe and acceptable treatment in hepatocellular carci- noma recurrence after liver tr ansplant. Nevertheless, its association with m-Tor inhibi- tors should be discouraged. Sheng J, Yang YP, Yang BJ, Zhao YY, Ma YX, Hong SD, et al. Efficacy of addition of antiangiogenic agents to taxane s-containing chemotherapy in ad- vanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis and systemic review . Medicine (United States) 2015;9 4 (31) (no pagination)(e1282). Abstract: Preclinical researches indicated a potential synergistic effect of taxanes-con- taining chemotherapy (TCC) and antiangiogenic agents (AAs) on the treatment of ad-vanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The advantage of adding AA to TCC in the real world remains confusing. We summariz ed the current evidences from relevant phase II/III randomized controlled trials (R CTs) by performing this meta-analyses. Electronic databases were searched for eligible literatures. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes were calculated using RevMan 5.2. A total of 14 phase II/III RCTs involv- ing 9703 participants were included. Compar ed to standard TCC, the addition of AA was associated with the significant better OS (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.97, P<0.0001), and 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.32, P< 0.00001). Subgroup analyses indicated that patient treated with monoclonal antibodies (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96, P = 0.02) as well as application in second-line (HR 0.91 , 95% CI 0.85-0.96, P=0.02) acquired sig- nificant OS improvement. Other clinical fa ctors directing significant OS improvement by the combination strategy included nonsquamous cancer (P=0.002), nonsmokers (P=0.0005), and female (P=0.02). Toxicities were greater but generally mild or moder- ate in the combination group, and were mo stly manageable. In summary, the addition of AAs to TCC could improve prognosis of advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, proper se- lection of patient population and AAs is crucial for clinical trials design and clinical practice in the future. Stewart LA. Chemotherapy in adult high-grade glioma: a systematic re- view and meta-analysis of individual patient data from 12 randomised trials . Lancet 2002;359(9311):1011-1018. 36 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Trials on the effect of systemic chemotherapy on survival and recurrence in adults with high-grade glio ma have had inconclusive results. We un- dertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of such treatment on survival and recurrence. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis using updated data on indi- vidual patients from all available randomised trials that compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Data for 3004 patients from 12 randomised con- trolled trials were included (11 published and one unpublished). FINDINGS: Overall, the results showed signif icant prolongation of survival associated with chemotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.91, p<0.0001) or a 15% relative decrease in the risk of death. This e ffect is equivalent to an absolute increase in 1-year survival of 6% (95% CI 3-9) from 40 % to 46% and a 2-month increase in median survival time (1-3). There was no evidence th at the effect of chemotherapy differed in any group of patients defined by age, sex, histology, performance status, or extent of resection. INTERPRETATION: This small but clear improvement in survival from chemotherapy encourages further study of drug treatment of these tumours. Ye X, Casaclang N, Mahmud SM. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of ymphoma: and meta-analysis . Hematological oncology 2014. Abstract: Epidemiological study between use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have been inconsistent. We aimed to systematically review epidemiological studies of the association and calculate pool ed relative risks using meta-analytic meth- ods. We searched eight electronic literature databases and three clinical trial registers to identify all studies (including observational studies and randomized clinical trials) of the association published prior to October 2013. Identified studies were independently reviewed by two researchers. We used a rand om effects model to calculate pooled odds ratio (PORs). Heterogeneity amongst studie s was examined using Cochran's Q and I- squared (I(2) ) tests; and sources of hetero geneity were explored using subgroup and meta-regression analyses. A total of 17 studie s (12 case-control studies and five cohort studies), all adult studies, were included. Us e of NSAIDs was not associated with over- all risk of NHL [POR =1.05, and 95% confidence risk of CLL/SLL (POR=0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.91) but not with the risk of all NHLs (POR =1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.17). Use of non-aspirin NSAIDs was associated with increased risk of NHL (POR=1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.97) amongst females only. The epidemiologic evidence re- mains inconclusive. Effects of NSAIDs may differ by drug type, NHL subtype, and sex and more studies taking into consideration these differences are needed. \u00a9 2014 The Authors. Hematological Oncology Published by John pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antidepressants: an updated Med 2009;6(4):522-543. Abstract: BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies have reported differences in the pharmacokinetics and/or pharma codynamics of antidepressants between women and men. OBJECTIVES: This article updates previously published literature describing sex dif- ferences in the pharmacokinetics and phar macodynamics of antidepressants, and ex- amines specific issues that face women with psychiatric illness. METHODS: An English-language literature search was performed with the PubMed database (March 2003-December 2008) using combinations of the search terms sex, gender, and antidepressants. In addition, ea ch antidepressant was identified in the 63rd edition of the Physicians' Desk Reference. RESULTS: The current data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants can be substantially different between women and men. Likewise, the response to antidepressants can be quite variable, in- cluding sex differences in adverse effects and time to response. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the many sex differences reported, there is still little pub- lished work systematically evaluating potential sex differences in antidepressant phar- macokinetics and pharmacodynamics. More research is needed to guide the treatment of depression and other mental illnesses. Calati R, Salvina Signorelli M, Balestri M, Marsano A, elderly: Disorders 2013;147(1-3):1-8. Abstract: Background: Depression is common in the elderly and in the last few years this led to a significant increase in antidepre ssant prescription rates. However, little is known about antidepressant efficacy profil e in relation with socio-demographic and clinical features in this population. The aim of the present study was to define the most suitable socio-demographic and clinical profil e for the use of antidepressant treatments in late-life depression. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for con- trolled trials (RCTs) focused on efficacy of antidepressants of all classes in major de- pressed elderly subjects (>60 years old). Re views and meta-analyses focusing on this topic have been considered as well. Thirty -four RCTs were incl uded and socio-demo- graphic and clinical were investigated via meta-reg ression analysis as modera- tors of efficacy measures (standardized mean difference based on Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Results: A lower rate of respon se to antidepressants of all classes was found in patients of male gender, of older age, and with a longer mean duration of the current episode. On the contrary, a higher rate of response wa s found in patients with a higher baseline severity and at their first episode of illness. Subsamples treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone yielded similar results. Limitations: RCTs only have been included. Conclusions: A number of socio-demographic and clinical features have been found to moderate antidepressant efficacy in elderl y population. Those variables could help cli- nicians for a more individualized treatment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Frackiewicz EJ, Sramek JJ, Cutler NR. Gender differences in depression and antidepressant pharmacokinetics and adverse events. Ann Pharmacother 2000;34(1):80-88. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review data gene rated by studies examining gender differ- ences in the prevalence of depression, as well as in antidepressant pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and adverse events. DATA SOURCES: Published articles and ab stracts were identifi ed through MEDLINE (January 1966-April 1999) using the followin g search terms: antidepressant, response, 38 gender, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, female, side effect, and adverse events. All articles that assessed gender differences in antidepressant response, pharmacoki- netics, and adverse events, as well as articles that evaluated postulated mechanisms for these differences, were reviewed. Additional articles were identified from bibliog-raphies of retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: A ll relevant abstracts, studies, and review articles were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Gender differences in the prevalence of depression have been re- ported and may result from the interaction of several factors. Women have been shown to have a higher incidence of depression, which may be due to artifact, social, or bio- logic reasons. Studies suggest that the pharmacokinetic disposition of popular antide- pressants varies between men and women, and women taking antidepressants may ex-hibit a different adverse event profile. Only one study specifically evaluated gender dif- ferences in antidepressant treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Further research elucidating gender differences in response to anti- depressant treatment and on depression prevalence is needed. Some studies report that the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants may vary between men and women. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that potential differences in antidepressant phar- macokinetics may exist, and a dosage adju stment may be necessary for women to en- sure a favorable drug response, compliance, and decreased incidence of adverse events. Gibiino S, Marsano A, Serretti A. Specificity profile of depression: metaregression of The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / offi- cial scientific journal of (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in the treatment of major depressive disorder, there is a lack of indications for each drug in different groups of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible role of clinical so- ciodemographic factors as moderators of cl inical response to venlafaxine and d on Medline and EMBASE for randomized control trials in English focused on sertrali ne and venlafaxine in the treatment of major depressive disorder and 59 st udies were included. Clinical efficacy of each treatment was assessed on the basis of Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and Montgomery-As- berg Depression Rating Scale. A metaregression analysis was performed to evaluate the role of clinical and sociodemographic factors as moderators of outcome, calculating the effect of each variable with the random-e ffects method. Gender, ethnicity and duration of depressive episode could have a role in pred iction of clinical response to both antide- pressants. Venlafaxine seems to have bette r effects in females and in Caucasian pa- tients. Sertraline seems to be more efficacious in the treatment of females. Both drugs were more efficacious in patients who suffere d a shorter episode of illness. Our results could represent an interesting point of view in the perspective of choosing the most suitable therapy based on clinical and social features for each patient. Metaregression is a retrospective analysis, based on the cumu lative results of previous studies, so the lack of original data could represent the main limitation in this report and in the inter- pretation of the results obtained. Hellem TL, Lundberg KJ, Renshaw PF. A review of treatment options for co- occurring methamphetamine us e disorders and depression . Journal of ad- dictions nursing 2015;26(1):14-23. Abstract: Co-occurring methamphetamine use and depression interferes with treat- ment outcomes. Female methamphetamine users are known to have higher rates of de-pression than male methamphetamine users, although this is also true for the general population. There are limited treatment options for the management of depression among methamphetamine users. In this in tegrative review, we summarize data on treatment strategies for co-occurring depression and methamphetamine use disorders. 39 English-language articles were identifi ed from PsychINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and Medline as well as from reference lists of key articles. Search terms included \"metham- phetamine,\" \"depression,\" and \"treatment.\" Re search articles describing psychological (n = 3), pharmacological (n = 6), nutritional supplement (n = 1), and psychological combined with pharmacological (n = 3) approaches for the treatment of methampheta- mine use or withdrawal and/or depression are included in this review. Psychological and combination of psychological with pharmacological approaches have not been shown to be effective in treating these co-occurring conditions. Antidepressants have been determined to be ineffective and/or to introduce side effects. Gender differences with response to treatment were examined in only one of the published studies. There is a large gap in knowledge regarding treatment of co-occurring methamphetamine use disorders and depression. Considering that female methamphetamine users experience higher rates of depression than men, a focus on gender-specific treatment approaches is warranted. Khan A, Brodhead AE, Schwartz KA, Kolts RL, Brown WA. Sex differences in an- tidepressant response in recent antidepressant clinical trials. J Clin Psy- chopharmacol 2005;25(4):318-324. Abstract: Some previous reports suggest th at women respond differently than men to antidepressant treatment. Much of this literature compares men and women's re-sponse to tricyclics to that of newer anti depressants (SSRIs, SNRI), or only examines one particular antidepressant. This study compares men and women's responses to 6 newer antidepressants. A total of 15 rand omized, placebo-controlled trials that in- cluded 323 depressed patients were examin ed for sex differences in antidepressant treatment response. Women had a significantly greater response than men to SSRI an-tidepressants. A similar trend was seen for those assigned to an SNRI antidepressant, although not to the same extent as with SSRI antidepressants. Although these gender differences in treatment respon se are not large enough to suggest that gender should guide the clinical use of SSRI and SNRI anti depressants, the results do have implica- tions for the design and interpretation of an tidepressant clinical trials. These findings also raise the possibility that antidepressa nts may work somewhat differently in men and women. Kokras N, Dalla C, Papadopoulou-Daifoti Z. Sex differences in Drug Metab Toxicol 2011;7(2):213-226. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Sex differences ha ve been identified in antidepressant treatment; however, it remains unclear to what extent pharmacokinetics contributes to these differences. As current antidepressant pharmacotherapy is less than optimal, un- derstanding the role of sex in pharmacokinetics may substantially contribute to a gen-der-based optimized treatment. AREAS COVERED: An unrestricted PubMed li terature search on antidepressant phar- macokinetics and sex was performed. Sex di fferences in absorpti on, distribution, me- tabolism and elimination of antidepressants, as well as the interaction of sex with age, genetic polymorphisms and gonadal hormones are discussed. We also provide an over- view of how each antidepressant presents a particular sex-diffe rentiated pharmacoki- netic profile. Most antidepressants present to some extent pharmacokinetic sex differ- ences, which often are further accentuated by gonadal hormones. In most cases, women, particularly elderly women, are expe cted to have higher exposure to antide- pressants when dosed in a similar way as men. EXPERT OPINION: Although the available pharmacokinetic evidence indicates that women should receive lower doses of antide pressants and men should receive higher doses, current guidelines do not recommend dose adjustment, because these sex differ- ences are considered to be clinically insign ificant. Unless we understand the link be- tween pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antidepressants, it will be difficult to determine whether sex differences are of clinical importance or not. Thus, further systematic and particularly focused research is needed on sex differences in pharmaco- kinetics. 40 Kornstein SG, Duloxe- tine efficacy for major depressive di sorder in male vs. female patients: data from 7 studie s have suggested potential gender differ- ences in the efficacy of antidepressant me dications. Pooled data from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were utilized to compare the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in male and female patients. METHOD: Efficacy data were pooled from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-trolled clinical trials of duloxetine. These st udies represent all available data from U.S. acute-phase, placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine for the treatment of MDD. Pa- tients (aged > or = 18 years) meeting DS M-IV criteria for MDD received duloxetine (40-120 mg/day; men, N = 318; women, N = 578) or placebo (men, N = 242; women, N = 484) for up to 9 weeks. Efficacy measur es included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score, HAM-D17 subscales (core, Maier, anxiety, retardation, sleep), the Clinical Global Im pressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale (PGI-I), the Quality of Life in De- pression Scale (QLDS), and Visual Analog Sc ales (VAS) for pain. The first patient visit was February 1, 1999, and the last pa tient visit was November 27, 2002. RESULTS: In both male and female patients, duloxetine produced significantly greater improvement in HAM-D17, CGI-S, and PGI-I when compared with placebo (p < .05). Treatment-by-gender interactions did not reach statistical significance, indicating that the magnitude of duloxetine's treatment effects did not differ significantly between male and female patients. However, there was a trend for female patients to show a more robust response than male patients to both duloxetine and placebo. On the basis of VAS assessments of pain severity, duloxeti ne-treated female patients appeared to ex- hibit greater improvement than male patients, while women receiving placebo had smaller responses than placebo-treated men. Improvements in quality of life were sig- nificantly greater for both men (p = .006) and women (p = .001) receiving duloxetine than placebo and showed no significant difference by gender. CONCLUSION: In this analysis of pooled data , the efficacy of duloxetine did not differ significantly in male and female patients.

J Affect Disord 2006;94(1-3):183-189. Abstract: BACKGROUND: While some studies have suggested sex differences in the efficacy of antidepressant medications, there have been few investigations into poten- tial sex differences related to safety and/or tolerability. Pooled data from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were utilized to assess the safety and tolerability of duloxe- tine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in male and female patients. METHODS: Safety data were pooled from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled clini- cal trials of duloxetine. Patients (aged >or= N=484) for up to 9 weeks. Safety was assessed using discontinuation rates, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, changes in vital signs and laboratory analyses. RESULTS: Discontinuation rates due to adve rse events among duloxetine-treated pa- tients were 18.6% for males and 13.5% for females. The most common treatment-emer- gent adverse events in both male and female patients included nausea, headache, dry mouth, diarrhea and constipation. The only event occurring at significantly different rates in male and female patients was nausea (Breslow Day p-value=0.008), and the significant difference was driven by a placebo nausea rate that was almost three times greater in females compared with males. No significant different ial sex effects were found for pulse, blood pressure or weight. No laboratory analyte had an incidence of abnormal high or low values that differed significantly between male and female pa- tients. 41 LIMITATIONS: This was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from acute phase clinical trials. Plasma concentrations of duloxetine were not obtained. Adverse event rates were based on spontaneous reports and different ial dose-response effects were not evalu- ated. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of clinically me aningful sex differences in the safety and tolerability of duloxetine were uncovered. Taylor Matthew J, Rudkin L, Bullemor-Day P, Lubin J, Chukwujekwu C, Hawton K. Strategies for managing sexual dysfunction induced by antidepressant medication. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013 (5). Abstract: Background: Sexual dysfunction (i ncluding altered sexual desire, orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction, erectile and ot her problems) is a relatively common side effect of antidepressant medication. These sexual side effects may compromise a per- son's lifestyle and result in a lack of compli ance with the prescribed antidepressant to the detriment of the person's mental health. A wide range of management strategies are possible to address this problem, including behavioural, psychological and pharma- cological approaches. Objectives: 1. To determine the effectivene ss of management strategies for sexual dys- function caused by antidepressants.2. To determine the adverse effects and acceptabil- ity of the different management strategies. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 1 Janu ary 2013), which includes relevant ran- domised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Li- brary (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Additional searches were carried out by the author team on the same bi-omedical databases (using terms for 'sexual dysfunction' only) together with CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2012). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that compared management strategies for an tidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction versus placebo or any alternative strategy.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently ex- tracted data and assessed trial quality. Stud y authors were contacted for additional in- formation. Main results: We included 23 trials invo lving 1886 people in this updated review. Twenty-two of these trials investigated the addition of medication to treat the identi- fied dysfunction, with most agents studied in only single studies. One study investi- gated switching to an alternative antidepressant.In men, data for the phosphodiester-ase inhibitors sildenafil (three studies, 255 participants) and tadalafil (one study, 54 participants) indicated they led to a greater improvement in erectile function than pla- cebo. Combined data from three sildenafil studies found benefit over placebo on Inter- national Index of Erectile Function ratings of ability to achieve (MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.44), and maintain erections (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59). A single point im-provement on these ratings is equivalent to an improvement in frequency from 'some- times' to 'most times'. Men receiving tadalafil were more likely to report improved erectile function (RR 11.50, 95% CI 3.03 to 43.67). For women it remains uncertain whether sildenafil is more effective than pl acebo. Unpublished data could reduce this uncertainty. Data from three studies in men and women of bupropion 150 mg twice daily indicate a benefit over placebo on rati ng scale scores (SMD 1.60, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.81), but response rates in two studies of bupropion 150 mg once daily demonstrated no statistically significant difference in e ffect (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.41).Other augmentation strategies failed to demonstrate significant improvements in sexual dys- function compared with placebo.One trial involving 75 people with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed the effect of changing antidepressant. Switching to nefazo-done was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), howeve r, nefazodone is no longer available for clinical use.There is an absence of randomised trials assessing the effects of switching to currently-available an tidepressant agents with lower rates of ad- verse sexual effects, the role of psychologica l or mechanical interventions, or of tech- niques such as drug holidays.We identified no data for any of the strategies included in the trials assessed that indicated that they led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, the relatively small numbers asse ssed for many of the interventions studied 42 means that the possibility of such an eff ct cannot confidently be excluded in all cases. Given the small numbers of studies assessing most of the strategies assessed, the pres- ence of any unpublished trials could have su bstantial effects on estimates of effect. In some cases, only results from particular items or subscales within ratings scales are available. It is likely that this could act to bias estimates of effect obtained, increasing apparent effectiveness. Authors' conclusions: The evidence currently available is rather limited. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil or tadalafil ap- pears to be an effective strategy. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dys- function the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far.

Abstract: In this review we investigate whether sex differences exist for side effects of second-generation antipsychotics. Results are based on a MEDLINE search for the years 1974 through 2005. Even if pharmaco kinetics differ between females and males, significantly higher plasma levels for wome n have been demonstrated only for olanzap- ine and clozapine. Hyperprolactinaemia is mainly induced by treatment with risperi- done and amisulpride, and there is evidence for more pronounced prolactin levels in females. Most studies reviewed indicate th at clozapine and olanzapine are associated with more body weight gain, once more espe cially in female patients. Furthermore, the few published studies indicate that metaboli c syndrome is more frequent in females and there are likely no gender-specific differences between the new antipsychotic medi- cations concerning frequency and degree of acute or chronic movement disturbance. The risk of QT prolongation with torsades de pointes arrhythmia is again higher in fe- males. In conclusion, there is some evidence of sex differences in th e side effects of sec- ond-generation antipsychotics. For better un derstanding of the basic mechanisms in sex differences, future studie s with a primary focus on this topic are required. More specific data will help to determine how these differences shall affect clinical manage-ment. Bawor M, D ennis BB, Bhalerao A, Varenbut al. Sex dif- ferences in outcomes of methadone maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder: a 2015;3(3):E344-351. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder is a serious international concern with limited treatment success. Men and women differ in their susceptibility to opioid use disorder and response to methadone treatm ent and can therefore benefit from sex-spe- cific treatment. We performed a systematic review of the literature on outcomes of methadone maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder in men and women related to drug use, health status and social functioning. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL for observational or randomized controlled studies involving ad ults 18 years of age or older undergoing methadone treatment for opioid use disorder . Studies were included if they investi- gated sex differences in methadone treatment outcomes. Two authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Meta-analyses were performed when possible; risk of bias and quality of evidence were also assessed. RESULTS: Twenty studies with 9732 particip ants were included, of which 18 were ob- servational and 2 were randomized controlled trials. Men and women differed signifi- cantly in alcohol use (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 0.86), amphetamine use (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.94), legal involvement (OR 0.63, 95% CI 43 0.47 to 0.84) and employment during treatment (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.73). Opi- oid use patterns were similar among men an d women. Risk of bias was moderate, and quality of evidence was generally low. INTERPRETATION: Sex differences were evident in polysubstance use, legal involve-ment and employment status among men and women receiving methadone treatment for opioid use disorders. Although the quality of evidence was low, our review high- lights the need for improved implementation of sex-specific treatment strategies. Davis ML, Smits JA, Hofmann SG. Update on the efficacy of pharmacother- apy for social anxiety disorder: a on pharma- cotherapy 2014;15(16):2281-2291. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common mental health problem that tends to be chronic in nature ; fortunately, effective pharmacotherapy op- tions exist. The current study provides an updated meta-analytic review of their effi- cacy and potential guidelines for their application in SAD. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the cu rrent literature yielded 39 randomized, pill placebo-controlled trials of pharmacoth erapy for adults diagnosed with SAD. Data on potential moderators of treatment outcome were collected, as well as data necessary to calculate effect sizes using Hedges's g. RESULTS: The overall effect size of pharmacotherapy for SAD is small to medium (Hedges's g = 0.39). The most effective pharmacotherapy type was phenelzine (Hedges's g = 1.14), followed by paroxeti ne (Hedges's g = 0.49), venlafaxine ER (Hedges's g = 0.45) and moclobemide (Hedges's g = 0.23). CONCLUSION: Effect sizes were not moderated by age, sex, length of treatment, diag- nostic subtype initial severity, maximum potential dose, or publication year. It is con-cluded that pharmacotherapy is effective fo r treating SAD, but there is considerable variation and room for further improvement. Future directions may include pharmaco- logical enhancement of psychological processes, such as d-cycloserine augmentation of exposure procedures. Graziani M, Nistico R. Gender differences in ph armacokinetics and phar- macodynamics of methadone substitution therapy 2015;6 (MAY) (no pagination)(122). Abstract: Gender-related differences in th e pharmacological effects of drug are an emerging topic. This review examines gender differences in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of methadone, a long-acting opioid agonist that is pre- scribed as a treatment for opioid dependence and the management of chronic pain. Method: We performed a search in the Medline database from 1990 to 2014 in order to find published literature related to gender differences in pharmacokinetics and phar- macodynamics of methadone. Results: None of the studies were carried out with the primary or secondary aim to identify any gender differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of methadone. Im- portantly; high inter-subjects variability in PK parameters was found also intra female population. The reported differences in volume of distribution could be ascribed to the physiological differences between men and women in body weight and composition, taking into account that the dose of methadone was established irrespective of body weight of patients (Peles & Adelson, 2006). On the other hand, the few studies present in literature found no gender difference in some direct pharmacodynamic parameters. Some reports have suggested that female gender is associated with an increased risk for long-QT (LQT)-related cardiac arrhythmia s in methadone maintenance subjects. Conclusion: Even though it may be too simpli stic to expect variability only in one pa- rameter to explain inter-individual variation in methadone response, we believe that a better knowledge of gender-related differences might have significant implications for better outcomes in opioid dependence substitution therapy in women. 44 Haack S, Seeringer A, Thurmann PA, Becker T, Kirchheiner Phar- macogenomics 2009;10(9):1511-1526. Abstract: differences observed in the adverse effects associated with psychotropic drugs have not been reported consistently in the literature. In this review, we discuss the current published data on sex differences observed in the occurrence, sympto- matology and reporting of the adverse effects associated with psychotropic drug effects, and discuss their clinical relevance. We re viewed the published data up to April 2009 on sex differences in the side effects of antipsychotics, an tidepressant and mood stabi- lizers, by systematically searching PubMed using combinations of search terms and re- trieving relevant references specifically re porting on these issues. The majority of the data was retrieved from clinical studies where the main outcome parameters did not relate specifically to sex differences. In mo st instances, sex was associated with other factors influencing side effects such as age, disease and body weight. Sex-related differ- ences were reported in the side effects associated with antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain and metabolic syndrome, symptoms of sexual dysfunction caused by anti- depressants and antipsychotic drugs and card iac arrhythmic side effects associated with antipsychotic drugs. Women might differ from men not only in incidence but also in the presentation of clinical symptoms associated with adverse psychotropic drug ef- fects. Clinicians should be made aware of th e differences reported in the literature re- garding the symptomatology, severity and recognition of the adverse psychotropic drug effects found in men and women. Moteshafi H, Zhornitsky S, Brunelle S, Stip E. Comparing ders, including schizophrenia, bipolar mani a, and unipolar and bipolar depression. Olanzapine treatment is associated with tolerability issues such as metabolic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, increase in blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels), extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS] (e.g . issues lead to some long-term conse- quences, which include cardiovascular dise ases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and these complications cause high rates of mortality and morbidity among patients with severe mental illnesses. The expanded indications of olanzapine in psychiatry sug- gest a need to investigate whether there is a difference in the incidence and severity of adverse effects related to category diagnosis. Are the adverse effects expressed differ- ently according to phenotype? Unfortunately, there are no reported studies that inves- tigated these differences in adverse effects associated with olanzapine treatment in psy-chiatric patients with different phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to separately examine olanzap- ine-induced cardiometabolic adverse effects and EPS in patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. DATA SOURCES: A search of computerized literature (1967-2010), EMBASE (1980-2010) and the clinicaltrials.gov website for randomized clinical trials was conducted. A manual search of reference lists of pub- lished review articles was carried out to gather further data. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials were included in our study if (i) they assessed olanzapine adverse effects (m etabolic or extrapyramidal) in adult pa- tients with schizophrenia or affective diso rders; and (ii) they administered oral olanzapine as monotherapy during study. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independ ently screened abstracts for choosing articles and one reviewer extracted relevant data on the basis of predetermined exclu- sion and inclusion criteria. It should be mentioned that for the affective disorders group we could only find articles related to bipolar disorder. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-three studies (4831 patients) that address olanzapine mon- otherapy treatment of adults with schizophre nia or bipolar disorder were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes were metabolic adverse effects (changes in weight, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels). The 45 secondary outcomes of our study were assessi ng the incidence of some EPS (parkinson- ism, akathisia and use of antiparkinson medication). The tolerability outcomes were calculated separately for the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups and were com- bined in a meta-analysis. Tolerability outcomes show that olanzapine contributes to weight gain and elevates blood triglycerides, glucose and total cholesterol levels in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. However, olanzapine treatment produced significantly more weight gain in schizophre nia patients than in bipolar disorder pa- tients. In addition, increases in blood glucos e, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the schizophrenia group compared with the bipolar disorder group, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Based on our results, the incidence of parkinsonism was significan tly higher in the schizophrenia group than in the bipolar disorder group. Subgroup anal ysis and logistic regression were used to assess the influence of treatment duration, do se, industry sponsorship, age and sex ra- tio on tolerability outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that schi zophrenia patients may be more vulnera- ble to olanzapine-induced weight gain. The findings may be explained by considering the fact that in addition to genetic disposition for metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients, they have an especially high incidence of lifestyle risk factors for CVD, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, stress and smokin g. It might be that an antipsychotic in- duces severity of adverse effect according to the phenotype. Viguera AC, Tondo L, Baldessarini RJ. Sex differences in response to lithium treatment . The American journal of psychiatry 2000;157(9):1509-1511. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although sex differ ences occur with some psychotropic drug treatments, they are not well defined for mood-stabilizing agents, including lithium. The authors' goal was to investigate whether there are differences between the sexes in response to lithium. METHOD: Studies identified in a literature se arch were analyzed fo r reports of sex dif- ferences in clinical response to lithium in major affective syndromes. RESULTS: Data from 17 studies published in 1967-1998, involving 1,548 adults treated with lithium for a mean of 38.6 months (S D=30.5), yielded similar weighted response rates to lithium in 1,043 women (65.6% [N=684]) and 505 men (61.0% [N=308]). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate little difference between the sexes in clinical re- sponse to lithium treatment of bipolar and related affective disorders. Wehmeier PM, Schacht A, Escobar R, Hervas A, Dickson R. Health-related qual- ity of life in ADHD: a pooled analysis of gender differences in in health-related qualit y of life (HR-QoL). Atomoxetine has been found to improve HR-QoL in both children and adolescents. However, there is scarcity of data on gender differences in treatment responses to ADHD medications. This pooled analysis of five atomoxetine trials aimed to evaluate treatment differences with respect to HR-QoL and ADHD symptoms acro ss genders. Data from 5 clinical atomox- etine trials (4 from Europe and 1 from Ca nada) with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria and similar durations (8- to 12-week follow-up) were included in the pooled analysis. All studies included the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition (CHIP-CE) Parent Report Form. In addition, co rrelations between HR-QoL and ADHD core symptoms were compared between girls and boys. Data from 136 girls and 658 boys (mean age: 9.6 and 9.7 years, respectively) were pooled. Boys and girls were similarly impaired at baseline with minor differences in some of the subdomains. Treatment ef- fect of atomoxetine was significant in both groups for the Risk Avoidance domain and its subdomains. No gender effect with both clinical and statistical significance was found for treatment outcome. Correlations between ADHD Rating Scale and CHIP-CE scores were similar in both genders and were generally low at baseline and moderate at endpoint and for the change from baseline to endpoint. Atomoxetine was effective in improving some aspects of HR-QoL in both genders without any significant differences across genders. Correlations between core symptoms of ADHD and HR-QoL were low to moderate in both boys and girls. 46 Whitney Z, Procyshyn RM, Fredrikson DH, Barr AM. Treatment of clozapine- associated weight gain: A systematic review . European Journal Clinical Pharmacology 2015;71(4):389-401. Abstract: Purpose: Clozapine an in treat- ment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is a ssociated with a low likelihood of extrapy- ramidal symptoms and other neurological side-effects but a high propensity to induce weight gain and general metabolic dysregulation. Various pharmacological and behav- ioral treatment approaches for reducing clozapine-associated weight gain exist in the literature; however, th ere are currently no clear clinical guidelines as to which method is preferred. The aim of the current review is to systematically summarize studies that have studied both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to attenu-ate or reverse clozapine-a ssociated weight gain. Methods: A systematic review of EMBASE and MEDLINE databases of all articles pub- lished prior to January 2014 was conducted. Seventeen studies were identified as meet- ing inclusion criteria and included in the review. Results: Aripiprazole, fluvoxamine, metformin, and topiramate appear to be beneficial; however, available data are limited to between one and three randomized controlled trials per intervention. Orlistat shows benefi cial effects, but in males only. Behavioral and nutritional interventions also show mode st effects on decreasing clozapine-associ- ated weight gain, although only a small number of such studies exist. Conclusions: While a number of pharmacological interventions can produce modest weight loss, each may be associated with nega tive side effects, which should be consid- ered before beginning treatment. Given the pressing need to improve cardiometabolic health in most clozapine-treated patients, substantially more research is needed to de-velop sound clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of clozapine-associated weight gain.

Abstract: Aims: We aim to identify the prevalence and management strategies of nine clinically important categories of antipsycho tic adverse effects, namely: and cardiovascular effects. Background: Antipsychotic drugs are widely prescribed for schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The adverse effects of an tipsychotics are common, with a potential negative impact on adherence and engagement . Despite this, the scientific study of the prevalence or management of adverse antipsychotic effects is a neglected area. Method: A systematic review was undertaken using pre-defined search criteria and three databases, with hand searching of citations and references. Inclusion was agreed on by two independent researchers after revie w of abstracts or full text. Quality analy- sis of included studies was conduc ted using pre-agreed criteria. Results: In total, 53 studies met inclusion criteria, revealing the following: (1) antipsy- chotic polypharmacy was associated with in creased frequency of adverse effects, and (2) a longer duration of treatment is associated with greater severity (e.g. higher BMI); (3) clozapine was more strongly associated with metabolic disturbance than other anti- psychotics in three studies and olanzapine wa s associated with the most weight gain in three studies; (4) hyperprolactinaemia was more common in women than men, but 50% men noted sexual dysfunction versus 2550% in women; (5) despite clinical guide- line recommendations there is a low rate of baseline testing for lipids and glucose; and (6) seven studies described adverse effect management strategies, but only two exam- ined their efficacy one found a significant reduction in weight with non-pharmacologi- cal group therapy and the other found a sign ificant reduction in dyslipidaemia with statins. Conclusions: Antipsychotic adverse effects are diverse and frequently experienced, but are not often systematically assessed. There is a need for further scientific study con- cerning the management of these side effects. 47 Smerte/sedasjon I alt identifiserte vi fi re relevante referanser. Averbuch M, Katzper M. A search for sex differences in response to analge- sia. Arch Intern Med 2000;160(22):3424-3428. Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is generally acce pted that males and females respond dif- ferently to painful conditions. With few exceptions, according to the published litera- ture, females demonstrate a lower pain thresh old and a lower tolerance of painful stim- uli. There is some support in the literature that females experience greater analgesic efficacy than do males after the administration of narcotic analgesics. We compared the analgesic response of females and males to ibuprofen in a post-third-molar extraction dental pain model. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 314 subjects included in the ibuprofen treatment arm of 7 double-blind, post-third-molar extraction dental pain (moderate to severe) studies, which were submitted to the agency electronically. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were practica lly identical in all studies. Pain relief and pain intensity measurements used the same metrics in all studies and were recorded just before and at least at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6. 0 hours after drug administration. RESULTS: The study included 195 female subjects and 119 male subjects (mean age, 21 years). Other than requiring de ntal extractions, the subjects were all healthy. Postoper- ative baseline pain was greater in females than in males to a statistically significant de- gree (P =.006). Both pain intensity and pain relief scores demonstrated the well-estab- lished analgesic effect of ibuprofen in the pool ed data set as well as in all the individual studies. Moreover, the mean pain intensity and pain relief scores over time for the fe- male and male treatment groups were not noticeably different at any time point after drug administration, with no imputation for missing values. Analysis of the data using the \"baseline observation carried-forward\" technique for remedicated subjects (the technique recommended by the Food and Drug Administration for efficacy analysis of acute analgesic medications) produced the same results, which were confirmed by analysis of variance and t tests at each time point of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated no sex effect on the analgesic response to ibuprofen. These results were obtained unde r the post-third-molar extraction setting, in which the least possible confounding factors are present. To fully establish the gen-erality of this phenomenon, studies should be carried out in other pain models and us- ing analgesic medications with different mechanisms of action.

Our objective is to investigate whether sex differences ex- ist in CYP3A activity as assessed by intrav enous (IV) or oral midazolam pharmacoki- netic analysis in healthy volunteers. METHOD S: Data from 13 previous studies were used. A single dose of IV midazolam (0.025 mg/kg) was administered to 66 white adults (37 women and 29 men; mean age, 36.3 +/-7.7 years). A single dose of oral mid- azolam, 0.075 mg/kg (5 studies), 0.15 mg/kg (1 study), or 5 mg (1 study), was adminis- tered to 72 adults (71 white and 1 Asian; 37 women and 35 men; mean age, 38.3+/-8.9 years). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined via population methods by use of a nonparametric adaptive grid program an d a 2-compartment IV and 1-compartment oral absorption model. The maximum a post eriori probability Bayesian method was used to estimate each subject's pharmacokinetic parameters. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability distribution of the area under the concen- tration-time curves (AUCs). RESULTS: Women exhibited 11% higher mean weight-corrected total body midazolam clearance and 28% higher oral clearance compared with men (P<or=.01). The median 48 AUC of IV midazolam was 0.05 mg.h/L (ran ge, in women and 0.06 mg.h/L (range, 0.02-0.14 mg.h/L) The midazolam was 0.11 mg.h/L (range, mg.h/L (range, 0.04-0.45 mg.h/L) in men. CONCLUSIONS: Although women showed significantly greater hepatic and intestinal CYP3A activity, only a minor sex difference in AUC was noted. Therefore the observed disparity may be of negligible clinical importance. Hu ZY, Zhao YS. Sex-dependent differences in cytochrome P450 by midazolam disposition a meta-analysis.

Meta-analysis of selected studies may address this ques- tion. Meta-analysis was performed on publis hed or unpublished data in terms of sex- dependent differences in midazolam (MDZ) disposition in humans. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were included for the analysis: MDZ oral and systemic clearance, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of oral and intravenous MDZ, MDZ oral bioavailability (F), and MD Z gastrointestinal extraction (E(G)). Ten studies including 409 healthy volunteers were identified. Women exhibited 16% higher weight-corrected MDZ oral clearance (P < 0.001) and 20% higher systemic clearance (P = 0.002) than men. No significant difference in the AUC after oral dosing of MDZ was noted between sexes. Women showed lo wer AUC of intravenous MDZ than men (P = 0.02). No sex-dependent di fferences were observed in F and E(G). In conclusion, women showed significantly greater hepatic CYP3A activity than men, whereas no sex- dependent difference in intestinal CYP3A activity was observed.

Pain 2010;151(1):61-68. Abstract: Although a contribution of sex in opioid efficacy has garnered much atten- tion, the confirmation and direction of an y such difference remain elusive. We per- formed a systematic review of the available literature on sex differences in mu and mixed mu/kappa opioid effect on acute an d experimental pain. Fifty unique studies (including three unpublished studies) were included in the analyses. Across the 25 clin- ical studies on mu-opioids there was no sign ificant sex-analgesia association. Restrict- ing the analysis to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) studies (irrespective of the opi-oid) yielded greater analgesia in women (n=1 5, effect size 0.22, 95% c.i. 0.02-0.42, P=0.028). Further restricting the analysis to PCA morphine studies yielded an even greater effect in size=0.36, 95% c.i. 0.17-0.56, P=0.003). Meta-re- gression indicated that the longer the duration of PCA, the difference in effect between the sexes further increased. Across experime ntal pain studies on mu-opioids women had 95% which was predominantly due to studies. Female patients had greater ies (n=7). Sex differ- ences exist in morphine-induced analgesia in both experimental pain studies and clini- cal PCA studies, with greater morphine efficacy in women. The data on non-morphine mu and mixed mu/kappa-opioids are less convincing and require further study.

Meta-analysis of the efficacy of nico- tine replacement therapy for smok ing cessation: differences between and women . J Consult Clin Psychol 2004;72(4):712-722. Abstract: Gender differences in the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) were examined in a meta-analytical review of 90 effect sizes obtained from a sample of 21 double-blind, placebo-controlled random ized studies. Although NRT was more ef- fective for men than placebo at 3-month, 6- month, and 12-month follow-ups, the bene- fits of NRT for women were clearly evident only at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Giv- ing NRT in conjunction with high-intensity nonpharmacological support was more im- portant for women than men. That is, NR T and low support were efficacious for women at only short-term follow-up, and me n benefited from NRT at all the follow-ups regardless of the intensity of the adjunct support. The results suggest that long-term maintenance of NRT treatment gains decrease more rapidly for women than men. Huang Y, Li W, Yang L, Jiang Y, Wu Y. Long-term efficacy and safety of vare- nicline for smoking cessation: A System atic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Journal of Public Health (Germany) 2012;20(4):355-365. Abstract: Aim: To evaluate the long-term effi cacy and potential risk of psychiatric side effects of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with placebo or nicotine replace- ment therapy. Subject and methods: Systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, SCI) up to Ma rch 2011. Two reviewers independently deter- mined the eligibility of randomized contro lled trials comparing with pla- cebo, or nicotine replacement therapy with follow-up of at least 12 months. Infor- mation was independently extracted by 2 reviewers. Results: Ten trials involving 6,375 smokers were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratios (RR) for continuous abst inence was 2.83 (95% CI: 2.20-3.63) at 52 weeks for varenicline (1 mg, twice per day) versus placebo. Varenicline seemed to be more effective in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR, 3.33) than smokers with cardiovascular diseases (RR, 2.64) or health smokers (RR, 2.52), non- Asian smokers than Asian smokers (2.98 vs. 1.94), elder smokers than younger smok- ers (2.87 vs. 2.52), female smokers than male smokers (2.98 vs. 1.94). The five predom- inant reported adverse events for vareniclin e compared to placebo were vomiting, nau- sea, abnormal dreams, constipation, and dysgeusia. There was no sufficient evidence that varenicline was associated with an incr eased risk of psychiat ric side effects (RR, 1.45, 95% CI: 0.90-2.32). Conclusion: Varenicline therapy compared with placebo is associated with a favorable effect on smoking cessation at the end of 52 weeks. However, the psychiatric adverse events related with varenicline should be fu rther studied with larger qualified study. People with preexisting mental illnesses should be prudently treated with varenicline. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2011. McKee SA, Smith PH, Kaufman M, Mazure CM, Weinberger AH. Sex Differences in Varenicline Efficacy for Smoking Cessation: A Meta-Analysis . Nicotine Tob Res 2016;18(5):1002-1011. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Women have lower rates of quitting than men with both bupropion and nicotine replacement. It is unknown whether varenicline demonstrates differential efficacy for men and women. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical trial data examining sex differences in the efficacy of varenicline for smoking cessation. METHODS: Searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO, 17 of 43 clinical trials of varenicline for smoking cessation published through December 31, 2014 were low-bias randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Data (n = 6710 smokers, 34% fe- male, n = 16 studies, 96% of available data ) was analyzed with Metafor program in R. Outcome endpoints were 7-day point-prevalence (PP) and continuous-abstinence (CA) 50 at week 12 (end of treatment), week 24 (6-month follow-up), and week 52 (12-month follow-up). RESULTS: Using placebo, women were less like ly than men to quit (PP-12, CA-24; P < .05 for sex). Using varenicline, similar ra tes of abstinence for men and women were demonstrated for all six outcomes (eg, PP-12 abstinence rates were 53% in both women and men). Varenicline versus placebo outcomes demonstrated that varenicline was more effective for women for short and interm ediate outcomes (PP-12, CA-12, CA-24; P interaction). For end-of-treatment PP, varenicline was 46% more effective for women. Fo abstinence, vare nicline was 34% (CA-12) and 31% (CA-24) smoking cessa tion medications, varenicline demon- strated greater efficacy among women smokers for short and immediate-term out-comes and equal efficacy for 1-year outcomes. Varenicline may be particularly useful for reducing the sex disparity typically seen in rates of smoking cessation. IMPLICATIONS: Varenicline is currently the most effective FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and this is the first demonstration that women compared with men have a preferred therapeutic response for a smoking cessation medication when considering short-term outcomes. Importantly, this is also the first demonstration that women have similar rates of quitting to men when considering longer-term, 1-year out- comes. Munaf\u00f2 M, Bradburn M, Bowes L, David S. Are there sex differences in trans- dermal nicotine replacemen t therapy patch efficacy? A meta-analysis. Nico- tine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 2004;6(5):769-776. Abstract: Smoking-related death and disabili ty rates for women have risen sharply re- cently. Despite lower smoking cessation su ccess rates for women using behavioral ther- apies, data are limited on whether specific pharmacological therapies are equally effica- cious in men and women. Using meta-analytic techniques, we examined whether sig- nificant differences in therapeutic efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation exist by sex. Out of the 31 randomized clinical trials of NRT that met inclusion criteria, 11 contributed to the analysis. The odds ratios for NRT vs. placebo were derived from each trial separately by sex for males and females, and these ratios were combined to give a pooled estimate of the effect of sex in response to NRT. NRT was effective at all time points in men (< 6 months: OR = 2.05, 95% CI= 1.61-2.60; 6 1.98, 12 months: OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.39-2.50) and women (< 6 months: OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.65-2.65; 6 months, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.17-1.98; 12 months: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.22-2.18). At all time points, no signifi- cant difference was observed between sexes (< 6 months: OR = .97, 95% CI = .69-1.36; 6 months: OR = 1.33, = months: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = .79-1.84). The results of this meta-analysis do not suppor t the hypothesis that NRT has higher thera- peutic efficacy for men than women. Perkins KA, Scott J. Sex differences in long-term smoking cessation rates due to nicotine patch . Nicotine Tob Res 2008;10(7):1245-1250. Abstract: Compared to men, women may be at greater risk for smoking-related dis- eases and have greater difficu lty quitting smoking. Sex differences in medication re- sponse could guide treatment for smoking cessation to improve women's quit rates. We conducted a meta-analysis of the 14 placebo-controlled nicotine patch trials (N = 6,250) for which long-term (6 months) clin ical outcome results could be determined separately by sex. This analysis updated a me ta-analysis of 11 of these trials that found no significant sex differences due to nicotine patch. The increase in quitting due to the nicotine vs. placebo patch was only about half as large in women as in men. Pooled ab- solute quit rates at 6 months for nicotine and placebo patch, respectively, were 20.1% and 10.8% in men, and 14.7% and 10.1% in wo men. The odds ratio for quitting due to nicotine vs. placebo patch was lower in women (OR = 1.61) than in men (OR = 2.20), with an interaction odds ratio of 1.40 (95% CI = 1.02-1.93, p = .04). This sex difference did not vary significantly by whether or not formal counseling was provided. Poorer 51 outcomes in women vs. men treated with nicotine patch suggests that increasing the quit rates of women smokers may require supplementing patch treatment or use of other medications. Scharf D, Shiffman S. Are there gender differences in smoking cessation, with and without bupropion? Pooled- and meta-analyses of clinical trials of Bu- propion SR. Addiction 2004;99(11):1462-1469. Abstract: AIMS: In this study, we examin e gender differences in smoking cessation with and without treatment with Bupropion SR. We test whether women and men have comparable success rates quitting smoking re gardless of treatment, whether Bupropion SR is effective for women, and whether Bu propion SR efficacy differs for men and women. DESIGN: A literature search was conducted to identify relevant trials. Data were ana- lyzed with individual-level (pooled) and st udy-level (meta-analytical) statistics. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 4421 participants in 12 randomized smoking cessation tri- als of Bupropion SR 300 mg versus placebo were analyzed. FINDINGS: Results from the meta-analysis re vealed that Bupropion SR was an effec- tive aid to smoking cessation [odds ratio (O R) = 2.49, 95% confiden ce interval (CI) = 2.06-3.00]. Moreover, Bupropion SR proved to be an effective cessation aid for women (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.92-3.17). No treatment-gender interaction was observed; women and men benefited equally from treatm ent with Bupropion SR (Q = 0.01, NS). Overall, women were less successful at quitting than men, regardless of treatment (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65-0.95). These results we re replicated with pooled, individual-level analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion SR is an effective smoking cessation aid for women. In these trials, women have less success quitting smoking than men, whether treated with Bupropion SR or placebo. There is a need to understand more about why women are less able to quit. Thomas KH, Martin RM, Knipe DW, Higgins JP, Gunnell D. Risk of neuropsychi- atric adverse events associated with varenicline: systematic review . BMJ (Clinical research ed) 2015;350:h1109. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events asso- ciated with use of varenicline compared with placebo in randomised controlled trials. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing study effects using two sum- mary estimates in fixed effects models, ri sk differences, and Peto odds ratios. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Con- trolled Trials (CENTRAL), and clinicaltrials.gov. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials with a placebo comparison group that report ed on neuropsychiatric adverse events (de- pression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, suicide, insomnia, sleep disorders, abnor-mal dreams, somnolence, fatigue, anxiety) and death. Studies that did not involve hu- man participants, did not use the maximum recommended dose of varenicline (1 mg twice daily), and were cross over trials were excluded. RESULTS: In the 39 randomised controlled trials (10 761 participants), there was no evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide (odds ratio 1.67, 95% con- fidence interval 0.33 to 8.57), suicidal ideati on (0.58, 0.28 1.20), depression (0.96, 0.75 to 1.22), irritability (0.98, 0.81 to 1.17 ), aggression (0.91, 0.52 to 1.59), or death (1.05, 0.47 to 2.38) in the varenicline users compared with placebo users. Varenicline was associated with an increased risk of sleep disorders (1.63, 1.29 to 2.07), insomnia (1.56, 1.36 to 1.78), abnormal dreams (2.38, 2.05 to 2.77), and fatigue (1.28, 1.06 to 1.55) but a reduced risk of anxi ety (0.75, 0.61 to 0.93). Si milar findings were observed when risk differences were reported. There was no evidence for a variation in depres- sion and suicidal ideation by age group, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, presence or ab- sence of psychiatric illness, and type of st udy sponsor (that is, pharmaceutical industry or other). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found no e vidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, depression, or death with varenicline. These 52 findings provide some reassurance for users and prescribers regarding the neuropsy- chiatric safety of varenicline. There was evid ence that varenicline was associated with a higher risk of sleep problems such as insomnia and abnormal dreams. These side ef- fects, however, : are already SS, L, Allen S, et al. Sex differ- ences in response to reduced Behav- iors 2014;39(7):1197-1204. Abstract: Background: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxi- cant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and de pendence. One area that has been rela- tively unexplored is what factors might moderate the effects of VLNC cigarettes. This exploratory analysis focuses on sex differenc es in responses to VLNC cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy. Methods: An exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized trial of 235 participants (58% female, mean age 47 years) comparing a) 0.05-0.09 mgnicoti ne yield cigarettes; b) 21mgnicotine patch nico tine yield cigarettes with 21mg nicotine patch was conducted. We focused on sex di fferences in product use, and impact of products on withdrawal response from usua l brand cigarettes and abstinence by ran- domized group. Results: The combination of VLNC cigarettes and nicotine patch was more effective in reducing use of VLNC cigarettes and withdr awal symptoms among males than females, whereas females were equally responsive to VLNC cigarettes with and without the nico- tine patch. Females were more likely to qu it smoking than males when assigned to ei- ther of the conditions that incorporated the VLNC cigarettes; however, males were more likely to quit smoking in the nicotine patch alone condition than females. Conclusion: Sex of the smoker may be an important determinant for effects of VLNC cigarettes and nicotine patch. Future large randomized trials to confirm these results are needed.

Consideration of sex in clinical trials of transdermal nico tine patch: a Abstract: Transdermal nicotine patch (TNP) is 1 of the most commonly used smoking cessation treatments; however, the efficacy of TNP by sex is not yet clear. The purpose of the current review was to synthesize how sex has been considered in published clini- cal trials of TNP for smoking cessation. The specific aims of the study were to examine the inclusion of sex in analyses of cessati on outcomes, TNP-related variables (compli- ance, side effects), and quit-related variable s (withdrawal, cravings); to review the con- sideration of sex-related vari ables (menstrual cycle phase, pregnancy); and to identify needs for future research. Pote ntial articles published through December 31, 2013 were identified through a MEDLINE search of the terms \"clinical trial,\" \"nicotine patch,\" and \"smoking cessation.\" Forty-two studies 3 terms and met the inclusion cri- teria. Approximately half of the studies repo rted that they considered sex in smoking cessation outcomes, with 15 studies finding no difference by sex and 7 studies finding better outcomes for men versus women. Only 5 studies reported data on outcomes by sex in their publications. No studies reported analysis of TNP compliance or with- drawal by sex. In the 1 study that examined side effects by sex, more women than men reported discontinuing TNP because of skin irritation. No study examined the associa- tion of cessation outcomes with menstrual cycle phase. There is a need to include sex in research on TNP, as well as other pharmaco logical and behavioral smoking treatments, to clarify the picture of treatment efficacy for women compared with men. 53 Andre sykdommer/tilstander I alt identifiserte vi 18 relevante referanser.

Clinical interventions in aging 2014;9:2079-2086. Abstract: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important health issue. While preva- lence and risk factors associated with ADRs in the general adult population have been well documented, much less is known about ADRs in the elderly population. The aim of this study was to review the published literature to estimate the prevalence of ADRs in the elderly in the acute care setting and identify factors associated with an increased risk of an ADR in the elderly. A systemat ic review of studies published between 2003 and 2013 was conducted in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Google Scholar and MEDLINE. search terms included: For inclusion in the review, studies had to focus on ADRs in the elderly and had to include an explicit definition of what was considered an ADR and/or an explicit assessment of causality, and a clear description of the method used for ADR identification, and had to describe fa ctors associated with an increased risk of an ADR. Fourteen hospital-based observatio nal studies exploring ADRs in the elderly in the acute care setting were eligible for in clusion in this review. The mean prevalence of ADRs in the elderly in the studies included in this review was 11.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1%-16.8%). The median prev leading to hospitalization was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.2%-12.8%), while the prevalence pitalization was 11.5% (95% CI: 0%-27.7%). There was wide variation in the overall ADR prevalence, from 5.8% to 46.3%. Female sex, increased comorbid complexity, and increased number of medications were all si gnificantly associated with an increased risk of an ADR. Retrospective studies and th ose relying on identification by the usual treating team reported lower prevalence rate s. From this review, we can conclude that ADRs constitute a significant health issue for the elderly in the acute care setting. While there was wide variation in the prevalence of ADRs in the elderly, based on the findings of this study, at least one in ten elderly patients will experience an ADR lead- ing to or during their hospital stay. Older female patients and those with multiple comorbidities and medications appear to be at the highest risk of an ADR in the acute care setting. Bacon RA, Mizoguchi H, Schwartz JR. Assessing therapeutic effectiveness of scalp treatments for dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, part 2: the im-pact of gender and ethnicity on efficacy . Journal of are common and troublesome scalp conditions that affect individuals independent of gender or eth- nicity.AIM: To evaluate whether population gender or ethnic origins impact the magni- tude of anti-dandruff therapeutic benefit obtained from use of a potentiated zinc pyri-thione shampoo treatment. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of anti-dandruff clinical data covering a single- product technology was conducted to assess whether statistically meaningful differ- ences were observed for gender or ethnic su b-populations. An analysis of covariance was performed on the pooled subject-level data. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of clinical data in volving 1114 subjects from seven trials demonstrated the lack of statistically signific ant impact of gender on flaking or selected biomarker measures. Similarly, a smaller population chosen to assess ethnicity demon-strated the lack of differences between Asian and Caucasian clinical sub-population re- sponses (flaking severity). 54 CONCLUSION: Through the use of both expert symptom grading and objective bi- omarker assessments, therapeutic efficacy of a potentiated zinc pyrithione shampoo was found to be independent of gender and ethnicity, being consistent with the lack of functional differences in skin from these populations.

Current Medical Re search & Opinion 2011;27(1):107-114. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Despite a plethora of published data on levocetirizine, no meta- analyses exist on the effect of study design , and covariates like age, gender, and base- line symptom severity on treatment response. The objective of this study was the effi- cacy of levocetirizine 5 mg tablets and matching placebo at reducing allergy symptoms in adult subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis under various pollen exposure study conditions and by age, gender and baseline symptom severity. METHODS: This was a meta-analysis of original reports from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studie s. Clinical studies without de tailed reports, open-label, non-randomized and non-controlled studies, or paediatric studies, were excluded. Study subjects were divided into an enviro nmental exposure (EE) group or a natural exposure (NE) group. RESULTS: Data from 3640 subjects were an alysed (n=2174 for levocetirizine, n=1466 for placebo). The overall results confirmed the efficacy of levocetirizine 5 mg, with an approximately 40% symptom score improvemen t from baseline, in both the EE and NE groups. While levocetirizine showed no gend er- or age-related differences in efficacy, female subjects responded better to placebo in the EE, but not in the NE group; younger subjects (<30 years of age) resp onded less favourably to placebo compared with older subjects (> 50 years of age). Levo cetirizine was consistently superior to pla- cebo regardless of baseline symptom score levels. The highest significance levels be- tween the active and placebo groups were observed in subjects sensitized to animal dander and grass. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between an oral antihistamine and placebo in clinical studies of allergic rhinitis might be due to a different response to placebo rather than to the active drug. Levocetirizine seems to have consistent efficacy regardless of age, gen- der, and baseline scores. Castilho JL, Melekhin VV, Sterling TR. Sex differences in HIV outcomes in the highly active antiretroviral th erapy era: a systematic review . AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 2014;30(5):446-456. Abstract: To assess sex dispar ities in AIDS clinical and laboratory outcomes in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART ) era we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on mortality, disease progressio n, and laboratory outcomes among persons living with HIV and starting HAART. We performed systematic Pub- Med and targeted bibliographic searches of observational studies published between January, 1998, and November, 2013, that included persons starting HAART and re- ported analyses of mortality, progression to AIDS, or virologic or immunologic treat- ment outcomes by sex. Risk ratios (relative risks, odd ratios, and hazard ratios) and 95% confidence intervals were ob tained. Sixty-five articles were included in this review. Thirty-nine studies were from North Amer ica and Europe and 26 were from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Forty-four studies (68%) showed no statistically significant difference in risk of mortalit y, progression to AIDS, or virologic or immunologic treat- ment outcomes by sex. Decreased risk of death among females compared to males was observed in 24 of the 25 articles that includ ed mortality analyses [pooled risk ratio 0.72 (95% confidence interval=0.69-0.75)], and decreased risk of death or AIDS was ob- served in 9 of the 13 articles that examined the composite outcome [pooled risk ra- tio=0.91 (0.84-0.98)]. There was no significan t effect of sex on the risk of progression to AIDS [pooled risk ratio=1.15 (0.99-1.31)]. In this systematic review, females starting HAART appeared to have improved survival compared to males. However, this benefit 55 was not associated with decreased progression to either AIDS or to differences in viro- logic or immunologic treatment outcomes. Cheng J. Doxycycline sclerotherapy in chil dren with head and neck lym- malformations . Journal of Pediatric Surg ery 2015;50(12):2143-2146. Abstract: Objective This is a systematic revie w of the literature describing doxycycline sclerotherapy (DS) to treat pediatric head and neck lymphatic malformations and ex- amine patient factors associated with treatment success. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid. Review methods A query of PubMed, EM- BASE, and Ovid search engines (1995-201 4) for studies examining outcomes for doxycycline sclerotherapy (DS) as primary tr eatment strategy for children with head and neck lymphatic malformations was undert aken. Successful outcome was defined as clinical resolution of symptoms or greater than 50% reduction in radiographic involve- ment. Results Five studies met the inclusion criteria for review. All were retrospective case series reports with high risk of bias. The dose of doxycycline used in all but one of the studies was 10 mg/mL, and the highest concentration administered was 20 mg/mL. Thirty-eight children met the inclusion crit eria for analysis. Thirty-two (84.2%) chil- dren were successfully treated with DS, wi th 23 (60.5%) utilizing only one treatment session. Average follow-up was 9.7 months. Age, gender, de Serres stage 1, and type of lymphatic malformation were not related to successful treatment outcome (p = 0.23, 1, 1, and 0.13, respectively). Conclusions DS is very effective for treatment of macrocystic and mixed head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. Overa ll success with DS treatment in children with lymphatic malformation of the head and neck was 84.2%. DS has distinct ad- vantages over other sclerotherapy agents in cluding that it is inexpensive and widely available, and has minimal side effects. No associated patient characteristics were found to predict improved success. Forte ML, Butler M, Andrade KE, Vincent A, Schousboe JT, Kane RL. Treatments for Fibromyalgia in Adult Subgroups (AHRQ Compar ative Effectiveness Reviews). Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We conduc ted a systematic literature re view of clinical trials to assess the comparative effectiveness of treatments for fibromyalgia in subgroups of highly affected or clinically comoplex adul ts. We focused on patient subgroups rather than overall treatment effects to complement a large systematic review being con-ducted on fibromyalgia treatments at McMaster University. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline(\u00ae), Embase(\u00ae), PsycINFO(\u00ae), AMED, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) plus reference lists of included studies and rece nt systematic reviews. METHODS: Two investigators screened abstract s of identified references for eligibility (enrolled adults with fibromyalgia, examined treatment effects, had a control group, and assessed outcomes at least 3 months after treatment initiation). Full-text articles were reviewed to identify ou tcomes reporting for at leas t one adult subgroup: women, older or obese adults, individuals with coexis ting mental health conditions, high sever- ity or longer fibromyalgia duration, multiple medical comorbidities, or other chronic pain conditions. Primary outcomes included pain, symptom improvement, function, fatigue, sleep quality, participation, and he alth-related quality of life. We extracted data, assessed risk of bias of individual st udies, and evaluated strength of evidence for each comparison and outcome. RESULTS: We identified 22 ra ndomized controlled trials (RCTs), 8 pooled analyses of patient-level RCT data, and 4 observational st udies that met inclusion criteria; 59 per- cent were drug trials. Adults with fibrom yalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD) were studied most often; drug studies also reported outcomes by age, sex, race, and anxiety. Most drug trials examined duloxetine effects on pain and global improvement; trial duration was typically 3 months. Low-strength evidence for duloxetine suggests that subgroups of adults with fibromyalgia and MDD do not experience differential short-term treatment effects. Other subgroup evidence is largely insufficient. For nearly all comparisons, treatm ent-by-subgroup interactions were not significant. Most 56 interaction results were report ed in text; only two RCTs and five pooled RCT analyses displayed data on subgroup outcomes. Losses to followup were considerable; dropout reporting was not subgroup specific. Advers e effects were reported for the MDD sub- group in one duloxetine pooled analysis; these were similar to overall adverse effects. Studies were not powered to detect subgroup effects. CONCLUSION: Despite the prevalent belief th at fibromyalgia treatments may behave differently in subgroups, evidence to date is largely insufficient for fibromyalgia sub- group effects of interventions other than du loxetine in adults with concomitant MDD. Future studies should be designed to support subgroup analysis to improve clinical ap- plicability. Gender-specific differences of drug effects with regard to age groups (Project record) .

Public Health Nurs 2014;31(3):206-214. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine published studies of immediate hypersensitivity re- actions (IHS) following vaccination and to determine whether women are at an in- creased risk of developing IHS after vaccination. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: PubMed was reviewed for vaccine articles reporting IHS by gender through June 2012. Data were abstra cted on type of study, vaccine, hypersensi- tivity reaction, and statistic reported. MEAS URES: Articles were included if they de- scribed co rrelational or descri ptive studies and IHS was reported by gender. RESULTS: Of 847 articles found in PubMed, 11 met the inclusion criteria. In eight studies, more women than men reported IH S, in two studies more men than women reported IHS and in one study the count was even. CONCLUSION: Limited data from these stud ies suggest that women may have higher rates of IHS reactions following vaccination than men. Limitations to the available data include the lack of denominator data and that the definition of IHS was not consistent across the studies. Large-scale population-bas ed studies are indicated to determine if there are differences in rates by gender and biologic basis for these differences. Hansen RA, Gartlehner G, Lohr KN, Kaufer DI. Functional outcomes of drug treatment in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis . Drugs & Aging 2007;24(2):155-167. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient functioning is an important outcome in Alzheimer's disease, but treatment-related improvements in patient function are difficult to quan- tify because a number of different scales are used in its measurement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systematically the evidence relating to patient functioning as an outcome measure in the drug treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Data were obtained by searching MEDLINE((R)), EMBASE, The Cochrane Library an d the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 through to December 2005 for studies assessing functional outcomes with donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine in Alz- heimer's disease. were sear ched manually and pharmaceutical manufac- turers were invited to submit dossiers. Tr ained reviewers abstracted data and assessed the internal validity (quality) of trials us ing predefined criteria. Standardised effect sizes (i.e. Cohen's standardised mean diff erence [d]) for various functional outcome scales and pooled mean incidence and 95% CIs for adverse events were calculated and summarised qualitatively and quantitatively. Meta regression was used to explore po- tential heterogeneity. RESULTS: Overall, the standardised effect size for functional outcome measures was small (d = 0.1-0.4) among incl uded studies. However, effect sizes consistently favoured drug treatment over placebo. For all drugs, pooled standardised effect sizes were con- sistent in both short (<24 weeks; d = 0.25; 95% CI 0.13, 0.37) and long trials (>/=24 57 weeks; d = 0.29; 95% CI 0.22, 0.36). The p ooled effect size was not significantly af- fected by parameters such as disease se verity, age, gender and drug dose. Adverse events were generally limited to gastrointe stinal problems, weight loss and dizziness, all of which were reported in <2 0% of patients on average. CONCLUSIONS: Standardised estimates of e ffect size across diverse functional out- come measures for drug treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease were small and the data reflect only a modest trend favouring active treatment over placebo. However, given the current lack of other effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease, this trend supports the clinical benefits of these treatments with regard to this important health outcome. Halsey NA, Griffioen M, Dreskin SC, fo llowing monovalent 2009 pandemic are a cause for concern. OBJECTIVE: To determine the type and rate by age, gender, and vaccine received for reported hypersensitivity reactions followin g monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines. DESIGN: A systematic review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Sys- tem (VAERS) following monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines. SETTING/PATIENTS: US Civilian reports following vaccine received from October 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Age, gender, vaccines received , diagnoses, clinical signs, and treat- ment were reviewed by nurses and physicians with expertise in vaccine adverse events. A panel of experts, including seven allergists reviewed complex illnesses and those with conflicting evidence for classification of the event.RESULTS: Of 1984 reports, 1286 were consistent with immediate hypersensiti vity disorders and 698 were attributed to anxiety reactions, syncope, or other illne sses. The female-to-male ratio was >4:1 for persons 20-to-59 years of age, but approx imately equal for children under 10. One hundred eleven reports met Brighton Collabo ration criteria for anaphylaxis; only one- half received epinephrine for initial therapy. The overall rate of reported hypersensitiv- ity reactions was 10.7 per million vaccine dose s distributed, with a 2-fold higher rate for live vaccine. LIMITATIONS: Underreporting, especially of mild events, would result in an underes- timate of the true rate of immediate hypers ensitivity reactions. Selective reporting of events in adult females could have resulted in higher rates than reported for males. CONCLUSIONS: Adult females may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions after influenza vaccination than men. Although th e risk of hypersensitivity reactions follow- ing 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccines was low, all clinics administering vac- cines should be familiar with treatment guidelines for these adverse events, including the use of intramuscular epinephrine early in the course of serious hypersensitivity re- actions.Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevi er Ltd.

Abstract: AIMS: To explore the durability of efficacy and gender differences during chronic administration of desmopressin in nocturia. METHODS: This pooled analysis of three shor t-term efficacy studies, with extensions, of desmopressin administered as orally disi ntegrating tablet (ODT) or solid tablet in nocturia treatment, comprised 351 patients completing 40-56 weeks' treatment. Effi- cacy endpoints of change in number no cturnal voids and duration of initial undis- turbed sleep period from base line were analyzed to determ ine response durability and gender differences. RESULTS: The mean decrease in number of nocturnal voids during short-term treat- ment was maintained and further reduced duri ng the long term. At 52 weeks, the mean 58 decrease in number of nocturnal voids from baseline reached 1.4-2.1 voids for desmo- pressin ODT 25-100 microg. Following 40-week tablet treatment, the decrease in num- ber of nocturnal voids was 0.8-1.5 for microg OD T) was greater for fema les than males. For females, the improvement in initial period of undisturbed sleep was 2.5-3 hr for desmopressin ODT 25-100 microg, compared with 1.3-2.6 hr for males. No gender dif- ference in efficacy was seen in the tablet studies. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in nocturnal voids and improvement in sleep with short-term desmopressin treatment were ma intained throughout long-term treatment. A durable gender difference in efficacy in favor of fema les was observed with desmo- pressin ODT 25 microg. Further, large-scale long-term trials are needed to confirm the durability of efficacy with gend er-specific doses of desmopressin. Kamath GR, Shah DP, Hwang LY. Immune response to hepatitis B vaccina- tion in drug using populations: a systematic review and analysis . Vaccine 2014;32(20):2265-2274. Abstract: Injecting and non-in jecting drug users are at increased risk of contracting HBV infection, and show lowe r antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination compared to the general population. This systematic review and meta-regression analysis aimed to estimate seroprotection rates and identify host or vaccine factors associated with varying immune response following hepatitis B vaccination in drug using populations. Original research articles were searched using online databases (Medline, PubMed, and Embase) and from reference lists of eligible articles. HBV vaccine intervention studies reporting seroprotection rates in drug users, published in English during or after 1989 were eligible. Of 978 citations reviewed, 11 st udies were eligible and included for final analysis. The reported seropr otection rates ranged from 54.5% to 97.1%. The studies were significantly heterogeneous (Q=180.8 50, p=0.000). Measurement of anti-HBs antibody at 2 months after the third va ccine dose (RR=2.62, 95%CI=1.16-5.94, p=0.026) was significantly associated with higher seroprotection rates compared to measurement at 1 month and 6 month following third vaccine dose. Age, gender, cur- rent drug use, vaccine dose and schedule, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HIV antibody seropositivity, and proportion of IDU study population did not show a significant asso- ciation with seroprotection rates. Recommendations for future research include the definition of a standardized time point for the measurement of anti-HBs antibody lev- els, to enhance comparability of the immune response between different studies. Stud- ies should strive to accurately report all potentially relevant factors affecting immune response to vaccine. Long-term follow up st udies are needed to assess the seroprotec- tion status in drug using populations receiving hepatitis B vaccine by standard or accel- erated schedules. Kargar M, Mansouri K. Anti-tu- berculosis drugs adverse reactions: a review of the Iranian literature . Ex- pert opinion on drug safety 2014;13(7):875-891. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: (TB) in particular TB (MDR-TB), is associat ed with toxicities and adverse reac- tions (ADRs). AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews Irania n literature reporting ADRs which oc- curred during tuberculosis treatment. Englis h language papers were sourced from Pub- Med, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Ovid and Proquest, with Google Scholar searched for Per-sian language articles. Reported ADRs, propor tion of patients with ADRs, risk factors and determinants, as well as the characteristic s of the studies were reviewed. 21 articles were included; about 60% of them were in English and three included patients with MDR-TB. The ratio of ADR per capita was 1.9 (in 6 studies) and 33.63% of patients de- veloped an ADR (in 7 studies). Hepatitis (2.5 - 45.3%) was reported in nearly all of the studies. The mean time from initiation of medication to development of hepatitis ranged from 4.67 to 25.25 days (in 6 stud ies). Most cases of mortality were due to hepatotoxicity. Except for comorbidities and female gender, other risk factors such as HIV and length of hospitalization were only reported in one article. 59 EXPERT OPINION: The pattern of ADRs in Ir anian articles was found to be similar to many other studies in the present review. We suggest that future studies resolve the confounding factors in this area that are mentioned in this review. Nicast ri E, Leone S, Angeletti C, Palm isano L, Sarmati L, Chiesi A, et al. Sex issues in HIV-1-infected persons during high ly active antiretroviral therapy: a systematic review . J Antimicrob Chemother 2007;60(4):724-732. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), morbidity and mortality rates have sharply decreased among HIV-infected patients. Studies of possible differences between men and women in the course of HIV infection give conflicting results. The objective of this study was to assess sex differ- ences during HAART. METHODS: A literature search by using the MEDLINE database between March 2002 and February 2007 was performed to identify all published studies on the sex-specific differences on the impact of HAART. All articl es with measures of effect (preferably ad- justed odds ratio, relative risk or hazard ratio with 95% CI) of sex on viroimmunologi- cal and clinical parameters during HAART were included. Five different topics of inter- est in our research were se lected: time of initiation of HAART, adherence, viroim- munological response, clinical response and adverse reactions during HAART. RESULTS: US data report an initiation of HAART at an earlier disease stage in men compared with women. After initiation of HAART, most authors do not report any vi- roimmunological difference, although a few clinical studies showed a significantly bet-ter virological response in women compar ed with men. Nevertheless, women were more likely to be less adherent to antiretrovirals and to have non-structured treatment interruptions than men. This is likely to be related to the higher number of adverse re- actions they experience during HAART. Finally, discordant opinions with regard to clinical benefits during HAART exist, but recent clinical and observational trials sug- gest a better clinical outcome for women. CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of sex differences during antiretroviral treat- ment. Nevertheless, most of these studies were underpowered to detect sex differences and had limited follow-up at 6 or 12 months. Design of new gender-sensitive clinical trials with both prolonged follow-up and sample size representative of the current HIV prevalence among women are strongly needed to detect the likely sex differences of an-tiretroviral agents during HIV infection. Ordooei Javan A, Shok Sahraei Z. A Colistin is an antibiot ic that was introduced many years ago and was withdrawn because of its nephrotoxicity. Nowadays, reemergence of this antibiotic for multi-drug resistant Gram-negative ctions, and a new high dosing regimen rec- ommendation increases concern about its nephrotoxicity. This review attempts to give a view on colistin nephrotoxicity, its preval ence especially in high doses, the mecha- nism of injury, risk factors, and prevention of this kidney injury. Method: The data col-lection was done in PubMed, Scopus and Coch rane databases. and prospective or retrospective observational ani-mal and human studies were included. In all, 60 articles have been reviewed. Result and conclusion: Colistin is a nephrotoxic antibiotic; a worldwide increase in nosocom- ial infections has led to an increase in its usage. Nephrotoxicity is the concerning ad- verse effect of this drug. The mechanism of nephrotoxicity is via an increase in tubular epithelial cell membrane permeability, which results in cation, anion and water influx leading to cell swelling and cell lysis. Ther e are also some oxidative and inflammatory pathways that seem to be involved in colistin nephrotoxicity. Risk factors of colistin ne- phrotoxicity can be categorized as dose and duration of colistin therapy, co-administra- tion of other nephrotoxic drugs, and patient-related factors such as age, sex, hypoalbu-minemia, hyperbilirubinemia, underlying di sease and severity of patient illness. 60 Udina M, Castellvi P, Moreno-Espana J, Navines R, Valdes M, Forns X, et al. Inter- feron-induced depression in chronic hepatitis C: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Journal of Clinical Psychi atry 2012;73(8):1128-1138. Abstract: Objective: To carry out a systematic review of the risk factors for, and inci- dence of, major depressive episode (MDE) re lated to antiviral therapy for chronic hep- Data Sources: The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched to lo-cate articles published from the earliest avai lable online year until June 2011 using the keywords hepatitis C, interferon-alpha, pe ginterferon, pegylated interferon, depres- sion, and mood and Boolean operators. Arti cles written in English, Spanish, and French were included. Study Selection: Prospective studies reporting incidence of interferon-alpha-induced MDE were included. At baseline, patients did not present a DSM-IV/ICD depressive episode, and evaluation was performed by a trained clinician. Twenty-six observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Extracted data included auth ors, year of publication, design, charac- teristics of the population, viral coinfection, adjunctive psychopharmacology, instru- assess depression, of interferon-alpha, adjunctive ribavirin treatment, and follow-up time. Outcome of incidence of MDE (primary outcome meas- ure) was abstracted, as were potential predic tive variables. Data Synthesis: A full re- view was performed. Meta-analysis of the cumulative incidence of induced MDE as a function of time was carried out. Odds rati os (ORs) and mean differences were used to estimate the strength of association of variables. Results: Overall cumulative incidence of de pression was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.35) and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.42) at 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, respectively. Accord- ing to our analysis, high baseline levels of interleukin 6 (mean difference = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.52), female gender (OR = 1.40 ; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.91), history of MDE (OR = 3.96; 95% CI, 2.52 to 6.21), history of psychiatric disorder (OR = 3.18; 95% CI, 1.60 to 6.32), subthreshold depressive symptoms (mean difference = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.61), and low educational level (mean difference = -0.99; 95% CI, -1.59 to -0.39) were predictive variables of MDE during antiviral treatment. Conclusions: One in 4 chronic hepatitis C patients who start interferon and ribavirin treatment will develop an induced major depressive episode. Clinicians should attempt a full evaluation of patients before starting antiviral treatment in order to identify those at risk of developing inte rferon-induced depression. \u00a9 Copyright 2012 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. Verster JC, Roth T. Gender differences in highway driving performance af- ter administration of sleep medication: a review of the literature . Traffic Injury Prevention 2012;13(3):286-292. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: It is generally assu med that there are minimal gender differ- ences in the safety and efficacy of central nervous system drugs, as is evidenced by men and women receiving the same drug dosage. There is, however, evidence that drugs may have a differential effect on performance in men and women, given reported dif- ferences in pharmacokinetics as well as the presence or absence and severity of adverse effects. It is especially important to veri fy whether gender differences in performance exist in case of activities that have pote ntially dangerous outcomes such as driving a car. This review summarizes the current scient ific evidence on gender differences in driving performance after treatment with hypnotic drugs. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to obtain all studies that conducted on-road driving tests to examine the effects hypnotic drugs on driving. Cross-references were checked and technical re ports and raw data were obtained, if possible.RESULTS: Fourteen studies were evaluated. Many studie s did not allow analyses of gender effects because only women were included. Others did not report data on gender analyses. Technical reports and additional data analyses revealed significant gender differences in driving performance the morning following bedtime administration of flurazepam (30 mg) and after middle-of-the-night administ ration of zolpidem (10 mg). No signifi- cant gender differences were found for ramelteon (8 mg), lormetazepam (1 and 2 mg), zaleplon (10 and 20 mg), and zopiclone (7.5 mg). 61 CONCLUSIONS: Although the available data ar e limited, the results show that signifi- cant gender differences have been found for some drugs but not others. Therefore, in the future more research is needed to reveal potential gender differences and to deter- mine what mediates them. Yu EW, Bauer SR, Bain PA, Bauer DC. Proton pump inhibitors and risk of fractures: A meta-analysis of 11 international studies . American Journal of Medicine 2011;124(6):519-526. Abstract: Background: Concerns have been raised about the risk of fractures with acid- suppressive medications, such as proton pu mp inhibitors and histamine <inf>2</inf>- receptor antagonists. Methods: This meta-analysis evaluated the association between proton pump inhibitor or histamine<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagoni st use and fractures. We performed a sys- tematic search of published literature (1970 to October 10, 2010) in MEDLINE, EM- BASE, and other sources. Ten publications re porting 11 studies were considered eligible for analysis. Results: All studies were observational case -control or cohort studies and primarily evaluated older adults. The summary effect es timate for risk of hip fracture increased modestly among individuals taking proton pu mp inhibitors (relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.43). Ther e also was an increase in spine (RR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.31-1.85) and any-site fractures (RR 1.16, 95% CI, 1.04-1.30) among proton pump inhibitor users. These findings were similar in both men and women and after stratification by duration of use. In cont rast, histamine<inf>2</inf>-receptor antago- nist use was not significantly associated with increased risk of hip fracture (RR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.97-1.30). Conclusion: In this meta-analysis of observ ational studies, proton pump inhibitors modestly increased the risk of hip, spin e, and any-site fractures, whereas hista- mine<inf>2</inf>-receptor antagonists were not associated with fracture risk. The possibility of residual confounding cannot be excluded. Further skeletal evaluation should be considered for patients who are ta king proton pump inhibitors and also at risk for osteoporotic fracture. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.
