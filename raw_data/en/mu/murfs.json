These guidelines were made in collaboration with COVID-19 vaccination providers and in accordance to requirements set out by the Commonwealth Government. Compliance with the most current version of these guidelines is a condition of the Public Health Emergency Orders and Secretary's Approval (see section on Legal authorisation of workforce ). Background COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person or from surface to person. Making safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines available to all Australians is a key priority of the Australian, State and Territory Governments. The Australian COVID-19 Vaccination Policy , endorsed by National Cabinet on 13 November 2020, sets out key principles for the roll out, such as that COVID-19 vaccines will be made available for free to all Australian citizens, permanent residents, and visa-holders. Further, it outlines how COVID-19 vaccines will be accessible on a rolling basis, dependent on vaccine delivery schedules and the identification of groups for most urgent vaccination. While it normally takes several years to develop a vaccine, scientists across the world have worked collaboratively and rapidly to achieve the same amount of work in a few months in order to make a safe and effective vaccine available as soon as possible. Although clinical trials have been carried out more rapidly than they have for other vaccines, this has been achieved by conducting some of the steps in parallel rather than sequentially and vaccine safety has not been compromised.1 The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has rigorously assessed COVID-19 vaccine applications for safety, quality and effectiveness before provisionally approving their use for Australians. For more information regarding COVID-19 vaccines, see the department's website for COVID-19 vaccines ( https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/vaccine ). Vaccine rollout The purpose of the COVID-19 vaccination program is to protect those who are at most risk from serious illness or death due to COVID-19. A vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is likely to be most effective way to control the pandemic. Initial roll out began with the delivery of the Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty BNT162b2 [mRNA] COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine) and the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine). Since then, the (Spikevax) mRNA-12732 (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) and the Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373) COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) have also been approved. The Victorian Department of Health (the department) nominated nine public health services, and a network of community health organisations (C19), aligned with 1 Public Health England COVID-19 vaccination programme Information for healthcare practitioners Version 3.1 11 January 2021. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/951155/COVID- 19_vaccination_programme_guidance_for_healthcare_workers_11_January_2021_V3.1.pdf 23 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL the department's local public health units (LPHUs), to deliver COVID-19 vaccines as part of the Commonwealth Government's COVID-19 vaccine roll out strategy. These nine health service hubs included: Albury Wodonga Health Austin Health Ballarat Heath Goulburn Valley Health Latrobe Regional Hospital Monash Health Western Health Some of the hubs had other health services and locations that served as outreach or sub-hubs. The Commonwealth Government led an in-reach workforce that delivered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination program in private residential aged care and disability care. COVID-19 vaccines are available at general practitioner respiratory clinics, general practices and community pharmacies that meet specific requirements, and Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Services. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Australia The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is responsible for assessing any COVID-19 vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness before they can be supplied in Australia. More information, including the approval process, safety monitoring and reporting and product information is available from the TGA website ( https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines ). The TGA has granted provisional approval for the use of four COVID-19 vaccines in Australia. These are: The Comirnaty BNT162b2 [mRNA] COVID-19 vaccine (PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) for individuals 6 months of age and older. The AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S COndix VID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine) for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Spikevax (elasomeran) COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) for individuals 6 months of age and older. The Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373) COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax COVID-19 vaccine) for individuals 12 years of age and older The Janssen-Cilag COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine) for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Janssen-Cilag COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available in Australia. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available in Australia. Provisional approval for each of these vaccines is valid for two years and is subject to certain strict conditions.

Phone: 1300 024 760 25 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Governance All COVID-19 vaccination providers will be responsible for organising the governance and leadership of their COVID-19 immunisation program. This includes health services hubs and any sub-hubs and outreach locations. It is anticipated that each provider will appoint a clinical and operational lead who will be responsible for the delivery of all aspects of the COVID-19 vaccination services in all relevant settings. This leadership should lead the development and implementation of local delivery plans to ensure all systems and processes, workforce, training and all other relevant preparatory requirements are in place to support delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination service. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must ensure that all staff involved in the COVID-19 vaccination service are aware of escalation processes for clinical and operational incidents, including reporting of suspected adverse events. Clinical governance Safer Care Victoria has published Victoria's clinical governance framework2 that outlines expectations regarding clinical governance and provides best practice guidance to inform good clinical governance. The five domains of the framework, underpinned by continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement are: leadership and culture consumer partnerships workforce risk management clinical practice. The framework is designed so that the COVID-19 vaccination providers can adapt and implement the components to best meet the needs of their clients and organisation. Leadership and culture All staff have a shared responsibility for building a positive workplace culture Organisational culture - a 'just' culture exists whereby staff are supported, and their wellbeing prioritised Clinical leadership - strong, transparent, supportive and accessible leadership fosters a culture of learning, accountability and openness, with strong clinical engagement Teamwork - staff are supported at all levels of the organisation by skilled management Ownership and accountability by all staff. 2 https://www.bettersafercare.vic.gov.au/publications/clinical-governance-framework 26 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Consumer/client partnerships The consumer/client is at the centre of care and viewed as a critical partner in the design and delivery of the immunisation service. Consumer engagement and input is actively sought and facilitated Using and improving systems to support organisational and community priorities Partnering with consumers/clients and management to ensure consumers/clients receive appropriate information and care Commitment to providing a positive consumer experience every time. Workforce COVID-19 vaccination providers are responsible for a safe environment for both consumers/clients and staff. All immunisation staff have the required knowledge and skills, technology and equipment to provide the best care possible, and are accountable for the care they provide. Risk management Safeguarding against clinical risk requires a structured approach to safety that is both proactive and reactive. Active participation in site processes that support consumer/client safety and identify and act on opportunities for quality improvement Reporting incidents and near misses Following through with open disclosure to consumers/clients and families Analysing and addressing adverse events Appropriately escalating safety issues to managers. The COVID-19 vaccination provider must ensure that any authorised COVID-19 vaccination workforce meets and maintains the requirements for professional registration for the full period of their engagement, where applicable. It's strongly recommended that the COVID-19 vaccination provider develops and institutes policies/procedures to confirm all COVID-19 vaccination workforces' registration status on initial engagement. Clinical practice Good clinical practice requires systems that provide safe and appropriate care for each consumer/client with the best possible outcome. Shared responsibility for protocols, equipment, and resources. The framework is underpinned by continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement. Code of Conduct: Self and family vaccinations Vaccine providers and authorised vaccination workforce should be aware of the medico- legal regulations associated with vaccinators administering COVID-19 vaccines to themselves and family members as well as recording their own vaccination and family member's vaccination. These requirements have been outlined in the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Regulations 2017 and the Medical Board APHRA Guidelines as detailed below. 27 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Self-vaccinations COVID-19 vaccines are classified as a Schedule 4 poison under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Regulations 2017 (R.105 (1))- Part 12. An individual is not permitted to self-administer the COVID-19 vaccine, nor record their own, family members' or friends' vaccination details. However, self-administering can be permitted in exceptional circumstances, when the vaccine is lawfully prescribed and supplied specifically for the treatment of that person by another authorised person (prescriber). This structure does not apply to persons authorised under the COVID-19 Secretary Approvals or Public Health Emergency Orders. Authorised workforce vaccinating family members Authorised vaccination workforce, wherever possible, should avoid providing vaccination care to anyone with whom they have a close personal relationship such as providing healthcare to close friends, those they work with and family members would be inappropriate because of the lack of objectivity, possible discontinuity of care, and risks to the patient and healthcare provider relationship. There may be instances where providing care to individuals having close personal relationship to the provider is unavoidable, for example in an emergency. Whenever this is the case, good clinical practice requires recognition and careful management of these situations. As an example, for further guidance refer to Section 4.15 of the Medical Board Ahpra Guidelines: Good medical practice: a code of conduct for doctors in Australia . Feedback and complaints Consumer feedback is a valuable resource and should be encouraged in all aspects of the service. Complaints should be responded to in consultation with the consumer to reach suitable resolution, outcomes should then be used to drive quality improvement. Systems should be in place to ensure: consumers and their needs are key organisational priorities consumers are provided with the relevant knowledge to participate fully in their care to extent they wish clear, open and respectful communication exists between consumers and staff at all levels of the health system services respond to the diverse needs of consumers and the community the rights and responsibilities of consumers are respected and promoted to the community, consumers, carers, clinicians and other health service staff, as required by the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, 2019) consumers are actively invited to provide feedback on their experiences of care services learn from and act on the feedback on clinical care and service delivery as provided by consumers in order to make improvements consumers are provided with the opportunity and information to fully participate in organisational processes for planning, monitoring and improving services consumer participation processes are monitored for their effectiveness in empowering consumers to fully partner in their care complaints are responded to compassionately, completely and in a timely fashion, with feedback provided to all parties about the action resulting from their input issues arising from complaints are analysed, reported and used to improve care and services. For an overview of all contact pathways please refer to Contact Information . 28 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL 29 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Workforce and regulation Legislative and regulatory framework COVID-19 vaccination providers should be familiar with the legal and legislative framework which they operate. The information provided in this section is not intended to serve as legal advice. COVID-19 vaccination providers are advised to seek independent advice from legal professionals. Authorisation of workforce The department reviews the workforces available to support the delivery of Victoria's COVID-19 vaccination program and assesses the capacity of existing vaccination delivery models in Victoria. Nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers, who are authorised under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Regulations 2017 (Vic) to administer Schedule 4 poisons, have provisions for the COVID-19 vaccine enabled through the issuing of COVID-19 Secretary Approvals. Other workforces participating in Victoria's COVID-19 vaccine program are authorised through Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 19813. A PHEO enables the Secretary to authorise additional workforces to prepare and/or administer vaccinations for an initial period of up to six months. This can be extended if required. The emergency orders include specific conditions and limitations relating to each authorised workforce. COVID-19 vaccination providers must be clear about the authorisation of their vaccination team members including the conditions and limitations under which they are authorised to prepare and/or administer the vaccine. The successful completion of the required training modules, competency assessments and adherence to these guidelines is included as a condition of the Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. Please refer to the Workforce requirements section for more detail on the authorisations, training, assessment and supervision requirements. COVID-19 vaccination providers are advised to consult closely with unions whose members may be directly impacted by the introduction and operation of this program. Table 1 below lists the professions that are authorised to participate in Victoria's COVID-19 vaccination program. Targeted external consultation has also occurred with a large number of external stakeholders including Victorian health services, professional bodies, unions and universities. PHEOs facilitate possession and/or supply of the COVID-19 vaccine and any Schedule 3 poisons necessary for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions to the vaccine by public/private hospitals, aged care services and disability services and State or Commonwealth contracted agencies in Victoria. The intention of these PHEOs is to facilitate logistical arrangements for both Commonwealth and State led components of the COVID vaccination program. 3 https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/drugs-and-poisons/drugs-poisons-legislation/drugs-and-poisons-act- regulations#:~:text=The%20Act%20and%20Regulations%202017,are%20properly%20trained%20and%20equipped 30 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL The PHEOs and Secretary's Approvals on issue can be viewed from the following link: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers Table 1: Workforces authorised to participate in Victoria's COVID-19 vaccination program Secretary Approval Authorisation Nurse immuniser Approval under Regulation 161 (1) of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Regulations 2017 to possess in order to administer without supervision or instruction.

Verbal or implied consent is acceptable and written consent is not required (although may be obtained in some settings as per local practices). For consent to be considered legally valid, the Australian Immunisation Handbook4 describes the following elements as necessary: It must be given by a person with legal capacity, and of sufficient intellectual capacity to understand the implications of receiving a vaccine. It must be given voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion or manipulation. It must cover the specific procedure that is to be performed. It can only be given after the potential risks and benefits of the relevant vaccine, the risks of not having it, and any alternative options have been explained to the person. 4 https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/ 31 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL The person must have the opportunity to seek more details or explanations about the vaccine or its administration. The information must be provided in a language or by other means that the person can understand. Where appropriate, involve an interpreter or cultural support person. Consent must be obtained before vaccination, after establishing that there are no medical condition(s) that contraindicate vaccination. The Commonwealth Government has developed a consent form that is available from the following link: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/covid-19-vaccination-advice-for-covid-19-vaccine-providers . Further information specific to COVID-19 vaccines, including consumer factsheets, is also available from this website. Discussions, statements and decisions about treatment can be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the person's My Health Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment of the decision-making capacity of the person. Aged care In addition to the above general consent requirements, in an aged care setting, the following should be considered when obtaining consent: Residents must be supported to exercise choice and independence in making decisions; Regard must be had to whether resident capacity is fluctuating or whether it is specific to only certain types of decisions; The information presented may need to be adjusted and tailored to the resident (e.g., consider whether larger font size on documents, provision of a verbal explanation in the presence of family members or undertaking the consent conversation at varying times of the day are appropriate measures for particular residents); and Where appropriate to do so, family members may be involved in the process. In residential aged care facilities, residents often do not have capacity to make decisions regarding medical treatment (although there is a presumption of capacity unless there is evidence to the contrary). Careful consideration must be given to residents' capacity to consent to vaccination particularly where cognition fluctuates and communication in the usual way may be difficult due to physical impairment. In circumstances where there is insufficient capacity, it will be necessary for consent to be provided to the COVID-19 vaccine from a Medical Treatment Decision Maker. This person will often be known to the residential aged care facility and may be a close loved one of the resident. The residential aged care facility, or a staff member of that facility is not able to consent on behalf of a resident who does not have decision making capacity. As the administration of a COVID-19 vaccination is unlikely to be unplanned medical treatment and not required in an emergency, it is recommended that residential aged care facilities make significant efforts to obtain consent from a resident's appointed Medical Treatment Decision Maker prior to turning to alternative Medical Treatment Decision Makers, which are outlined in section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). Disability In addition to the above general consent requirements, in a disability setting, the following should be considered when obtaining consent: Whether the person's capacity is fluctuating or whether it is specific to only certain types of decisions; 32 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Whether reasonable adjustments can be made to the information provided to the person with disability to enable them to understand the COVID-19 vaccination process in order to consent to the treatment; and Where appropriate to do so, family members may be involved in the process. It is sometimes assumed in the disability context that people with disability are unable to make their own decisions in relation to medical treatment. As with all other adults, it should be assumed that a person with disability is able to consent to their own medical treatment, unless there is evidence to the contrary. It should be considered whether adjustments can be made to assist the person to make a decision for themselves in relation to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In the event that a person with disability is unable to consent to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it will not be possible for their facility or carers to consent for them, and the alternate-decision maker process under section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) will need to be considered. Mental health patients In addition to the above general consent requirements, it is important to note that 'mental health patients' being compulsory, security and forensic patients under the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic) are not subject to the alternate decision maker provision at section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). Rather, the alternate decision maker for a mental health patient will need to be determined through section 75 of the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic). As with all adults, whether a mental health patient has capacity to consent to medical treatment needs to be considered in their particular circumstances, and the assumption should not be made that they do not have capacity simply because they are receiving mental health treatment. In relation to children who are mental health patients, there is a particular process for alternate decision makers at section 75(2) of the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic). Children (under the age of 18) For certain procedures, including vaccination, a child or adolescent may be determined to be mature enough to understand the risks and benefits, and thereby provide informed consent. This principle applies to people under the age of 18 years requesting COVID-19 vaccination. In accordance with the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) , a medical treatment decision maker for a child will be the child's parent or guardian or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is reasonably available and willing and able to make the medical treatment decision. For the purposes of the MTPD Act, a child means any person under the age of 18 years. For children or adolescents under the age of 18 years, who are presenting for vaccination without a parent, guardian or other medical treatment decision maker, capacity to consent will be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority. Children assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to the COVID-19 vaccination.5 These principles are enshrined in section 4 of the MTPD Act. Before administering the COVID-19 vaccination to a person under the age of 18 years, the immuniser must assess whether: 5 Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (2011), Consent to medical treatment: the mature minor - available at https://www.racgp.org.au/download/documents/AFP/2011/March/201103bird.pdf 33 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL 1. the child or adolescent understands the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of that decision (that is, they understand an explanation of the information given by the immuniser in a way that is appropriate to the child or adolescent's circumstances, whether by using modified language, visual aids or any other means); 2. the child or adolescent can retain that information to the extent necessary to make the decision; 3. the child or adolescent uses or weighs that information as part of their decision-making process; and 4. the child or adolescent communicates the decision, and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, including by speech, gestures or other means. There is no presumption that a child or adolescent has capacity; therefore, it is important to consider all of the above factors in relation to the child or adolescent's individual circumstances. A child or adolescent should be provided with practicable and appropriate support in making and communicating any decision as to vaccination. This includes: using information or formats tailored to the particular needs of the person; communicating or assisting a person to communicate the person's decision; giving a person additional time and discussing the matter with the person; and using technology that alleviates the effects of a person's disability. Immunisers who are assessing whether a child or adolescent has decision making capacity should take reasonable steps to conduct the assessment at a time and in an environment in which the child or adolescent's decision-making capacity can be most accurately assessed. Immunisers who decide not to administer the COVID-19 vaccine based on their assessment of the individual's capacity to provide informed consent in line with the principles above, should refer the individual back to their medical practitioner. If the child or adolescent refuses a COVID-19 vaccination that a parent and/or guardian has given consent for, respect the child's or adolescent's wishes. As detailed above, discussions, statements and decisions about treatment can be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the person's My Health Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment of the decision-making capacity of the person. For further guidance on 'Consent for COVID-19 vaccination administration in children and adolescents', please view Appendix 9 . This guidance is targeted to vaccination services delivered within schools, state-run vaccination sites, disability services and in-reach programs. Working with Children Checks For the purposes of working in COVID-19 vaccination program, workers are not required to have a Working with Children Check (WWCC) under the Worker Screening Act 2020 (Vic). Organisations may have their own policies about who requires a WWCC, over and above what is required under the Act. A WWCC is recommended but not required for those involved in the vaccination of minors. It may be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. 34 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Keeping and accessing records related to vaccination It is the responsibility of the COVID-19 immunisation provider to ensure that the administration of all vaccination records complies with relevant legislation. Privacy Each COVID-19 vaccination provider should have its own privacy policy. Copies should be readily available to the public upon request, including at immunisation sessions. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must comply with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 and Health Records Act 2001 whenever personal information about clients or staff is collected, stored, transmitted, shared, used or disclosed. Providers should be mindful of client privacy when conducting administrative procedures, collecting personal information and administering vaccines. In addition to the above legislation, the use and management of vaccination records are also governed by the following: Public Records Act 1973 Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 Australian Standards for Record Management - AS ISO 15489 It is important to note that health services are also subject to confidentiality obligations pursuant to the Health Service Act 1988 . A health service must not disclose any information acquired except to carry out functions, exercise powers or disclose information authorised to be disclosed under the Health Services Act 1988 , or another Act. The disclosure of information by a health service is permitted in circumstances where the person to whom the information relates has given their prior consent to the disclosure. All health services should ensure they are aware of their obligation under the Health Services Act 1988 and takes steps, including but not limited to ensuring the notification requirement below are complied with, to ensure that the health service remain compliant with its confidentiality obligations. Privacy notification As routine practice, vaccinees or their guardians should be informed that immunisation information will be passed to Australian Immunisation Register and under what circumstances this information is released. In accordance with the Health Records Act 2001 guardians and adult vaccinees should be given appropriate notice regarding the use of health information collected as part of the immunisation service. Health privacy principle (HPP) 1.4 extracted from the Health Records Act is reprinted below and outlines the information that should be notified to individuals in relation to their health information. At or before the time (or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable thereafter) an organisation collects health information about an individual from the individual, the organisation must take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the individual is generally aware of: (a) the identity of the organisation and how to contact it; and (b) the fact that he or she is able to gain access to the information; and (c) the purposes for which the information is collected; and (d) to whom (or the types of individuals or organisations to which) the organisation usually discloses information of that kind; and 35 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL (e) any law that requires the particular information to be collected; and (f) the main consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the information is not provided. Reporting data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) The Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) is a national register that records vaccinations given to people of all ages in Australia. It is managed by the Australia Government through Services Australia. In 2020, the Australian Immunisation Register Amendment (Reporting) Bill 2020 was tabled to amend reporting advice to the AIR, which previously recommended that vaccine providers only have a discretionary duty to report any vaccinations they administer. As of 1 March 2021, all vaccine providers are required to report influenza vaccinations to the AIR, with all other National Immunisation Program vaccinations to be reported from 1 July. Reporting of all COVID-19 vaccinations is mandatory from commencement of the COVID-19 vaccination program. The following manner and period of reporting will apply: Manner of reporting: electronic or if this is not reasonably practical then in written form Reporting period: within 24 hours, and no more than 10 working days after the vaccination Personal information: Medicare number (if applicable), name, date of birth, gender Vaccine information: brand name, dose number and batch number, date of administration Provider information: provider number, name and contact details More information is available from the AIR website6. Practice management software is required to send data about vaccines to the AIR. If a service provider does not have practice management software or they need to view an individual's immunisation record held on the AIR, they can access the AIR using Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). HPOS can be accessed via an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. Further information about how to register to access the AIR is available from https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/business/services/proda-provider-digital-access Occupational health and safety The Occupational Health and Safety Act 20047 and related regulations aim to keep Victorian workplaces safe. The Act, in conjunction with the Australian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of infection in Healthcare 20198 should guide the development of occupational health and safety protocols for COVID-19 vaccination providers. Providers should maintain up to date, easily retrievable protocols relevant to their scope of practice in immunisation concerning all relevant aspects of occupational health and safety including, but not limited to: blood spills disposal of infectious waste needle stick injuries 6 https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/australian-immunisation-register- health-professionals 7 https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/occupational-health-and-safety-act-and-regulations 8 https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-guidelines-prevention-and-control-infection-healthcare-2019 36 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL medication errors equipment used using multidose vials repetitive strain injury prevention of transmission of infectious diseases in the health care setting safety of interior and exterior of venues where immunisation sessions are held All staff should be familiar with the content of the protocols and how to follow them. WorkSafe have developed the following resources, which may assist vaccine providers to identify potential risks to the workforce. Managing COVID-19 risks in workplaces | WorkSafe Victoria Coronavirus (COVID-19) | WorkSafe Victoria Professional indemnity insurance Service providers, education providers and authorised workforces are required to hold appropriate insurance for the administration of vaccines and provision of a vaccination service. Health professionals, and education providers should consult with their insurance provider regarding insurance appropriate to their circumstances, including the provision of care outside of employer premises or clinical placement providers' premises, as relevant to the insured party/ies. Workforce requirements COVID-19 vaccination providers are responsible for deploying a skilled workforce in sufficient numbers to meet their localised COVID-19 vaccination obligations. This includes adhering to regulatory requirements, which authorise specific professions to perform specialist activities, as well as ensuring staff have completed the appropriate training. COVID-19 vaccination providers must also manage and support staff to run sites safely and efficiently. These requirements are important to deliver vaccinations to priority groups with a consistent client experience across COVID-19 vaccination locations whilst managing clinical and operational risk. These guidelines provide a base level of workforce guidance, which COVID-19 vaccination providers can use to inform their workforce planning. Please also see section Legislative and Regulatory frameworks - Authorisation of workforce for additional detail. Workforces are authorised to perform distinct roles, following completion of essential education and training. These include: a. Possess and prepare vaccine: Includes preparing, reconstituting, labelling, and drawing-up of the vaccine (including multi-dose vial handling). b. Possess, prepare and administer vaccine : Includes the above functions, in addition to obtaining consent (where authorised), administering vaccine, record keeping and disposing of clinical waste. Where a vaccine is prepared and administered by the same person, it is recommended that a second person checks to ensure the dose is correct. Workforces authorised to participate in the COVID-19 vaccination program are classified as: supervising authorised immunisers (also referred to as authorised immunisers) 37 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL emergency authorised workforce COVID-19 vaccination providers must be clear about the authorisation of their vaccination workforce including the conditions and limitations under which they are authorised to prepare and/or administer the vaccine. The successful completion of the required training modules and adherence to these guidelines is included as a condition of the Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. The PHEOs and Secretary Approvals relevant to the COVID-19 vaccine in Victoria are available from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers Note: Under the Commonwealth's Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) COVID-19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service and the COVID-19 Vaccination in Community Pharmacy (CVCP) Program, the workforces eligible for Commonwealth program funding to perform COVID-19 vaccination activities within general practice/primary care/community pharmacy settings may differ from those described within Victoria's Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. Further details on the Commonwealth's programs can be found at Appendix 10 - Information for Victorian general practices providing COVID-19 vaccination services and Appendix 11 - Information for Victorian community pharmacies providing COVID-19 vaccination services and: MBS patient COVID19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service information via MBS Online, available at: http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/News-210302 COVID-19 Vaccination in Community Pharmacy (CVCP) Program details, available at: https://www.ppaonline.com.au/programs/covid-19-programs/covid-19-vaccination-in-community-pharmacies , and vaccine preparation supervisors Supervising authorised immunisers and vaccine preparation supervisors were previously required under Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) to supervise emergency/surge workforces in the preparation and/or administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The relevant PHEOs are now expired and the workforces requiring this supervision are no longer authorised to prepare and/or administer COVID-19 vaccines. Emergency authorised workforces Recognising that sites may need to draw upon other key professions to meet vaccination demand and other healthcare demands, the Department of Health has expanded the list of eligible workforces authorised to possess, prepare and/or administer COVID-19 vaccines in Victoria. Time limited Public Health Emergency Orders detailing specific requirements and conditions have been issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic). The PHEOs and Secretary Approvals relevant to the COVID-19 vaccine in Victoria are available from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers Under the time limited emergency orders, workforces are eligible to participate in the COVID-19 vaccination program where they: hold appropriate registration with their professional regulating body (e.g., Ahpra) or Australian industry or professional association (where specified); successfully complete all mandatory training and assessments comply with all supervision ratios and requirements (see Table 3 and below information of note) 38 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL comply with the version of the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines (this document) current at the time of vaccine administration.

Vaccination site leads should consider the skills, competencies and relevant experience of nurse immunisers and other workforce members in determining those appropriate to engage in the vaccination program targeted at 5-11-year-old children. To ensure consistency of practice, vaccination sites should consider the use of a dedicated workforce for the vaccination of children aged 5-11 years. However, where agency workforces are required, suitably skilled, competent and experienced agency staff should be selected for deployment/placement at sites. Practical training specific to vaccinating children is strongly recommended for any workforce member that does not have experience and/or currency of practice vaccinating children in this age cohort. Workforce requirements for sites administering vaccines to children aged 5-11 years Vaccination sites administering vaccines to children aged 5-11 years must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on-site, who has completed all required COVID-19 vaccination training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. It is recommended that a health professional with qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged 5-11 years are being vaccinated. Authorised immunisers Whilst additional practical training and competency assessment specific to the vaccination of children 5-11 years of age is not mandatory for authorised immunisers , the scope of practice and experience of all staff who will be engaged in administering vaccines to children in this age cohort should be considered. Vaccination providers may determine on a case-by-case basis whether an authorised immuniser has the pre- existing skills, knowledge and experience required to immediately vaccinate children 5-11 years of age, or whether they need to undertake additional training and a competency assessment. Where their experience has not previously or recently included childhood vaccination, it is strongly recommended that the staff member undertake practical training and be able to demonstrate the clinical skills and competencies set out in Appendix 2, Part 2 (Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment) . Examples of situations where additional practical training for authorised immunisers is recommended include: Nurse immunisers that have recently completed an Immuniser Program of Study and do not have experience vaccinating children. Pharmacist immunisers whose individual scope and recency of practice has not included the vaccination of children under 10 years of age. For authorised immunisers, the need to have sign-off of the clinical competency assessment for children will be at the discretion of the clinical leads at each vaccination site. Emergency authorised workforces Emergency authorised workforces are eligible to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5-11 years (within the classification and scope of their authorisation - see Table 3 ). The suitability of emergency authorised workforce should be considered, including their experience as a vaccinator, communication skills, and previous experience working with children. All emergency authorised workforce members who will be administering COVID-19 vaccines to this age group are required to undertake training as set out below, including any additional paediatric specific modules as 42 OFFICIAL part of the Commonwealth COVID-19 training program, onsite practical training, and satisfy the requirements of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment specific to the 5-11 years age group (Appendix 2, Part 3). Emergency authorised workforce members who will be engaged in preparation only of the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 years (i.e. will not be administering vaccinations) are required to complete the any relevant Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program modules, and only those sections of the clinical skills and competencies assessment relevant to possessing and preparing the vaccine (Appendix 2, Part 3 ). Training for vaccination of 5-11-year-old children (refer to Training requirements section for more detail) Online training Required training modules (eLearning): All staff involved in the preparation and/or administration of a paediatric COVID-19 vaccine must complete any relevant additional modules from the Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program available from: https://covid19vaccinationtraining.org.au Practical training Practical training is strongly recommended for any staff member that does not have experience vaccinating children. Examples of practical training include: Mentoring by experienced paediatric vaccinators Attendance at council immunisation clinics Structured training by registered training organisations, nurse educators, etc. Part 3 of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment (Appendix 2 ) may be used as a guide for training purposes. The training of other workforce members at vaccination sites and any associated competency assessment is the responsibility of the relevant Local Public Health Unit or vaccination service provider. Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment ( Appendix 2, Part 3 ) Part 3 of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment outlines the key skills required for vaccinating children aged 5-11 years. This checklist and training certificate must be completed and issued by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised worker for any emergency authorised vaccination staff member prior to vaccinating children aged 5-11 years. Completion of this assessment is strongly recommended for authorised immunisers who do not have experience vaccinating children. Additional training and resources for vaccinating children aged 5-11 years A number of other resources and training packages are available to help upskill the workforce to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to children.

On most occasions, the TGA approval and the ATAGI guidance will align for the approved/recommended patient groups to receive a particular COVID-19 vaccine. This advice should be followed when the TGA approval and ATAGI recommendation(s) do not align . Authorised vaccination workforces should read and understand their individual authorisation requirements (see the department's Information for COVID-19 vaccine providers page for all the COVID-19 vaccine Public Health Emergency Orders and Secretary Approvals). Vaccination service providers should consider the skills, competencies and relevant experience of authorised vaccination workforce members in determining those appropriate to engage in the vaccination program when administering COVID-19 vaccines under these circumstances. Escalation processes must be in place to support safe and timely clinical decision-making. Clinical assessment Emergency authorised workforces must be competent to make a thorough, detailed and documented clinical assessment as to the appropriateness of that particular COVID-19 vaccine to be administered to a person (based on successful completion of the relevant training and competency assessments described below in the Training requirements section and also in Appendix 2 of these Guidelines). If the staff member is not confident in their ability to make a thorough, detailed and documented clinical assessment of the patient under these circumstances, they should escalate their concerns to their supervising authorised immuniser for more education and training, or the assessment to be completed by an experienced supervising authorised immuniser or another trained, competent and confident authorised vaccinator. Informed by best practice clinical guidance If the COVID-19 vaccine is being administered as per the ATAGI guidance, rather than the TGA approval for that particular patient group, the vaccine must be administered in line with best practice clinical guidance current at the time of vaccine administration (i.e., these Guidelines and the specified ATAGI guidance for that particular vaccine in those particular circumstances). Please check these Guidelines regularly for updates and consult the relevant sections of these Guidelines for TGA approval information and the current ATAGI guidance as it is published (see section COVID-19 Vaccine Information in these Guidelines). Informed consent Prior to administering the COVID-19 vaccine under these circumstances, the emergency authorised worker needs to inform the person receiving the vaccine that the administration of [that specific COVID-19 vaccine] 44 OFFICIAL has not been approved by the TGA for the patient group that the person belongs to. It is important that this is clearly conveyed to the patient for them to make an informed decision about receiving that particular vaccine, for that particular purpose. Details of clinical discussions, statements and decisions about treatment should be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the persons My Health Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment as to the suitability of the COVID-19 vaccine. See section Obtaining consent for vaccination for more details about informed consent. Decision aids Clinical decision-making aids may assist the emergency authorised workforces to perform this activity thoroughly and as per legal requirements. They should include an appropriate script or prompts for the authorised vaccinator to convey critical information to the person receiving the vaccine and contain reminders to document the person's consent and decisions about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in the person's health care record. Contact COVID19VPO@health.vic.gov.au for support to identify decision-making aid(s) if these circumstances apply. Training requirements To support each COVID-19 vaccination provider in training its workforce, the department has provided guidance on the pre-requisite training modules, and skills and competencies demonstration required to consider the workforce ready for delivering COVID-19 vaccinations. It is the responsibility of each COVID-19 vaccination provider to: Identify members of the workforce who need to complete pre-requisite training modules Structure a training plan accordingly Confirm and document that training has been completed Ensure staff have the appropriate experience or have demonstrated the skills and competencies to fulfill their role safely within their individual scope of practice. Where the emergency authorised worker (regardless of role) has not previously demonstrated practical competence in all authorised vaccination activities, the supervisor should demonstrate, teach and supervise all authorised vaccination activities, until such time as the worker's supervisor is confident the worker demonstrates practical competence prior to undertaking the authorised vaccination activities. Training activities Training pre-requisites are dependent on the roles and authorisations of different workforces in the program. A summary of training requirements can be found in Table 5 . Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination Training program https://www.health.gov.au/covid-19-vaccination-training-program This mandatory training is available for all COVID-19 vaccination providers. Core COVID-19 training modules cover: COVID-19 introduction Handling and storage Communication and purpose Multi-dose vial (MDV) training 45 OFFICIAL Documentation and reporting Safety and surveillance monitoring and reporting for adverse events following immunisation Additional COVID-19 training modules include specific training for individual brands of the vaccine. Select modules may also be completed by non-clinical staff working in administrative roles. Training verification: User issued with multiple certificates of completion - one certificate for the core modules, and another for each vaccine specific module. Victorian COVID-19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Training Certificate ( Appendix 2 of the Guidelines) The COVID-19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment is to verify that every emergency authorised worker (under a Public Health Emergency Order) is deemed clinically skilled and competent to possess, prepare and/or administer COVID-19 vaccines. This is not a pre-employment exercise and cannot be completed prior to commencing employment. The assessment will be completed as part of the onboarding process, by the COVID-19 vaccination provider. A certificate of completion will be issued upon successful completion (the assessment is only required to be completed once). This checklist and training certificate must be completed and issued by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised worker (for example a pharmacist could oversee the vaccine preparation skills and competencies of a pharmacy technician, or an experienced nurse immuniser could oversee the vaccine administration skills and competencies of a registered nurse). It is only required to be completed once and a copy must be made available to the emergency authorised worker as evidence of their clinical competency in Victoria, available to use across all Victorian health services. To minimise the risk of misplacement and loss, where possible, the worker and employer should keep a digital copy of the assessment when completed. There are three parts to the COVID-19 Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment: Part 1 - Practical training: This must be completed by emergency authorised surge workforces due to the lower baseline level of skills and competency in vaccination. Part 2 - Clinical skills and competency assessment: Must be completed by all emergency authorised workforces Part 3 - Competency for vaccination of children 5-11 years: must be completed by all emergency authorised workforces engaged in preparing or administering vaccines to children under 12 years of age. Workers who are authorised to prepare the vaccine only (not administer) must demonstrate competence in vaccine preparation only. Workers who are administering the vaccine must show competence in both preparation and administration steps. Training verification: This assessment must be completed by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised immuniser. Additional training requirements Vaccination providers may identify other suitable training for vaccination staff. 46 OFFICIAL Training verification It is the responsibility of COVID-19 vaccination providers to verify and document that their workforce has completed the requisite training, and to manage the associated records. COVID-19 vaccinator providers are also required to notify their workforce of any updates to training packages.

For the purposes of these guidelines, all non-clinical staff have been grouped together as supporting administration, logistics and non-clinical workforce. Where appropriate, non-clinical staff may also be trained to observe for adverse effects post-vaccination and escalate to the supervising authorised immuniser who is the designated first-responder. Emergency response COVID-19 vaccination providers are to ensure that they have suitably qualified and experienced workforce available for emergency response. Providers must ensure an appropriate clinical response in the case of an emergency, and must make certain that: an experienced clinician, who is trained and authorised to possess and administer adrenaline, is available on site and able to respond in the case of anaphylaxis following vaccine administration vaccinations can continue regardless of an AEFI sufficient workforce is available to deliver vaccination, supervise vaccination and respond to the AEFI concurrently; and the emergency response is in addition to vaccination supervision requirements. It is recommended that vaccination sites have a designated medical or nurse practitioner to provide oversight and clinical advice, including emergency response to an AEFI. For example, an easily deployed and available Medical Emergency Team (MET) or response team to respond to vaccination sites that are co-located at a health service. Where the medical or nurse practitioner is not available on site, they must be immediately available via phone or video consultation during clinic operational hours. An experienced nurse immuniser must be present on site if a medical or nurse practitioner is only available via phone or video consultation. Managing and responding to adverse events following immunisation and other emergency responses A requirement of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID-19 vaccination providers is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measures in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. Vaccination sites also have a duty of care to respond to other medical emergencies that may occur on site. Vaccination providers should ensure that all staff working at the vaccination site are trained on this procedure including their points of escalation in the case of a medical emergency. COVID-19 vaccination providers can refer staff who wish to complete a refresher in anaphylaxis management to the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). ASCIA Anaphylaxis e-training for health professionals is available online free of charge at https://etraininghp.ascia.org.au/ 48 OFFICIAL Roles and responsibilities In delivering the end-to-end vaccination journey, a mixture of both clinical and non-clinical professions are likely to be mobilised. The exact workforce model will be influenced by individual COVID-19 vaccination providers and site configurations. COVID-19 vaccination providers are to appoint suitability qualified personnel (such as an associate nurse unit manager) to oversee the clinical governance and day-to-day operations of vaccination sites. End-to-end workforce journey The end-to-end workforce journey covers both clinical and non-clinical functions as part of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Its purpose is to assist COVID-19 vaccination providers in identifying the underlying activities that the workforce will perform. These major functions include: Vaccine logistics Client pre-appointment Site management Vaccine preparation Client arrival Pre-vaccination Vaccination Post-vaccination Client follow-up Ongoing site management It is critical that the workforce has visibility over how their activities work together in this end-to- end journey to both enable a smooth client journey, and clearly delineate handoffs between functions.

Prior to commencement, COVID-19 vaccination providers would have signed a declaration form. The site requirements checklists are available from the following Commonwealth Government website: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-site-requirements-for- covid-19-vaccination-clinics Site readiness declarations (covering site requirement checklist items) should be completed prior to a new vaccine clinic being established. The declarations are completed through the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to complete a site readiness declaration through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide 55 OFFICIAL The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual site readiness declarations. Any forms received will be returned. In addition to Commonwealth Government site requirements, COVID-19 vaccination providers may also need to abide by any additional requirements as set out by the department and state legislation, such as training requirements and supervision ratios. Vaccination locations will be run by a registered healthcare provider and will comply with the relevant accreditation and clinical governance standards for that provider (e.g., hospital, general practice, GP Respiratory Clinic, pharmacy setting, community health, ACCHO). It is a requirement of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID-19 vaccination providers is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measures in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. See Emergency response section for further details. In keeping with site requirement 6.1 of the Commonwealth Government's site readiness checklist (https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/02/covid-19-vaccination-site- requirements-for-covid-19-vaccination-clinics.pdf ), all sites must have access to a patient management system and the Australian Immunisation Register via Provider Digital Access (PRODA). For further information about reporting to the AIR, see section Reporting data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) . In keeping with site requirement 6.6.1, all sites must: Have a process in place to confirm record of previous receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine doses (including date and brand of product received) A range of documents can be used to confirm previous receipt including Individual personal record via MyGov / Medicare / My Health Record Vaccination card issued at first encounter Patient management systems Verbal verification Where there is any ambiguity regarding vaccination status, sites should have a process for accessing AIR to confirm records. Where there are ongoing concerns, an appropriate process for clinical escalation should be in place to support decision-making. 56 OFFICIAL Vaccine logistics Data loggers Temperature data loggers should always be used in the transport and storage of COVID-19 vaccines. For information on data loggers, please refer to National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine logistics This section provides information specific to logistics and storage for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech has provided a document titled Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution9, which has been distributed to sites who are administering Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Reference, where appropriate, has been made to where further information can be obtained. 9 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution January 2021 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Figure 1: Vaccine logistics journey for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine Vaccine logistics journey: Provided by the Commonwealth Government 58 OFFICIAL The responsibility of the COVID-19 vaccination provider starts from the point the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is delivered to the site. This includes storage, transfer, handling and administration. The COVID-19 vaccination provider and associated locations must ensure all staff have completed the appropriate training in the storage and handling requirements of the vaccine, in accordance with the training requirements set out by the Commonwealth Government (see section on Training ). Table 8: Summary of the logistics journey 1. Thermal shipper arrival 2. Storage and handling 3. Returning thermal shipper Vaccines arrive in thermal shippers that can be used as temporary storage for up to 30 days, as long as dry ice is replenished upon receipt and there after every 5 days. A temperature range between -90 and -60C is maintained by the thermal shipper. If the vaccine is stored within this temperature range it is not considered an excursion from the recommended vaccine storage condition. The vaccines should be protected from light and kept in the original packaging when stored in a ULT freezer between -80 and -60C. Vials should never be in direct contact with dry ice. During storage vials should remain upright in trays and well secured (preventing movement or rolling around) when transported. If stored between -90 and -60C, vials are stable for up to eighteen months from the date of manufacture. The vaccine vials are made of glass and should be handled with care. A visual inspection must be carried out prior to use. Once removed from trays the vials should be refrigerated between 2 and 8C. When the vaccine has been reconstituted and is ready for use, there should be no evidence of particulate matter. Within 30 days of delivery the thermal shipper and temperature logger must be returned to Pfizer. Instructions for thermal shipper and temperature logger return are available on/with the shipper. Pfizer is responsible for the return of the thermal shipper. 59 OFFICIAL Thermal shipper The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine arrives in a thermal shipper. Each thermal shipper can hold up to 5 vial trays (pizza boxes). Each box will contain 195 vials. More details and specifications on the Pfizer thermal shipper can be found in Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution , p. 5-6. The thermal shipper also comes with a temperature and location tracking device. Once received, the GPS enabled data logger should be turned off by pressing 'stop' on the tracker. Within one hour of pressing the stop button temperature records will be provided. Upon delivery to the health service, it would be the responsibility of the health service to ensure the required temperature specifications are maintained at their site. Ultra-Low Temperature Thermal Shipper Configuration (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine) Vaccine storage On receipt of the thermal shipper from DHL, the health service will need to transfer the vial trays into their own ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezer between the range (-90 to -60C). Alternatively, the vaccine can be temporarily stored in the thermal shipper by replenishing the dry ice on receipts and at 5-day intervals thereafter10. Upon receipt of the vaccines in the thermal shipper, the GPS enabled logger must be disabled and the trays need to be transferred to the ULT freezer within 3 minutes (or within a maximum period of 5 mins). Sites are recommended to use their own temperature monitoring devices if the ULT freezer does not have one. Appropriate PPE needs to be used while handing the vaccine under ultra-low temperature conditions.11 Each thermal shipper with 5 vial trays would weigh around 36.7 kgs. The vaccine storage and stability times are given in the Table 9 below: 10 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution January 2021 p. 12-13 11 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution January 2021 p 7, 11 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Table 9 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine storage and stability 12 13 Storage type/ scenario Temperature range Temperature threshold Time frame Comments ULT freezer -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C Recommended temp = -70\u00b0C Must not go below -90\u00b0C or go above -60\u00b0C.

Further instruction on how to submit vaccine delivery acceptance through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. Any forms received will be returned. Each delivery should come with the following: Dry ice handling insert Safety data sheet for dry ice Return instructions for GPS loggers and the thermal shipper Blank label to cover 'dry ice' label when container is empty, return shipping label, outbound shipping label and contents label on the inside flap. Deliveries without a cold chain monitor should not be accepted. Stock management Stock management reports should be completed weekly through the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to submit stock management reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. Any forms received will be returned. It is critical that cold-chain storage and handling requirements are always maintained and are not breached during the stocktake process. It is recommended that one key person is nominated to oversee the stock management including the cold chain with the support of a backup person in the absence of key person. Facilities should have a process in place to support the required freezer monitoring. Storage in ULT freezers (range -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C) Once the trays are moved to a local ULT freezer at a health service hub, there should be a system to continuously monitor the temperature. Most ULT freezers come with an inbuilt monitoring system which would record the data. Current maximum and minimum temperatures must be recorded at least 4 times per day and whenever they are accessed. The freezer should be connected to a reliable power supply with appropriate electricity back up. 63 OFFICIAL Storage in refrigerators (range 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) Refrigerator temperatures should be stabilised at least 48 hours prior to stocking the vaccine. The use of purpose-built vaccine refrigerators is mandatory. Data loggers are required for the refrigerator to record temperature automatically and should be set to no less than 5-minute intervals. The minimum and maximum temperatures in all refrigerators must be monitored and recorded at least twice daily regardless of the monitoring system used. Please note that the validity of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) is only for 31 days (Pfizer 12+ years) or 10 weeks (all other formulations). Use of coolers for offsite/outreach Coolers should be used only as a last option, as the risk of freezing is high. Coolers are not recommended for more than 8 hours or extreme conditions. Conditions for using icepacks can be found in National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5' | Australian Government Department of Health . Temperature should be monitored and recorded every 15 minutes, or a temperature logger should be used. The temperature must be recorded at least hourly during mobile and outreach immunisation clinics. This includes the current minimum and maximum temperature measured with a digital thermometer. A specialised vaccine cooler is recommended in an extreme climate (environmental temperature is <0\u00b0C or >40C) or for long-term portable storage more than 8 hours. Specialised coolers have thicker walls for insulation resulting in a minimum 'cold life' of 120 hours in temperatures of 43\u00b0C if the lid is not opened. Thawing At the point of delivery, the vials need to be thawed and diluted before use. Once a vial is thawed it should not be re-frozen. Frozen vials should be transferred to an environment of 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C to thaw. Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30\u00b0C for immediate use. Please refer to the Product Information14 for more information. Movement of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine from hubs to other locations Movement of thawed vials The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine can be moved thawed at 2-8\u00b0C. The recommended option is to move the vials from the health service hub to other locations using a portable refrigerated or temperature controlled and monitored container. If hubs do not have the capacity to move the vaccine stock from hub to sub-hubs or any other location, then they may: engage an existing logistics provider used by the health service to move vaccines and other medicines at 2-8\u00b0C, or use the department's logistics provider to move thawed vaccine at 2-8\u00b0C. The department will provide contact details directly to health services. 14 https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210125-pi.pdf 64 OFFICIAL Moderna Spikevax vaccine logistics Vaccine storage and handling All immunisers should follow the principles of safe vaccine storage and cold-chain maintenance to ensure that clients receive effective and potent vaccines. The following are the storage and handling vaccines considerations: All deliveries received at a facility will be accompanied by a cold chain monitor which monitors temperature during transit and detects temperature excursions outside acceptable requirements for the vaccines. Deliveries must be checked and stored promptly without delay. Deliveries without a cold chain monitor should not be accepted. Instructions for unpacking the vaccines are provided by the logistics provider depending on the delivery model being used. The vaccine comes ready to use once thawed. Providers should confirm that the syringe containing the dose is not cold to touch prior to administration to minimize discomfort from receiving an injection of a chilled product. This vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products or diluted.

The three vaccines have different handling requirements, which means reducing any confusion is very important. Storage in the same fridges may be more of a concern than storage at the same hospital or facility however can be overcome with good clinical governance standards and processes. Please note: the packing for the pre-filled single dose vaccine is significantly larger than the previous Moderna Spikevax Bivalent. You will not be able to store the same quantity of doses/vaccines in your Vaccine Fridge. To reduce confusion and dose mishandling, ATAGI recommends the following: Clear standard operating procedures and clinical governance standards with good workflow and processes that are clearly separated and defined. Adequate training, supervision and quality controls in the hubs with experiences immunisation teams/supervisors, Separate teams and outreach clinics using each/different vaccines. Use of a single vaccine brand on any outreach (i.e., administration of 1 vaccine for any remote venue). Further to the above, the below suggestions can assist sites to reduce the risk of administration errors and vaccine wastage when sites are managing different COVID-19 vaccines. Incorporating dedicated morning or afternoon sessions for one type of the COVID-19 vaccine and/or schedule, e.g., Friday morning for Moderna booster doses Assigning dedicated booths or staff members at the vaccination site, to administer only one type of the vaccine and/or schedule e.g., Immuniser A administers Pfizer booster dose only. Some sites e.g., pharmacies may have the facilities to store different COVID-19 vaccines in different fridges or different shelves, to clearly distinguish between COVID-19 vaccine types. Ensuring clear labelling of the shelf/location where each type of vaccine vials is located, to reduce the risk of selection error e.g.,are located, to reduce the risk of selection error e.g., Moderna vials stored in fridge 1 or Paediatric Pfizer vials stored on shelf 2. Stock management Stock management reports should be completed weekly through the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to submit stock management reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. Any forms received will be returned. It is critical that cold-chain storage and handling requirements are always maintained and are not breached during the stocktake process. It is recommended that one key person is nominated to oversee the stock management including the cold chain with the support of a backup person in the absence of key person. Facilities should have a process in place to support the required freezer monitoring. 73 OFFICIAL Cold chain management Vaccines management guidelines are contained within National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 Receipt of vaccines on delivery Step What to do Complete 1 Vaccines must be received by immunisation staff who are educated in cold chain management. 2 Check the temperature monitoring device. 3 Check that the vaccine consignment matches the delivery invoice. 4 Sign the delivery docket and return it to the courier. 5 Place the vaccines in a purpose-built vaccine fridge with a data logger and minimise the time that the vaccine fridge door is open. 6 Rotate vaccines so that the stock with the earliest indication for use is used first. 7 Do not remove vaccines from their packets - this protects them from light and temperature fluctuation. 8 Document vaccine delivery and record and reset fridge temperatures Identifying a cold chain breach A cold chain breach may happen when vaccine is stored outside the recommended temperature range. Any service storing vaccines must have a strategy for dealing with cold chain breaches. In case of a power failure or fridge breakdown, a backup plan should be practiced by all key personnel. Alternate purpose-built vaccine fridges/coolers should be able to contain the full vaccine stock supply. The time and temperature must be recorded as soon as practicable after the breach commences. For information on storage and stability, please refer to Table 9 for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, Table 11 for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and Table 12 for Novavax vaccine logistics. Any temperature recorded outside the recommended temperature ranges is a cold chain breach. Reporting a vaccine cold chain breach Vaccine stored outside of the recommended storage requirements is considered a vaccine cold chain breach. The following actions must be implemented: Quarantine affected vaccines within appropriate cold chain conditions Label 'Do not use, do not discard' Complete a Cold Chain Breach (CCB) reporting form and email it to the VOC at COVID19VaccineOperationsCentre@Health.gov.au If advised to discard vaccine follow the reporting guidance in the Vaccine Wastage section below 74 OFFICIAL Patients who are inadvertently administered a cold chain breached vaccine: A cold chain breached vaccine that has been administered inadvertently is consider a vaccine administration error. SAEFVIC must be contacted: 1), and complete SAEFVIC online report form . For all other non-COVID-19 vaccines affected by a cold chain breach, go to Cold chain breach reporting and follow the directions. Vaccine wastage Vaccine wastage can be due to cold chain breach, underutilised stock at end of session, damage to vials or vaccine passing expiry date. Reporting vaccine wastage Less than 5 vials (minor wastage) In the event of a potential or actual wastage incident (e.g., damaged vials, breach of cold chain requirements), that is less than 5 vials , a site must discard the vaccine in the biohazard clinical waste container. For general practice and other Commonwealth-funded vaccine providers, report wastage less than 5 vials through the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS). Further instruction on how to submit minor wastage reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide . 5 or more vials (major wastage) In the event of a potential or actual wastage incident (e.g., damaged vials, breach of cold chain requirements), that exceeds the threshold (5 or more vials at a time), a site must \u00b7 Notify the Commonwealth VOC immediately on 1800 318 208 \u00b7 Report wastage of more than 5 vials through the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS). Further instruction on how to submit minor wastage reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID-19 Order Management - User Guide . Strategies to manage a power outage or refrigerator breakdown with vaccine stock All COVID-19 Vaccination Clinics should have a site-specific Emergency Planning and Response Tool/ Policy including procedures to manage cold chain during extreme weather events, planned or unplanned power outages, or other service disruptions. Cold chain breach steps Immediately isolate the vaccines and prepare to transfer them into temporary monitored vaccine storage, if necessary. Start conditioning ice packs/gel packs. Keep vaccines refrigerated between 2 and 8\u00b0C for as long as possible, and label them 'Do not use' while preparing to transfer them. Do not discard any vaccine until advised to do so by either the State or Commonwealth Government. Take steps to correct the problem and to prevent it from recurring. 75 OFFICIAL Record fridge temperature issues and actions on the minimum/maximum vaccine refrigerator temperature chart at: https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/04/national- vaccine-storage-guidelines-strive-for-5-vaccine-fridge-temperature-chart-poster-strive-for-5-vaccine- fridge-temperature-chart-poster.pdf Equipment required: A back-up purpose-built vaccine fridge for a refrigerator breakdown (if feasible onsite) A sign reading 'Keep the fridge door closed and do not use vaccine until further notice' Sufficient number of ice packs / gel packs to place in the fridge and cooler/s Insulating material such as bubble wrap/cardboard to cover the glass door of the fridge Cooler/s to fit the vaccine stock (see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 , Section 9.3 How to pack a cooler ) Polystyrene chips/bubble wrap to protect the vaccine stock from the icepacks and allow air circulation in the cooler A battery-operated digital minimum/maximum thermometer with a temperature probe and external display, for use in a cooler or an alternative fridge A data logger for use in a cooler or an alternative fridge. (For more information on data loggers, pleases refer to National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 ) Alternative vaccine storage in the event of a power failure may include any of the following: A monitored purpose-built refrigerator offsite, for instance at a local hospital or pharmacy - ensure that an agreement has been put in place with the relevant organisation before the event, and also consider that this organisation may be affected by the same power failure Cooler/s - each facility should ensure that they have sufficient coolers for an emergency Action during a power outage for vaccines in the purpose-built refrigerator: Place a sign on the door of the fridge 'Keep the fridge door closed and do not use vaccine until further notice'. Insert icepacks in empty spaces in the fridge to maintain the temperature Place the battery-operated digital minimum/maximum thermometer temperature probe into a vaccine box in the middle of the fridge Place the external display of the min/max thermometer on the outside of the fridge to limit the need to open the door. Ensure the data logger is near the temperature probe Lock the fridge door if possible Closely monitor the refrigerator temperature Prepare the cooler for vaccine stock transfer 76 OFFICIAL Remove ice packs/gel packs from the freezer: Place the number of packs you require for your cooler on the bench to 'sweat' (see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 Section 9.2 for information about conditioning ice packs/gel packs). Place the ice packs/gel packs in your cooler to chill the inside of the cooler. Remove the ice packs/gel packs from the cooler and place insulating material (bubble-wrap or polystyrene chips) in the bottom of the cooler. Reset the minimum/maximum thermometer and insert the thermometer probe inside an empty vaccine box with the product information intact. Make sure the minimum/maximum temperature is between 2 and 8\u00b0C at the time the vaccines are placed in the cooler. If the temperature rises to 8\u00b0C (less than 9\u00b0C) move vaccines to a prepared cooler. Actions when vaccines are transferred into a cooler: Place the vaccine stock in the cooler with the box containing the thermometer probe and the data logger in the center. All vaccines should remain in their original packaging until they are administered or returned to a purpose- built vaccine refrigerator \u2014 this prevents damage from exposure to light and ambient temperature. Surround the vaccines with polystyrene chips or bubble wrap and place conditioned ice packs/gel packs on the top before closing the cooler. Ensure that vaccine stock is not in direct contact with the ice packs/gel packs, to minimise risk of freezing. Close the cooler lid and fix the digital thermometer display to the outside of the cooler. Keep the cooler out of direct sunlight. Record the date, time, and minimum and maximum temperatures on the temperature chart now. Then record temperatures at the following times: - every 15 minutes for the first hour - hourly thereafter, provided the temperatures are stable. Note: Freezing vaccines occurs most commonly in the first 2 hours of storage in a cooler. Ensure that ice packs/gel packs do not become displaced and have direct contact with vaccines \u2014 this may freeze the vaccines and render them unviable. Remove vaccines from the cooler only as they are required. Only move vaccines back to a purpose-built vaccine refrigerator in which the temperature is between 2 and 8\u00b0C. Ensure that all vaccines are packed and monitored in the cooler with a digital minimum/maximum thermometer and data logger. Do not transport vaccines to another vaccine refrigerator, cooler without a minimum/maximum thermometer or data logger to monitor the temperature. Do not place vaccines in a domestic refrigerator (including bar fridges) as they are not designed to store vaccines and must not be used. 77 OFFICIAL If at any time the temperature goes outside the recommended temperature range do not use or dispose of vaccine. See section on Reporting a vaccine cold chain breach. Power restored - what to do When power is returned: Record the minimum and maximum temperatures for the fridge. Reset the min/max fridge temperatures once the temperatures are in the 2 to 8\u00b0C range. If the temperature readings are outside 2 to 8\u00b0C, do not use or discard vaccine. Monitor the fridge closely (e.g. hourly) to ensure that the temperature is consistently stable, then return to twice-daily monitoring. Please see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 for cold chain management checklists. Transporting doses for home visits When transporting Pfizer, Moderna or Novavax COVID-19 vaccines for a home visit, there are 2 options: Where possible, transport the vial at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 6 hours, and draw up the dose at the site of administration. A pre-drawn dose in a syringe can be transported if it can be appropriately stored (protecting from light and maintaining the cold chain) and can be administered as soon as practicable and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 1 hour if at room temperature, and within 6 hours if at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

IPC precautions and work practices are to be maintained by all staff, in all settings, at all times. Standard precautions include (but is not limited to): hand hygiene use of personal protective equipment (PPE) safe use and disposal of sharps waste management aseptic technique routine environmental cleaning. Further IPC advice can be found in the department's COVID-19 infection control guidelines https://www.health.vic.gov.au/covid-19-infection-control-guidelines and the Australian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection in Healthcare (2019) <https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about- us/publications/australian-guidelines-prevention-and-control-infection-healthcare-2019> The following are general IPC recommendations for vaccination hubs: There should be a supervisor or someone who is designated to be responsible for overseeing IPC practices, including monitoring correct PPE use by staff and checking appropriate storage and stock levels of PPE. There should be separate points of entry and exit for clients, with a one-way flow for people being vaccinated. Display signage at the entrances and throughout vaccination clinics, to remind staff and clients of IPC precautions (for example, use of masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing). All set-ups, for example between vaccination stations and where people wait after being vaccinated, should allow for physical distancing of 1.5 metres. Each vaccination bay/workspace should have alcohol based hand rub and a securely mounted sharps bin. Attestations for staff and visitors prior to entry to confirm that they are symptom free and not a close contact of an exposure site or case of COVID-19. Staff working across different sites should do so in accordance with current public health directions.

Preparation and dosage information for Pfizer (12 years; Purple cap vial) COVID-19 vaccine Preparation and dosing The TGA uses the Product Information as guidance. The administration advice from the PI is as follows: This is a multidose vial (0.45ml) and must be diluted before use. After dilution, one vial contains 6 (six) doses of 0.3 ml of vaccine. In order to extract six doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and / or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle each dose must contain 0.3 ml of diluted vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 ml, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. For further information on the use of multi-dose vials for COVID-19 vaccines see the following ATAGI advice: ATAGI guidance on the use of multi-dose vials for COVID-19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health 88 OFFICIAL Dosing Intervals The latest recommended ATAGI interval between two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 5 years old is 8 weeks. If the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is administered later than the recommended interval, no vaccine doses need to be repeated. Please note that administration of the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine less than 21 days after the first dose must be reported to SAEFVIC as an administration error. Call the SAEFVIC online report form . If a dose has been inadvertently given before the minimum 3-week interval, it is not currently recommended that the vaccine dose be repeated unless the interval was less than 14 days, ATAGI has provided further guidance regarding a repeat dose after an unacceptably short interval of less than 14 day For further information see ATAGI clinical guidance on replacement doses for invalid primary courses of COVID- 19 vaccines, see ATAGI clinical guidance on replacement doses for invalid primary courses of COVID-19 vaccines and ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine administration errors Preparation and dosage information for paediatric Pfizer (5 -11 years; Orange Cap) COVID- 19 Vaccine Preparation and Dosing The administration advice from the product information is as follows: This is a multidose vial (1.3ml) and must be diluted before use. After dilution, one vial contains 10 doses of 0.2 ml of vaccine. To extract ten doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used.

These include children with the following or similar conditions: - Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the ATAGI advice on 3rd primary doses of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised - Bone marrow or stem cell transplant or chimeric antigen T-cell (CAR-T) therapy' - Complex congenital cardiac disease; - Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease; - Type 1 diabetes mellitus; - Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions; or - A disability that require frequent assistance with activities of daily living, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). The recommendation is for 2 primary doses, except for those with severe immunocompromise who require 3 primary doses. The recommended interval between each dose is 8 weeks. ATAGI does not currently recommend vaccination for children aged 6 months to <5 years who are NOT in the above risk categories for severe COVID-19. The recommended dose for this age group is 25 micrograms. Where possible, it is preferable to separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7-14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination though, however, can be given as required after for any discomfort or fever.

ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Product information The TGA has provided Product Information on Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. Preparation of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine Each multidose vial contains 10 doses of 0.5 mL. One dose (0.5 mL) contains 5 micrograms of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and is adjuvanted with Matrix-M. The vaccine comes ready to use. Do not dilute. An overfill is included in the vial to ensure that a maximum of ten (10) doses of 0.5 mL each can be extracted. Each 0.5 mL dose is withdrawn into a sterile needle and sterile syringe to be administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual dose Do not mix the vaccine in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Novavax COVID-19 vaccine dosing and interval Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. The recommended interval between the first and second dose is 3-8 weeks. Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax. Providers can consider extending the interval between 2 primary doses of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine to 8 weeks (from a minimum of 3 weeks) to potentially improve effectiveness and reduce any potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. There is no data available on the interchangeability of Novavax with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the primary vaccination course. Individuals who have received a first dose of Novavax should receive the second dose of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine to complete the vaccination course. ATAGI recommends that Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be administered as part of a heterologous (mixed) primary schedule to people who have received one or more doses of another COVID-19 vaccine, including as a third dose for people with severe immunocompromise. If AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given as a first dose to a person aged under 18 years, Pfizer, Moderna or Novavax COVID-19 vaccines should be used for the second dose. See Clinical recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health Please note that administration of a dose of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine at less than the recommended interval must be reported to SAEFVIC as an administration error. 101 OFFICIAL Call (1300 the SAEFVIC online report form . If a dose has been inadvertently given before the minimum interval of three weeks, it is not currently recommended that the vaccine dose be repeated. ATAGI advises that the absolute minimum interval between the first and second dose is 14 days to be considered valid as fully vaccinated in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). ATAGI has provided further guidance regarding a repeat dose after an unacceptably short interval. The most commonly reported reactions include headache, paraesthesia, chest pain, fatigue and dizziness. To date, no safety signals have been identified for Novavax COVID-19 vaccine based on this limited number of reports. Paraesthesia is an unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation, and has also been reported for other COVID-19 vaccines. It is not known why paraesthesia sometimes occurs after vaccination, but it is thought it may be a stress-related response to immunisation rather than an immune reaction.

Patient Information Safety considerations for in-home COVID-19 Vaccination For operational and clinical safety considerations to support in-home COVID-19 vaccination model/s, please refer to Appendix 15 Safety Considerations for in-home COVID-19 vaccination 102 OFFICIAL Primary course of vaccination A primary COVID-19 vaccine course consists of two doses of the following COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia: Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines; or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (which is registered but not available in Australia). ATAGI continues to recommend a primary course of vaccination against COVID-19, followed by a booster dose for those eligible, even in individuals who have had past infection. Adults who have already been infected with an Omicron subvariant and vaccinated with 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine are at lower risk of reinfection and hospitalisation compared to those who have been infected but not vaccinated. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Mixed schedules of these vaccines are also included in the definition of an acceptable primary course, as are additional TGA-recognised vaccines . Key definitions Terminology Definition Thirdprimarydose Refers to an additional COVID-19 dose required as part of the primary course to reach a comparable (optimal) level of protection. Generally, provided to those with significant immunosuppression(short interval after 2nddose e.g.,2 months). On 8 October 2021, ATAGI recommended that individuals with severeimmunocompromisehave a third doseof a COVID-19 vaccineas part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure optimalimmune response. 2023 booster dose ATAGI recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults in the following groups, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received: o All adults aged 65 years and over o Adults aged 18-64 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises the following groups should consider a 2023 booster dose if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received, based on an individual risk benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. o All Adults aged 18-64 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19 o Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises that a booster dose is not recommended at this time for children and adolescents aged under the age of 18 who do not have any risk factors for severe COVID-19. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Up to date status To be considered up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, you must have completed all the doses recommended for your age and health status. . See defining 'up-to-date' status for COVID-19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health 103 OFFICIAL Third primary doses for severely immunocompromised people People with immunocompromising conditions or therapies have been recognised as being at increased risk of severe outcomes due to COVID-19. Those aged 6 months and over who have immunocompromise or are taking immune-weakening treatments should be vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for those who are immunocompromised. Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are not live COVID-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains a virus which cannot replicate or spread to other cells and does not behave like a live virus. There is no reason to expect a higher rate of safety issues with either COVID-19 vaccine in those who are immunocompromised. ATAGI recommends the use of a third primary dose for individuals who are severely immunocompromised from 6 months and above. Antibody testing is not recommended to assess for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following COVID-19 vaccination including in immunocompromised people. For details on the eligibility and indications for a third primary dose, see ATAGI recommendations on the use of a third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - COVID-19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - Provider guide to COVID-19 vaccination of people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health Timing of third primary doses Third primary doses can be administered 2 months after the 2nd dose. In exceptional circumstances, ATAGI advises that a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd primary dose, may be considered (e.g, anticipated intensification of immunosuppression). Vaccine preference for third primary dose ATAGI recommends that it is preferable to use the same brand for all doses of the primary course, an alternative brand can be used for the second/third dose if a patient is unable to access or declines another dose of the same brand . An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) or the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be used for this third dose. Please note that Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be administered as part of a heterologous (mixed) primary schedule to people who have received one or more doses of another COVID-19 vaccine, including as a third dose for people with severe immunocompromise. There is very limited data on the immunogenicity and efficacy of Novavax as a third dose in people with severe immunocompromise. See Appendix 12: Third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine for for severely immunocompromised . 104 OFFICIAL Booster doses (These recommendations replace previous ATAGI COVID-19 vaccine booster advice) ATAGI 2023 booster advice* Age At risk** No risk factors <5 years Not recommended Not recommended 5-17 years Consider Not recommended 18-64 years Recommended Consider 65 years Recommended Recommended *mRNA bivalent booster preferred; for ages in which a bivalent vaccine is not approved, use a vaccine approved for that age group . A 2023 booster dose should be given 6 months after a person's last dose or confirmed infection. **Includes those with a medical condition that increases the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (refer to ATAGI clinical guidance ) or those with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities which increase the ri sk of poor outcomes from COVID -19. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care ATAGI recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults in the following groups, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received: o All adults aged 65 years and over o Adults aged 18-64 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID- 19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises the following groups should consider a 2023 booster dose if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received, based on an individual risk benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. o All Adults aged 18-64 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19 o Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises that a booster dose is not recommended at this time for children and adolescents aged under the age of 18 who do not have any risk factors for severe COVID-19. Regarding vaccine choice, all currently available COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to provide benefit as a booster dose, however bivalent mRNA booster vaccines are preferred over other vaccines. These include: Pfizer Original/Omicron BA.4/5, as well vaccine can be co-administered with influenza and other vaccines. Administration of a 2023 COVID-19 booster dose should aim to occur prior to June 2023 and at a time of 6 months or greater following the most recent COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection. 105 OFFICIAL Ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 infection rates and clinical outcomes, new variants, and vaccine effectiveness will inform future recommendations for additional booster doses. Potential risks of a COVID-19 booster dose For people aged under 65 years, the decision to have a 2023 COVID-19 booster dose in the coming months should take into account an individual's age, risk factors for severe COVID-19, number and timing of previous doses or previous infection, and risk factors (predominantly age) for myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination. Adolescents and younger adults have a lower age-related risk of severe COVID-19, and a comparatively higher risk of myocarditis following vaccination. The risk of myocarditis is highest in people aged 16-30 years (peak 16- 18 years), and is higher in males than females12-14. The risk of myocarditis appears to be lower after COVID-19 booster doses in comparison with dose 2 of the primary course and is lower following Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as compared with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in some contexts14,15. See COVID-19 vaccination - Guidance on myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccines for more information. Vaccine choice Any age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine, including original (ancestral virus-based) vaccines, are expected to boost neutralising antibodies and thereby provide additional protection against any infection and longer lasting protection against severe disease. However, most immunogenicity studies have shown a trend towards BA.4/5-based vaccines inducing higher neutralising activity against Omicron subvariants (including BQ.1 and XBB) than original vaccines or BA.1- containing vaccines4,16-18, although a few studies reported similar neutralising antibody titres when comparing the responses to different vaccines19. Early published and preprint data on whether these increases in neutralisation activity translate into measurable differences in clinical protection suggest a small advantage in vaccine effectiveness with bivalent vaccines over original vaccines in preventing hospitalisation and death20,21. However, further confirmatory studies are awaited. Early data suggest that the vaccine effectiveness of BA.1- based bivalent booster vaccines is similar to ancestral-based booster doses, but potentially with slower waning of protection6,22. For more information on which vaccines are available for each age group refer to the COVID-19 vaccine doses and administration webpage . Note:Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccines are only registered for use in people aged 18 years and over. The Pfizer bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4/5 vaccine is registered for use from 12 years of age. There are currently insufficient data to determine the timing of any additional future COVID-19 booster doses. However it is likely, as with influenza vaccine, that regular doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be needed to maintain immunity against SARS-CoV-2 over years to come, particularly for those at highest risk of severe disease. ATAGI will continue to monitor data on the duration of protection from booster doses, as well as on new circulating virus variants or subvariants, and will provide updated vaccine advice as required. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care For children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with risk factors for severe illness, a booster dose may be beneficial; decision-making around booster vaccination should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. The risk of severe disease with current high population levels of hybrid immunity in children and adolescents aged 5-17 years without risk factors is now considered to be lower than when previous ATAGI booster advice was issued. At present, most at-risk children aged 6 months to <5 106 OFFICIAL years who have received a primary course have done so within recent months and a booster dose is not recommended at present. Regarding vaccine choice, all currently available COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to provide benefit as a booster dose, however bivalent mRNA booster vaccines are preferred over other vaccines. These include: Pfizer Original/Omicron BA.4/5, as well 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care ATAGI clinical guidance for COVID-19 vaccine providers | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Table 1. COVID-19 Booster vaccines Vaccine Age groups Timing Booster dose Additional Information Pfizer 5 years and above The 2023 Booster is recommended for at risk groups* 18 years and over and all adults aged 65+. The booster can be considered for those at risk, 5-17 years, and 18-64 years with no risk factors, 6 months following the last COVID-19 vaccination or confirmed COVID- 19 infection (whichever is the most recent). Booster Timing : 6 months following the last vaccination or 6 months after a confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection, whichever is the most recent and 12 years and above: 30\u00b5g 5 - 11 years: 10\u00b5g Can be administered as a booster irrespective of brand used in primary course.

Novavax 12 years and above 0.5ml (5ug) dose In those aged 18 years and older, can be used as a booster if: person has a contraindication to mRNA vaccine person does not prefer an mRNA vaccine Although not TGA-registered as a booster for 12-17yo, Novavax can be used as a booster if no other COVID-19 vaccine brand is suitable for that person. *Includes those with a medical condition that increases the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (refer to ATAGI clinical guidance ) or those with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities which increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. **For children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with risk factors for severe illness, a booster dose may be beneficial; decision-making around booster vaccination should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. The risk of severe disease with current high population levels of hybrid immunity in children and adolescents aged 5-17 years without risk factors is now considered to be lower than when previous ATAGI booster advice was issued. At present, most at-risk children aged 6 months to <5 years who have received a primary course have done so within recent months and a booster dose is not recommended at present. ATAGI recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults in the following groups, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received: o All adults aged 65 years and over 108 OFFICIAL o Adults aged 18-64 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises the following groups should consider a 2023 booster dose if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received, based on an individual risk benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. o All Adults aged 18-64 years without risk factors for severe COVID-19 o Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs. ATAGI advises that a booster dose is not recommended at this time for children and adolescents aged under the age of 18 who do not have any risk factors for severe COVID-19. The Influenza vaccine can be co-administered with the additional booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. However, if a person is not yet eligible for their 2023 booster dose, influenza vaccine could be given ahead of the additional booster dose.

These have co-circulated without any specific subvariant establishing clear dominance. Numerous immunological studies report reduced neutralisation of new Omicron subvariants by both vaccine-induced and naturally derived antibodies3,4. COVID- 19 vaccines may have a reduced and/or shorter duration of protection against infection from these subvariants compared with older variants, however vaccines (together with hybrid immunity from natural infection) continue 109 OFFICIAL to provide strong protection against severe COVID-19. Of note, early evidence suggests that the newer Omicron subvariants do not cause more severe disease compared with the original Omicron subvariant (BA.1)5. Anticipated benefits of a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose An additional COVID-19 booster dose is anticipated to address waning of protection against severe COVID-19 prior to winter. This will provide an increase in protection against severe illness and protect the healthcare system during a time of high demand. It is recommended to defer vaccination for 6 months following a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this, together with prior vaccine doses received, will boost protection against COVID-19. ATAGI notes that testing rates have decreased and there are likely to have been many people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection within recent months. There are no safety concerns for individuals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine who may have had undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past 6 months. The increase in protection against severe illness from COVID-19 following a booster dose is most beneficial for people at higher risk of severe illness, i.e., older adults and those with relevant medical risk factors6,7. Studies conducted throughout the pandemic, including during Omicron epidemic waves have identified a higher risk of hospitalisation among older adults and adults with immunosuppression or other chronic medical conditions, compared with younger or healthy adults. ATAGI considers a booster dose beneficial for all adults aged 65 years and older. The risk of severe disease increases with each decade of age. With similar levels of hybrid immunity to the Australian population, UK modelling during the Omicron era found that 800 people aged 70 years and above would need to be given a booster to prevent one hospitalisation from COVID-19, compared with 8000 people aged 50 to 59 years and 92,500 people aged 40-49 years10. However, a booster dose may still be beneficial for people aged 5-64 years based on individual circumstances such as underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease. For children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with risk factors for severe illness, a booster dose may be beneficial; decision-making around booster vaccination should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. The risk of severe disease with current high population levels of hybrid immunity in children and adolescents aged 5-17 years without risk factors is now considered to be lower than when previous ATAGI booster advice was issued. At present, most at-risk children aged 6 months to <5 years who have received a primary course have done so within recent months and a booster dose is not recommended at present. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Safety Considerations for vaccinating children aged 5 years and above For information relating to the safety considerations for children aged 5-11 years please see Appendix 14: COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 5-11 years For safety considerations relating to children and adolescents aged 12 and above, please see Appendix 7: Guidance - Considerations for vaccinating children aged 12 years and above Safety Considerations for Booster Dose Vaccinations in Aged Care Facility Outbreaks Vaccination in an outbreak setting is not routinely recommended due to safety considerations for workforce as well as conflicting evidence on the benefit 110 OFFICIAL Booster vaccination may be considered in RACF in outbreak settings on a case-by-case basis where there is high case load and/or morbidity and mortality and the RACF residents and/or staff are due for their booster dose. Consideration should be given to not enter outbreak settings if the workload placed on the facility impacts on other outbreak mitigation efforts Booster vaccines should be given in line with ATAGI advice The decision on which RACF may meet this approach should be made by the relevant Local Public Health Unit. Consultation will also be required with the corresponding health service's in-reach vaccination team. Check the resident's vaccination status prior to administering a booster to ensure they are 6 months post last vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. 111 OFFICIAL COVID-19 vaccine co-administration advice ATAGI recommends that COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered (i.e. given on the same day) with an influenza vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines can also be co-administered with other vaccines including routine childhood and adolescent vaccines if required, however, given the current limited evidence on the concomitant use of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines, providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co-administration with giving the vaccines on separate visits. There is the potential for an increase in mild to moderate adverse events when more than one vaccine is given at the same time. Co-administration or near administration (e.g. within days) with another vaccine may also make the attribution of potential adverse events more challenging. The benefits of ensuring timely vaccination and maintaining high vaccine uptake outweigh any potential risks associated with immunogenicity, local adverse reactions or fever. Providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co-administration with the benefits of giving the vaccines on separate visits. When giving a COVID-19 vaccine and another vaccine, the provider should administer each vaccine in opposite arms (right and left deltoid). If this is not possible, separate the injections by 2.5cm as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook . Vaccinating children aged 6 months to <5 years however, it is preferable to separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7-14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination though, however can be given as required after for any discomfort or fever. Useful resources: Clinical recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines - Timing of administration of other vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health . Co-administration of COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccines On 7 March 2023 The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) updated the current influenza vaccine advice: ATAGI advice on seasonal influenza vaccines in 2023 . Maintaining high rates of vaccination will be essential to protect the Victorian population against influenza. Current ATAGI advice states COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered (that is, given on the same visit) with an influenza vaccine. There is no interval required between COVID-19 and influenza vaccines if given on separate days. This will provide an opportunity for the community to receive both vaccines on the same day and would encourage uptake of both vaccines. For advice on co-administration of vaccines for infants and children please see: ATAGI Clinical recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines - Timing of administration of other vaccines For further information please see the following links: 2023 Influenza vaccination - Program advice for vaccination providers | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care 112 OFFICIAL Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care -Getting vaccinated against influenza - Resource collection 2023 National Immunisation Program influenza vaccination- Early advice for vaccination providers.

There are two vaccines available in Australia for prevention of Monkeypox: the 3rd generation JYNNEOS\u00ae and the 2nd generation ACAM2000TM vaccine. JYNNEOS\u00ae is the preferred vaccine and limited supplies of it have been secured by the Commonwealth and some states and territories. ATAGI advises there is a rare risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis with both ACAM2000 TM and with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, especially in people under 40 years of age and in males. This risk should be considered when deciding the timing of vaccination. It is considered safe to co-administer JYNNEOS\u00ae and ACAM2000 TM with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) purposes only, a spacing of 4 weeks between an MPX vaccine (JYNNEOS\u00ae and ACAM2000 TM) and mRNA (Moderna or Pfizer) or Novavax COVID-19 vaccines should be considered for people with increased risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis. However, the decision to delay administration should be balanced against the need for earlier protection and the potential to miss an opportunity to vaccinate. For further information refer to - ATAGI clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox. 113 OFFICIAL Mixed (heterologous) schedules ATAGI recommends that, if available , the same COVID-19 vaccine brand sho uld be used for the two doses of the primary vaccination course. Third primary doses are currently only indicated for those who are severely immunocompromised . While it is preferable to use the same brand for all doses of the primary course, an alternative brand can be used for the second/third dose primary in select circumstances including if a patient is unable to access or not accepting of a second dose of the same brand . There is emerging data supporting the safety and efficacy of mixed brand schedules. Mixed dose schedules are also appropriate in the instance that a pregnant woman has received first dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine prior to pregnancy and wants to complete this course with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine ( see relevant section on pregnancy ). For medical contraindication or serious adverse events, please refer to the vaccine safety section of these guidelines . COVID-19 vaccination - Clinical advice on the use of a different COVID-19 vaccine as the second dose | Australian Government Department of Health . Additional dose due to second dose administration timing error ATAGI clinical guidance is available on the use of an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose as a replacement dose for an invalid dose in specified scenarios of schedule deviation or vaccine administration errors, including: Giving a replacement dose if a second COVID-19 vaccine dose was given at less than 14 days after the first dose Giving a replacement dose for specified vaccine administration errors resulting in under-dosing This clinical guidance advice is applicable to both homologous and heterologous two dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules, including accepted non-TGA registered vaccines. For further information please see: ATAGI clinical guidance on use of an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose as a replacement dose for an invalid dose in specified scenarios of schedule deviation or vaccine administration errors . ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine administration errors | Australian Government Department of Health Returning from overseas travel Please see the Commonwealth website for COVID-19 vaccine international travel requirements to and from Australia, which includes information on current Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved or recognised vaccines and dosages which are accepted for travel. This is consistent with ATAGI advice on the definition of fully vaccinated: ATAGI advice on the definition of fully vaccinated | Australian Government Department of Health 114 OFFICIAL This definition includes homologous (two doses of the same vaccine) and heterologous (two doses of different TGA-approved or recognised vaccines) schedules. The above referenced ATAGI document also provides vaccination recommendations for individuals returning from overseas travel and who have received: one dose of a TGA-approved or TGA-recognised vaccine only and will need to complete their primary vaccination course within Australia A first dose or a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine that is not TGA-approved or TGA-recognised . For further advice and vaccine recommendations please refer to: COVID-19 vaccination - Clinical advice on the use of a different COVID-19 vaccine as the second dose | Australian Government Department of Health . Even if an individual meets the definition of fully vaccinated for the purposes of international travel, they may not be considered 'up to date' with COVID-19 vaccinations in some states and territories. Therefore, international travellers are encouraged to access Australia's vaccination program to bring their vaccinations 'up to date'. 115 OFFICIAL Considerations for special cohorts Children aged 5 years of age As per ATAGI , all children aged 5 years and above are recommended for COVID-19 vaccination as per advice for children 5-11 years . It is preferred to complete a primary vaccination schedule in children aged 5 years or older with the same brand of vaccine for both doses. Children who turn 6 years old between doses should receive the dose that is applicable to them on the day of vaccination. Pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding - COVID-19 vaccination considerations (Please note: some of this information maybe superseded by new ATAGI advice for early 2023 COVID-19 booster doses and will be updated shortly) As per ATAGI mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) are the recommended COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant and breast-feeding women. This is based on the growing body of evidence supporting the safety of mRNA vaccines in pregnancy, whereas there are still very limited data on the safety of the other COVID-19 vaccines (AstraZeneca and Novavax) in pregnancy. However, people who cannot access an mRNA vaccine can consider vaccination with the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine if the benefits to the individual outweigh the potential risks. Women who received their first dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine and are pregnant can receive a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for their second dose, which is preferred. Pregnant women should speak with their health care provider about the best choice for them. Pregnant women with severe immunocompromise are recommended to receive a 3rd primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Women aged 16 years or older who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and had their primary course at least 6 months ago are recommended to receive a booster dose . This includes severely immunocompromised people who had 3 doses as part of their primary course . Pfizer (for those 16 years and older) Moderna Bivalent) (for those who are 18 years and older) COVID vaccines are the preferred vaccines for the booster dose, regardless of the COVID-19 vaccine that was given for the primary course. Those considering a booster dose during pregnancy should speak to their health professional for consideration of whether to proceed with a booster dose. COVID-19 vaccination may provide indirect protection to babies by transferring antibodies through the placenta (during pregnancy) or through breastmilk (during breastfeeding). For more information, please see the COVID-19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy Please see the below statements from ATAGI and Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Obstetricians (RANZCOG) Joint statement between RANZCOG and ATAGI about COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women | Australian Government Department of Health 116 OFFICIAL RANZCOG - COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women and those planning pregnancy . Individuals with previous COVID-19 infection If a person tests positive to COVID-19 they should not receive a COVID-19 vaccine dose until they have recovered from the acute illness and are 6 months post infection. There is no need to provide a negative PCR test or serology following an acute infection, prior to vaccination. ATAGI recommends people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection should wait for 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection before they receive their next COVID-19 vaccine (whether primary vaccination course or booster). The next scheduled dose should be given as soon as possible after this period. Waiting for a 6-month period after infection before COVID-19 vaccination is intended to optimise protection for that person. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection. This change in recommendation applies to all people who are recommended to receive COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., from 6 months and above, as eligible), regardless of how many COVID-19 vaccine doses they have received. It does not apply to other vaccines (for example, influenza vaccinations) which can continue to be administered as usual. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies can be used for treatment in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or as pre or post -exposure prophylaxis. When given following infection, ATAGI does not recommend a specific minimum time to defer vaccination due to monoclonal antibody therapy. However, people are still recommended to follow guidance to defer vaccination for 6 months following infection As with all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccination should be deferred in people who are acutely unwell (e.g., acute febrile or systemic illness). People with prolonged symptoms from COVID-19 beyond 6 months should be vaccinated on a case-by-case basis. For further information on medical exemptions see ATAGI Expanded Guidance on temporary medical exemptions for COVID-19 vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health Serological Testing for immunity Testing for anti-spike antibodies or neutralising antibodies to demonstrate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated individuals is not recommended. An immune correlate of protection has not yet been established for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological testing or other testing to detect current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 is neither necessary nor recommended before vaccination. Serology testing should not be used to determine the need for a third primary dose. Individuals requiring sedation On 6 April 2022 ATAGI released a statement on advice for use of sedation to assist in the safe administration of COVID-19 vaccines. See, ATAGI advice on use of sedation for COVID-19 vaccination 117 OFFICIAL In most cases, sedation should not be used as a first line option. Many individuals with anxiety or behavioural disorders can be safely vaccinated in the community using non-pharmacological techniques, such as a low-sensory stimulation environment, presence of comfort person/object, distraction with music, video or toys, relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy (for anxiety/needle-phobia). Possible indications for sedation include people with severe anxiety or needle-phobia and developmental or behavioural disorders, where non-pharmacological measures to facilitate vaccination have been exhausted. The choice of sedative agent and the degree of sedation required will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis. A tiered approach initially using non-pharmacological measures may assist in facilitating vaccination. In patients where non-pharmacological techniques have failed, sedation may facilitate safe administration of vaccines in some special circumstances. Informed consent must be obtained prior to each dose from the patient themselves, or, where the patient does not have capacity to give consent, from the parent, guardian or substitute decision-maker. Sedation should not be used as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements. Other Cohorts Please refer to the below guidance and shared decision-making resources in relation to certain cohorts at higher risk of disease. Frail Older People including those in Residential Aged Care Facilities Please refer to the COVID-19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for frail older people, including those in residential aged care facilities .

Safety Updates See: weekly TGA safety report Medical contraindications The medical contraindications to the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine outlined below are as per the ATAGI Clinical Guidance on COVID-19 vaccine 120 OFFICIAL Contraindications to Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines A contraindication to one mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be considered a contraindication to other COVID-19 vaccines made with that vaccine platform. For example, a person who is contraindicated for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine would also be contraindicated for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Contraindications to Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are: anaphylaxis to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) any other serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines (and without another cause identified) that has been reported to state adverse event reporting programs and/or the TGA, and has been determined following review by, and/or on the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be a contraindication to future doses, taking into account whether repeat vaccine doses would be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event. People who have myocarditis or pericarditis following Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may still be able to receive further doses following a risk assessment. Please refer to ATAGI guidance for further details. Contraindications to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine Anaphylaxis after a previous dose Anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polysorbate 80 Any other serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (and without another cause identified) that has been reported to state adverse event reporting programs and/or the TGA, and has been determined following review by, and/or in the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be a contraindication to future doses, taking into account whether repeat vaccine doses would be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event. Consultation with a specialist is required to assess for potential vaccine-induced adverse events and to inform future vaccination options. Suitable specialists include immunologists or immunisation specialist services. For further information on contraindications, see ATAGI guidelines: COVID-19 vaccination - ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine in Australia in 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health Precautions For details on precautions to the COVID-19 vaccines, please see the brand specific product information linked below and the COVID-19 vaccination - ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine in Australia in 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax. Providers can consider extending the interval between 2 primary doses of Novavax to 8 weeks (from a minimum of 3 weeks) to potentially improve effectiveness and reduce any potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. For further information see individual product information for each vaccine: Product Information* Spikevax (Moderna) elasomeran (AstraZeneca) Product Nuvaxovid (Novavax) Product Information 121 OFFICIAL Information (no longer available) Thrombosis with Thrombocytopaenia Syndrome (TTS) A link has been established between the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (no longer available) and a rare but serious side effect - thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS). TTS can cause long-term disability and death. TTS involves blood clotting (thrombosis) combined with low platelets (thrombocytopenia). The risk of TTS appears to be higher in younger people, hence ATAGI advises an alternative to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is preferred for people under 60 years of age. People aged under 60 years can still receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine if the benefits outweigh the risks and they provide informed consent. ATAGI statement on revised recommendations on the use of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, 17 June 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health COVID-19 vaccination - Weighing up the potential benefits against risk of harm from COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca | Australian Government Department of Health When to suspect TTS Consider TTS in a patient who has received AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine 4-42 days prior to presentation, and: 1. has signs or symptoms of thrombosis (see below for manifestations) or 2. has signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, e.g. petechiae, noting platelet count may be normal in early stages. Possible presentations of thrombosis in TTS include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), thrombosis in the vein thrombosis (DVT) and arterial thrombosis. TTS symptoms and signs TTS can present variably. Signs and symptoms to look out for can be seen below. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST): Headaches related to a CVST diagnosis have been described as starting any time following AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine, and may initially respond to simple analgesia (e.g. paracetamol or ibuprofen). What makes them different to the common, expected headache is that they are persistent beyond 48 hours or appear later than 48 hours after vaccination, and they may progress to have some unusual features, such as: o Signs or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (e.g. headache worse when supine or associated with nausea and vomiting) o Neurological deficit (e.g. blurred vision, dysarthria, altered mental status or seizures) Abdominal (splanchnic): Variable presentation and can be asymptomatic. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom, accompanying symptoms may include gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or constipation, or fever. DVT: Lower limb pain, redness or swelling PE: Sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath 122 OFFICIAL Arterial ischaemia: Limb coldness or signs/symptoms of myocardial ischaemia or stroke Thrombocytopenia: Petechiae, purpura, acute onset bleeding (e.g. nose, gums).

Guidance on the identification and management of TTS is available from the Thrombosis and Haemostasis Society of Australia and New Zealand Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia (ITP) In Australia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been reported in less than one in every 100,000 people following the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. In many cases ITP is mild with up to a third of people having no symptoms at all, or only minor bruising. However, about 5% develop severe bleeding. We encourage people to seek medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms that could suggest ITP, such as unusual skin bruising or clusters of small red or purple spots that do not lose their colour when pressed. Unusual bleeding is another sign, for example bleeding from the nose or mouth that is hard to stop, or blood in the urine or stools. For more information and up to date reports on suspected ITP post COVID-19 vaccination, please review COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) MVEC- Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia People who develop immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) within 42 days after receiving AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine should consult a haematologist whether to proceed with the second dose using the same or an alternative vaccine, and the timing of the second dose. For further information see COVID-19 vaccination - ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine in Australia in 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health Myocarditis and Pericarditis The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation ( ATAGI) highlights that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the rare risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. COVID-19 Vaccination continues to provide protection against severe disease and risk of hospitalisation. mRNA vaccines ATAGI reports a small increased risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in people vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, compared with unvaccinated people. This risk is higher with Moderna than with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that the severity of the myocarditis and pericarditis cases differs when comparing Moderna and Pfizer Myocarditis is more commonly reported after the second dose in males under 40 years, however these conditions can occur in any gender, and after any dose, including a third or fourth dose. Non mRNA vaccines 123 OFFICIAL AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (no longer available to order or administer) may also be associated with a small increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, though this risk appears lower than with Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax. Providers are recommended to extend the interval for the primary schedule to 8 weeks between dose one and two for Novavax For further details and rates of myocarditis/pericarditis post mRNA COVID-19 vaccination refer to Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines TGA - COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety reports Precautions People with a history of any of the following conditions can receive a COVID-19 vaccine but should consult a GP (General Practitioner), immunisation specialist service or cardiologist about the best timing of vaccination and whether any additional precautions are recommended: 3. Recent (i.e., within the last 3 months) myocarditis or pericarditis 4. Acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e., with evidence of active inflammation) 5. Acute decompensated heart failure Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to be recommended as per latest COVID-19 vaccine adverse events | Australian Government Department of Health for people with a history of most chronic cardiovascular conditions and can be given to people in the following groups without any specific precautions: Coronary artery disease Myocardial infarction Stable heart failure Arrhythmias Prior history of rheumatic heart disease Kawasaki Disease Congenital heart disease An implantable cardiac device Cardiomyopathy Cardiac transplant recipients Myocarditis and/or pericarditis occur very rarely in younger people aged 11 years or younger. At present there is no clear attributable risk of myocarditis an/or pericarditis from the COVID-19 vaccines in this age group Vaccination ATAGI's interval recommendations to potentially reduce risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis: - Pfizer,Moderna and Novavax: 8 week interval between dose one and dose two (particularly for males aged 12 to 39 years) If people are moderately to severely immunocompromised, at risk of severe disease or aged 65yrs and over: 124 OFFICIAL - A shorter interval between first and second dose is acceptable Pfizer and Novavax - down to 3 weeks Moderna- down to 4 weeks (Note: Moderna vaccine primary doses phased out for ages above 5 years. Moderna Bivalent BA. 4-5 is approved as a booster dose in those 12 years and over (if eligible), and Moderna Bivalent BA. 1 as a booster in those 18 years and over) Symptoms Symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis generally, appear within 1-5 days of vaccination. The majority of cases myocarditis reported after COVID-19 vaccines have occurred within 1-5 days (median 2 days). Symptoms include those in the table below and individuals with these symptoms in the days post vaccination should seek urgent medical care. Myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination can present with atypical features such as absence of chest pain or presence of abdominal pain or other non-specific symptoms. It is important to consider myocarditis in the differential diagnosis if someone presents with ongoing non-specific symptoms in the 1-2 weeks following a COVID-19 vaccine. Chest pain is less common in children and adolescents. Younger people with myocarditis and pericarditis may present with symptoms that are non-specific. Investigation and Management Guidance on assessment of children or adolescents presenting with chest pain following an COVID-19 vaccine is available at: www.predict.org.au/mrna-chest-pain-guideline/ Initial investigations can be performed in primary care if: - Patient is not acutely unwell and has mild symptoms - Referring practice can obtain and review all results of initial investigations within 12 hours Patients with significant clinical suspicion of myocarditis and/or pericarditis should be immediately referred to ED. Treatment is determined on a case-by-case basis and often supportive treatment is all that is required. 125 OFFICIAL After a diagnosis of myocarditis and/or pericarditis, cardiology follow up will be required for at least 12 months. Future vaccine dose recommendations For people who have had confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis attributed to a COVID-19 vaccine, further doses should be considered on a case-by-case basis with a cardiologist or specialist immunisation service, and usually deferred until they have been symptom-free for at least 6 weeks Refer to COVID-19 vaccination - Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health MVEC - Myocarditis and Pericarditis Other pharmacotherapy associated with myocarditis Some patients will be taking prescribed medications that have myocarditis listed as an uncommon side effect (e.g., antipsychotic drugs and biological chemotherapeutic agents). Treatment with these medications does not constitute a contraindication to vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination is the greatest protection an individual can have against severe COVID-19 disease, and mRNA vaccines remain the preferred option in Australia for those under the age of 60. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug used in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. If a patient develops myocarditis in close proximity to the initiation of clozapine, this may preclude its use for the patient in the future. Clozapine-induced myocarditis tends to present early after commencement, generally within the first 2 - 8 weeks of therapy. Therefore, given the small increased risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination it is recommended that clozapine is not commenced within 21 days of an mRNA vaccine, to avoid uncertainty about the precipitant of the myocarditis diagnosis. For clinical considerations for clozapine myocarditis refer to Clozapine - induced Myocarditis - Monitoring Protocol . If clinicians are aware that an individual uses recreational stimulant, they should discourage patients from the use of these stimulants, especially in the week following their mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Chest Pain Guideline - PREDICT Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) There is growing evidence of a possible link between GBS and the AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine (AZ no longer available) following rigorous investigations of safety data by the TGA and other international regulators. In response to rare cases following vaccination, warning statements about GBS have been added to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Please see the Product Information for more detail. 126 OFFICIAL Current data on GBS associated with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can be found at: COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) MVEC - Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) We encourage people to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms that could suggest GBS. This includes weakness and paralysis in the hands or feet that can progress to the chest and face over a few days or weeks. Capillary Leak Syndrome Cases of capillary leak syndrome following immunisation with the AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine (AZ no longer available) have been reported overseas. As a precautionary measure, the sponsor of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has included a warning in the Product Information about capillary leak syndrome and specifically advise that the vaccine should not be used in people who have a history of this condition. Patients with a past history of capillary leak syndrome should therefore not be vaccinated with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and an alternate vaccine can be considered. COVID-19 vaccine adverse events | Australian Government Department of Health Paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia The potential adverse events paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia have been added to the Product information for the Astrazeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine(AZ no longer available) under adverse effects. Paraesthesia is an unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation, and hypoaesthesia is a decreased feeling or numbness. These adverse events have also been reported for other COVID-19 vaccines. It is not known why they sometimes occur after vaccination, but it is thought they may be a stress-related response to immunisation rather than an immune reaction. Symptoms are usually mild, however, if they persist, people should seek medical attention. Transverse myelitis A warning about transverse myelitis has been included in the Product Information for AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID- 19 vaccine (AZ no longer available) under sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 4.8. This follows a review by the European Medicines Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee(link is external) which concluded there is a reasonable possibility of a causal link to the vaccine. Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder of the spinal cord caused by inflammation and has been reported very rarely following vaccination. It has multiple causes including infection, in particular viral infection, and underlying demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. However, transverse myelitis can present with no known cause, and this occurs at a background rate of 1-4 people per million in the general population. Transverse myelitis develops quickly over hours to days and worsens over weeks. Symptoms include burning, tingling or numbness that starts in the feet, muscle weakness in the arms and legs and, in some cases, problems with bladder or bowel control. These effects can be long-lasting. Health professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms to ensure early diagnosis, supportive care and appropriate treatment, and to rule out other causes. 127 OFFICIAL Vaccine errors Immunisation errors can include errors in vaccine storage, handling, preparation or administration. COVID-19 Vaccination errors resulting in a cold chain breach should be notified to the Commonwealth VOC. The Commonwealth VOC can be contacted on; 1800 318 208 covid19vaccineoperationscentre@health.gov.au COVID-19 vaccine operations | Australian Government Department of Health COVID-19 vaccination administration errors should be reported to SAEFVIC for vaccine safety surveillance review. For more information on submitting a SAEFVIC report please see below; About clinics.saefvic@saefvic.org.au 924 (option 1) Please note that ATAGI has also published the below guidance on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration errors. ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID-19 vaccine administration errors | Australian Government Department of Health If a COVID-19 vaccination administration occurs, we recommend the site follows their health service's existing incident reporting, management, and improvement processes. Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) SIRVA is a rare complication of suspected incorrect vaccine administration into the shoulder and not into the correct site of the deltoid muscle. This can cause a local inflammatory response and damage to local structures within the shoulder joint (e.g. ligaments, tendons) resulting in shoulder pain and a limited range of movement. The onset of symptoms of SIRVA usually occurs within the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. SIRVA can be an extremely painful condition. The pain and limited range of movement can impact a person's ability to perform work, sporting activities and basic activities of daily living. Symptoms can last for days, weeks, months or years. Following investigation, many affected individuals are diagnosed with bursitis, impingement syndrome or ligament tears. The Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) developed an education module on correct vaccination technique and the prevention of SIRVA: MVEC module: Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) and all vaccine providers are recommended to complete this module. To prevent SIRVA, vaccine providers must know: understanding the surrounding structures and how to identify the correct injection site using the anatomical landmarks. the correct positioning of the vaccinee for safe vaccination. the correct vaccination technique and needle length for the vaccine being administered and the age of the vaccinee 128 OFFICIAL Useful resources For information on route of administration, preparing the person receiving the vaccine, positioning for vaccination, vaccine injection techniques, identifying the injection site, and recommended needle size, length and angle, see the Australian Immunisation Handbook - Section on administering vaccines Avoiding shoulder injury related to vaccine administration MVEC administration technique Safety considerations during administration of vaccines Images below are taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook: Avoiding shoulder injury related to vaccine administration - This printable PDF can be printed and displayed as a reminder to vaccine providers and included in educational material for clinical staff. Below outlines steps to administering a vaccine in the deltoid muscle. Steps for safe vaccine administration to prevent shoulder injury related to vaccine administration into the deltoid muscle. Choose the correct needle length For the recommended needle length, see table below from the Australian Immunisation Handbook . Expose the entire upper arm 129 OFFICIAL Find the correct injection site The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in individuals 12 months of age. Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid injection site 130 OFFICIAL Older children and adults can also receive vaccines in the anterolateral thigh and ventrogluteal area if the deltoid muscle is not suitable by suitably trained vaccine providers. Refer to the links below to see the alternative injection sites: Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site on the anterolateral thigh. Anatomical markers used to identify the ventrogluteal injection site Position the individual encouraging them to relax the muscle ( Asking the patient to place their hand on their thigh when sitting can help to relax the deltoid muscle - see the Australian Immunisation Handbook Administration of vaccines for positioning for children and infants). If the skin is visibly clean, there is no need to wipe it with an antiseptic (such as an alcohol wipe). If you use alcohol or other disinfecting agents to clean skin that is visibly dirty, the skin must be allowed to dry before injecting the vaccine. This prevents inactivation of live vaccines and reduces the likelihood of irritation at the injection sit Insert the needle 90 degrees to the skin to the needle hub. Inject the vaccine as per the Australian Immunisation Handbook and dispose of sharps appropriately Cover the injection site with a bandaid / gauze if required / requested 131 OFFICIAL Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) - Reporting and Management COVID-19 vaccination providers should reasonably anticipate three medical emergencies associated with vaccination: fainting, hyperventilation, and anaphylaxis. All clinical staff should have up to date CPR training and immuniser training in managing anaphylaxis response. Steps for managing an adverse event following immunisation An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is an unwanted or unexpected event following the administration of a vaccine(s). AEFIs may be caused by a vaccine(s) or may occur by coincidence (that is, the event would have occurred regardless of vaccination). AEFIs also include conditions that may occur following the incorrect handling or administration of a vaccine. The following documents contain official general advice on managing medical emergencies associated with vaccination: Recognising and treating anaphylaxis18 Managing anaphylaxis | The Australian Immunisation Handbook (health.gov.au) Preparing kit | The Australian Immunisation Handbook (health.gov.au) Anaphylaxis Clinical Care Standard developed by Safer Care Victoria Appendix 3 - Guidance for differentiating anaphylaxis from acute stress response for vaccine providers and emergency departments MVEC resources and video on Allergy and COVID-19 vaccines Fainting and syncopal seizures There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immunisation for children aged 5 years and above compared to children aged 11 years and above. Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. An Australian study19 showed the occurrence of syncope and seizures following vaccination administrating is higher in children and adolescents compared to adults. While most cases of fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating environment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. 18 <https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/resources/handbook-tables/table-recognition-and-treatment-of-ication> 19 Syncope and seizures following human papillomavirus vaccination: a retrospective case series | The Medical Journal of Australia (mja.com.au) 132 OFFICIAL Reporting an immediate AEFI (at place of vaccination) All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code Medically attended events are defined as medical assistance from the onsite clinician, paramedic attendance or transfer to an emergency department or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Serious or unexpected AEFI Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via online SAEFVIC form. Reporting a delayed AEFI (outside place of vaccination) Vaccinees are advised to seek medical attention from their local general practitioner or emergency department should a delayed AEFI occur. Following medical attention, clinicians should report an AEFI to SAEFVIC via usual practices either online www.saefvic.org.au or by phone call (as above). Vaccinees may also choose to report directly via the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 or the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080 or to SAEFVIC. Vaccinees can find more information online at https://saefvic.online/report or by using the QR code. Please refer to Appendix 4 - Factsheet - Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) for a factsheet that can be printed out and displayed for COVID-19 vaccination site staff to easily locate contact information. Managing anaphylaxis and other serious AEFI Serious AEFI such as anaphylaxis is a rare adverse event that can occur after administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. The current incidence of anaphylaxis to a COVID-19 vaccine is estimated internationally to be 7.91 cases per million vaccinations. A component of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID-19 vaccination providers is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measures in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. Vaccination sites also have a duty of care to respond to other medical emergencies that may occur on site. a. Vaccination providers and sites are being asked to review their AEFI management and response plans as required. Vaccination providers should consider the below for each vaccination site: b. All staff working at the vaccination site should be trained on this procedure including their points of escalation in the case of a medical emergency. c. Vaccination sites (including all spoke sites) that refer to a standard emergency response procedure should clearly document how their emergency response applies at their vaccination site (e.g. when a MET call or Code Blue activation is not possible). d. Anaphylaxis kits must be available onsite where the vaccination program is occurring. 133 OFFICIAL e. An experienced clinician, who is trained and authorised to possess and administer adrenaline, must be available on site and able to respond in the case of anaphylaxis following vaccine administration. f. Anaphylaxis training is recommended for all staff administering the COVID-19 vaccination. The recommended training is the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals. g. AEFI involving adrenaline administration, defibrillator use, transfer to hospital care, life-threatening AEFI, or death, require IMMEDIATE notification If vaccination providers have any concerns regarding management and escalation procedures associated with AEFIs, they should contact their performance and monitoring manager.

An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs following administration of a vaccine. All COVID-19 vaccines approved in Australia are safe and most people should be able to be vaccinated without needing a referral to a specialist immunisation service, regardless of underlying comorbidities and this should be discussed with their treating GP and subspecialist as required. Please see the link below for current information: 135 OFFICIAL ATAGI advice on use of sedation for COVID-19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care VicSIS was comprised of five paediatric COVID-19 Specialist Immunisation Clinics. As of 31 December 2022, the adult services have been discontinued, and the paediatric services discontinued 31 January, 2023. As a result, VicSIS will no longer accept referrals for adult vaccination consultations. Our adult VicSIS clinics were located at Monash Health, Austin Health, Barwon Health and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the paediatric VicSIS clinics were located at Royal Children's Hospital, Austin Health, Barwon Health, Monash Health and Western Health. Please consult your healthcare professional for advice on managing vaccinations in populations at risk of AEFI. Vaccinating people who have previously had a serious AEFI A serious AEFI is one that is considered life-threatening. The most serious immediate adverse AEFI is a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. A contraindication to any particular vaccine is previous anaphylaxis to that vaccine or one of its ingredients. People who have had other serious AEFIs may be subsequently vaccinated under close medical supervision. Most states and territories offer an adverse event immunisation clinic where parents or carers can: get advice regarding revaccination receive supervised vaccinations if required Where there is no clinic, there is often a paediatrician or infectious diseases specialist who will assist families Contact your state or territory health department for more information about adverse event immunisation services.

All other pre-requisite training (including the Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program, Victorian COVID-19 eLearning Competency must be completed before the COVID-19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment. There are three parts to this Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment: Part 1: Practical training (some workforces) Some workforces authorised under Public Health Emergency Orders have lower baseline level of skills and competency in vaccination and will require additional training to address knowledge and practical training gaps. Part 2: Skills and competency assessment This is a requirement for all emergency authorised vaccination workforces. It is only required to be completed once and a copy must be made available to the emergency authorised worker as evidence of their clinical competency in Victoria, available to use across all Victorian health services. To minimise the risk of misplacement and loss, where possible, the worker and employer should keep a digital copy of the assessment when completed. Workers who are authorised to prepare the vaccine only (not administer) must demonstrate competence in vaccine preparation only. Part 3: Competency for vaccination of children aged 5-11 years Vaccinating children 5-11 years requires a different skillset to vaccinating adults and adolescents. Any emergency authorised workforce administering the vaccine to children less than 12 years of age must also complete a clinical skills and competency assessment specific to this age group (Part 3).

The mainstay of management is adrenaline. There are no contraindications for the use of intramuscular adrenaline in the setting of anaphylaxis. There are however a number of conditions that can mimic anaphylaxis, such as vagal reactions, anxiety and vocal cord dysfunction. While it can be difficult to distinguish at times between these three conditions, if you suspect anaphylaxis, follow appropriate guidelines from your workplace and transfer to hospital. If there is uncertainty around diagnosis, treatment of anaphylaxis should not be withheld. However, if adrenaline is administered, it is important to reassure the person receiving the adrenaline of the possibility of an alternate diagnosis, but that the adrenaline is being given as it is safe to do so. The possible diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be reassessed at later stage. An adrenaline autoinjector (EpiPen) prescription is not required post discharge following a queried vaccine adverse reaction. To help confirm the possibility of anaphylaxis, a serum tryptase should be taken within 30 minutes to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms and 24 hours after symptoms have resolved. A serum tryptase assists in a retrospective review of the case, guides diagnosis and assists in reassuring the person regarding future vaccinations.

An AEFI can be coincidentally associated with the timing of immunisation without necessarily being caused by the vaccine or immunisation process. Moderate / Unexpected or Serious AEFI On the day reporting to SAEFVIC via any option below SAEFVIC online - www.saefvic.org.au (preferred option) Victorian Coronavirus Hotline 1800 675 398 30 May 2022 152 Appendix 5: Factsheet - AusVaxSafety - Post vaccine survey For advice or queries, please call the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline1800 675 398 Victoria participates in national safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines through AusVaxSafety. Participant information sheet: How will AusVaxSafety monitor vaccine safety? Publicly facing COVID-19 vaccine safety results: AusVaxSafety website After receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, people will be sent a survey that can be used to report any side effects they have experienced. This survey is part of the national safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines. Depending on the survey response, the Victorian Department may follow-up with the patient . COVID-19 immunisation First survey Second survey Final survey (after 2nd dose) 153 Appendix 6: Guidance - clinician's guide to COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer 10th March 2022, Version 1.2 OFFICIAL COVID-19 vaccines Patients with malignancy are at increased risk for COVID-19 [1, 2]. Cases of COVID-19 in patients with haematological malignancy have been associated with high case fatality ratios of up to 60 per cent [2-4]. In addition, COVID-19 positive cancer patients experience more rapid deterioration, have more concurrent infections, have higher rates of intensive care unit admission and need for mechanical ventilation [1, 5]. Australia has secured four COVID-19 vaccines based on different platforms [6]. They are the Pfizer- BioNTech (NOTE:the AstraZeneca longer available to order or ModernaTX MRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine (mRNA) and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) (recombinant protein with adjuvant) vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer Vaccination is an effective strategy to reduce risk and burden of infection in at-risk patients. However, in patients receiving treatment for malignancy, response to vaccination may be impaired due to patient, disease or treatment-related factors [7-13]. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca (no longer available), Novavax and Moderna vaccines do not contain live SARS- CoV-2 and as such do not pose a risk of infection to recipients. Although the initial clinical trials of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have excluded patients receiving anti-cancer therapies, there are now multiple published studies evaluating the use and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer. Immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer is highly variable. Studies suggest high immune response rates in patients with solid organ malignancies with responses comparable to patients without cancer[14]. However, response rates are significantly lower in patients with haematological malignancy, in particular patients receiving active therapy with anti-CD20 antibody therapies [15, 16]. Overall, vaccination associated adverse event rates are lower in patients with cancer[16]. Based on available studies, recent reports and guidance provided by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) [7, 17-25], the following broad principles for COVID-19 vaccination have been developed. Vaccination against COVID-19 is highly recommended. Guidance for clinicians: Vaccine type and response Patients with cancer are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality associated COVID-19 infection. Therefore, vaccination against COVID-19 is highly recommended. Carers and family members of patients with cancer are encouraged to keep up to date with their COVID- 19 vaccination. Vaccines available in Australia do not contain live SARS-CoV-2, therefore do not pose an infectious risk to patients. 154 Vaccine choice, number of doses and timing of vaccination should be guided by the latest ATAGI advice, taking into account patient age, community outbreaks of COVID-19, risks for severe complications from COVID-19 infection and possible vaccine related adverse events. Immune response to COVID-19 vaccination will likely be negatively impacted by underlying disease or therapy and patients should be advised to continue general measures such as hand hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing. Early investigation of respiratory symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses remain vital to guide need for antiviral therapies. Adverse events Local adverse effect (e.g., pain) is the most common reported adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI). Fever is a less common adverse effect following vaccination. Persistent fever for more than 48 hours after vaccination (or fever in association with concerning symptoms (e.g. sweats, rigors) should prompt medical review and investigation for a cause including testing for COVID-19. A rare but serious adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome/vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, has been linked with use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (no longer available), New or persistent symptoms such as severe headache unresponsive to simple analgesia, beyond 3 days following vaccination should prompt medical review. A rare adverse event, myocarditis has been linked with the use of mRNA vaccines. Although rare, it is more likely to occur in the younger age groups. New symptoms such as chest pain within days of vaccination should prompt medical review. Radiation recall reactions have been noted in patients who have received radiotherapy prior to vaccination. These are usually mild. In addition to symptomatic management (analgesia and barrier creams), if this is suspected, please contact the treating radiation oncology team. A serious/severe immediate allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a COVID-19 vaccine or known component (such as polyethylene glycol [PEG] or polysorbate) is a contraindication to vaccination. PEG and polysorbate are also components in some conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (see Table 2 below). Referral for specialised review via the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Service is recommended. Patients should be assessed for whether they have subsequently tolerated other medications containing PEG or polysorbate before referral. Serious or unexpected AEFI Timing of vaccination Where possible, commence vaccination prior to anticipated commencement of myelosuppressive, lymphodepleting therapy or targeted therapies taking into account the need for and timing of subsequent vaccine dose(s). Delaying or interrupting cancer treatment/cycles to potentially improve responses to COVID-19 vaccination is not currently recommended. Where possible, avoid COVID-19 vaccination during anticipated periods of immune nadir (e.g. expected neutropenic nadir) or risk period for immune-related adverse event associated with the specific cancer therapy. Patients on dual checkpoint inhibitor therapy should discuss with their treating physician about the optimal timing of their COVID-19 vaccine in relation to their cancer therapy. If vaccinating during treatment, it would be preferable to vaccinate during the 'off' week during the treatment cycle to avoid potential overlap of treatment-related and vaccine-related adverse events. Defer vaccination if severe neutropenia present (ANC < 0.5 x109/L) until anticipated recovery. Patients have been able to mount an immune response to vaccination 3-6 months following autologous (as early as 2 months) and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Patients could be vaccinated from 3 months following HCT. Use of inactivated vaccines has not been associated with flares of graft vs. host disease (GvHD) and patients with stable GvHD on therapy could be vaccinated for COVID-19. Anti-CD20 antibody therapy is likely to negatively impact response to vaccination. However, with significant risk posed by COVID-19 it would be reasonable to vaccinate during or within 6-months of anti- CD20 with the understanding that protection maybe limited. 155 Special considerations Where possible, avoid COVID-19 vaccination on the same day as intravenous immunoglobulin replacement to minimise confusion around any adverse events. Currently, COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered with the seasonal influenza vaccine. They can also be co-administered with other vaccines if required. However, interval administration of vaccines reduces the potential overlap of local and systemic side effects. If positron emission tomography (PET) scan is planned, discuss recommended timing of vaccination relative to PET scanning with their treating specialist and ensure receipt of recent vaccination is highlighted/communicated to the PET imaging team. Patients who have thrombocytopenia or on oral anticoagulants may develop a haematoma at the injection site. To minimise risk, application of prolonged pressure at injection site recommended. Suitability of vaccination in patients receiving end of life care should be evaluated in line with their goals of treatment/care. Avoid vaccination in a body area where a patient is receiving or has received radiation therapy to (e.g. use contralateral upper limb). Safety and follow up Currently routine measurement of serological response to COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended as there is no established cut-off value which correlates with protection/response. Consider enrolling patient in available immunogenicity studies. Any suspected adverse event following immunisation should be reported to SAEFVIC , the state vaccine safety team based at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), Parkville.

J Allergy 2021. 9(4): - considerations for vaccinating children aged 12 years and above Version 1.6 - 30 September 2022 OFFICIAL Purpose: The following guidance has been developed for COVID-19 vaccination clinics to support vaccinating children aged 12 and above. Overall, the COVID-19 vaccination procedures for children aged 12 and above are same as for adults. Informed Consent For certain procedures, including vaccination, a child (any person under the age of 18 years) may be determined to be mature enough to understand the risks and benefits, and thereby provide informed consent. This principle applies to people under the age of 18 years requesting COVID-19 vaccination. In accordance with the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) , a medical treatment decision-maker for a child will be the child's parent or guardian or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is reasonably available and willing and able to make the medical treatment decision. For children under the age of 18 years, who are presenting for vaccination without a parent, guardian or other medical treatment decision maker, capacity to consent will be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority . Children assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to the COVID-19 vaccination. These principles are enshrined in section 4 of the MTPD Act. Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must verify the minimum eligible age (12 years and above) with identification (ID) or any proof of age document, such as a birth certificate, passport, or school card. Cross-referencing Medicare card details with the Australian Immunisation Register or a letter from the child's general practitioner or school is also acceptable if there is no other 'proof of age' documents available at the relevant time. A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider. Before administering the COVID-19 vaccination to a person under the age of 18 years, the immuniser must assess whether: o The child or adolescent understands the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of that decision (that is, they understand an explanation of the information given by the immuniser in a way that is appropriate to the child or adolescent's circumstances, whether by using modified language, visual aids or any other means); o The child or adolescent can retain that information to the extent necessary to make the decision; o The child or adolescent uses or weighs that information as part of their decision-making process; and o The child or adolescent communicates the decision, and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, including by speech, gestures or other means. 159 Informed consent should take into consideration adverse events relating to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines as described in ATAGI guidance regarding vaccination of adolescents in Australia For further information, refer to Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines . Risks of allergy and anaphylaxis relating to mRNA vaccines- refer to ATAGI Clinical guidance . Administration Recommended injection sites and needle length The injection sites are same for this cohort as adults. Needle length is the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. Supporting those with needle phobia Pain and anxiety associated with vaccine administration can be a source of distress for children and their families. There are a range of techniques that can be used to reduce this pain and anxiety, such as effective preparation, distraction techniques and pain management strategies. See additional resources developed by the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre Post-vaccination observation Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Immunisation is effective and safe. Like adults, some children may experience a reaction to a vaccine. In virtually all cases, adverse events following immunisation are not as serious as the symptoms a child would experience if they were to contract the disease. This cohort is likely to experience the same mild, common and expected adverse events as adults. To 6 March 2022, the TGA has received about 3,800 reports from approximately 3.5 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in 12-17 year olds (noting Moderna has been phased out for ages above 5 years for the primary course and continues to be available for boosters as the Moderna Bivalent formulation for 18 years and over). The most reported reactions are chest pain, headache, dizziness, nausea and fever. More information is available in the AusVaxSafety survey for adolescents. Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. One of the most immediate adverse events in older children is fainting. This can occur before or after vaccination. Refer the Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. Myocarditis is a known but very rare side effect of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. It is usually temporary, with most people getting better within a few days. The risk is higher with Moderna than with Pfizer Children or adolescents and their parents/guardians should be advised of possible symptoms of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after vaccination, which include chest pain, pressure or discomfort, palpitations (irregular heartbeat, skipped beats or \"fluttering\"), syncope (fainting), shortness of breath, and pain with breathing. Symptoms typically start within a few days after vaccination (median 2 days). Myocarditis and/or pericarditis following vaccination can present with atypical features, such as absence of chest pain, or the presence of abdominal pain or other non-specific symptoms. It is important to 160 consider myocarditis in the differential diagnosis if someone presents with ongoing non-specific symptoms in the 1-2 weeks following a COVID-19 vaccine. If children or adolescents experience any of these symptoms after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, prompt medical attention should be sought. Children or adolescents who already have underlying heart dysfunction should seek medical attention for new onset or worsening of pre-existing symptoms following vaccination. Systemic adverse events are more common after the second dose. Concerns about adverse events following immunisation See Vaccine safety for reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Resources needed Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, check that you have the protocols, equipment and medicine to manage anaphylaxis . Always keep an anaphylaxis response kit handy. See Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Please note: The Adrenaline dosing and needle size are same as the adult intramuscular injection Laminated copy of Table. Doses of intramuscular 1:1000 adrenaline for anaphylaxis in After vaccination Laminated copy of Table. Recognising and treating anaphylaxis Workforce training Vaccination hubs should ensure that an experienced immuniser is present on-site, who has completed all required COVID-19 vaccination training and has completed recent anaphylaxis training. Responding to AEFIs - including anaphylaxis is covered in the mandatory COVID-19 training program. Anaphylaxis training is recommended for all staff administering the COVID-19 vaccination. The recommended training is the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals . There is no requirement for staff to be trained in paediatric life support. Vaccination sites should have protocols for the management of serious adverse events including anaphylaxis. There is no requirement for staff to have a Working with Children Check. 161 Appendix 8: Guidance - for people at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) Version 1.0, 16 August 2021 OFFICIAL In some people, COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with prominent constitutional symptoms, such as: vomiting, diarrhoea and decreased oral fluid intake, especially in the first 1-2 days following the vaccine. The impact of associated decreased volume status may lead to decreased blood pressure, postural hypotension and falls, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI). Decreased volume may manifest as decreased urine output with or without an obvious decrease in blood pressure. Some vaccinees may have symptoms and signs of postural hypotension including dizziness upon standing. There is also an increased risk of falls particularly in the frail and elderly. Blood pressure may be found to be lower than usual or there may be a significant drop upon sitting or standing (drop of >20mmHg systolic). Blood tests may show a decrease in the eGFR and a rise in the serum creatinine. In extreme cases, it may precipitate acute tubular necrosis and the need for supportive measures such as dialysis. People especially susceptible to low blood pressure, postural hypotension, and AKI in the setting of dehydration or hypovolaemia include the following groups: The frail, debilitated or cognitively impaired Those using diuretics e.g. frusemide, hydrochlorothiazide, Those using ACE Those using non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Patients with cardiac failure or severe liver disease Patients with existing kidney disease Patients with a kidney transplant How to minimise the risk of dehydration, decreased blood pressure, falls related to postural hypotension, and acute kidney Injury (AKI) It is important to remind those at risk to maintain adequate oral hydration at home when the above symptoms occur and to seek urgent medical attention when vomiting makes this impossible or when diarrhoea is severe. Anti-hypertensives and/or diuretics may need to be temporarily withheld until volume status and blood pressure have improved. An assessment of renal function and other metabolic parameters (various electrolytes) may be necessary in the emergency department along with the need for electrolyte and fluid replacement intravenously. If significant renal impairment develops or there are unusual features such as proteinuria or haematuria noted, review by a nephrologist is strongly recommended. 162 There are reports of glomerulonephritis possibly arising from mRNA vaccines, however these cases are extremely rare, and causality with the vaccines has not been clearly established. Serious or unexpected AEFI See Vaccine safety for reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Reporting a delayed AEFI outside place of vaccination Vaccinees are advised to seek medical attention from their local general practitioner or emergency department should a delayed AEFI occur. Following medical attention, clinicians should report an AEFI to SAEFVIC via usual practices online www.saefvic.org.au . Vaccinees may also choose to report directly via the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 or the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080 or to SAEFVIC. Vaccinees can find more information online at https://saefvic.online/report or by using the QR code. 163 Appendix 9: Consent for persons under 18 years of age - Schools and in-reach programs. Schools, disability services and in-reach programs This document provides guidance for COVID-19 vaccination providers in schools, disability services and in- reach programs in vaccinating an eligible child or adolescent against COVID-19. This document is provided as guidance only and is not to be taken as or substituted for legal advice. All health professionals authorised to administer the COVID-19 vaccine can provide detailed information about a COVID-19 vaccine and obtain informed consent. However, where possible, COVID-19 vaccination providers will use experienced immunisers to provide information about a COVID-19 vaccine and obtain consent for the vaccination of children or adolescents against COVID-19. 'child or adolescent ' in this document refers to any person under the age of 18 years. 'decision maker ' in this document refers to a person with parental responsibilities for a child or adolescent, or a person who holds an authority to make decisions about medical treatment on behalf of a child or adolescent. 'authorised accompanying adult ' in this document refers to an adult attending a vaccination site with the child or adolescent, for example, a grandparent or other family member, or a person with a family-like relationship to the child or adolescent, who is not the decision maker and who meets one of the following criteria: o Has: o written consent from a decision maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated; or o written authority from a decision maker authorising them to give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. o If no written consent or written authority from the decision maker is presented, the health professional can phone the decision maker to: o obtain verbal consent from the decision maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated; or o obtain verbal authorisation from the decision maker that the accompanying adult may give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. o If the health professional is unable to contact the decision maker, the accompanying adult can sign a statutory declaration to validly declare that the decision maker has provided them with the authority to give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. Children and adolescents may present in a range of ways for vaccination. This guidance is to support COVID-19 vaccination providers to ensure they are prepared to manage all scenarios including presentation: with a decision maker; without a decision maker but with an authorised accompanying adult; or without a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult. 164 Where a child or adolescent presents without a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult, they can be assessed for decision-making capacity to provide informed consent in accordance with legal requirements (see section 3 below in this document). Establishing consent in advance of COVID-19 vaccination From a decision maker A clear process should be established to obtain and record consent, or refusal to consent, from a decision maker prior to COVID-19 vaccination of children and adolescents in schools, State-run vaccination sites, disability services, in-reach programs and other COVID-19 vaccination settings. This process may differ depending on the model and the setting but must comply with legal requirements under the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). As part of the process, the decision maker should be provided with adequate information to enable them to make an informed decision about the benefits and risks of vaccinating the child or adolescent against COVID-19. Establishing a clear process is particularly important where the decision maker, child or adolescent has a disability that raises any doubt about their decision-making capacity, or their capacity to clearly communicate their consent to someone who does not know them well. From an authorised accompanying adult Ideally, the decision maker will provide written consent in advance of the day that the child or adolescent presents for COVID-19 vaccination. Where an authorised accompanying adult is attending the vaccination site with the child or adolescent, they should be asked to provide a copy of written evidence either that the decision maker has provided consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, or that the decision maker has authorised the accompanying adult to give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. Written evidence of consent can be a signed COVID-19 vaccination consent form (such as the form of consent in the links at section 6 below) or a letter or document signed by the decision maker clearly and expressly providing such consent. Similarly, authority given by the decision maker for the accompanying adult to provide consent can be in the form of a letter or other document that clearly and expressly provides such authorisation. The authorised accompanying adult should also provide acceptable evidence to verify their identity and their name should be recorded as part of the record keeping requirements set out in section 4 below. Where an accompanying adult does not have written consent or written authority to consent from the decision maker for the vaccination of the child or adolescent they are accompanying, the health professional administering the vaccination can contact the decision maker directly by phone. The health professional can obtain verbal consent from the decision maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, or verbal authorisation that the authorised accompanying adult may give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. The authorised accompanying adult or the child or adolescent can assist the experienced health professional to contact the decision maker. Where the decision maker cannot be contacted by phone on the day of the COVID-19 vaccination, but the authorised accompanying adult verbally states that the decision maker has given them authority to consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, the authorised accompanying adult must be requested to confirm this by signing a statutory declaration stating that they are so authorised. This must be witnessed in accordance with the legal requirements for the making of such declarations, noting that nurses and medical 165 practitioners may witness statutory declarations. All efforts should be made to obtain written or verbal consent from the child's or adolescent's decision maker before resorting to this option. The health professional administering the vaccination is ultimately responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Other staff, including administrative staff, teachers and/or support workers, can help to coordinate this process (for example, by making contact with the decision maker) but cannot obtain that consent. Schools, State-run vaccination sites, disability services and in-reach programs should have systems in place to support this process if required. Children or adolescents in out-of-home care For children or adolescents in out-of-home care, it is the responsibility of the child or adolescent's carer to bring a copy of their child-specific instrument of authorisation or standard authorisation, issued by their Community Service Organisation, to medical appointments as evidence of their authority to give valid consent to immunise the child or adolescent. Children of separated or divorced parents Where parents are separated or divorced, only one parent is required to provide consent unless there is a court order or agreement in place. If a court order or agreement is in place, this generally requires that the parents alert the service or vaccinator that an order is in place, and this may delay the vaccination. If the court order or agreement is in place, the family may attend a Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner or be seen in a specialist immunisation clinic to try to come to a decision together. If there is no court order or agreement in place, and the child or adolescent does not refuse to be vaccinated and the accompanying parent or guardian provides informed consent, the vaccinator may proceed with the vaccination of the child or adolescent, regardless of the views of a non-accompanying parent or guardian. Where a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult has provided consent, but the child or adolescent is refusing vaccination Where a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult has provided consent but the child or adolescent refuses due to anxiety, the person supporting them on the day (their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult), may provide counselling and general support. Where required, the support person is able to support the use of prescribed medication to assist with reducing anxiety or use other behavioural support practices contained in the child or adolescent's behaviour support plan for the environment where vaccination takes place (i.e. school, in-reach settings). Further information is available at: https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/document/2756 . If these strategies are not available or successful, the vaccination should not be administered to the child or adolescent. Vaccination service providers should refer the child or adolescent and/or their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult to their usual medical practitioner, behaviour support service, a specialist immunisation clinic or the Disability Liaison Officer program to explore options that will meet the child or adolescent's needs. This referral may be provided via a written document or via a conversation with the decision maker, if present, or the authorised accompanying adult. 166 Where a decision maker refuses consent If a decision maker refuses a COVID-19 vaccination for a child or adolescent, attempts should be made to understand the reasons and determine if the provision of additional support, tailored to the child or adolescent's needs, would alter that view. Examples may include a one-off vaccination at a different location, vaccination at a drive-through clinic where the child or adolescent can stay in a vehicle, or a home visit by a medical practitioner or nurse immuniser. If additional support is required to facilitate delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination, the child or adolescent and their decision maker (or their authorised accompanying adult) may be referred to a local Disability Liaison Officer and/or a specialist immunisation service to explore these options. If a decision maker maintains refusal for the COVID-19 vaccination following the above provision of support and information, that refusal should be respected unless the child or adolescent chooses to be vaccinated on the day and they are deemed to have decision-making capacity (see section below). In this case, the decision of the child or adolescent should be respected and upheld, even if it conflicts with the views of their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult. Assessing a child or adolescent's decision-making capacity to provide informed consent Where no consent or refusal to consent for a child or adolescent's vaccination can be obtained from the decision maker or an authorised accompanying adult, an experienced health professional must assess whether a child or adolescent has decision-making capacity and can provide informed consent to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. A child or adolescent's decision-making capacity needs to be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority . Children or adolescents assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to vaccination. These principles are enshrined in section 4 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). It is expected that the health professional administering the COVID-19 vaccine will have the appropriate level of expertise to assess a child or adolescent's decision-making capacity in accordance with the Act. In assessing decision-making capacity, the experienced health professional must consider whether the child or adolescent can: understand the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of the decision to be vaccinated; retain that information to the extent necessary to make the decision; use or weigh that information as part of their decision-making process; and communicate the decision and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, including by speech, gestures or other means. The child or adolescent should be provided with practicable and appropriate support in making and communicating any decision. This includes: o using information or formats tailored to the particular needs of the child or adolescent, for example, information may be provided via modified language, visual aids or other means, including using assistive technology, as appropriate; o communicating or assisting the child or adolescent to communicate their decision including by speech, gestures or other means, including using assistive technology; and o giving the child or adolescent additional time to discuss and consider their decision. 167 The experienced health professional must take reasonable steps to conduct the assessment at a time and in an environment in which the child or adolescent's decision-making capacity can be most accurately assessed. When a child or adolescent is assessed as having decision-making capacity When a child or adolescent is assessed as having decision-making capacity, their decision should be respected and upheld, even if it conflicts with the views of their decision maker. When a child or adolescent is assessed as not having decision-making capacity When the experienced health professional assesses that a child or adolescent does not have decision- making capacity, the experienced health professional must determine who has authority to provide consent on behalf of the child or adolescent (i.e. who is their decision maker or an authorised accompanying adult). The school, disability service or in-reach program can assist with this information. If consent for the vaccination of the child or adolescent has not been obtained, the vaccination should not be given. Clinic organisers should refer the decision maker or authorised accompanying adult to the child or adolescent's usual medical practitioner or a specialist immunisation clinic to seek COVID-19 vaccination. Record keeping When assessing a child or adolescent's decision-making capacity, each stage of the decision-making process and the outcome of the assessment should be recorded in the child or adolescent's health care record (for example in their Australian Immunisation Register record and/or the child or adolescent's My Health Record). In the same way that records of the consent provided by a decision maker must be kept, where an authorised accompanying adult has attended the vaccination with the child or adolescent, the name and contact details of the authorised accompanying adult and their relationship to the child or adolescent should also be recorded in the child or adolescent's health care record, along with the form of consent and relevant details of evidence of that consent (for example, the form of the written consent from the decision maker that was presented by the authorised accompanying adult, or that verbal consent was obtained via phone call with the decision maker, or that a statutory declaration was made before consent was provided by the authorised accompanying adult). Working with Children Check (WWCC) For the purposes of working in the COVID-19 vaccination program at State-run vaccination clinics, workers are not required to have a WWCC under the Worker Screening Act 2020 (Vic) if their only contact with children is via the COVID-19 vaccination program, and their work outside of that program does not usually involve direct contact with children. Organisations may have their own policies about who requires a WWCC, over and above what is required under the Act. Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. COVID-19 vaccination providers who are undertaking in-reach vaccination services in school settings in Victoria are likely to require a WWCC. 168 Further information The Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines and related documents and can be accessed from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers .

Commonwealth Government's MBS COVID-19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service requirements The Commonwealth Government's Bulk Billed MBS Patient COVID-19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service provides a fee-for-service payable to general practitioners and 'Other Medical Practitioners' (OMPs) for these practitioners and 'suitably qualified health professionals' to assess patients for their suitability to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 'OMPs' include specialist medical practitioners and consultant physicians working in a general practice setting in their capacity as OMPs. 'Suitably qualified health professionals' refers to a person registered in a health profession regulated under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (also known as Ahpra-registered professionals and students). General practitioners (GPs), OMPs and suitably qualified health professionals who provide a vaccination to a patient must be appropriately trained, qualified and authorised to provide the COVID-19 immunisation to the patient (see section below). This includes having completed mandatory Commonwealth training, and where required by the relevant workforce authorisation(s), Victorian COVID-19 vaccination training and competencies assessment. Note: All health professionals and students administering COVID-19 vaccines must complete COVID-19 vaccination training. This includes nurses administering under the written or verbal instruction of a medical practitioner or other authorised prescriber and healthcare students undertaking clinical placements. Victorian COVID-19 vaccination program requirements Specific requirements for health professionals authorised to prepare and/or administer the COVID-19 vaccine in Victoria, including mandatory training and compliance with the COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines, are outlined in the relevant Secretary Approvals and Public Health Emergency Orders, available at: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers . The information below is a summary of Victorian COVID-19 vaccination program requirements relevant to COVID-19 vaccination in general practice and other primary care settings. Refer to the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines for further detail about health professional training, competency assessment and supervision requirements, including ratios. 171 COVID-19 vaccine administration Medical practitioners and nurse practitioners (within scope) are authorised via Victorian drugs and poisons legislation to administer the COVID-19 vaccine without the need for additional authorisation. Nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers have been authorised through Secretary Approvals to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Victoria. A 'nurse immuniser' is a registered nurse who has successfully completed an 'immuniser program of study' that has been recognised by the Victorian Chief Health Officer and aligns with the National Immunisation Education Framework for Health Professionals and meets all requirements of the ' Secretary Approval: Nurse Immuniser - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) VACCINE '. A 'pharmacist immuniser' has completed an equivalent immuniser program of study and meets all requirements of the ' Secretary Approval: Pharmacist Immuniser - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) VACCINE '. Registered nurses, enrolled nurses (without notation), medical students (third year and above), nursing students (second year and above) and select healthcare professionals have been authorised through Public Health Emergency Orders to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Victoria under ratio-based indirect supervision of a 'supervising authorised immuniser'. Only authorised Ahpra-registered health professionals meet the MBS COVID-19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service requirements and can provide COVID-19 vaccination services in a general practice setting (or designated vaccination premises off- site). A 'supervising authorised immuniser' is a medical or 'pharmacist immuniser'. Supervising authorised immunisers should have the relevant skills and experience to provide supervision to less experienced, and emergency authorised immunisation staff. Please note that enrolled nurses (without notation) and nursing and midwifery students must be supervised by a nurse immuniser, nurse practitioner or registered nurse/midwife with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision as per Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia requirements and detailed within the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines. The COVID-19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service must be billed in the name of the supervising GP or OMP and they must be physically present at the location at which the vaccine suitability assessment service is undertaken and must accept full responsibility for the service. COVID-19 vaccine preparation All workforces authorised to administer the COVID-19 vaccine are also authorised to prepare the vaccine under the same supervision requirements. Training requirements The following training requirements must be completed prior to providing COVID-19 vaccination services. Refer to the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines for full details and definitions in sections: Workforce requirements Supervising authorised immunisers and vaccine preparation supervisors (including Table 2) Emergency authorised workforces (including Tables 3 and 4) noting that only Ahpra-registered workforces are eligible to deliver services as outlined in the MBS Online guidance. 172 Training program: To be completed by: Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program 1.

It is recommended that general practices have a documented process for emergency response to an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), including a pathway for Ambulance Victoria support. Mandatory workforce vaccination COVID-19 vaccination of all staff working in vaccination sites is required. Influenza vaccination is also strongly recommended for all staff and may be a requirement of your employment. Indemnity insurance Service providers and authorised workforces are required to hold appropriate insurance for the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine and provision of a vaccination service. Authorised vaccination staff working in general practice settings, should confirm medical indemnity insurance arrangements with their employer. In some instances, where vaccination is not a part of a healthcare professional's usual scope of practice, the individual's own professional indemnity insurance may not provide coverage for this activity. Employers need to confirm that any staff providing COVID-19 vaccination services are covered by appropriate indemnity insurance.

Commonwealth Government's COVID-19 Vaccination in Community Pharmacy (CVCP) Program The Commonwealth Government's CVCP Program provides a fee-for-service payable to community pharmacies for administering the COVID-19 vaccine. The CVCP Program Rules allow for administration of COVID-19 vaccinations to an eligible patient by an 'Appropriately Qualified Person' under the supervision of an 'Approved Pharmacist'. 'Appropriately Qualified Person' is defined as a person currently holding Ahpra registration who is authorised in accordance with jurisdictional requirements to administer the COVID-19 vaccine in a pharmacy or off-site setting and who has undertaken the mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Training Program. An 'Approved Pharmacist' is defined as a registered pharmacist, noting that in Victoria this must be a pharmacist immuniser (see section below). Victorian COVID-19 vaccination program requirements Specific requirements for health professionals authorised to prepare and/or administer the COVID-19 vaccine in Victoria, including mandatory training and compliance with the COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines, are outlined in the relevant Secretary Approvals and Public Health Emergency Orders, available at: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers . The information below is a summary of Victorian COVID-19 vaccination program requirements relevant to COVID-19 vaccination in community pharmacy settings. COVID-19 vaccine administration Pharmacist immunisers and nurse immunisers have been authorised through Secretary Approvals to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Victoria. A 'pharmacist immuniser' is a registered pharmacist who has successfully completed an 'immuniser program of study' that has been recognised by the Victorian Chief Health Officer and aligns with the National Immunisation Education Framework for Health Professionals and meets all requirements of the ' Secretary Approval: Pharmacist Immuniser - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) VACCINE '.

Pharmacists and select healthcare professionals are authorised through a Public Health Emergency Order to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Victoria. For authorisations relating to preparing and administering the COVID-19 vaccine, the below orders are relevant and available at https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-covid-19-vaccine-providers : Only authorised Ahpra-registered health professionals meet the CVCP Program Rules and can provide COVID- 19 vaccination services in a community pharmacy (or a designated vaccination premises off-site). A 'supervising authorised immuniser' is a 'pharmacist or nurse practitioner. Supervising authorised immunisers should have the relevant skills and experience to provide supervision to less experienced, and emergency authorised immunisation staff. Please note that enrolled nurses (without notation) must be supervised by a nurse immuniser, nurse practitioner or registered nurse/midwife with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision as per Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia requirements and detailed within the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines. COVID-19 vaccine preparation All workforces authorised to administer the COVID-19 vaccine are also authorised to prepare the vaccine under the same supervision requirements. However, pharmacists do not require supervision to prepare the vaccine. Pharmacy technicians are authorised to prepare COVID-19 vaccines under indirect supervision of a pharmacist, pharmacist immuniser or other supervising authorised immuniser. Training requirements The following training requirements must be completed prior to providing COVID-19 vaccination services.

Background On 8 October 2021 ATAGI recommended that individuals with severely immunocompromising conditions were advised to receive a third primary dose as part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure optimal vaccine effectiveness. On 11 February 2022 ATAGI extended this recommendation to immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years. Definition There are three types of additional doses, these are defined in table 1. Table 1: Definition of third primary dose and additional doses Type Definition Third primary dose Refers to an additional COVID-19 dose as part of the primary course to reach a comparable (optimal) level of protection. ATAGI recommend a third primary dose for individuals who are severe ly immunocompromise d. Up to date status To be considered up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, you must have completed all the doses recommended for your age and health status. See defining 'up-to-date' status for COVID-19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health Eligibility Severe COVID-19 in fully vaccinated individuals is very rare. There have been reports of breakthrough infections with COVID-19 in severely immunocompromised individuals who have received a full course of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and these individuals have been found to have absent or low antibody titres despite completing their vaccination. ATAGI considers it important to offer a third primary dose to provide a higher level of protection for these individuals to attain a level as close as possible to that seen in healthy individuals. A third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for all severely immunocompromised individuals as outlined in Table 2, from the age of 5 years. 179 Table 2 - A summary of the eight severely immunocompromised conditions Immunocompromising conditions Active haematological malignancy Non-haematological malignancy with current active treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, but excluding immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors Solid organ transplant with immunosuppressive therapy Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy within 2 years of transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapies Primary immunodeficiency including combined immunodeficiency and syndromes, major antibody deficiency (e.g., common variable immune deficiency (CVID) or agammaglobulinemia), defects of innate immunity (including phagocytic cells), defects of immune regulation, complement deficiencies and phenocopies of primary immunodeficiencies. Advanced or untreated HIV with CD4 counts <250/L or those with a higher CD4 count unable to be established on effective anti-retroviral therapy Long term haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis For details on the eligibility and specific indications for a third prima ry dose refer to ATAGI recommendations on the use of a third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - COVID-19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - Provider guide to COVID-19 vaccination of people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health Timing of third primary dose Third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to eligible severely immunocompromised individuals (see table 2 above) 2 months after their 2nd dose, as per current ATAGI guidance (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2-6 months). In exceptional circumstances where rapid protection is required (e.g., an outbreak setting or a significant increase in immunosuppression related to an urgent addition of an additional immunosuppressant agent), ATAGI considers a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the second and third primary dose to be acceptable. 180 ATAGI advises that it takes at least 2 weeks to generate an adequate immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination should ideally occur at least 2 weeks prior to the addition of a new immunosuppressive agent. Individuals should be advised by their usual treating specialist on timing of the vaccine and usual/new treatment. ATAGI - COVID-19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise Additional considerations mRNA Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are preferred for the third primary dose. Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can also be used, for those 12 years, noting there is limited data of its immunogenicity or efficacy in people with immunocompromise Paediatric formulation of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine must be used for children aged 5 to 11 years (0.2ml (10\u00b5g) per dose) and adolescent/adult formulation used for those 12 years (0.3ml (30\u00b5g) per dose) Moderna COVID-19 vaccine may be used as a third primary dose for children aged 6 months to 5 years, (0.25ml (50\u00b5g) per dose). Where individuals have received 1st and 2nd doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, it is acceptable for AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to be used for the third primary dose if there are no contraindications or precautions for receiving it since the last dose. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not preferred but can be used for the third dose if there are contraindications to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Please note: AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available for order or administration as of 21 March 2023. Mixed (heterologous) schedules Mixed (heterologous) schedules using two different vaccines to complete the primary vaccination course are only recommended in special circumstances such as for those with serious vaccine-attributed adverse events after the first dose and in those who were partially vaccinated overseas with a brand not available in Australia. See also the ATAGI Clinical guidance on COVID vaccine - Mixed (heterologous) schedules for further information on mixed (heterologous) schedules Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) The profile of adverse events after the third primary dose is similar to that of previous doses, and studies have not reported additional vaccine-related serious adverse events. However, these studies were conducted in small numbers of patients, and rare side effects may not have been detected. Monitoring of AEFIs post-third primary dose will continue. Information on possible adverse events after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine should be provided to the patient and carers. Resources for patients receiving a COVID-19 vaccination are available from the Commonwealth COVID-19 vaccination website Patients and carers should be made aware of how to manage of common, minor, expected adverse events, such as the use of simple analgesics for injection site pain, fever, headaches, or body aches, and advised to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. For further information about reporting adverse events please refer to the vaccine safety section . 181 Appendix 13: Mental health toolkit - COVID-19 vaccination 15 June 2022 Version 2 Purpose This is a toolkit to assist clinicians, community health and mental health care providers, and SAEFVIC staff in responding to patients and/or clients who are experiencing an exacerbation of mental illness or psychological distress related to COVID-19 vaccinations. The aim is to help overcome barriers to vaccination by increasing access to COVID-19 vaccines and awareness of existing support services. This toolkit aims to guide clinicians to provide support for those experiencing an exacerbation of existing mental health issues in relation to COVID-19 vaccinations and COVID-19 vaccination mandates. those experiencing new onset of psychological distress in relation to COVID-19 vaccinations and COVID-19 vaccination mandates. Distribution Plan This toolkit is intended to support clinicians, community health and mental health staff; the list of channels through which it will be distributed includes, but is not limited to: SAEFVIC RACGP RANZCP Safer Care Victoria Mental Health Victoria This toolkit may be distributed to a broader audience of health services and organisations if it is deemed to be of value to those organisations. It is not intended for non-clinical members of the public. Overview The Department of Health (DH), SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunisation in the Community) and are receiving increased reports and referrals of exacerbation of mental illness or new onset psychological distress around COVID-19 vaccination and associated mandates. Background VicSIS purpose was to provide specialist immunisation consultations to those who have experienced adverse reactions following a COVID-19 vaccination or are deemed to be at risk of experiencing an adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. VicSIS is not intended to provide specialised mental health services to respond to referrals made for mental illness or psychological distress. This necessitates the provision of clear advice to community health clinicians to appropriately manage and refer those experiencing mental illness or psychological distress related to vaccines to the appropriate services. 182 Vaccine exemptions On 26 November 2021, ATAGI published expanded guidance on conditions regarding temporary medical exemptions to include individuals who are a risk to themselves or others during the vaccination process. This may include a range of individuals with underlying developmental or mental health disorders. However, it is of note that non-pharmacological interventions can safely facilitate vaccination in many individuals with behavioural disturbances and that specialist services may be available to facilitate the safe administration of vaccines in this population. Enablers and Barriers When organising COVID-19 vaccination for those with mental illness or those experiencing psychological distress relating to the vaccinations, it is important to acknowledge the barriers these individuals face. These barriers may result in their delayed uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, however, can be overcome with tools and techniques at the time of vaccination, to ensure a comfortable process. Examples of barriers Examples of enablers A history of mandatory treatment administration can result in long term fear of needles and clinical settings Acknowledge the medical or treatment history of the individual and facilitate a setting for vaccination which alleviates concerns Medical concerns around the vaccine Plain English and CALD community languages for vaccine information Sense of coercion into vaccination Longer appointments can facilitate a supportive environment Misinformation around the vaccines Consider incidental vaccinations and conversation regarding vaccines in a non-threatening environment Mistrust of the government Practical assistance to access vaccination sites Feeling judged by others for not being vaccinated, when reasons for this are beyond individual control Do not treat individuals as a burden Concerns relating to the vaccine have not been addressed Act in a way that responds to people's concerns Fear of medical or clinical settings Provide a comfortable vaccination environment Needle phobia Encourage vaccination in venues which are less overwhelming Making a vaccination booking online or over phone can be challenging for some Practical assistance to make vaccination appointments Families and carers facing challenges in assisting individuals obtaining a COVID-19 vaccination Empower family, carers, and support persons and allow them to accompany vaccinees through the process. 183 Mental Health Services Crisis Support If an individual is at risk of imminent harm to themselves or others, the following services should be engaged.

Vaccination Support Services Safe Spaces for Vaccination General Practice General practitioners are ideally placed to offer individualised care to their patients and provide a calmer environment for vaccination than large vaccine hub sites. General Practitioners can develop patient specific vaccination plans, ahead of the vaccination appointment to minimise distress and optimise the safe provision of this case. Key strategies that can be utilised in primary care are: An individualised patient-centred vaccination plan, developed ahead of the vaccine appointment Not forcing children via physical restraint (which can cause long-term harm) Distraction techniques for children: bubbles, musical toys, phones, vibration/cold sensations Utilising resources available for both children and adults: RCH TV: A child's guide to hospital Meg Foundation (megfoundationforpain.org) Kids Health Information: Podcast (rch.org.au) Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Use clear and simple language Provide support and reassurance Remove distracting stimuli Try not to stop stimulating behaviours (helps alleviate distress) Low threshold to refer to specialist immunisation provider for sedation (especially teenagers) Psychologist support for patients and families In some cases, it may be necessary to refer a patient with severe needle phobia for psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy or exposure therapy. The Australian Psychological Society (APS) website can assist with finding a psychologist with an interest in phobias. Pharmacy Similar to the General Practice setting, pharmacies may provide a calmer, quieter environment for vaccination. For those who experience distress in crowds or long lines, this may be a more preferrable setting for vaccination. 187 Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) Pathway The Disability Liaison Office (DLO) Program, can facilitate a vaccination in a manner that is appropriate for the individual. Those with a disability, a mental illness or a severe needle phobia can access this service to discuss organising vaccination in a way that is most comfortable for them. This can include in-home vaccination. Sedation for vaccination may be considered if more conservative measures have been exhausted or are not appropriate. For general information regarding the DLO Program, see the following website: Vaccination information for people with a disability, carers, volunteers and disability support workers | Coronavirus Victoria This includes a link to the referral form: Request for Disability Liaison Officer Support (Page 1 of 3) DLOs can: Assist with booking a COVID-19 vaccination Assist to organise group bookings for service providers or groups of people with disability Provide advice to vaccine and testing sites on how to improve access for people with a disability or special requirements Assist in facilitating vaccination if a patient is not able to attend a vaccination centre.

Overview Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or experience a mild illness. Those who are symptomatic typically have a short illness and are least likely of all age groups to require hospitalisation or ICU admission for COVID-19. There is an emergence of a rare association of SARS-CoV-2 in children and post infective Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (1 in 2,469 cases) and the post COVID-19 condition called 'long COVID' . International data shows children, adolescents and young adults with underlying medical conditions have an increased risk of developing severe disease and complications when infected with SARS-CoV-2 22. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommends vaccinating children aged 5- 11 years following their evaluation of available data to support its safety and efficacy among this age group. This evaluation considers the direct benefits of vaccination for the child in preventing illness and the contribution vaccination makes to the broader community through reduced transmission levels to family members, in schools, reduction in school and workplace absenteeism and greater protection for older and more vulnerable Australians. Current vaccine policy for children On 5 December 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer COVID- 19 vaccine, for use in individuals 5 years and older. In making this regulatory decision, the TGA carefully considered data from clinical trials conducted in the United States, Finland, Poland and Spain which included participants 5 -11 years of age. The study demonstrated effectiveness by showing that the immune response to the vaccine in children was similar to that seen in older age groups. On 9 December 2021 ATAGI recommended the paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine be administered to all children 5-11 years old. The recommended schedule for vaccination in this age group is 2 doses, 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened in special circumstances to a minimum of 3 weeks, such as in an outbreak response, prior to the initiation of significant immunosuppression or international travel. It is important to ensure preparedness for the specific considerations that children aged 5-11 years will require to be safely vaccinated. 22 Graff K, Smith C, Silveira L, et al. Risk factors for severe COVID 19 in children. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2021; 40: e137-e145. 192 On 12 January 2022 ATAGI stated the dose interval for children at higher risk of COVID-19 (e.g. some underlying medical conditions) may be shortened from 8 to 3 weeks in the context of ongoing community transmission. A list of underlying medical conditions associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 are available in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID-19 vaccines and ATAGI recommendations on the use of the paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 years in Australia (health.gov.au). On 17 February 2022, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for a two-dose schedule of 50g per dose in 6- to 11-year-old children. (Please Note: the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for 6 to 11years has been phased out of the COVID-19 vaccine schedule . Please refer to the following table for vaccine options for 6 to 11 year olds Summary table of COVID- 19 vaccines in use in Victoria ) On 23 February 2022, ATAGI recommended Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6-11 years, (noting this vaccine has been phased out of the program). The recommended schedule for vaccination in this age group is 2 doses, 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 4 weeks, for children at risk of moderate to severe COVID-19 in special circumstances as outlined in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID-19 vaccines On 11 February 2022, ATAGI recommended severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years receive a 3rd primary dose of a mCOVID-19 vaccine, from 2 months after their second dose, in line with other severely immunocompromised age cohorts (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2 to 6 months). More information may be found at Recommendations on the use of a 3rd primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised (health.gov.au) There are approximately 578,499 children between the ages of 5-11 years old in Victoria. Clinical Governance The site specifications outlined in this document are the requirements to deliver a child-friendly 5-11-year-old vaccination program in Victoria. All clinical governance around vaccination remains the responsibility of the vaccination provider as outlined in the Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines and the Victorian COVID- 19 Vaccination Program Service Specifications. 193 Models of Service Children will have different support needs based on their previous experiences and medical history, however, there is a minimum support requirement for all children being vaccinated. The different models of service that are recommended to be available for this age group, based on the level of care needed and possible patient cohorts, can be seen below (Figure 1 and Table 2), as well as a guide to decision making about what level of care a child may need (Figure 2). These models of service are applicable across vaccination delivery models (e.g., drive through, pop-up, in-home vaccination), however they may need to be adapted depending on the setting and resources available e.g., alternative distraction techniques may be required for a drive-through model. Figure 1 - Models of service for COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 5-11 194 Table 1 - Care pathway for COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 5-11 Level Possible cohorts Recommended Requirements Level 0: Foundation Minimum requirements for all children Children with no anticipated additional support needs Safe child-friendly environment (inclusive, healthy, friendly, and protective): Pre assessment to identify care level required Experienced nurse immuniser with adequate paediatric training Availability of COVID-safe activities e.g. stickers, play area, digital devices e.g., tablets Availability of music - white noise apps, parents encouraged to bring devices to play music, speakers Floor and wall decals for directional signage and observation area Parents encouraged to bring toys and distraction from home for child Big screen to display animations and child entertainment material Parent or guardian to always remain with child Children's band aids Activity pack to be given to child as well as fidget toy and stress ball Level 1: Basic As above plus minor additional assistance required Minor behavioural issues Developmental disability or autism normally needing minimal support Previous negative experience with procedures Additional nurse immuniser to provide additional support Extended appointment time Availability of distraction methods Buzzy bee (a bee-shaped distraction device) Cool sense 195 Resources: Needle phobia and sedation guidelines and Safe immunisation holding practices for children with disabilities Please note, mention of VicSIS is historical as this service ceased 31 January 2023 in the below table Anticipated anxiety Viewer devices Virtual Reality headsets (Smiley Scope) Level 2: Intermediate As above plus further support for tailored sites with increased resources (e.g., Children with special needs) If the vaccination team is unable to vaccinate the child using the previous techniques or: History of autism with sensory issues Easily overwhelmed in crowded spaces Moderate anxiety or needle phobia Intellectual disability, developmental disorders or significant physical disability (e.g., cerebral palsy GMFCS V) Additional pre-planning of the vaccination consult Low stimulus \"quiet\" environment Low volume hubs OR sessions Appropriate holding techniques must be used Do not have more than 2 unsuccessful attempts at vaccinating this cohort before aborting and referring to the patient's GP or a DLO (see decision tree).

Dedicated \"quiet\" and low stimulus sessions at vaccination centres to cater for children with a disability Sites should be disability accessible Clearly marked priority queue or entrance for children with disability Involving staff trained in disability support e.g., Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and immunisers who have experience vaccinating this specific cohort. An extended appointment time and single additional nurse immuniser should be provided, as too many people assisting with the procedure may increase anxiety. Minimising the number of staff in the room to only those necessary is important. Appropriate holding techniques can be considered to provide comfort and stability to the child. Forceful holding should never be used. These Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) guidelines provide useful advice in relation to holding techniques and outlines when they are appropriate and when they are not permissible. If immunisation attempts are unsuccessful or the child is flagged as high risk, a referral for to an immunisation specialist may be considered. Refer to MVEC website for further information on options such as sedation and specialist needle phobia clinics. Several resources specific to COVID-19 vaccination for people with autism are available through Amaze. This includes training tools, checklists and social scripts that explain the COVID-19 vaccination process. It is important to recognise when the vaccination shouldn't go ahead. Such indicators include: 1. If the child attempts to leave the room 2. If a child is unable to be settled using the child's usual comfort measures 3. If the child requires holding that requires more than one person or any degree of force 4. If the resources required to complete safe vaccination are unable to be provided 5. If the parent/guardian requests to abandon attempt 6. Vaccination should be aborted after two unsuccessful attempts and the individual should be referred to a DLO for consideration of alternate vaccination models. 198 Procurement Distraction equipment can be purchased from the following providers: 1. Buzzy Bee - https://www.buzzy4shots.com.au/ 2. Coolsense - https://balancemedical.com.au/ , orders to ordering@balancemedical.com.au 3. Viewfinders - or other 4. Virtual Reality Headsets - SmileyScope Note that there is a 1-2-week delay from ordering to arrival of the SmileyScope Virtual Reality headsets. Each headset can be programmed with the most common languages and virtual training on the use of these devices will be provided. Workforce and Regulations Workforce Requirements Vaccination providers must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on-site, who has completed all required COVID-19 vaccination training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. Vaccination providers should consider the competence and experience of their workforce to determine their suitability to vaccinate children. Experienced emergency authorised vaccination staff may be considered suitable to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5-11. These staff should demonstrate competency in administering the vaccine to this age group. A competency assessment will be provided by the department for all emergency authorised immunisers. It is recommended that a health professional who has qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged 5-11 are being vaccinated. A Working with Children Check (WWCC) is recommended regardless of role. Some organisations may have their own policies that require workers to have a WWCC and it may also be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. Training for immunisation staff A MVEC training webinar is accessible through MVEC's Education Portal: https://education- mvec.mcri.edu.au/ Providers may identify staff who they assess to have the relevant skills and experience to vaccinate 5-11- year-olds without further practical training. For example, nurse immunisers that have previously worked in council or paediatric immunisation settings may not require any additional practical training. Further training to other suitable staff and any associated 'accreditation' or competency assessment is the responsibility of the relevant LPHUs / providers. 199 Eligibility confirmation Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must verify the minimum eligible age (5 years and above) with identification (ID) or any proof of age document, such as a birth certificate, passport or school card. Cross-referencing Medicare card details with the Australian Immunisation Register or a letter from the child's general practitioner or school is also acceptable if there is no other 'proof of age' documents available at the relevant time. A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider The child should be clinically assessed, and their details confirmed before administering the vaccine. Review consent forms Undertake pre-vaccination assessment Provide an opportunity for the child and parent/guardian to raise any questions Complete consent and pre-immunisation assessment checklists. Instruct the child and parent/guardian to wait for at least 15 minutes, as a safety requirement, while they are observed for signs of adverse reaction. Provide information on post-vaccination self-care and direct the parent/guardian to read this (Available in a range of community languages if applicable). Informed consent A parent or guardian will be required to provide consent to vaccinate a child (aged 5-11), as the child will not be competent to consent for themselves as per the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) . A medical treatment decision-maker for a child will be the child's parent, guardian, or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is available and willing to provide informed consent for the child's COVID-19 vaccination. Appropriate reading level English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to the children and carers - if resources permit. The health professional administering the vaccination is responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Other staff including administrative staff, teachers and/or support workers can help to coordinate this process (by contacting the decision maker) but cannot record consent. Schools, disability services and in-reach programs should have systems in place to support this process, if required. For more information refer to the additional resources on consent Appendix 9: Consent for COVID-19 vaccination administration in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years . Operational planning and preparedness Creating a child-friendly and safe vaccination site Vaccination providers ensure that vaccination spaces are child-friendly and welcoming. Site planning should also be informed by existing guidance on delivering culturally safe vaccination services. Key considerations can include easy to read information in multiple languages, rapid and on-site access to interpreter services and workforce diversity to support delivery of culturally appropriate care. Consultation 200 with parents of children with disability and from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities informed these recommendations. Vaccine logistics Paediatric dosage of COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (5-11 years; Orange capped vial) On 5 December 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer COVID- 19 vaccine, for use in individuals 5 years and older. In children aged 5-11 years the paediatric Pfizer COVID- 19 vaccine vaccine should be given in a two dose regimen at 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened in special circumstances to a minimum of 3 weeks, such as in an outbreak response, prior to the initiation of significant immunosuppression or international travel. A lower dose (10 micrograms or 0.2 ml) will be given to children aged 5-11 years, compared to that used for individuals 12 years and older (30 micrograms). A child should be vaccinated with the recommended dose based on their age at time of vaccination (e.g., if they turn 12 between dose 1 and 2 they would be vaccinated with an adult dose for dose 2). On 12 January 2022 ATAGI stated the dose interval for children at higher risk of COVID-19 (e.g. some underlying medical conditions) may be shortened from 8 to 3 weeks in the context of ongoing community transmission. A list of underlying medical conditions associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 are available in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID-19 vaccines To deliver the smaller dose, an orange-capped vial will be used to vaccinate children. It will be clearly differentiated from the vial currently used to vaccinate those 12 years and older (purple top). Expected differences in dosing, storage and preparation for adult and paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine can be seen in Table 3. To reduce the risk of vaccine errors the following should be considered: Paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (orange capped vial) can only be used for children 5-11 years Where practicable, paediatric and adult Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine vials should be stored separately in vaccine fridges/freezers. Paediatric and adult Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses should not be drawn up together or the filled syringes stored together. Paediatric and adult doses should be clearly labelled to reduce the risk of errors. Other vaccines should not be stored with the paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Implementation should ensure that the risk of vaccine errors are minimised by specific awareness and training around multi-dose vials for this age group i.e., orange caps. Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine On 17 February 2022, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was provisionally approved by the TGA for a two-dose schedule of 50g per dose in 6- to 11-year-old children. Note: This vaccine has been phased out. Pfizer vaccines are available for this age group. Please see current ATAGI advice. https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/who-can-get-vaccinated/children Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommended COVID-19 vaccines and doses (health.gov.au) COVID-19 vaccine doses and administration | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-recommendations-for-a-booster-dose-of-the-paediatric-pfizer-covid-19- vaccine-in-children-aged-5-to-11-years 202 The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine continues to be available and recommended for 5-11-year-old children. Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine are available for children who are 6 months to 12 years old. Moderna vaccine is available for children 6 months to 5 years if eligible. Booster doses are not currently recommended for those aged below 18 years, but maybe considered for at risk populations. ATAGI 2023 booster advice | Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care 203 Table 4 - Differences between adult and paediatric dosage and preparation of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Source: US CDC, 202123) Further guidance on paediatric storage, preparation, and dosage of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to be provided by TGA and ATAGI. 23 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Pfizer-Pediatric-Reference-Planning.pdf 204 Preparing for vaccination Equipment Access to emergency medical equipment such as Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with paediatric pad/key option, portable emergency oxygen kits, first aid kit, and anaphylaxis response kit should be available on site. Equipment should be regularly checked and maintained in line with the organisation's policy on resuscitation equipment use. Please note that a defibrillator is rarely required in children. Most paediatric life support initially focuses on airway and respiratory management. Recommended injection site and needle length Needle length and injection site are the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid muscle injection site and Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. The solo sitting position is recommended for this age group; however, the cuddle or straddle position may also be considered. Refer to Recommended positioning for children The anterolateral thigh and ventrogluteal area can be used as alternative sites if the deltoid muscle is difficult to access due to distress or injury. Immunisation providers should be familiar with the landmarks used to identify these injection sites and only administer to these sites if they have been suitably trained. Refer to the links below to see the alternative injection sites: Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site on the anterolateral thigh. Anatomical markers used to identify the ventrogluteal injection site Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, ensure that protocols, equipment, and medicine to manage anaphylaxis are available by keeping an anaphylaxisresponse kit handy. Ensure that a printed table with age-based adrenaline dosing is readily available. SeePreparing an anaphylaxis response kit and Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals. Vaccine safety considerations Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Information on possible adverse events after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine should be provided to the child (depending on age and maturity) and parent/guardian. They should be made aware of how to manage common minor and expected adverse events, such as the use of simple analgesics for injection site pain, fever, headaches, or body aches, and advised to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. 205 Fainting and syncopal seizures There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immunisation for children aged 5 years compared to children aged 11 years. Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. An Australian study24 showed the occurrence of syncope and seizures following vaccination administration is higher in children and adolescents compared to adults. While most cases of fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating environment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. Allergic reactions Allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare but need to be closely monitored for. The signs/symptoms of mild to moderate allergic reaction include: rapid onset swelling to face, lips and/or eyes tingling of the mouth hives (urticaria) or welts abdominal pain/vomiting. A mild to moderate allergic reaction may sometimes progress to a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis may include difficult or noisy breathing, swelling of the tongue or throat tightness, wheeze or persistent cough, hoarse voice, pallor, and floppiness (in a young child), or collapse. All immediate (within 4 hours) and generalised symptoms of a possible allergic reaction to a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be reported to SAEFVIC . See ASCIA Guide: Allergy and COVID-19 Vaccination for more information. Myocarditis and pericarditis Myocarditis and/or pericarditis occur very rarely in younger people, including adolescents and children. Myocarditis and pericarditis typically occur within 10 days of mRNA vaccines. The classic symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis can include chest pain, pressure, or discomfort palpitations (irregular heartbeat, skipped beats or 'fluttering'), syncope (fainting), shortness of breath, pain with breathing. Younger individuals with myocarditis and pericarditis may present with symptoms that are more non-specific. Most myocarditis and pericarditis cases linked to mRNA vaccination have been mild and patients have recovered quickly. Longer-term follow-up of these cases is ongoing. 24 Syncope and seizures following human papillomavirus vaccination: a retrospective case series | The Medical Journal of Australia (mja.com.au) 206 The risk of myocarditis appears highest in the 12-29 years age group. There is not yet sufficient data to predict rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in the 5-11 years age group25. For further information refer to the ATAGI's Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines. Reporting of AEFI For further information refer to SAEFVIC vaccine safety information and reporting. *An AEFI is considered significant if it is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, deemed clinically significant, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or death. 25 Daniels CJ, Rajpal S, Greenshields JT, et al.

For more information on home visit safety considerations, refer to the Home Visit Guidelines. Safety considerations for vaccinating children aged 5-11 Paediatric dosage of COVID-19 vaccine Paediatric Pfizer (Orange Cap) COVID-19 Vaccine Paediatric Pfizer (Orange Cap) COVID-19 Vaccine is given as a two-dose schedule for children aged 5-11 years. ATAGI recommends an interval between the two Pfizer doses of 8 weeks. This can be reduced to a minimum of 3 weeks, under special circumstances or for international travel or in the context of ongoing community transmission. The paediatric formulation of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine must be used for children aged 5 to 11 years (0.2ml (10\u00b5g) per dose). A child should be vaccinated with the recommended dose based on their age at time of vaccination (e.g., if they turn 12 between dose 1 and 2, they would be vaccinated with an adolescent/adult formulation for dose 2). There are no additional handling and transportation requirements for the paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. For further guidance see Transporting doses for home visits - Victorian COVID-19 vaccination guidelines Severely Immunocompromised ATAGI recommend severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years receive a 3rd primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 2 months after their second dose, in line with other severely immunocompromised age cohorts (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2 to 6 months). More information may be found at Recommendations on the use of a 3rd primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised (health.gov.au) To reduce the risk of vaccine errors the following should be considered: Paediatric Pfizer (Orange Cap) COVID-19 Vaccine can only be used for children 5-11 years old. Where practicable, paediatric and adult Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine vials should be stored separately in vaccine fridges/freezers. Paediatric and adult Pfizer doses should not be drawn up together or the filled syringes stored together. Paediatric and adult doses of COVID-19 vaccines should be clearly labelled to reduce the risk of errors. 208 Other COVID-19 vaccine brands, not registered for use in children aged 5 to 11 years (eg AstraZeneca and Novavax) should be stored separately. Specific awareness and training around the different vaccines and multi-dose vials for this age group, will minimise risk of errors. Fainting and syncopal seizure There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immunisation for children aged 5 years compared to children aged 11 years. Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. While most cases of fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating environment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. For more information, refer to the COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 5-11 . How can the service be requested? Individuals or their carers can make a request for the Vaccinations at home service, by the following pathways: Enquire with their regular GP if they offer home visit COVID-19 vaccinations for their patients Contact your local public health unit Book an at-home appointment, via the COVID-19 hotline on 1800 675 398 . For an interpreter, press 0. People with special requirements or a disability (and their carers) are encouraged to contact a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who can help with their booking. You can contact a DLO by: completing the Request for Disability Liaison Officer support online form emailing DLOcoordinator@dhhs.vic.gov.au . Further information for Victorians who need to receive their COVID-19 vaccine at home may be found at COVID-19 vaccination at home . 209 Appendix 16: COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months to under 5 years Purpose This document is a guidance for administering COVID-19 vaccines to children aged 6 months to under 5 years in Victoria. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for ages 6 months - under 5 years ATAGI recommends Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 months to <5 years with severe immunocompromise, disability and those who have complex and/or multiple health conditions which increase risk of severe COVID-19. These include children with the following or similar conditions: Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the ATAGI advice on 3rd primary doses of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised (see Box 1) Bone marrow or stem cell transplant or chimeric antigen T-cell (CAR-T) therapy' Complex congenital cardiac disease; Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions; or A disability that require frequent assistance with activities of daily living, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). The recommendation is for 2 primary doses , except for those with severe immunocompromise who require 3 primary doses. The recommended interval between each dose is 8 weeks . ATAGI does not currently recommend vaccination for children aged 6 months to <5 years who are NOT in the above risk categories for severe COVID-19. The recommended dose for this age group is 25 micrograms compared with 50 micrograms in children aged 6-11 and 100 micrograms for those aged 12 years and over. Where possible, it is preferable to separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7-14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination, however, can be given as required for any discomfort or fever after vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended to be deferred for 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 210 Source: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/atagi-recommendations-on-the-use-of-a-third-primary-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-individuals-who-are-severely-immunocompromised 211 Model of delivery Given the special needs of this group and the small size of the cohort to be vaccinated, only a small number of vaccination sites have been selected to deliver the vaccine. These sites include: state and territory paediatric hospital clinics some general practices some Commonwealth Vaccination Clinics some Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. Appointments will be available from 5 September 2022. Please visit the COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic Finder (covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/booking/) to secure an appointment. Check back regularly, as appointments will continue to be added by immunisation providers. The Easy Vaccine Access (EVA) service is also available to book a COVID-19 vaccination. Simply message the EVA call back service on 0481 611 382 between 7 am and 10 pm (AEST), 7 days per week. The National Coronavirus Helpline provides information about COVID-19 and vaccinations. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and reached by calling 1800 020 080. Safety Considerations Risk of Vaccine Errors A new formulation of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has been developed for use in children under 5 years of age (6 months to 4 years). With the introduction of a new formula and dose, there is potential for errors in vaccine handling, prescribing and administration. Potential risks of vaccine errors for this age group include: Incorrect formulation which may result in overdosing Incorrect volume (dose) administered resulting in over- or underdosing Errors in the number of doses administered and/or dosing intervals Potential for partial doses (children moving arm out of way/inexperienced workforce) and therefore also a risk of needlestick injury Mitigation strategies include: Adequate training of staff for correct selection and preparation of vaccine and review of product information before administering vaccine. The use of systematic pre-vaccination screening to ensure the right person is getting the correct formulation and dosage of vaccine via the right route and injection site at the right time. Additional training for providers to ensure age-appropriate immunisation delivery including correct route of administration and injection site of administration. The use of colourful posters in the vaccination preparation area which clearly demonstrate the different formulations and how they need to be prepared. 212 The provision of clear written and verbal information to parents and/or guardians so that they have a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of vaccination and the required number and timing of doses. Provision of these materials in various translated versions would also be helpful. Vaccine storage and handling procedures that ensure the correct vaccine is being selected for administration. There is also a risk that COVID-19 vaccination in this age cohort may interfere with the administration of other important childhood vaccines on the National Immunisation Program (NIP) and/or result in confusion between which vaccine is responsible for an adverse event following immunisation AEFI). Authorised vaccinators should continue to mitigate errors with usual process of medication management and report any vaccine errors. For further information on vaccine errors see ATAGI Vaccine Errors and on reporting see Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Risk of Needlestick Injury A needlestick injury can happen when the needle from a syringe used for injection accidentally pricks or cuts the skin and can affect both the immuniser or the child/parent/guardian. Infants and children in this age group are at increased risk of injury as they are highly mobile, easily distracted and have varying capacity to follow instructions. Mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to: Vaccine providers must ensure all needles are safely disposed of in a sharps container, and needles should not be recapped. Sharps containers should comply with the Australian Standards, should have a wide neck to avoid the need to push objects into the container, and must never be overfilled Positioning the approved sharps container at the point-of-use, away from the infant of child Use of Distraction techniques to provide a calm environment for the child so that they will stay still for the procedure. The child should be positioned safely in the cuddle/straddle position and the immunisation provider should be confident that the parent is able to hold the child appropriately or seek additional support from another immuniser. For further information, see Difference in administration technique for infants under 12 months Preparing for vaccination Eligibility Confirmation Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must confirm the child's details and verify the minimum eligible age (6 months to 4 years) with identification (ID) such as the General Practitioner software, My Health, Learning and Development Record (green book) or an equivalent interstate record or confirm the child's details with the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) if this record is not available. For those without Medicare details such as newly arrived migrants, refugees or asylum seekers, other proof of age documents can be used, such as: Birth certificate Passport A letter from the child's general practitioner (if no other form of identification is available) 213 A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider. The child should be clinically assessed, and their details confirmed before administering the vaccine; Review consent forms Undertake pre-vaccination assessment Provide an opportunity for the child and parent/guardian to raise any questions Instruct the child and parent/guardian to wait for at least 15 minutes, as a safety requirement, while the child is observed for signs of adverse reaction. Provide information on post-vaccination self-care and direct the parent/guardian to read this (Available in a range of languages if applicable ). Informed consent A parent or guardian will be required to provide consent to vaccinate an infant/child, as the infant/child will not be competent to consent for themselves as per the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) . A medical treatment decision-maker for a child will be the child's parent, guardian, or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is available and willing to provide informed consent for the child's COVID-19 vaccination. Appropriate reading level English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to the carers if resources permit. The health professional administering the vaccination is responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Other staff including administrative staff, and/or support workers can help to coordinate this process (by contacting the decision maker) but cannot record consent. Disability services and in-reach programs should have systems in place to support this process, if required. For more information refer to the additional resources on consent Appendix 9. The Commonwealth have developed an information and consent form for parents and guardians of children aged 6 months to 5 years Pre-immunisation preparation Where possible, parents/guardians/carers should be provided with an immunisation plan (will be available prior to start of program) to guide the immunisation experience for the child and the parent. This can be completed ahead of time to provide the child and parent/guardian/carer with a level of control over the process, in terms of selecting who will accompany the child, time of day, toys, music or other distractions that the parent/carer/carer brings to the appointment. The parent/guardian/carer can record any previous negative immunisation experiences or anticipated anxiety and select the most appropriate immunisation pathway that may suit their child. Awareness of Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) services prior to and at the point of booking aims to provide the most appropriate immunisation experience first time for children with disability, special needs, needle phobia and/or anxiety. 214 Equipment Access to portable emergency oxygen kits, a first aid kit, and an anaphylaxis response kit should be available on site. Equipment should be regularly checked and maintained in line with the organisation's policy on resuscitation equipment use. Please note that a defibrillator is rarely required for children. Most paediatric life support initially focuses on airway and respiratory management. Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, ensure that protocols, equipment, and medicine to manage anaphylaxis are available by keeping an anaphylaxisresponse kit on site. Ensure that a printed table with age-based adrenaline dosing is readily available. SeePreparing an anaphylaxis response kit and Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals. 215 Children aged 5 years of age As per ATAGI , all children aged 5 years and above are recommended for COVID-19 vaccination as per advice for children 5-11 years . Five year old children can receive either Moderna 25 micrograms or Pfizer 3 micrograms per 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. It is preferred to complete a primary vaccination schedule in children aged 5 years or older with the same brand of vaccine for both doses. Children who turn 6 years old between doses should receive the dose that is applicable to them on the day of vaccination. Providers should note that the dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is the same for children aged 5 years and those aged 6 to 11 years. Product information The TGA has provided product information on Moderna. Preparation of vaccine The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is supplied in a multidose vial WITH A BLUE cap 0.10mg/ml (vial contains 2.5ml). There are 10 doses for use in children aged 6mths - under 5 years for a dose of 25g (0.25ml per dose) For other preparation of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, see product information. The vial should not be diluted. For further information on vaccine preparation, see product information. 216 Administration of vaccines in children under 5 There are different injection sites recommended for children under the age of 5 compared to those under 12 months. Note: An infant refers to a baby under the age of 12 months, a child is over 12 months. The Vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in infants under 12 months of age . See Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site on the anterolateral thigh This is because it is a large muscle and is free of neurovascular structures that could be harmed by vaccine administration. The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in children 12 months of age. See Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid injection site Cuddle position for infants A video outlining this technique can be found on the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) website Figure 1 - Differences in administration (injection site) for infants under 12 months Source: Images taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook Position the infant in a semi-recumbent cuddle position on the parent's/carer's lap (see figure 1. Positioning a child <12 months of age in the cuddle position ). The parent/carer should: Tuck the infant's inside arm against the parent's/carer's chest Securely hold the infant's outside arm and outside leg Flex the infant's outside knee to relax the vastus lateralis for intramuscular injections. Positions for older children Figure 2 - Positioning an older child in the cuddle position (Source: Images taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook ) 217 Sit child sideways on their carer's lap with their legs in between the carers thighs. The carer's outside (left) arm is wrapped around the back of the child and holding the child's left arm snuggly against the child's side. The carer is holding the child's left hand snuggly against the child's stomach with their right hand. The child's inside (right) arm is tucked under the carer's left armpit. This reveals the injection side in the child's left deltoid muscle. Another position for older children is the straddle position shown in figure 3. Figure 3 - Positioning an older child in the straddle position (Source: Images taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook ) An older child may face the parent/carer with their legs straddled over the parent's/carer's lap. The child's arms should be folded in front, and the parent/carer should hug the child's body to their chest. Alternatively, the child can 'hug' the parent/carer, with the parent's/carer's arms holding the child's arms in a reciprocal hug (see Figure.3 Positioning a child in the straddle position ). For further information on positioning of infants and children, please refer to The Australian Immunisation Handbook Recommended injection site and needle length for children Needle length and injection site are the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. 218 Managing AEFI in in infants and children under 5 years Diagram 2 - Managing AEFI in infants and children 6 months through 4 years (Source: Image from The Victorian Department of Health resource on vaccine side effects ) Common side effects for children and infants following immunisation can include: Mild fever (<38.5C) that doesn't last long Grizzly, unsettled, unhappy or sleepy Injection site discomfort where the needle was given: sore, red, burning, itching, or swelling for 1-2 days and/or small hard lump for a few weeks For more information on AEFI in children under 5 years refer to the Australian Immunisation Handbook. Managing fever after immunisation Give extra fluids to drink and/or breastfeed more frequently. Do not overdress the infant/child if hot and do not have too many blankets on. Although routine use of paracetamol after vaccination is not recommended, it can be given if the infant/child has a fever for comfort. The dose of paracetamol for a child up to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg/dose, every 4-6 hours, up to 4 times a day. not give paracetamol for more than 48 hours without seeking medical advice. Managing injection site discomfort Many vaccine injections can cause soreness, redness, itching, swelling, or burning at the injection site for 1-2 days. Putting a wet cold cloth on the injection site can ease discomfort. Paracetamol and/or Ibuprofen may be needed to ease the discomfort (check the label for correct use). Resources for parents/guardians/carers Resources on COVID-19 vaccination, including information on minor, common and expected side effects following COVID-19 vaccines are available from the Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination website. 219 Vaccine providers should provide information to the parent/guardian on how to manage common, minor, expected adverse events, and advise the parent/guardian to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. Very rare vaccine side effects requiring immediate medical attention If the AEFI is unexpected, persistent, or severe, or if a parent/guardian is concerned about the child's condition, they must be encouraged to seek medical review from their doctor or immunisation nurse as soon as possible or go directly to a hospital. Parent's/guardians should seek medical advice if an infant or child is unwell, as this may be due to another illness, not because of the vaccination. Reporting Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) Vaccine providers do not need to report minor, common, or expected side effects . See Vaccine safety for reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Workforce Readiness and Training Workforce Requirements No amendments are required to the Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) or Secretary Approvals. Note: all COVID-19 vaccination workforces have been authorised to prepare and administer the COVID- 19 vaccine to persons as approved by the TGA. The Commonwealth COVID-19 (online) training package and (on-site) competency assessment have been updated to ensure the workforce has the knowledge, skills, and competence to administer to this younger age group. Experienced emergency authorised vaccination staff may be considered suitable to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to children aged under 5 years. These staff should demonstrate competency in administering the vaccine to this age group. A competency assessment will be provided by the department for all emergency authorised immunisers. Vaccination sites must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on-site, who has completed all required COVID-19 vaccination training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. It is also recommended that a health professional who has qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged under 5 are being vaccinated. Vaccination site leads should consider the competence and experience of their workforce to determine their suitability to vaccinate infants and young children. For the purposes of working in the COVID-19 vaccination program, a Working with Children Check (WWCC) is recommended regardless of role. Some organisations may have their own policies that require workers to have a WWCC and it may also be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. It is recommended that health services consider that all staff working with children receive training in mandatory recognising and reporting signs of a child at risk of harm, violence, or neglect. Other Considerations Mandates for infants and children The National Immunisation Program (NIP) vaccines are not mandated in this preschool age group. However, to attend Early learning centres/childcare ( No Jab No Play legislation) the child must be up to date with their NIP vaccines according to the Australian Immunisation Register, immunisation history statement at the time of enrolment or be eligible for the 16 week support (grace) period provision . 220 The COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory for children and has not been included in the NIP so it is therefore not applicable to the 'No Jab' policies. Documentation Immunisation providers must document all vaccinations. It is mandatory to notify the Australian Immunisation Register . Providers can also document vaccination on their local clinical software/database and infant/child health book including the site of vaccination (e.g., right deltoid/left thigh) For more information on documentation, please refer to "}
