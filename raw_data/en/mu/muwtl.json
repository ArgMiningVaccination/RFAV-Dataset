We went to Belgium by car, arrived at the hotel, groomed her at the hotel and through it all NO signs of stress. So when her turn came at the competition, I finally saw and felt that she was back to normal. Everything went very well and she did what she had to do with a proud face. I am very happy with the results of Travel Pet. - Allison The customer service is, by far, the best I have ever encountered. Not only are they incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, they actually CARE about your pet's well-being. - Shelley It is tasteless. It is odorless.
