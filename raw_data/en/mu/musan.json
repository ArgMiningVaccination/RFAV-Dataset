Cover image taken in Chilliwack, BC.MESSAGE FROM FNHA'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND THE PROVINCIAL HEALTH OFFICER OF BC First Nations have known for millennia that self-determination, culture, language, connection to land, and supportive systems are the foundation of their health and wellness. We have grounded the First Nations Population Health and Wellness Agenda in these teachings. We offer this agenda as an evolving way to monitor population health, and a step that supports reconciliation and relationship building. The indicators presented in this report provide an eagle-eye view of First Nations health and wellness in BC. We come to this work with a deep respect for First Nations who remain strong, resilient, and revitalized, despite centuries of disruption, destruction, and dislocation. We see this agenda as an opportunity to illuminate the pathway we are on in BC, and offer seven calls to action to inspire discussion to help catalyze and guide the next steps of our journey. Our Offices have formed a unique partnership\u2014a partnership that reflects reconciliation in action, and a space to work in mutual respect and true collaboration. Together, we will monitor and report on these indicators until 2030, with public-facing reports every two-and-a-half years. Throughout this journey, we commit to finding new and better ways to honour and integrate First Nations teachings and ways of knowing into our work. Achieving the vision of healthy, vibrant, self-determining children, families, and communities requires paddling together with one heart and one mind, through true collaboration, integrated efforts, and intersectoral action. We hope that you will embark on this journey with us.

It begins by describing elements of healthy and self-determining Nations and communities by presenting indicators that explore self-determination; connections to land, water, and territories; and cultural wellness. Next, it focuses on supportive systems, including food, housing, education, and the health care system. The last grouping of indicators focuses on healthy children, families, and Elders. Indicators include healthy birth weights, infant mortality, oral health, healthy child weights, youth/young adult rates of death by suicide, mental and emotional well-being, physical activity, smoking commercial tobacco, diabetes, serious injuries, alcohol-related deaths, life expectancy, and mortality. The report concludes by offering seven calls to action to make further strides toward achieving the vision of healthy, self-determining, and vibrant BC First Nations children, families, and communities. Conclusion This chapter provided some historical context for the health of the First Nations population in BC and introduced a new suite of indicators for monitoring health and wellness in the province. It provided an overview of the process to develop a new way to monitor health and wellness through two-eyed seeing, a wellness-based approach, and the incorporation of the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness. It also reviewed the process for selecting the final indicators and targets that make up the Population Health and Wellness Agenda. In its structure, processes, and content, this report is offered as a new way of joint reporting, in the spirit of true reconciliation and partnership.

While each one is described in turn, they are interrelated, and together, form Indigenous concepts that are central to health and wellness. As illustrated in the words at the beginning of this chapter, the health of Indigenous people is connected to the land and the strength of culture and identity that comes from that connection. Self-determination, the right to freely determine political status and pursue economic, social, and cultural development,1 is central to maintaining and revitalizing these crucial connections. This chapter illuminates the importance of self- determination, connection to land, and cultural strength for First Nations as well as the QHHG\u0003IRU\u0003V\\VWHPV\u0003DQG\u0003VWUXFWXUHV\u0003WR\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003UHYLWDOL]DWLRQ\u0003HRUW development SOURCE N/A TARGETExplore how to measure and monitor, and implement the strategy BASELINE N/A Elders and Knowledge Keepers have long asserted that self-determination is foundational to health.

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2008) acknowledges that Indigenous people have the right to self-determination and states that by virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.1 Academics and institutions are contributing to a growing body of evidence to support what Indigenous peoples have always known-that self-determination is essential to their health and wellness. Research shows that Indigenous communities that have secured a degree of self-government and local control over community services, and that were actively engaged in the defense of their land rights and the revitalization of culture, experienced low to nonexistent rates of youth suicide. Conversely, it found that communities that had achieved little progress in these areas had considerably higher levels of youth suicide.3\u00036LPLODUO\\\u000f\u0003D\u0003ODUJH\u0003ERG\\\u0003RI\u0003HYLGHQFH\u0003LV\u0003HPHUJLQJ\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003HOG\u0003 RI\u0003VRFLDO\u0003HSLGHPLRORJ\\\u0003WKDW\u0003QGV\u0003WKDW\u0003 control over one's life (the capability of a person to lead the life they most want to lead) is fundamental to health.4 Low perceived life control or autonomy is linked to various health issues, including chronic diseases, accidents, mental illness, and suicide.4, 5 There is work underway to secure self-determination for First Nations land and governance at a macro level. This includes formal international and national government and intergovernmental structures (e.g., Assembly of First Nations, the United Nations). It also includes processes for granting recognition of the title and rights within the unceded territories of what is now BC, which is being done through self- government and economic development initiatives, and land claims.6 Self-determination is also critical at an individual level. The process of colonialism was disempowering not only to Nations, but also to individuals and families, through aggressive tactics and policies that took away individuals' control over their own lives, such as the Indian Residential School System, Indian Hospitals, the reserve pass system, and sudden introduction of relief foods.

Utilizing the Traditional Ecological Knowledge developed and passed down over countless generations, First Nations managed the rich resources of their territories and planned for the future of their communities and natural surroundings. However, increasing pressure from industry, high-impact tourism, resource extraction, and climate change has threatened the balance that First Nations had maintained with nature13 resulting in the degradation of natural ecosystems and reduced opportunities for First Nations livelihoods in fishing and forestry. Following from the Sparrow decision in 1990 that recognized First Nations' right to fish for food, social, and ceremonial purposes,14 people from a handful of First Nations along the BC coast and Haida Gwaii were hired to observe, record, and report possible violations of environmental regulations in their traditional territories.13 Since this time, Guardian Watchmen have been the \"eyes and ears\" of communities along the BC Coastline,15 working to uphold and enforce traditional and contemporary Indigenous laws16 and ensure that the cultural natural resources of the coast are protected and safeguarded so that Coastal First Nations \"can continue to sustain healthy communities for generations to come\".17 Over 40 Indigenous Nations and communities in Canada have launched Guardian programs. The programs enable community members to: \u0083Engage in meaningful in-community employment, \u0083Share Indigenous knowledge and lifeways, \u0083Connect with other First Nation communities, \u0083Strengthen Indigenous economies, \u0083 Open up new opportunities for sustainable businesses, \u0083Bring financial inflows into the community, \u0083Allow Nations to assert their rights and title, \u0083 Develop more responsive and responsible stewardship capacity, and \u0083 Build confidence and hope for current and future generations. Guardian Watchmen programs provide a broad range of benefits that all contribute to the roots of wellness described in this report and the goals of various sectors including public health, resource industry, tourism and the environment.17 HEALTHY, SELF-DETERMINING NATIONS AND Cultural Wellness MEASURECultural wellness reported by on-reserve First Nations adults, as a composite index of language, traditional foods, traditional medicines, traditional spirituality, and participation in community cultural events.

Cultural healing, or healing through traditional wellness, includes First Nations cultural practices and teachings such as ceremony, prayer, traditional medicines and foods, songs, sacred spaces, language, stories, dance, smudging, brushings, hunting, gathering, fasting, running, sweats, and baths, among others. Cultural healing is inherently relational because it looks past an individual's body to aid in healing with connections to the Creator, the land, and other human beings. Traditional Foods Traditional First Nations foods include a wide variety of seasonal plant and animal species that combine to create a diverse, nutritious, and complete diet.32 However, for many First Nations, the role of food extends beyond the physical needs of the body and cannot be separated from culture, ceremony, place, land, relationships, and community.33 Food is also connected to First Nations economies and complex trade networks, First Nations knowledge, and land stewardship roles; these are all woven together into a sustainable food system.32, 34 \"The land nourishes us in all ways; physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional. The health and security of our people is vitally dependent on continued and improved access to sufficient amounts of healthy Indigenous foods and medicines on the land and in the forests and waterways.\"%\u0003BXO\u0003.PSSJTPO \u00034FDX\u00a9QFND\u0003/BUJPO31 26 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS AGENDA Cultural sharing by Takaya Tours, Vancouver Coastal Cultural Wellness Cultural wellness is critical to overall health and wellness; however, it is a very subjective, dynamic and FRPSOH[\u0003SKHQRPHQRQ\u0011\u0003&RPELQLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003YH\u0003DVSHFWV\u0003RI\u0003)LUVW\u00031DWLRQV\u0003FXOWXUH\u0003GHVFULEHG\u0003LQ\u0003WKLV\u0003VHFWLRQ\u0003FUHDWHV\u0003 a very high-level perspective on how actively these areas are being revitalized.

Prepared by First Na ons Health Authority, July 2019. 28 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS AGENDA This chapter has discussed three key aspects of the roots of wellness for First Nations people in BC: self- determination, connection to land, and cultural wellness. These concepts are interrelated, and together, form a foundation for First Nations people to achieve the vision of healthy, vibrant, and self-determining individuals, families, and communities. For First Nations, self-determination cannot be achieved without jurisdiction, access, and continuity of their relationship with the land. Creating space and opportunities for First Nations peoples to foster and promote cultural teachings, connect to land, and practice individual self-determination can begin to reverse the health disparities caused by colonialism.35 Future reports of the First Nations Population Health and Wellness Agenda will provide more information about a self- determination indicator, and will provide results from the We Walk Together project that is currently underway to better understand and monitor the connections between land and health for First Nations in BC. Analyses of cultural wellness of adults surveyed on reserve over the last 10 years showed that levels across the province are high and increasing, but that more can be done to increase use of traditional medicines in BC. The next chapter will explore the foundations for health and wellness at a population level by examining societal and structural systems in BC.

Through the legacy of colonialism, longstanding First Nations systems and jurisdiction over education, housing, food acquisition, and healing have been eroded. In addition, First Nations are socially excluded from Western systems, resulting in disparities compared to other residents both in determinants of health and in health outcomes.

That's what we're going to get out of life.\"- Janine Luggi, Stellat'en First Nation1 For centuries, food has been a source of sustenance and healing for First Nations people. Many believe that \"food is medicine\".2 In addition to being necessary for physical needs, food is seen as an integral part of emotional, mental, and spiritual needs.3 Food is a central element of many traditional ceremonies, as well as traditional First Nations economies and complex trade networks.4 For many First Nations people, food is also an essential component of their identity, linking them to their community, the land, their culture, and the ancestors, and it is one way in which cultural values such as sharing and cooperation were practiced on a daily basis.5 Traditionally, communities used their knowledge and understanding of wholistic food systems to have diverse, nutritious, and complete diets while maintaining a balance with the availability of food and resources from the lands and waters.6 The harvesting, processing, preparing, and sharing of food engaged people in physical activity and brought communities together, helped to maintain social relationships, facilitated knowledge transfer, and sustained spiritual connections to the land.7 While these traditions are still practiced today, colonialism and the forced dislocation of Indigenous peoples from their territories disrupted access to traditional foods and food practices.8 Since contact, )LUVW\u00031DWLRQV\u0003KDYH\u0003EHFRPH\u0003PRUH\u0003H[SRVHG\u0003WR\u0003OHVV\u0003QXWULWLRXV\u000f\u0003SURFHVVHG\u000f\u0003VWRUH\u0010ERXJKW\u0003IRRGV\u000f\u0003ZKLFK\u0003KDV\u0003 contributed to disproportionate rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.8 First Nations living in northern, rural, and remote regions of the province face additional challenges DVVRFLDWHG\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003DYDLODELOLW\\\u000f\u0003TXDOLW\\\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003FRVW\u0003RI\u0003IUHVK\u000f\u0003QXWULWLRXV\u000f\u0003VWRUH\u0010ERXJKW\u0003IRRGV\u0011\u0003)DPLOLHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003 lower income levels experience even further challenges. 34 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS AGENDA ability for First Nations to source food from the land is further impeded by ongoing threats of resource extraction and encroaching development, and traditional hunting and gathering areas have EHHQ\u0003FRQWDPLQDWHG\u0011\u00030DQ\\\u0003)LUVW\u00031DWLRQV\u0003KDYH\u0003DOVR\u0003VXHUHG\u0003WKH\u0003ORVV\u0003RI\u0003IRRG\u0003VWRFNV\u0003WKURXJK\u0003RYHUKDUYHVWLQJ\u000f\u0003 competition, and environmental destruction related to industry.9 The impacts of climate change\u2014such as sea level rise and extreme weather events, temperature, and rainfall variability\u2014are now creating added challenges to food systems.10 First Nations are working to revitalize traditional food practices and reintegrate traditional foods into their diets.

This indicator was chosen to represent an economic measure, alternative to income, and represents a key impact of income challenges. SUPPORTIVE SYSTEMS 35 Ha\u00edzaqv community partners have built gardens in Bella Bella and at our seasonal community spaces out on the land. We've mapped community fruit trees and sold or distributed dozens of raised beds made from local wood for community members to start their own gardens at home. We are rebuilding the kind of intimate, place-based knowledge of our territory that helped my grandmother's grandmother know where to harvest what she needed and how to tend those places into abundance\u2014but we are learning and practicing by developing an intimate knowledge of our own little gardens. Each post-contact generation of Ha\u00edzaqv people has endured assaults on our land-based identity. Colonialism has attempted to legislate us off our territories and away from many of the resources that we depend on for food, social, and ceremonial purposes. It's the driving force behind systemic oppressions that have sought to separate us from our homelands and our Ha\u00edzaqv identity. While this has clawed away at our access to our homelands and the intimate knowledge our ancestors held of all 35,553 square kilometres of our territory, we have survived, and we will thrive again. That bone-deep impulse to thrive manifests as many pairs of Ha\u00edzaqv hands digging in the dirt, calling up the little green promises of abundance, as the weight of the kale and the carrots and the aromatic herbs we grow is equal to the weight of the full hearts swelling over the meals we share and good food we give away to the people we love. That love and generosity is Ha\u00edzaqv to the core. Of course, gardening in isolation will not solve everything. But food is medicine, and food is community building. In gardening, we express food sovereignty. We take responsibility for nourishing ourselves and our loved ones with good food that will make our bodies strong. We reinforce the social and spiritual bonds that hold our people together when we work side by side and share our harvests with one another. And we become more giving, more autonomous, and more attuned to the natural cycles and rhythms that help us\u2014and our gardens\u2014to grow. In my garden, I feel at peace and in control. This is an act of resistance in a world that seeks to marginalize me, and in that peace, I feel a stronger connection to my ancestors. In the face of generations of colonial oppression, gardening is one more way to say that we're still here. We're taking care of our bodies and our people. We're planting seeds as a promise to our future selves. And in this way, to me, growing deep-red tomatoes and hefty zucchinis is a creative way of doing the work our ancestors set out for us because it is a tangible commitment to our own resilience. For a Nation keenly focused on asserting and building up its identity, growing a garden is planting a seed of Ha\u00edzaqv resurgence. 36 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS The target for this indicator for the next 10 years is to reduce the proportion of First Nations households on reserve experiencing food insecurity by 20 per cent. 2008-10 2015-17 2025-27 Per cent 43.5 Target 43.5 34.80102030405060708090100Per cent Notes: A \"balanced meal\" contains a variety of food groups (e.g., a selec on of protein, grain, vegetables, fruit, and da iry products).

It should be noted that this is a voluntary survey for patients in health care settings; First Nations patients with unsatisfactory or disrespectful experiences, or those who may have concerns about ongoing systemic racism, may be reluctant to participate or disclose Indigeneity, and therefore may be underrepresented in these data. As shown in Figure 3.13, the percentages of Status First Nations patients in these two care settings reporting respectful care were similar in the most recent reporting years. As indicated here, 68.8 per cent of Status First Nations surveyed in acute care settings reported that their care provider was respectful of their culture and traditions, while 69.5 per cent reported the same experience in the emergency department. The target for this indicator for the next 10 years is to increase the percentage of First Nations patients in both survey settings reporting that their care provider was respectful of their culture and traditions, by 25 per cent.

While I don't necessarily disclose details of my personal life to my patients, when they meet me and know that I'm First Nations, there's something that goes unspoken, something that's intuitive - that I have somehow suffered too and have a sense of empathy and understanding. It seems to be easier to develop a sense of mutual trust and rapport, and health care encounters seem to develop into partnerships in a culturally safe way. I was also happy to be visible in the communities I worked in - showing the youth that it is possible to become a doctor who is First Nations. If you can't see yourself in a role or career, you'll never set a goal to achieve it. I always say to youth that you are only limited by the extent of your imaginations and working as a physician in community is one way to expand the imaginations of the young people.\"%\u0003\u0003 S\u000f\u0003/FM\u00038JFNBO \u0003\"OJTIOBXCF \u0003-JUUMF\u0003(SBOE\u00033BQJET\u0003'JSTU\u0003/BUJPO \u00031SFTJEFOU\u0003PG\u0003UIF\u0003 Indigenous Physicians Association of Canada (IPAC), and Deputy Chief Medical 0DFS \u0003'JSTU\u0003/BUJPOT\u0003)FBMUI\u0003\"VUIPSJUZ 58 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND has given rise to barriers and systems that are racist and exclusionary, and as a result, are not fully meeting the needs of First Nations people.

This will assist in the medical management of your care. It is just that I recognized that there has been significant trauma and scarring along your gums. Can you tell me to the best of your knowledge what happened?\" My dad studied the man across the desk, wearing his suit, tie, and polished shoes, with his white walled office with one family picture. I looked at him, sized him up. Would I tell him or would I avoid telling him? It was a fair question. My dad decided to tell him. \"First, I want you to know that I do not want pity. I do not want any emotional looks. I will tell you what happened. I was brought to Kuper Island Indian residential school. I was eleven when it happened. A dentist come in, examined my mouth, then later I was brought into another room. My ankles were buckled, then my arms, then my chest, then my forehead. It was a damn good thing because when they opened my mouth, every single tooth was pulled in one sitting. Nothing was given for freezing. My face swelled, my eyes swelled, and God bless my sister Cecelia, she gave me water. Weeks passed and my mouth got rotten. I was taken back to that chair. There was no fight left in me; I was too weak. And the dentist pinched off all the rotten gums. I remember becoming so skinny, but I lived. I survived.\" My dad looked at me \"Stop that, stop that crying now. You have nothing to cry about.\" I held back my grief, anger, my questions. I wiped the tears from my face. And my dad went back to his story. \"Today, I have never been able to eat solid food; all my food has to be soft. No matter how much polident paste I use inside my dentures. I cannot chew anything hard or even semi hard. If I try my gums break down and then I'm on an even softer diet.\" It was a sudden realization, that's right; everything he ate was mashed, soft, without body. To my knowledge, this surgeon corrected this for my dad. And during the last 10 years of his life he was able to enjoy foods that he could chew. He never did talk to me about what happened to him. He never talked about pain. He taught us that trauma can cause you to be either resilient or weak. You make your own choice. You make your own luck. People have to heal with dignity or they will not heal at all. It's been 20 years since my dad is gone but the river still runs through us. 74 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS AGENDA Treated Decay cent 45.7 30.7 23.6 Count 1,537 1,034 7920102030405060708090100Per cent Decay StatusPercentage of Indigenous Kindergarten Children With Visible Dental Decay, by Status of Decay, BC, 2015/16 Notes: This analysis iden es children between the ag es of 4 and 6 with \"no visible dental decay\" (no broken enamel and no exis ng restora ons) based on a visual inspec on of the child's teeth.

As a teenager, I expe rienced two severe traumatic events that led to my developing chronic PTSD that went undiagnosed. For many years, I coped by distracting myself with school and then work and family responsibilities. Later as an adult, I experienced significant changes in a short period, including the deaths of two of the most important people in my life. Again, I tried to bury myself in my work but over several years, I became depressed, unable to sleep and reluctant to seek help. I started to increase my alcohol use in the evenings, drinking initially to self-medicate my anxiety, grief and insomnia. Eventually, my alcohol use became problematic and impaired my ability to meet life's demands. Being First Nations delayed my seeking treatment, because I had internalized the stigma of being an alcoholic. I eventually deteriorated to the point where it became necessary for me to seek residential treatment. I completed a program where both my alcohol use and chronic PTSD were addressed. I've been on my recovery journe y now for over 4\u00bd years. I have the tools to manage my anxiety, mood and trauma symptoms without having to use substances. I have a stronger identity as a First Nations person, my self- esteem has improved and most importantly, I am able to be clear and present to meet all of my responsibilities. I've become a valuable, contributing member of the communities I belong to.

We embedded the PHWA framework in an ecosystem metaphor because it aligns with the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness. Our natural laws teach us that all beings require balance to thrive. Whether we are plant or human, when our roots of wellness are adequately nourished and if we are free of harsh external conditions, we thrive. In this agenda we have illuminated roots of wellness that have been severely undermined by Canadian colonial practices and policies\u2014including self-determination, language, culture, and connection to land. We have highlighted systems, which have not yet fully achieved cultural safety and continue to present harsh conditions that impede First Nations vibrancy and health. Finally, we reported on health and wellness outcomes that act as signals of the condition and integrity of the soil and roots of wellness. These health and wellness outcomes demonstrate that the health of babies, children, youth, and adults is improving; however, there remains a significant journey ahead of us to reach our shared vision of healthy, vibrant, self-determining First Nations children, families, and communities. We invite you to join us and commit to paddling with one heart and one mind towards First Nations health and wellness in BC. References 1 First Nations Health Council.

The act is considered paternalistic and intrusive as it controls and determines eligibility requirements for \"Indian Status.\" It has divided and separated families, discriminated against women, and has been a source of harm and injustice for First Nations and Indigenous peoples and communities.16,22 Indian Hospitals formed a separate and segregated system of health care for Indigenous people, operated by Christian missionaries and then by the Canadian government throughout the 20th century.

Population attributable fractions for alcoholis the proportion of the total cases of deaths in a population that are linked to alcohol consumption, and therefore represents the proportion of deaths that would be reduced if alcohol was not used in that population.13 Population health approachis a framework for understanding health that seeks to improve the health of an overall population by addressing inequities experienced within it between populations, among both causes DQG\u0003RXWFRPHV\u0003 H\u0011J\u0011\u000f\u0003GLHUHQFHV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003GHWHUPLQDQWV\u0003RI\u0003KHDOWK\u000f\u0003 GLHUHQFHV\u0003LQ\u0003LOOQHVV\u0003DQG\u0003GLVHDVH\u0003UDWHV \u001146 Potential years of life lost is a measure of premature death that estimates the average years of life lost in individuals who would have otherwise lived an optimal life expectancy (e.g., 86 years).47 Primary health care LV\u0003HVVHQWLDO\u0003KHDOWK\u0003FDUH\u0003WKDW\u0003LV\u0003RIWHQ\u0003WKH\u0003UVW\u0003OHYHO\u0003RI\u0003FRQWDFW\u0003ZLWK\u0003 the health system, and includes health promotion, prevention, curative, and rehabilitative services.48 Reciprocal accountability is a shared responsibility among First Nations, as well as between First Nations and government partners, to achieve common goals.

This was a foundational concept for many First Nations traditional social systems, which required all community members to be accountable for their decisions and actions, and for their contributions to the community's wellness as a whole.56 Reconciliation is establishing relationships based on mutual trust and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples throughout Canadian society. It is an ongoing process that includes recognition of the injustices and harms of the past, providing support for Indigenous peoples to heal from colonization and its legacy, as well as action and commitment to create a future of equality, dignity, and peace.49 means that Indigenous people are free to determine their political status, free to pursue their economic, social, and cultural development, and free to practice, develop, and teach their own spiritual and religious traditions, customs, and ceremonies.50,51 Status Indian while outdated and inappropriate, this term is still used in the Canadian government to mean an Indigenous person who is registered under the Indian Act .16 Strengths-based approach is an approach that recognizes and promotes the inherent strengths, skills, capacity, knowledge, resilience, and potential of individuals, their families, and communities, and considers how they can be used and built on.52 Two-eyed seeing refers to learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing and from the other eye with the strengths of Western ways of knowing, and using both of these eyes together to gain a more comprehensive understanding.53 Unintentional injuries are injuries that are not purposely or deliberately intended by the individual or anyone else (e.g., motor vehicle collisions, falls, accidental poisoning).54 Wellness-based approach is concerned with keeping people well and supporting wellness through a wholistic approach rather than only responding to individual cases of illness and disease.17 Wholistic health includes supporting the health of the whole person, i.e., the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of their well-being.55 152 FIRST NATIONS POPULATION HEALTH AND WELLNESS Ramirez S, Narayan M, Theodosis C, et al.

DIPC has ethical oversight responsibilities regarding the use of the FNCF and reviews each request for FNCF data access. The Committee has established processes and procedures for the submission and review of FNCF data access requests, balancing the need for high-quality First Nations health data with the need to protect individual and community privacy and to respect the principles of First Nations health information governance. First Nations health information governance refers to the structure, process, and protocols by which First Nations in BC have access to First Nations data, and it ensures that there is influential involvement by First Nations in decision-making regarding the appropriate and respectful collection, use, disclosure, and stewardship of that information. The intended use of the FNCF cohort is to provide information about the health and well-being of First Nations people to support health planning, surveillance, and evaluation. 7KH\u0003LQWHQGHG\u0003XVH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003)1&)\u0003FRKRUW\u0003LV\u0003WR\u0003SURYLGH\u0003LQIRUPDWLRQ\u0003DERXW\u0003WKH\u0003KHDOWK\u0003DQG\u0003ZHOO\u0010EHLQJ\u0003RI\u0003)LUVW\u0003 1DWLRQV\u0003SHRSOH\u0003WR\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003KHDOWK\u0003SODQQLQJ\u000f\u0003VXUYHLOODQFH\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003HYDOXDWLRQ\u0011\u0003 $V\u0003ZLWK\u0003DQ\\\u0003GDWD\u0003DQDO\\VHV\u000f\u0003WKLV\u0003UHSRUW\u0003KDV\u0003EHHQ\u0003VXEMHFW\u0003WR\u0003VRPH\u0003FKDOOHQJHV\u0003DQG\u0003OLPLWDWLRQV\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003 GDWD\u0003SUHVHQWHG\u0011\u0003)LUVW\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003GDWDVHWV\u0003DUH\u0003FRQWLQXRXVO\\\u0003EHLQJ\u0003XSGDWHG\u0003DQG\u0003DUH\u0003VXEMHFW\u0003WR\u0003FKDQJH\u0003DV\u0003RSHQ\u0003 RU\u0003XQUHVROYHG\u0003FDVHV\u0003DUH\u0003UHVROYHG\u0003DQG\u0012RU\u0003FRUUHFWHG\u0003UHWURDFWLYHO\\\u0011\u0003$GGLWLRQDOO\\\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003VWDQGDUG\u0003SRSXODWLRQ\u0003 used to age-standardize rates was updated from the 1991 version used in other iterations of this report structure to the 2011 version now available.
