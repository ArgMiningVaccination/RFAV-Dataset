Your Naturopathic Physician will be able to provide you with what you are looking for in our conventional Primary Care setting: medication management, labs, imaging, and referrals but can also provide other methods to address your concerns at the moment. Here is where we go above and beyond, discussing with your the complete picture of care from the importance of having a team approach both traditional care and naturopathic. We can help implement the necessary dietary, lifestyle, and behavioral factors that your cardiovascular or other providers don't have the time to. We use the same assessment markers traditional providers use, including Lipids/Cholesterol, Glucose, Hemoglobin A1C, highly sensitive C-Reactive Protein, and go go further with tests that examine oxidation and damage of the cardiovascular system, or how the microbiome, or environmental contributions play a role in your cardiovascular system. Functional Medicine & Integrative Cardiovascular Care Integrative Cardiovascular Care Medication, Diet, Supplement, Lifestyle Synergy Since the 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic, and now more than ever, cardiovascular care has been highlighted as a primary risk factor for multiple health conditions.

Instead of botulinum, we use homeopathics and herbs to help support skin detoxification and reconstruction. Hypertension & Blood Flow As a deep \"resurfacing\" type of treatment, [Micro](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/microneedling/) & [Nano](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/nano-needling/)-Needling is a comprehensive exfoliation process. Apple-stem cells are paired with Hyaluronic Acid and Chinese Medicine herbs to create specialized serums for each client depending on their needs. Our skin absorbs the stem cells and nutrients from the herbs and utilizes these resources in its repair and reconstruction process. Heart Health & Inflammation As a popular Add-On, Cosmetic Cupping and Guasha are ancient massage techniques that stimulate circulation and help release muscle tension. When applied to the face, it generally helps to round out your skincare regimen at Rebel Med NW. If you get your own set of tools, our providers can teach you tips and techniques for giving yourself an at-home facial massage. Cardiovascular Care for All Ages Cardiovascular Care in your 20s & 30s In your 20s and 30s, you may not be thinking about your skin much, but there's a lot that acupuncture and Cosmetic Acupuncture has to offer. First of all, if you have great skin, keep it great and healthy by maintaining a facial regimen. You can prolong the life of your skin by being proactive now. Secondly, if you suffer from acne, acupuncture - in general - can be a great treatment strategy as it addresses skin health from a holistic approach. If you are in your 20s, you will benefit from cosmetic acupuncture as a preventative process that will help your skin stay optimal throughout its lifetime. Begin fighting against sun damage now. The best use is after harsh seasons like winters and summers when skin suffers a lot of damage from sun and weather. If you are in your 30s, you will experience your skin looking brighter and more even, your pores are less noticeable, and the beginnings of lines and wrinkles diminish. The best use is seasonally, but at least after summers and winters. Cardiovascular Care in your 40s & 50s The needs of people in their 40s and 50s are unique. This is when we're likely heavily involved in life, from raising kids to becoming leaders in our careers. Our stories come out in our faces: lack of sleep, subpar nutrition, lots of happy hours! For those of you in your 40s, you will experience rejuvenation in the form of smoother texture, softened fine lines and wrinkles, and plumper, brighter, more even skin tone. The best use is seasonal to monthly. Those in your 50s will experience a more even look, softer lines, and wrinkles, while your skin becomes more plump and tight, and brighter from increased blood circulation, detoxification, and repair. The best use is monthly or every other month. Cardiovascular Care for 60s & Onward In your 60s and up, you are much more comfortable and confident in your own skin. Give it the TLC it needs and deserves by revitalizing it with some Cosmetic Acupuncture. For the fabulous 60s and older, you will experience varying degrees of skin-plumping and tightening, softening of fine lines, and lightening of various spots and blemishes. You may also have specific areas that you want to target, and although we cannot guarantee targeted results, we can still focus our treatments accordingly. When utilizing Cosmetic Acupuncture for a specific goal, we usually recommend a regular weekly series of 6 or 10 treatments. Once you get the desired results, you can follow a seasonal or monthly regimen of single treatments. Upgrade your Cosmetic Acupuncture protocols with Bio-Injections or an add-on Glutathione IV to support regeneration and detox. Can I see a Naturopathic Physician & a Cardiologist? Yes!, and we encourage a comprehensive team for those that need it. We found that having doorways open for our patients to get the most appropriate care is where we can achieve the best results. While our facility doesn't have the same diagnostic equipment & procedures, such as ECHO's, or Perfusion Studies, we do work with several facilities and cardiovascular physicans to counsel you through the day to day optimization that can be implemented so you can really optimize your cardiovascular longevity while improving your ability to be optimally treated while under pharmaceutical medications.
