This FOA refers to research into and development of com putational systems that ta ke action to achieve a goal as Artificial Intelligence (AI) research a nd may include Machine Le arning (ML) techniques as appropriate. This Announcement invites applicati ons for AI research in three topic areas: AI research for HEP, HEP for AI research, and deve lopment of an HEP AI Ecosystem. The HEP program explicitly encourages applica tions from non-traditional HEP institutions and researchers that may broaden the participat ion in HEP research and the AI sub-field. 2 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Background Information The following program descriptions are offere d to provide more in-depth information on scientific and technical ar eas of interest to HEP: Program Website: https://science.osti.gov/hep/. The mission of the HEP program is to unders tand how the universe works at its most fundamental level, which is done by discovering the elementary constituents of matter and energy, probing the interactions be tween them, and exploring the ba sic nature of space and time. The Energy Frontier - where powerful accelerators are used to create new particles, reveal their interactions, and investigate fundamental forces; The Intensity Frontier - where inte nse particle beams and highly se nsitive detectors are used to pursue alternate pathways to inve stigate fundamental forces and particle interactions by studying events that occur rarely in na ture, and to provide precision meas urements of these phenomena; The Cosmic Frontier - where non-ac celerator-based experiments obs erve the cosmos and detect cosmic particles, making meas urements of natural phenomena that can provide information about the nature of cosmic acceleration, incl uding dark energy and the cosmic microwave background, search for dark matter particles, and studying properties of the universe that impact our understanding of matter and energy; Theoretical High Energy Physics, where th e vision and mathematical framework for understanding and extending the knowledge of part icles, forces, space-tim e, and the universe are developed; Accelerator Science and Technology Research an d Development, where the technologies and basic science needed to design, build, and operate the accelerator facilities essential for making new discoveries are developed; Detector Research and Development, where the ba sic science and technologies needed to design and build the High Energy Physics detectors essential fo r making new discoveri es are developed. Additional information about the HEP research subprogram areas describe d above, and in areas (a) through (f) given below, may be found at https://science.osti.gov/hep/research/ . Each of the research frontiers is described with a list of currently-supported experi ments and facilities. Experiments, facilities, theoretical topics, subjects of research, and multi-institutional cooperative endeavors, in which scientific resear ch is carried out, are re ferred to as \"research thrusts\" in this FOA and in the HEP-supported research community. Res earch proposed to this FOA must be a new initiative not currently support ed as part of an ex isting or ongoing program. Program Objective 3 This FOA will invest in AI research applied to the HEP program following previously identified national research prior ities and Basic Research Needs workshops conducted by SC.[1, 2, 3] The objectives are to support AI research that extends the scientific reach of existing HEP programs well beyond what is currently achievable includi ng across frontiers and e xperiments; uses HEP to improve the understanding of the theoretical ca pabilities and lim itations of fundamental AI; or develops shared public HEP datasets and compu ting environments for AI training and testing. The aim of this FOA is to consolidate existing parallel efforts and to foster new directions towards these objectives. Applications are sough t that primarily focus on one of the following topic areas, though research ma y benefit secondary areas. AI for HEP - The scientific objectiv es and priorities for the field recommended by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP) are detaile d in its long-range stra tegic Particle Physics Project Prioritization Plan (P5).[ 4] Applications are sought that are well aligned with the HEP program priorities. AI research th at advances the P5 science driv ers, or development of new AI- based technologies that expand paths of investigation for HEP beyond what was considered in the P5 report are encouraged. Ambitious applicat ions of AI benefitting multiple HEP programs or experiments coherently and which are of broad interest are espe cially sought, as are innovative applications that can deliver signif icant advances to HEP experimental reach or theoretical u nderstanding. HEP for AI - This FOA also seeks to support research that makes use of unique aspects of HEP to improve the understanding of the theoretical capabilities an d limitations of fundamental AI. Research into robust scientific ML, data in tensive ML, ML-enhanced Modeling and Simulation, Uncertainty Quantification, a nd Physics Informed ML that exploits HEP theoretical understanding, experimental data, or simulations to provide insight into general AI/ML methods are encouraged. An example of a possible research topic in this area would be evaluation of various Physics Informed ML techniques compar ed to training more traditional networks. HEP AI Ecosystem - Proposed work toward production of open datasets, collaboration with industrial or national laboratory partners, as well as development of \"ecosystem\" software allowing for straightforward tr aining and deployment of mo dels is equally encouraged. Applications that address democratic access amon g all-sized institutions to computing resources and continued development and retention of the workforce for the products being developed are especially welcome. Examples of possible topics in this area w ould be curating HEP datasets for public access, or integration of modern ML software into standard HEP tools. Applications for work currently supported by DOE or other funding entities are outside the scope of this FOA. Applications that are not in di rect support of HEP research (e.g., conferences, experimental operations, conceptu al research and development (R&D), design, or fabrication directed towards a specific project, etc.) may no t be submitted in respons e to this FOA. They may be submitted to the annual SC FOA or to other applicable SC FOAs published at https://www.grants.gov/ . Additional Guidance There are two paths for applicati ons seeking support from this FOA: multi-institution teams and 4 single-institution \"seed\" awards: (1) This FOA seeks to support broad ambitious research requiring multiple institutions via research teams led by a single institution with subawards to team members. Such teams are particularly appropriate when the involvement of multiple institutions permits the formation of larger te ams that can address mult i-faceted questions of scientific inquiry, especially wh ere the problem can be factori zed across team members. Multi- disciplinary efforts are encourag ed when appropriate for the wo rk proposed. (2) Exploratory investigations by researchers and institutions new to the field, or smaller scale studies of HEP or AI-research are sought through the s eed awards. Applications for s eed awards must be from only a single institution, but may involve multiple co-P Is at that institution if appropriate for the proposed scope of work. Applications in the se ed award path may be appropriate for PIs from non-traditional HEP institutions, HEP PIs who have minimal prior AI research experience, or for establishing feasibility of blue-sky research. The intention of both the multi-institution teams a nd seed awards is to fund research. Support for equipment and computational hardware may be availa ble at a lower priority and is expected to be capped per institution. Multi-institution collaborations must be led by a DOE/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) National Lab with a lead PI who is expect ed to charge not less th an 25% of their effort to the award. References 1. https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1478744 https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/Na tional-AI-RD-Strategy-2019.pdf Open Science SC is dedicated to promoting th e values of openness in Federall y supported scientific research, including, but not limited to, ensuring that rese arch may be reproduced and that the results of Federally supported research are made available to other researchers. These objectives may be met through any number of mechanis ms including, but not limited to, data access plans, data sharing agreements, the use of archives and repositories, and the us e of various licensing schemes. The use of the phrase \"open-sourc e\" does not refer to any particul ar licensing arra ngement, but is to be understood as encompassing any arrangement that furthers the objective of openness. Applications from for-pro fit organizations that propose resear ch related to current commercial activity may be declined without merit review. Multi-Institutional Teams 5 Collaborative applications (def ined as those in which each team member submits its own application with a common research narrativ e) will not be accepted under this FOA. S UBAWARDS1 Multi-institutional teams must submit one a pplication from a desi gnated lead DOE/NNSA National Laboratory with all othe r team members proposed as s ubrecipients. A well-thought-out research plan and its associated budget(s) shoul d leave no confusion about which institution will do which parts of the research. DOE/NNSA National Laboratories 2, other Federal agencies, an d another Federal agency's FFRDCs3, if participating in a team led by a DOE /NNSA National Laborat ory, may be proposed as subrecipient. Note that the value of any such proposed subaward may be remo ved from any such prime award: DOE may make separate awards to Federally affiliated institutions. 1 Subawards are made to subrecipients. Both terms are defined in 2 CFR 200.1 (https://www.ecfr.gov) 2 The phrase \"National Laboratories\" is used broadly to encompass DOE/NNSA laboratories and sites capable of performing the work described in th is FOA and capable of r eceiving funds through the DOE Field Work System. 3 An authoritative list of all Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) may be found at https://www.nsf.gov/s tatistics/ffrdclist/ 6 Section II - AWARD INFORMATION A.

Th e standard checklist is available at http://energy.gov/management/office-manage ment/operational-man agement/financial- assistance/financial-assistance-forms under Award Forms: Indi vidual awards may impose additional requirements. D. REPORTING OF MATTERS RELATED TO RECIPIENT INTEGRITY AND PERFORMANCE (DECEMBER 2015) DOE, prior to making a Federal award with a to tal amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, is required to review and cons ider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrit y and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) (see 41 USC 2313). 29 The applicant, at its option, may review information in the desi gnated integrity and performance systems accessible through SAM and comment on any information about itself that a Federal awarding agency previously entere d and is currently in the desi gnated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM. DOE will consider any written comments by the app licant, in addition to the other information in the designated integrity and performance system , in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and r ecord of performance under Federa l awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as desc ribed in 2 CFR 200.206 Fe deral awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. E. INTERIM CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 1. Policy The DOE interim Conflict of Inte rest Policy for Financial Assist ance (COI Policy) can be found at https://www.energy.gov/management/pf-2022-17-depa rtment-energy-interim-conflict-interest- policy-requirements-financial . This policy is applicable to a ll non-Federal entities applying for, or that receive, DOE funding by means of a financ ial assistance award (e. g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or technology invest ment agreement) and, through th e implementation of this policy by the entity, to each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the project funded wholly or in part under the DOE financial assistance aw ard. DOE's interim COI Policy establishes standards that provide a reasonable expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of projects funded wholly or in part under DOE financial assistance awards will be free from bias resulting from financial conflicts of intere st or organizational conf licts of interest. The applicant is subject to the requi rements of the interim COI Policy and within each application for financial assistance, the applicant must certify that it is, or will be by the time of receiving any financial assistance award, comp liant with all requirements in the interim COI Policy. The applicant must flow down the requirements of the interim COI Policy to any subrecipient non- Federal entities. 2. SC Implementation SC only requires that unmanaged or unmanageable financial conflict s of interest be included in the FCOI report. 30 Section VII - QUESTION S/AGENCY CONTACTS A.

Scientific Contact Jeremy Love Jerem y.Love @science.doe. gov 31 Section VIII - SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL A. HOW-TO GUIDES 1. How to Distinguish Between a New and Renewal Application New Application: An application must be submitted as \"new\" in the following circumstances: When applying for funding to crea te a new research award that has not previously received DOE funding, including any f unding for the current year, When applying for funding to support continued research from the same applicant institution as the current grant but with a significant cha nge in fundamental nature of the research, or When applying for funding to support continue d research supported by an existing DOE award but at a new applicant institution. Renewal Application: A renewal application is appropriate when funds are requested for an award that has no changes in the following items: The recipient/applicant institution, The award's senior leadership, and The fundamental nature of the award. A change in an award's PI doe s not necessarily require submi ssion as a new application: The change in personnel must be consid ered in light of other changes. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer-reviewed app lications and must be developed as fully as though the ap plicant were applying for the fi rst time. Renewal applications must be submitted by the same s ponsoring institution as that holding the curre nt award for which renewal funding is requested, and the proposed research topic must be logical scientific extensions of the research that has been performed in the current award. 2. How Federally Affiliated Organizatio ns May Participate and Be Funded V ALUE /FUNDING FOR DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND NON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S For grant awards, the value of, and funding for, a DOE/NNSA National La boratory contractor, a non-DOE/NNSA Federally Funded Research and De velopment Center (FFRDC) contractor, or another Federal agency's portion of the work will not be included in the award to the successful applicant. DOE will fund a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory contractor through the DOE field work authorization system or other appropr iate process and may fund non-DOE/NNSA FFRDC contractors and other Federal ag encies through an interagency agreement in accordance with the Economy Act, 31 USC 1535, or ot her statutory authority. R ESPONSIBILITY The successful prime applicant/a wardee (lead organiza tion) will be the responsible authority regarding the settlement and satisfaction of a ll contractual and administrative issues, including but not limited to, disputes and claims arising out of any agreement between the applicant and 32 any team member, and/or subrecipient. If an award is made to a DOE/NNSA National La boratory, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of the DOE/NNS A National Laboratory's management and operating (M&O) contract, as a pplicable, in consultation between DOE and the prime awardee. If an award is made to another Federal agency or its FFRDC cont ractor, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms an d conditions of the interagency agreement in consultation between DOE and the prime awardee. 3. How Federally Affiliated Organizations May Apply DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATORIES DOE/NNSA National Laboratories, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, s hould ensure that their cognizant DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer provides written authori zation. This authorization should be submitted with the application as part of the Budget Ju stification for DOE/NNS A National Laboratory Contractor File. [This is not required for the National Energy Technology Laboratory because it is a Government Owned/Gove rnment Operated (GOGO).] Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in rejection of an application prior to merit review. If a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractor is se lected for award, or proposed as a team member, the proposed work will be authorized un der the DOE field work authorization system or other appropriate process a nd performed under the laboratory Contractor's M&O contract, as applicable. The following wording is acceptable for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the __ ___________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for th e laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laborat ory and will not adversely impact execution of the DOE/NNSA assigned programs at the laboratory.\" (end of acceptable authorization) If a DOE/NNSA FFRDC is selected for award nego tiation, the proposed work will be authorized under the DOE work authorization process and performed under the laboratory's Management and Operating (M&O) contract. N ON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S Non-DOE/NNSA FFRDCs, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, shoul d follow the following guidelines: The prime applicant must obtain writte n authorization for non-DOE/NNSA FFRDC participation. The cognizant Contracting Office r for the Federal agency sponsoring the FFRDC contractor must authorize in wr iting the participati on of the FFRDC contractor on the proposed 33 project and this authorization s hould be submitted with the application. The written authorization must also contain a determination that the use of a FFRDC contractor is consistent with the contractor's authority under it s award and does not place the FFRDC contractor in direct competition with the pr ivate sector, in accordance with FAR Part 17.5. Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in reje ction of an application prior to merit review. The following wording is accepta ble for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the __ ___________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for th e laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laborat ory and will not adversely impact execution of the (insert agency) assigned programs at the laboratory. Th is laboratory is authorized to perform the work pro posed in the application submitted under DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement <<Include the FOA number on the cover page>> by the following statutory authority (insert st atute name, citation, and section) .\" (end of acceptable authorization) O THER FEDERAL AGENCIES Other Federal Agencies, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, mu st include in their budget justif ications any specific statutory authorization (other th an the Economy Act) that permits their receipt of an interagency agreement or that authorizes the payment of certain costs. 4. How Consortia May be Used I NCORPORATED CONSORTIA Incorporated consortia are eligib le to apply for funding as a prim e recipient (lead organization) or subrecipient (team member). Each incorporated consortium must have an in ternal governance structure and a written set of internal rules. Upon reque st, the consortium must provide a wr itten description of its internal governance structure and its inte rnal rules to the DOE Contra cting Officer. There is no requirement that subawards be formal ized into incorporated consortia. U NINCORPORATED CONSORTIA Unincorporated consortia (team arrangements) must designate one member of the consortium to serve as the prime recipient/consortium repres entative (lead organi zation). There is no requirement that subawards be formal ized into unincorporated consortia. Upon request, unincorporated cons ortia must provide the DOE Contracting Officer with a collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as th e articles of collabora tion, which sets out the rights and responsibilities of each consortium member. This agreement binds the individual consortium members together and should discuss, among other things, the consortium's: 34 Management structure; Method of making payments to consortium members; Means of ensuring and overseeing me mbers' efforts on the project; Provisions for members' cost sharing contributions; and Provisions for ownership and rights in intell ectual property develope d previously or under the agreement. Note that a consortium is applie d for in one application and resu lts in one award with subawards to consortia members. Multi-institutional te ams may, if permitted under this FOA, submit collaborative applications with each institution submitting its own applica tion with an identical research narrative, resulting in multiple awards to the collaborating institutions. 5. How to Submit Letters of Intent Do not submit an LOI unless an FOA requires or allows their submission. It is important that the LOI be a single file wi th extension .pdf, .docx, or .doc. The filename must not exceed 50 characters. The PI and anyone submit ting on behalf of the PI must register for an account in PAMS before it will be possible to submit a LOI. All PIs and those submitting LOIs on behalf of PIs are encouraged to establis h PAMS accounts as soon as possible to avoid submission delays. Submit Your Letter of Intent: Create your LOI outside the system and save it as a file with extension .docx, .doc, or .pdf. Make a note of the location of the file on your computer so you can br owse for it later from within PAMS. Log into PAMS and click the Proposals tab.

If you choose to edit, doing so will remove your previously submitted version from consideration. If you are still edit ing at the time of the deadline, you will not have a valid submission. Please pa y attention to the deadline. 7. How to Register and Submit an Application in Grants.gov This section provides the application submission a nd receipt instructions fo r applications to SC. Please read the following instruct ions carefully and completely. E LECTRONIC DELIVERY SC is participating in the Gran ts.gov initiative to provide the gr ant community with a single site to find and apply for grant funding opportunitie s. SC requires applicants to submit their applications online through Grants.gov. H OW TO REGISTER TO APPLY THROUGH GRANTS .GOV a. Instructions: Read the instru ctions below about registering to apply for SC funds. Applicants 37 should read the registration instru ctions carefully and prepare th e information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing an d assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information. Organizations must have a Data Universal Nu mbering System (DUNS) Number, active System for Award Management (SAM) registration, and Grants.gov account to apply for grants. If individual applicants are eligible to apply for this FOA, then you may begin with step 3, Create a Grants.gov Account, listed below. Creating a Grants.gov account can be complete d online in minutes, but DUNS and SAM registrations may take several w eeks. Therefore, an organization' s registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entity's ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Complete organization registration instru ctions can be found on 1) Obtain a DUNS Number : All entities applying for fund ing, including renewal funding, must have a DUNS Number from Dun & Bradst reet (D&B). Applican ts must enter the DUNS the data entry field la beled \"Organizational DUNS\" on the SF-424 form. For more detailed refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/gran ts/applicants/organ ization-registrati on/step-1-obtain- SAM : All organizations applying onlin e through Grants.gov must register with SAM at https://www.sam.gov . Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants .gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For more detailed instructions for register ing with SAM, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants /applicants/organization-re gistration/step-2-register- with-sam.html 3) Create a Grants.gov Account : The next step is to regist er an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on-screen instructions or refer to the detailed instructions here: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants /applicants/registration.html 4) Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account : A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant) or an individual applicant. If you work for or consult with multiple organi zations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access a ll of your grant applications. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the DUNS Number for the organization in the DUNS field while adding a profile. For more de tailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/appli cants/registration/ add-profile.html 5) EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles : After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the organization applicant' s request for Grants.gov roles 38 and access is sent to the Electronic Busine ss Point of Contact (EBiz POC). The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and aut horize the appropriate roles, which may include the Authorized Organization Repr esentative (AOR) role , thereby giving you permission to complete and s ubmit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online a ny time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For more detailed inst ructions about creating a prof ile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applican ts/registration/au thorize-roles.html 6) Track Role Status : To track your role request, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/gran ts/applicants/registrati on/track-role-status.html b. Electronic Signature : When applications ar e submitted through Grants .gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that su bmitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the appli cation, serving as the electroni c signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding co mmitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed a nd it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. H OW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO SC VIA GRANTS .GOV Grants.gov applicants can apply online usi ng Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each F OA, you can create individual instances of a workspace. Below is an overview of appl ying on Grants.gov. For access to comp lete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/a pplicants/apply-for-grants.html 1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allo ws you to complete it online and route it through your organization for re view before submitting. 2) Complete a Workspace: Add participants to the workspace, complete all the required forms, and check for errors before submission. a. Adobe Reader: If you decide not to a pply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace so that they will appear similar to other Standard forms. The individual PDF forms can be dow nloaded and saved to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drives, then accessed through Adobe Reader. NOTE: Visit the Adobe Software Compatib ility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software at: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applican ts/adobe-software- compatibility.html b. Mandatory Fields in Forms: In the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk and a different background color. These fiel ds are mandatory fields that must be 39 completed to successfully submit your application. c. Complete SF-424 Fields First: The form s are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the a pplicant name, address, and DUNS number. To trigger this feature, an app licant must complete the SF-424 in formation first. Once it is completed, the information will transfer to the other forms. 3) Submit a Workspace: An application may be submitted through wo rkspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application package at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues th at may disrupt the application submission. 4) Track a Workspace: After successfully submitting a wo rkspace package, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automati cally assigned to the package. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. For additional training resources, in cluding video tutori als, and email at support@Grants.gov . For questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number lis ted in the application packag e of the grant you are applying for. If you are experiencing diff iculties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Cent er ticket number will as sist SC with tracking your issue and understanding backgr ound information on the issue. T IMELY RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS AND PROOF OF TIMELY SUBMISSION Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. Applicant AORs w ill also receive the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When SC successfully retrie ves the application from Gr ants.gov, and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the app licant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receiv es your application. Applications received by Gran ts.gov after the establis hed due date for th e program will be considered late and may not be considered for funding by SC. Applicants using slow internet, such as dial- up connections, should be aware that transmission 40 can take some time before Grants.gov receiv es your application. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received tran smission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role. The Grants.gov Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. Please be patient and give th e system time to process the application. 8. How to Prepare an Application A PPLICATION PREPARATION You must submit the application through Grants.gov at https://www.Grants.gov/ , using either the online webforms or downloaded forms. (Addi tional instructions are provided in 7., above .) You are required to use the co mpatible version of Adobe Read er software to complete a Grants.gov Adobe application package. To ensure you have the Grants.gov compatible version of Adobe Reader, visit the soft ware compatibility page at https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applican ts/adobe-software- compatibility.html . You must complete the mandatory forms and any applicable optional forms (e.g., Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (SF-LLL)) in accordance with the instructions on the forms and the additional instructions below. Files that are attached to the forms must be PD F files unless otherwise specified in this FOA. Attached PDF files must be plain files consisting of text, numbers, and images without editable fields, signatures, passwords, re dactions, or other advanced fe atures available in some PDF- compatible software. Do not us e PDF portfolios or binders. Please note the following restrictions that appl y to the names of all files attached to your application: Please limit file names to 50 or fewer characters Do not attach any documents with the same na me. All attachments must have a unique name. Please use only the following characters when naming your attachment s: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore, brackets, ampersand, tilde, exclamation point, comma, semi colon, apostrophe, at sign, number sign, dollar sign, percent sign, plus sign, and equa l sign. Attachments that do not follow this rule may cause the entire application to be rejected or cause issues during processing. R ENEWAL APPLICATIONS For renewal applications only, the PI is required to submit a Renewal Proposal Products section through the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . The PI must enter into PAMS each product created during the course of th e previous project period. Types of products include publications, intellectual pr operty, technologies or technique s, and other products such as databases or software. As soon as the renewa l application is assi gned to a DOE Program Manager, the PI will receive an automated email from PAMS (<PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >) instructing him or her to navigate to the PAMS Task tab 41 to complete and submit the Re newal Proposal Products. The submit ted product list will be sent for merit review as part of the application. The application will not be considered complete and cannot be sent for review until th e product list has been submitted. R ESUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA may be withdrawn fro m consideration by using the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . Applications may be withdrawn at any time between when the applicant submits the ap plication and when DOE makes the application available to merit reviewers. Such withdrawals take effect immediately and cannot be reversed. Please exercise due caution. After the applicati on is made available to merit reviewers, the applicant may contact the DOE pr ogram office identified in this FOA to request that it be withdrawn. After an application is withdrawn, it may be resubmitted, if this FOA is still open for the submission of applications. Such resubmissions will only count as one submission if this FOA restricts the number of applic ations from an applicant. Note that there may be a delay between the application's sub mission in Grants.gov and when it is available to be withdrawn in PAMS . SC will usually consider the last submission, according to its Grants.gov timestamp, to be the intended version. Pl ease consult with your program manager to resolve any confusion about which version of an application should be considered. I MPROPER CONTENTS OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA will be st ored in controlled-access systems, but they may be made publicly available if an award is made. As such, it is critical that applicants follow these guidelines: Do not include information subject to any le gal restriction on its open distribution, whether classified, export control, or unclassif ied controlled nuclear information. Do not include sensitive and protected personall y identifiable information, including social security numbers, birthdates, citizenship, mar ital status, or home addr esses. Pay particular attention to the content of biographi cal sketches and curriculum vitae. Do not include letters of s upport from Federal officials. Do not include letters of support on Federal lette rhead. Letters that are not letters of support (such as letters confirming access to sites, faci lities, equipment, or data; or letters from cognizant Contracting Officers) may be on Federal letterhead. Clearly mark all proprietary or trade-secret information. C HANGE OF AWARDEE INSTITUTION If an awardee chooses to relinquish an award made under this FOA to permit the transfer of the award to a new institution, the new instituti on must submit an application under the then- available SC \"annual\" or \"open\" FOA. 9. How to Prepare a Biographical Sketch 42 A biographical sketch is to provide information that can be used by reviewers to evaluate the PI's potential for leadership within the scientific co mmunity.

How to Prepare Current and Pending Support WARNING : These instructions have been significantly revi sed to require disclosure of a variety of potential conf licts of interest or commitment, including participation in foreign government-s ponsored talent recruitment programs. Current and Pending support is intended to al low the identification of potential duplication, 44 overcommitment, potential conflict s of interest or commitment, a nd all other sources of support. The PI and each senior/key person at the pr ime applicant and any pr oposed subaward must provide a list of all sponsored activities, awards, a nd appointments, whether paid or unpaid; provided as a gift with terms or conditions or provided as a gift without terms or conditions; full- time, part-time, or voluntary; f aculty, visiting, adjunct, or honorar y; foreign dir ectly supporting the indivi dual's research or indirectly supporting the individual by supporting st udents, research staff, space, equipment, or other research expenses. All fo reign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs must be identified in current and pending support. SC requires the use of the format approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which may be generated by the Science Experts Networ k Curriculum Vita (SciENcv), a cooperative venture maintained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ , and is also available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/po licy/nsfapprovedformats/cps.pdf . The use of a format required by another agency is intended to reduce the ad ministrative burden to re searchers by promoting the use of common formats. For every activity, list the following items: The sponsor of the activit y or the source of funding. The award or other identifying number. The title of the award or activit y. If the title of the award or ac tivity is not de scriptive, add a brief description of the research being pe rformed that would identify any overlaps or synergies with the proposed research.

Details of any obligations, contra ctual or otherwise, to any pr ogram, entity, or organization sponsored by a foreign government must be provid ed on request to either the applicant institution or DOE. 12. How to Prepare a Data Management Plan In general, a DMP should addre ss the following requirements: 1. DMPs should describe whether and how data generated in the course of the proposed research will be shared and preserved. If the plan is not to share and/or preserve certain data, then the plan must explain the basis of the de cision (for example, cost/benefit considerations, other parameters of feasibility, sc ientific appropriateness, or limit ations discussed in #4). At a 45 minimum, DMPs must describe how data sharing and preservation will en able validation of results, or how results could be validated if data are not shared or preserved. 2. DMPs should provide a plan for making all rese arch data displayed in publications resulting from the proposed research open, machine-readable, and digitall y accessible to the public at the time of publication. This incl udes data that are displayed in ch arts, figures, images, etc. In addition, the underlying digital rese arch data used to generate the displayed data should be made as accessible as possible to the public in accordance with the principles stated in the Office of Science Statement on Digital Data Management ( https://science .osti.gov/funding- opportunities/digital- data-management . This requirement could be met by including the data as supplementary information to the published article, or through other means. The published article should indicate how th ese data can be accessed. 3. DMPs should consult and reference available in formation about data management resources to be used in the course of the proposed rese arch. In particular, DMPs that explicitly or implicitly commit data manageme nt resources at a facility beyond what is conventionally made available to approved users should be accompanied by written approval from that facility. In determining the re sources available for data mana gement at Office of Science User Facilities, researchers should consult th e published description of data management resources and practices at that facility and reference it in th e DMP. Information about other Office of Science facili ties can be found at https://science.osti.gov/user-facilities/ . 4. DMPs must protect confidentiality, personal privacy, Personally Iden tifiable Information, and U.S. national, homeland, and economic secur ity; recognize proprietary interests, business confidential information, and intellectual prope rty rights; avoid signifi cant negative impact on innovation, and U.S. competitiveness; and ot herwise be consistent with all applicable laws, and regulations. There is no requi rement to share pr oprietary data. DMPs will be reviewed as part of the overall SC research proposal merit review process. Applicants are encouraged to consult the SC we bsite for further informat ion and suggestions for how to structure a DMP: https://science.osti.gov/funding-opport unities/digital-da ta-management 13. How to Prepare a Research and Related Budget and Justification The following advice will improve th e accuracy of your budget request: Funds requested for personnel (s enior, key, and other) must be justified as the product of their effort on the project and their institutional base salary. Funds requested for fringe benef its must be calculated as the product of the requested salary and, if present, the negotiated fringe benefit rate containe d in an institu tion's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement. Funds requested for indirect cost s must be calculated using the correct indirect cost base and the negotiated indirect cost rate. You are encouraged to include the rate agreemen t used in preparing a budget as a part of the budget justification. Do not prepare a budget justification using the expired DOE form F4260.1. If you are proposing indirect costs an d do not already have an Indire ct Cost Rate Agreement with your Cognizant Federal Agency or documentation of rates accepted for estimating purposes by DOE or another Federal agency, it is recommended that you begi n preparing an Indirect Cost 46 Rate Proposal to be submitted, upon request, to the DOE contract specialist/grants management specialist who will evaluate your applica tion if you are selected for award. For your convenience in preparing an Indirect Cost Rate proposal, a link to applicant resources, including indirect rate model temp lates, has been provided below: https://science.osti.gov/sbir/appli cant-resources/grant-application/ . Budget Fields Section A Senior/Key Person For each Senior/Key Person, enter the requested information. List personnel, base salary, the numbe r of months that person will be allocated to the project, requested sa lary, fringe benefits, and the total funds requested for each person.

How to Register in PAMS After you submit your application through Grants.gov, th e application will automatically transfer into the Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS) for processing by the DOE SC. Many functions for grants and cooperative agreemen ts can be done in PAMS, which is available at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . You will want to \"register to\" your application: a process of linking yourself to the application after it has been submitted thr ough Grants.gov and processed by DOE. You must register in PAMS to submit a pre-application or a LOI. Notifications sent from the PAMS system will come from the PAMS email address <PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >. Please make sure your em ail server/software allows delivery of emails from the PAMS email address to yours. Registering to PAMS is a two-step process; once you create an individual account, you must associate yourself with (\"register to\") your institution. Detailed steps are listed below. 49 CREATE PAMS ACCOUNT : To register, click the \"Create Ne w PAMS Account\" link on the website https://pamspublic .science.energy.gov/ . Click the \"No, I have never had an account\" link and then the \"Create Account\" button.

Corporate Felony Conviction and Federal Tax Liability Representations (March 2014) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: It is not a corporation that has been convicted of a felony cr iminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months, It is not a corporation that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that ha s been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies ha ve been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. For purposes of these representations the following definitions apply: 56 A Corporation includes any entity that has file d articles of incorporation in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or the various territories of the United States [but not foreign corporations]. It incl udes both for-profit and non-profit organizations. 6. Environmental, Safety and Health (ES&H) Performance of Work at DOE Facilities With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award which is performed at a DOE-owned or controlled site, the recipien t agrees to comply with all state and Federal ES&H regulations, and with all other ES&H requirements of the operator of such site. Prior to the performance on any work at a DOE-Own ed or controlled site, the recipient shall contact the site facility manager for informati on on DOE and site-speci fic ES&H requirements. The recipient shall apply this provisi on to all subrecipients at any tier. 7. Federal, State, and Local Requirements With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award, the recipient agrees to comply with all applicable local, state, a nd Federal ES&H regulati ons. The recipient shall apply this provision to all sub awardees at any tier. 8. Funding Restrictions Funding for all awards and future budget periods are contingent upon the availability of funds appropriated by Congress for the purpose of this program and the availability of future-year budget authority. Cost Principles : Costs must be allowable, allocable and reasonable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Pre-award Costs : Recipients may charge to an award resulting from this FOA pre-award costs that were incurred within the 90-day calendar pe riod immediately preceding the effective date of the award, if the costs are allowable in accordance with the applicable Fe deral cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Recipients must obtain the prio r approval of the DOE Contrac ting Officer for any pre-award costs that are for peri ods greater than this 90-day calendar period. Pre-award costs are incurred at the applicant's risk. DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the a pplicant does not receive an award or if the award is made for a lesser amount than the applicant expected. 9. National Environmental Po licy Act (NEPA) Compliance If question 4.a. on the \"Research and Related Ot her Project Informatio n\" document indicates \"potential impact on the enviro nment\", or if DOE's own review indicates it, DOE may ask the 57 applicant to provide additional informati on on those impacts in or der to prepare an environmental critique/synopsis per 10 CFR 1021.216. Note that this pre- award environmental critique/synopsis process would be separate from the prepar ation of a NEPA document such as an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment (EA). If DOE determines the latter documentation is necessa ry, this process would need to be completed, funded by and with the participation of the awar dee, prior to them taking any action on the proposed project that could have adverse environmental effects or that could limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Note that in most ca ses, even when \"Potential Impact to the Environment\" is checked \"Yes,\" preparation of such NEPA docu ments is rarely necessary, but DOE has the expectation that the Applicant will disclose the potential, which would serve to initiate dialog with DOE if necessary. The inab ility to satisfy the NEPA requirements after an award would result in cancellation of the award. 10. Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agre ements Representa tions (June 2015) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: (1) It does not and will not require its employees or contractor s to sign internal nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements or st atements prohibiting or otherwis e restricting its employees or contactors from lawfully reporti ng waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal depart ment or agency authorized to receive such information. (2) It does not and will not use any Federal funds to implement or enforce any nondisclosure and/or confidentiality policy, fo rm, or agreement it uses unless it contains the following provisions: a. ''These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1) classified in formation, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, right s, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive orders and statutory pr ovisions are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.'' b. The limitation above shall no t contravene requirements ap plicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other fo rm issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. c. Notwithstanding provision listed in para graph (a), a nondisclosure or confidentiality policy form or agreement that is to be executed by a person connected with the conduct of an intelligence or intelligen ce-related activity, other than an employee or officer of the United States Government, may contain provisio ns appropriate to th e particular activity for which such document is to be used. Such form or agreement shall, at a minimum, require that the person will not disclose any cl assified information received in the course of such activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the United States Government. Such nondisclosure or confidentia lity forms shall also make it clear that they do not bar disclosures to Congress, or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice, that are essential to reporting a substantia l violation of law. 58 11. Notice Regarding Eligible /Ineligible Activities Eligible activities under this program include those which describe and promote the understanding of scientific and technical aspects of specific en ergy technologies, but not those which encourage or support political activitie s such as the collecti on and dissemination of information related to potential, planned or pending legislation. 12.

Rights in Technical Data 60 Normally, the government has unlim ited rights in technical data cr eated under a DOE agreement, including the right to distribute to the public. Delivery or third party licensing of proprietary software or data developed sole ly at private expense (\"Limited Rights Data\") will not normally be required except as specifically negotiated in a particular ag reement to satisfy DOE's own needs or to insure the comme rcialization of technology deve loped under a DOE agreement. If software is specified for deli very to DOE, or if other specia l circumstances exist, e.g., DOE specifying \"open-source\" treatm ent of software, then the DOE Contracting Officer, after negotiation with the recipient, ma y include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the DOE Contractin g Officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government li cense, and/or otherwis e altering the copyright provisions. 19. Subaward and Executive Reporting Additional administrative requireme nts necessary for DOE grants and cooperative agreements to comply with the Federal Funding and Transparen cy Act of 2006 (FFATA) are contained in 2 CFR 170. (See: www.eCFR.gov ). Prime awardees must register with the new FSRS database at https://www.fsrs.gov and report the required data on their firs t tier subrecipients. Prime awardees must report the executive compensation for their own executives as part of their registration profile in SAM. 20. Title to Subject Inventions Ownership of subject inventi ons is governed pursuant to the authorities listed below: Nonprofit organizations or small business firms : Under the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 200 et seq.), nonprofit organizations or small business firms as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 may elect to retain title to their subject inven tions subject to the above identified U.S. Competitiveness Provision. All other parties : The federal Non-Nuclear Energy Act of 1974, 42. U.S.C. 5908, provides that the government obtains titl e to new inventions unless a wa iver is granted (see below). Patent Waiver : Applicants may request a waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in inventions conceive d or first actually reduced to practice in performance of an agreement as a result of this FOA, in advance of or within 30 days afte r the effective date of the award. Even if such advance waiver is not re quested or the request is denied, the recipient will have a continuing right under the award to request a waiver of the rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of the award. Any patent waiver that may be granted is subject to certain terms and conditions in 10 CFR 784. For more information, see https://energy.gov/gc/ser vices/technology-transfer-and-procur ement/office-assistant-general- counsel-technology-transf-1 . Nonprofit organizations and sma ll business firms do not need a patent waiver in order to retain title to their subject inve ntions (see above). 61 Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) : On June 07, 2021, DOE approved a DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (DEC) UNDER THE BAYH-DOLE ACT TO FURTHER PROMOT E DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE OF DOE SCIENCE AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. In accord ance with this DEC, all awards, including sub-awards, under th is FOA shall include the U.S. Competitiveness Provision in accordance with Section 21 of this FOA. A copy of the DEC can be found at https://www.energy.gov/gc/determinatio n-exceptional-circumstances-decs . Pursuant to 37 CFR \u00a7 401.4, any nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 affected by any DEC has the righ t to appeal it by providing written notice to DOE within 30 working days from the time it receives a copy of the determination. DOE may require additional submissions or re quirements as authori zed by any applicable DEC. [IF APPLICABLE] DEC : QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES DEC : On August 28, 2020, DOE approved a DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THE BAYH-DOLE ACT FOR QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE TECHNOLOGIES, pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2), which applies to agreements issued under this FOA requiring each applicant to agree to a U.S. Competitiveness Provision. DOE has determined that exceptional circumstance s exist that warrant the modification of the standard patent rights clause for small bus inesses and non-profit awardees under the Bayh- Dole Act, 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq., to the exte nt necessary to ensure that DOE \"obtains sufficient rights in the federally supported inventions to meet the needs of [DOE]\" and \"to promote the commercialization a nd public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industr y and labor\" and/or further pr omote other purposes of the Bayh-Dole Act. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 200. In accordance with this DEC, all awards, including sub-awards, under this FOA shall include the U. S. Competitiveness Provision above. A copy of the DEC can be found at https://www.energy.gov/gc/determination-exceptional- circumstances-decs . [IF APPLICABLE] Class Patent Waiver : DOE has issued Class Patent Waiver No. W(C) 2020-001 of Patent Rights Related to Quantu m Information Scien ce and its Technology Applications that applies to this FOA for any domestic large business that is a recipient, or subrecipient at any tier to this FOA and is providing at least 20% cost share. Under this Class Patent Waiver, domestic large businesses may elect t itle to their subject inve ntions similar to the right provided to the domestic small businesses, educational instituti ons, and nonprofits by law. In order to avail itself of the class patent waiv er, a domestic large busines s must agree that any products embodying or produced through the use of a subject invention first created or reduced to practice under this program will be substantially manufactured in the United States. Entities not eligible under the Class Pate nt Waiver are still able to pe tition DOE for rights under an Advanced or Identified Patent Waiver as described above. Nonprofit organizations and small bu siness firms do not need a patent waiver in order to retain title to their subject inventions (see above). 21. U.S. Competitiveness A primary objective of DOE's multi-billion dol lar research, developm ent and demonstration 62 investments is to cultivate new research and development ecosystems, manufacturing capabilities, and supply chains for and by U.S. industry and labor. Therefore, in exchange for receiving taxpayer dollars to s upport an applicant's project, th e applicant must agree to the following U.S. Competitiveness Provision as part of an awar d under this FOA. (m) U.S. Competitiveness The Recipient agrees that any products em bodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject i nvention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Recipient can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Governme nt's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, e.g., alternative bindi ng commitments to provi de an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. Th e Recipient agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject i nvention to any entity, at any tie r, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Recipient or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Inve ntion undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Recipient or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (m) and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within 6 months of the cha nge. The Recipient and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragr aph (m). The Recipient will include this paragraph (m) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier , for experimental, developmental or research work. (n) The requirements, rights and administrati on of paragraph (m) are further clarified as follows: 1. Waivers. The Recipient (or any entity subject to paragraph (m)) may request a waiver or modification of para graph (m). Such waivers or modifications ma y be granted when DOE determines that (1) the Recipient (or any entity subject to paragraph (m)) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (2) a waiver or mo dification would best se rve the interests of the United States and the general public. 2. Final determination of breach of paragraph (m). If DOE determines the Recipient is in breach of paragraph (m), the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determin ation includes a demand for titl e to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions under th e award to the United States Government, including a ll pending U.S. and foreign patent applications an d all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject inve ntion, without compensa tion. Any such final determination shall be si gned by the cognizant DOE Cont racting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Couns el for Technology Transfer & Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Recipient before any final written determination by DOE is issued. 63 3. Pursuant to Recipient's agreement in paragraph (m) to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (m): any such license , assignment, or other transf er of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (m) suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, as signee, or other transf eree of rights to any subject invention is finally de termined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (m), the applicable license, a ssignment or other transfer sh all be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for commen t to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made. 4. For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject inve ntion is due to a breach of paragraph (m), the Recipient shall not be enti tled to any compensati on, or to a license to the subject invention including th e reserved license in section (e)(1), unless DOE grants a license through a separately ag reed upon licensing agreement. 5. Authority. The requirements and administra tion of paragraph (m) is in accordance with the Determination of Exceptional Circ umstances (DEC) under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies executed by DOE on June 7, 2021. A copy of the DEC is available at https://www.energy.gov/gc/determinatio n-exceptional-circumstances-decs . By accepting or acknowledging the award, the Recipient is also acknowledging that it has received a copy of the DEC through the foregoing link. As set forth in 37 CFR 401.4, any nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 affected by any DEC has the right to appeal the imposition of the DEC within thirty (30) working days from the Recipient's acceptance or acknow ledgement of this award. Please note that a subject invention is any inve ntion conceived or first actually reduced in performance of work under an award. An invention is any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable. The r ecipient includes any awardee, recipient, sub-awardee, or sub-recipient. As noted in the U.S. Competitiveness Provision, if an entity cannot meet the requirements of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision, the entity may re quest a modification or waiver of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision. For example, the entity may propose modifying the language of the U.S. Competitiveness Provision in order to change the scope of the requirements or to provide more specifics on the application of the requi rements for a particular technology. As another example, the entity may request that the U.S. Competitiveness Provision be waived in lieu of a net benefits statement or U.S. manufacturing plan. The statement or plan would contain specific and enforceable commitments that would be beneficial to the U.S. economy and competitiveness. Examples of such commitment s could include manufacturing specific products in the U.S., making a specific investment in a new or existing U.S. manufacturing facility, keeping certain activities based in the U.S. or supporting a certain number of jobs in the U.S. related to the techno logy. DOE may, in its sole discre tion, determine that the proposed modification or waiver promotes commercializa tion and provides sufficient U.S. economic benefits, and grant the request. If granted, DOE will modify the award te rms and conditions for the requesting entity accordingly. 64 The U.S. Competitiveness Provision is implement ed by DOE pursuant to a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) under the Ba yh-Dole Act and DOE Patent Waivers. 65 D.

Consortium or sub-award agreement Consortium or sub-award agreement means a formalized agreement whereby a research project is carried out by the grantee and one or more other organizations that are separate legal entities. Under the agreement, the grantee must perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned research and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. These agreements typically invo lve a specific level of e ffort from the consortium organization's PD/PI and a categorical br eakdown of costs, such as personnel, supplies, and other allowable expenses, including F&A costs. The relationship between the recipient and the collaboratin g organizations is considered a sub- award relationship.

Cost sharing or matching Cost sharing or matching means the portion of pr oject costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). See also 2 CFR 200.306 Cos t sharin g or matchin g. Deadline Deadline means the published date and/or time that a grant application is to be submitted to the fundin g agency. Debarment and suspension Debarment and suspension means the actions taken by a debarring official in accordance with OMB guidance at 2 CF R 180, \"Non-procurement Debarment and Suspension,\" to exclude a person or organization from participating in grants and other non-procurement awards government-wide. If debarred or suspended, the person or organization may not receive financial assistance (under a grant, cooperative agreement, or sub-award, or contract under a grant) for a specified period of time. Debarments and suspensions carried out pursuant to 2 CFR 376 are distinct from post-award suspension action by an awardin g agency. See 2 CFR 901 for DOE implementation. Direct costs Direct costs means costs that can be identifie d specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high de gree of accurac y. See 2 CFR 200.413. Disallowed costs Disallowed costs means those charges to a Federal award that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines to be unallowable, in accordance with the applicab le Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Domestic organization Domestic organization means a public (including a State or other governmental agency) or private non-profit or for-profit organization that is located in the United States or its territories, is subject to U.S. laws, and assumes legal and financial accountability for awarded funds and for the performance of the grant-supported activities. DUNS number DUNS number means a nine-digit number and by Dun and Bradstree t to uniquel y identif y a business entit y. Effort Effort means the amount of time, usually expressed as a percentage of the total, which a faculty member or ot her employee spends on a sponsored project. No one is allowed to spend more than 100% total commitment on all academic activities, including grant-s ponsored research, university-sponsored research, teaching, administ ration, advising and other contracted duties. Effort is indicate d on the budget in units of person-months. Equipment Equipment means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non-Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. See also 2 CFR 200.1 Capital assets, Computing devices, General purpose equipment, Information technology systems, Special purpose equipment, and Su pplies. Expanded authorities Expanded authorities means authorization to grantees under certain research grant mechanisms which waives the requirement for prior agency approval for specified actions related to awards. Example: 90-day pre-award spending authority, no cost extensions for up to one additional year, and automatic carryover of unobligated funds from one budget period to the next. The expanded authorities are now contained in the standard terms and conditions for mos t research grants. Expiration date Expiration date means generally, the date signifying the end of the current project period, afte r which the grantee is no t authorized to obli gate grant funds. 69 Facilities and administrative costs Facilities and administrative costs means costs that are incurred by a grantee for common or joint objectives and th at, therefore, cannot be identified specifically with a particular project or program. Thes e costs also are known as indirec t costs. Federal financial report Federal financial report means submitted on Standard Form (SF) 425, to indicate the status of awarded funds for the period covered. Frequency of reporting is specified in the Reporting Ch ecklist provided as part of the award documents. Financial assistance Financial assistance means transfer by DOE of money or property to an eligible entit y to suppor t or stimulate a public purpose authorized by statute. Financial status report Financial status repor t means see Federal Financial Report. Foreign travel Foreign travel is meant to include travel ou tside of North America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) and U.S. territories and possessions (Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Ri co, the U.S. Virgin Islands. A trip is considered foreign travel for all legs of the itinerary if the traveler does not return to his or her post prior to departure for a foreign destination. Costs for foreign travel ma y be restricted by the lan guage of a Fundin g Opportunit y Announcement. Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) means A publicly available document by which a Federal Agency makes known its intentions to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, usually as a result of competition for funds. Funding opportunity announcements may be known as program announcements, requests for applications, notices of funding availability, solicitations, or other names depending on the Agency and type of program. Funding opportunity announcements can be found at www.Grants. gov. An FOA ma y also be known as a solicitation. Grant agreement Grant agreement means a legal instrument of financial assistance between a Federal awarding agency or pass-throug h entity and a non-Federal entity that, consistent with 31 USC 6302, 6304: (a) Is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value from the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to the non-Federal entity to carry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 USC 6101(3)); and not to acquire property or services for the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity's direct benefit or use; (b) Is distinguished from a cooperative agreement in that it does not provide for substantial involvement betw een the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity in carrying out the activity contemplated by th e Federal award. (c) Does not include an agre ement that pr ovides only: (1) Direct United States Government cash assistance to an individual; (2) A subsidy; (3) A loan; (4) A loan guarantee; or (5) Insurance. Grant-supported project or activity Grant-supported project or activity means those activities specified or described in a grant application or in a subsequent submission that are approved by DOE for funding, regardless of whether Federal funding constitutes all or only a portion of the financial support necessary to carry them out. Grantee Grantee means the organization or individual awarded a grant or cooperative agreement by DOE that is responsible an d accountable for th e use of the funds provided and for the performance of th e grant-supported project or activity. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if a particular component is designated in award documents. The grantee is legally responsible and accountable to DOE fo r the performance and financial aspects of the grant- 70 supported project or activit y. Also known as awardee o r recipient. Grants.gov Grants.gov (https://www.Grants.gov/ ) has been designated by the Office of Management and Budget as the single access point for all grant programs offered by 26 Federal grant-making agenci es. It provides a si ngle interface for agencies to announce their grant opportun ities and for all applicants to find and apply for those oppor tunities. Indirect costs (facilities & administrative) Indirect (F&A) costs means those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitte d, without effort di sproportionate to the results achieved. To facilitate equitabl e distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be n ecessary to establish a number of pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools must be distributed to benefitted cost objectives on bases th at will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits derived. Institutional base salary Institutional base salary means the annual compensation paid by an organization for an employee's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient car e, or other activities. Base salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties for the applicant/grantee organization. Base salary may not be increased as a resul t of replacin g organizational salar y funds with grant funds. Matching or cost sharing Matching or cost sharing means the value of third-party in-kind contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted project or program not borne by the Federal government. Matching or cost sharing may be required by statute or program regulation. Costs used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements are subject to the same policies governing allowability as other costs unde r the approve d budget. Merit (or peer) review Merit (or peer) review means the process that involves the consistent application of standards and procedures that produce fair, equitable, and objective examinations of applications base d on an evaluation of scientific or technical merit or other relevant aspect s of the application. The review is performed by experts (reviewers) in the field of endeavor for which support is requested. Merit review is intended to provide guidance and to the DOE individuals responsible fo r makin g award decisions. Monitoring Monitoring means a process whereby the programmatic and business management performance aspects of a grant are assessed by reviewing information gathered from various requir ed reports, audits, site visits, and othe r sources. NEPA NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Public Law 91- 190, as amended. NEPA requires Federa l agencies to assess the environmental effects of proposed ma jor Federal actions prior to makin g decisions. No-cost extension No-cost extension means an extension of time to a project period and/or budget period to complete the work of the grant under that period, without additional Federal funds o r competition. Non-Federal share Non-Federal share means when cost sharing or matching is required as a condition of an award, the portion of allowable project/program costs not borne by the Federal government. Obligations Obligations when used in connection with a non-Federal entity's utilization of funds under a Federal award, obligations means orders placed for property and services, contracts and sub-awards made, and similar transactions during a given period that require payment by the non-Federal entity during the same or a future period. OMB circulars OMB circulars means government-wide guidance issued to Heads of Federal agencies by the Directo r of the Office of Mana gement and Bud get. Other significant contributors Other significant contributors means individuals who have committed to contribute to the scientific developmen t or execution of the project, but are no t 71 committing any specified measurable effort (i.e., person months) to the project. These individuals are typically presented at \"effort of zero person months\" or \"as needed.\" Individuals with measurab le effort may not be listed as Other Significant Contributors (OSCs). Consultants should be included if they meet this definition. Program participant Program participants are the recipients of servi ce or training provided at a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium or other short-term instructional or information-sharing activity funded by an external grant or award, or the training beneficiaries of the project or program funded by an external grant or award. A participant is not involved in providing any deliverable to the grantee or a third party or woul d not be terminated o r replaced fo r failure to perform. Participant support costs Participant support costs means direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances , and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences, o r trainin g projects. Person months Person months is the metric for expressing the effort (amount of time) PD/PI(s), faculty and other senior/key personnel devote to a specific project. The effort is based on the type of appointment of the individual with the organization; e.g., calendar year, academic year, and/or summer term; and the organization's definition of such. For instance, some institutions define the academic year as a 9-month appointment while others define it as a 10-month appointment. Pre-application or pre- proposal Pre-application or pre-proposal means a brief outline or narrative of proposed work and sometimes budget, for informal review by a sponsor to determine whether an application should be submitted. Three predominant reasons for requiring submission of a preliminary pre-application are: Reduce the applicant's unnecessary e ffort in proposal preparation when the chance of success is very small. This is particularly true of exploratory initiatives where the community senses that a major new direction is being identified, or competitions that will result in a small number of actual awards. Increase the overall quality of the submission. Distill the number of applications that will be submitted to the agency and the numbe r of anticipated reviewers neede d to review. Pre-award costs Pre-award costs means any cost incurred prior to the beginning date of the project period or the initial budget period of a competitive segment (under a multi-year award), in anticip ation of the award and at the applicant's own risk, for otherwise allowable costs. Prior approval Prior approval means written approval from the designated Contracting Office r. Program Director/ Principal Investigator Program Director/ Principal Investigator means the individual(s) designated by the applicant organization to have the appropriate level of authority and responsibility to direct the project or program to be supported by the award. The applicant organization may designate multiple individuals as program directors/principal investigators (P D/PIs) who share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. When multiple PD/PIs are named, each is responsible and accountable to the app licant organization, or as ap propriate, to a collaborating organization for the proper conduct of the project or program including the submission of all required reports. The presence of more than one PD/PI on an application or award diminishes neither the responsibility nor the accountabilit y of an y individual PD/PI. Program income Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award durin g the period of performance excep t as provide d in 2 CFR 200.307 72 paragraph (f). (See 2 CFR 200.1 Period of performance.) Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See also 2 CFR 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval). See also 35 USC 200- 212 \"Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards\" for inventions made under Federal awards. Program Manager Program Manager means the DOE official responsible for the programmatic, scientific, and/or technical aspects of a grant. The same role is filled by Program Directors, Program Officers, or Project Directors at other Federal agencies. Progress report Progress report means periodic, frequently annual, report submitted by the grantee and used by DOE to assess progress and to determine whether to provide fundin g for the budget period subsequen t to tha t covered by the report. Project/performance site Project/ performance site means location(s) of where the work described in the research plan will be conducted. Project period Project period means the total time for which Federal support of a project has been programmatically approved as shown in the award documents; however, it does not constitute a commitment by the Federal government to fund the entire period. The total award period comprises the initial competitive segment, any subsequent competitive segments resulting from a renewal award(s), and extensions. Proposal See application. Re-budgeting Re-budgeting means reallocation of funds available for spending between approved budget categories to allow best use of funds to accomplish the project goals. Recipient Recipient means the organizational entity or individual receiving a grant or cooperative a greement. Renewal application Renewal application means an application requesting additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer reviewed applications and must be developed as full y as thou gh the applican t is appl ying for the firs t time. Research Research is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. See 2 CFR 200.1 Research and Development (R&D). Research misconduct Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion. See 10 CFR 733. SAM.gov SAM.gov is the System for Award Management (SAM) a consolidated service that includes Entity Registration, Assist ance Listings, and other services for makin g, mana ging, and receivin g Federal awards. Scope of work Scope of work means the aims, objec tives, and purposes of a grant; as well as the methodology, approach, analyses or other activities; and the tools, technologies, and timeframes needed to meet the grant's objectives. This includes the research or training pl an included with the original grant application, alon g with an y approved modifications. Senior/Key Personnel Senior/Key personnel means the PD/PI and other individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of a project in a substantive, measurable way, whether or not they receive salaries or compensation under the grant. T ypicall y, these individuals have doctoral o r othe r professional 73 degrees, although individuals at the ma sters or baccalaureate level may be considered senior/key personnel if their involvement meets this definition. Consultants and those with a postdoctoral role also may be considered senior/key personnel if they meet this definition. \"Zero percent\" effort or \"as needed\" is no t an acceptable level of involvemen t for Senior/Ke y Personnel. Significant re-budgeting Significant re-budgeting means a threshold that is reached when expenditures in a single direct cost budget category deviate (increase or decrease) from the categorical commitment level established for the budget period by more than 25 percent of the total costs awarded. Significant re-budgeting is one indicator of chan ge in scope. Small business concern Small business concern means a business that meets the regulatory and size requirements establishe d by the SBA a t 13 CFR 121. Solicitation See Fundin g Opportunit y Announcemen t. Subaward Subaward means a legal instrument by which a recipient provides funds (or property in lieu of funds) to an eligible subrecipient (or a lower-tier transaction) to perform a substantive por tion of the grant-supported program or project. The term includes such financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement (even if the agreemen t is called a contract) but does not include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of a grant, including the recipient's procuremen t of property or services needed to carry out the project or program. The term includes consortium a greements. Subrecipient Subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass- through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A sub-recipient may also be a recipien t of othe r Federal awards directl y from a Federal awardin g agency. Supplement Supplement means a request for an increase in support during a current budget period for expansion of the project's scope or to meet increased costs unforeseen at the time of the new or renewal application. A supplement may increase support for future years in ad dition to the current year. Supplements require applications and are sub ject to administrative and meri t review. Terms and conditions of award Terms and conditions of award means all legal requirements imposed on a grant by DOE, whether based on statute, regulation, policy, or other document referenced in the grant award, or specified by the grant award document itself. The award documents may include both standard and special conditions that are considered necessary to attain the grant's objectives, facilitate post-award administration of the grant, conserve grant funds, or otherwise protect the Federal governmen t's interests. Unallowable costs Unallowable costs means costs that cannot be char ged, directly or indirectly, to Federal awards because the costs are prohibited by law, regulation (including applicable cost principles), or the terms and conditions of award. Costs that are not allowable, allocab le, or reasonable are unallowable. Unliquidated obligation Unliquidated obligations means, for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity that have not been paid (liquidated). For reports prepared on an accrual expenditure basis, these are obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity for which an expenditure has not been recorded. Unobligated balance Unobligated balance means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the non-Federal entity has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the non-Federal entity's unliquidated obligations and expenditures of funds under the Federal award from the cumulative amount of the funds that the Federal aw arding agency or pass- throu gh entit y authorized the non-Federal entit y to obli gate. 74 Validate In the context of the data management plan requirements, validate means to support, corroborate, verify, or otherwise determine the legitimacy of the research findings. Validation of resear ch findings could be accomplished by reproducing the original experiment or analyses, comparing and contrasting the results against those of a new experiment or analyses, or by some other means.
