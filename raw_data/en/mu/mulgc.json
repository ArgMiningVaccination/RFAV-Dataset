For a complete listing, see 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING . 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 4.1 Dosing Considerations This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal p roducts. 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment The primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses of 0.5 mL each; an initial dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose admini stered anytime between 2 and 6 months later. Administration of the second dose of SHINGRIX is important to ensure maximum vaccine efficacy and duration of protection against HZ disease. For individuals who are or will be immunodeficient , or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule, the second dose can be given 1 to 2 months after the initial dose (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). The need for booster doses following the primary va ccination schedule has not been established. SHINGRIX can be given with the same vaccination schedule in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated HZ vaccine ( see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). 4.3 Reconstitution SHINGRIX is to be reconstituted only with the accompanying adjuvant suspension. The lyophilized powder and suspension should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of appearance. If either is observed, do not reconstitute the vaccine. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 5 of 36 4.4 Administration SHINGRIX is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle. How to prepare SHINGRIX : SHINGRIX must be reconstituted prior to administration. Withdraw the entire contents of the vial containing the suspension into a sterile syringe. Add the entire contents of the syringe into the vial containing the lyophi lized powder. Shake gently until the lyophilized powder is completely dissolved. The reconstituted vaccine is an opalescent, colourless to pale brownish liquid. The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and /or variation of appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the vaccine. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be used promptly; if this is not possible, the vaccine should be stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). If not used within 6 hours it should be discarded. Before administration : Withdraw the entire contents of the vial containing the reconstituted vaccine into a sterile syringe. Change the needle so that you are using a new needle to administer the vaccine. Any unused medicinal pro duct or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 4.5 Missed Dose If you miss a scheduled injection, it is important that you make another appointment. 5 OVERDOSAGE No cases of overdosage have been reported. For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre. 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACK AGING To help ensure the traceability of vaccines for patient immunization record -keeping as well as safety monitoring, health professionals should record the time and date of administration, quantity of administered dose (if applicable), anatomical site and route of administration, brand name and generic name of the vaccine, the product lot number and expiry date .

The vaccine is supplied as a vial of lyophilized recombinant varicella zoster virus surface glycoprotein E (VZV gE) which is reconstituted at the time of use with the accompanying vial of AS01 B adjuvant suspension. 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS General Prior to immunization It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with regard s to previous vaccination and possibl e occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. Precautions for use Do not administer the vaccine intravascularly, intradermally or subcutaneously . Maladministration via the subcutaneous route may lead to an i ncrease in transient local reactions. SHINGRIX is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection or for the treatment of herpes zoster (HZ) or postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Concomitant use of vaccines Fever and shivering were more frequent when PPV23 vaccine is co -administered with SHINGRIX. Febrile Illness As with other vaccines, vaccination with SHINGRIX should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, sh ould not result in the deferral of vaccination. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 8 of 36 Hematologic As with other vaccines administered intramuscularly, SHINGRIX should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these individuals. Neurologic In a post -marketing observational study in individuals aged 65 years or older, an increased risk of Guillain - Barr\u00e9 syndrome (estimated 3 excess cases per million doses administered) was observ ed during the 42 days following vaccination with SHINGRIX. Available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. See 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Reactions . Syncope Syncope (fa inting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints . 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women There are no data on the use of SHINGRIX in pregnant women. Animal studies performed with SHINGRIX administered to female rats do not indicate any harmful effects with respect to pregnancy (see 16 NON - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). 7.1.2 Breast -feeding The effect on breast -fed infants of administration of SHINGRIX to their mothers has not been studied. 7.1.3 Pediatrics Pediatrics (<18 years of age): The safety and efficacy of SHINGRIX in individuals younger than 18 years have not been established. 7.1.4 Geriatrics Geriatrics (60 years of age): The efficacy and safety in individuals 60 years an d older were assessed in clinical trials ( see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview More than 17,000 adults aged 50 through 96 years of age received at least one dose of SHINGRIX in 17 clinical studies. The incidence of solicited local and general symptoms was higher in subjects who received SHINGRIX than in subjects who received control (placebo or other vaccines). SHINGRIX was generally well tolerated. Additionally, 1,587 adults 18 years of age and older who were immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy (referred to as immunocompromised (IC)), were vaccinated with at least one dose of SHINGRIX in clinical studies. The reported adverse reactions were consistent with the reported clinical trial adverse reactions of adults 50 years of age and older. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 9 of 36 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions . The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ; therefore, may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real -world use. Adults aged 50 years and older The safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated by pooling data from two pivotal phase III placebo -controlled clinical studies, ZOE -50 (Zoster -006) and ZOE -70 (Zoster -022), involving 29,305 adults aged 50 years and older who received at least one dose of SHINGRIX (n = 14,645) or placebo (n = 14,660) administered according to a 0 - and 2-month schedule. Solicited Adverse Reactions The reported frequencies of solicited local and general adverse reactions from studies ZOE-50 and ZOE -70 are presented in Table 2 . Data on solicited local and general symptoms were collected using standardized diary cards for 7 days following each dose of vaccine or placebo in a subset of adults (n = 4,88 6 receiving SHINGRIX, n = 4,88 1 receiving placebo with at least one documented dose in the ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 studies).

Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 10 of 36 g Placebo = saline solution The majority of solicited local and general symptoms seen with SHINGRIX were mild to moderate in intensity and were not long -lasting (median duration of 3 days). The incidence of solicited local and general symptoms was numerically lower in adults aged 70 years and older compared with those aged 50 to 69 years. There was a higher incidence of pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, myalgia, headache, shivering, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults aged 50 to 69 years compared with those aged 70 years and older. The overall frequency and severity of these events did not indicate a clinically meaningful different reactogenicity profile in the younger age strata . The incidence of solicited local and general symptoms of SHINGRIX from the ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 studies were generally the same following each dose. Unsolicited Adverse Events In studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 30 days following each vaccination (Day 0 to 29) were recorded with diary cards in all adults . In studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, unsolicited adverse events occurring within 30 days o f vaccination were reported in 50.5% and 32.0% of adults who received SHINGRIX (n = 14,645) and placebo (n = 14,660), respectively (Total Vaccinated Cohort). Unsolicited adverse events that occurred in 1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 2 -fold higher than placebo included chills (3.5% versus 0.2%), injection pruritus Serious (SAEs) In studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, SAEs occurred at a simila r rate in adults who received SHINGRIX (2.3%) and placebo (2.2%) within 30 days after the last dose of vaccine or placebo. During the entire follow -up period (median 4.4 years, range: 0 to 5.0 years), SAEs were reported for 12.8% of adults who received SHI NGRIX and for 13.3% of adults who received placebo. In both groups, the incidence of SAEs was higher in adults aged 70 years and older compared with those aged 50 to 69 years. These events were either not in temporal association with vaccination and/or had alternative plausible causes. Deaths During the 30 -day follow -up period, deaths were reported for 0.1% of adults who received SHINGRIX and 0.1% of adults who received placebo in studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70. During the entire follow -up period (median 4.4 years, range: 0 to 5.0 years), deaths were reported in 4.3% of adults who received SHINGRIX and in 4.6% of adults who received placebo. Causes of death were consistent with those generally reported in adult and elderly populations. The majority of deaths were reported in adults aged 70 years and older in the vaccine and placebo groups. None of the fatal cases were considered related to vaccination. Potential Immune -Mediated Diseases In studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, new onset of potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) or exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 1.2% of adults who received SHINGRIX and 1.4% of adults who received placebo during the entir e follow -up period (median 4.4 years, range: 0 to 5.0 years). Approximately half of pIMDs occurred with time to onset longer than one year after the last vaccination. The most frequently reported pIMDs in the vaccine and placebo groups were polymyalgia rhe umatica (0.2% in psoriasis (0.1% in each group), and autoimmune thyroiditis group). Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 11 of 36 Flexible Dosing Schedule In a phase III clinical study Zoster -026, where 119 adults 50 years of age were vaccinated with SHINGRIX following a 0, 6 -month schedule, the safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults 50 years of age vaccinated with SHINGRIX following a 0, 2 -month schedule (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). Adults with Previous History of Vaccination with Live Attenuated HZ Vaccine In a phase III clinical study Zoster -048, where 430 adults 65 years of age with or without a previous history of vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine were vaccinated with at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX, the safety and reactogenicity profiles were comp arable in adults irrespective of previous vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine. See 14 CLINICAL TRIALS . Concomitant use of vaccines In a phase III clinical study Zoster -035 including 865 adults 50 years of age were vaccinated with SHINGRIX following a 0, 2-month or 2, 4 -month with 1 dose of Pneumovax 23 at month 0 , fever and shivering were reported more frequently when PPV23 vaccine was co -administered with SHINGRIX (16% and 21%, respectively) compared to when S HINGRIX was given alone (7% for both adverse reactions). Immunocompromised (IC) Adults aged 18 years and older The safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated by pooling data from 6 placebo -controlled clinical studies involving 3,116 adults aged 18 years and older who were immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy (referred to as immunocompromised) and received at least one dose of SHINGRIX (n = 1,587) or placebo (n = 1,529) administered according to the study schedule . At the time of receipt of SHINGRIX or placebo, the mean age of the population was 55 years. The methodology for evaluating solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and pIMDs across these studies was similar to those in the ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 studies. See 14 CLINICAL TRIALS . Solicited Adverse Reactions The reported frequencies of solicited local and general adverse reactions (overall per subject) by age group across the 6 studies are presented in Table 3. Data on solicited local and general symptoms were collected in adults 7 days following each dose of vaccine dose or placebo (n = 1,587 receiving SHINGRIX, n = 1,529 receiving placebo with at least one documented dose in the studies).

In the 50 -year age group: n = 1,073 for SHINGRIX, n = 1,055 for placebo. e GI = Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhe a, and/or abdominal pain. The majority of solicited local and general adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX were mild to moderate in intensity and were not long -lasting ( median duration of 1 to 3 days ). There was a higher incidence of pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, shivering, and fever in adults aged 18 to 49 years compared with those aged 50 years and older . The overall frequency and severity of these events did not indicate a clinically meaningful different reactogenicity profile in the younger age strata. Unsolicited Adverse Events Unsolicited adverse events occurring within 30 days following each vaccination were reported in 46% and 44% of adults who received SHINGRIX or placebo . The unsolicited adverse event that occurred in 1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher than placebo was arthralgia (1.5% versus 1.0%). Serious Adverse Events SAEs occurred at similar rate in adults who received SHINGRIX (7%) or placebo (8%) from the first administered dose up to 30 days post -last vaccination. SAEs were reported for 26% of adults who received SHINGRIX and for 27% of adults who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post -last vaccination. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 13 of 36 Deaths From the first administered dose up to 30 days post -last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.1% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.5% of subjects who received placebo. From the first administered dose up to 1 year post -last vaccination, deaths wer e reported for 6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 6% of subjects who received placebo. Potential Immune -Mediated Diseases New onset of potential immune -mediated diseases ( pIMDs ) or exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 1.3% of adults who received SHINGRIX and 1.0% of adults who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post -last vaccination. The most frequently reported pIMDs were comparable in the groups receiving SHINGRIX and the placebo groups. Other Medically Relevant Events In the auHSCT study (Zoster -002), relapse and disease progression occurred at similar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX 239 of 922 subjects (26% ) and 81 of 922 subjects ( respectively or placebo 253 of 924 (27% ) and 82 of 924 subjects ( 9%), respectively from the first vaccination to study end. In the hematologic malignancy study, disease -related events (i.e., relapse or disease progression) were reported for 45 of 283 subjects ( 16% ) who received SHINGRIX and 58 of 279 subjects ( 21% ) who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end. In the renal transplant study, biopsy -confirmed allograft rejection occurred at similar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX at 4 of 132 subjects (3%) or placebo at 7 of 132 subjects (5%) from the first vaccination to study end. 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Reactions Table 4 Post -Market Adverse Reactions System Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema Rare Post -marketing observational study of the risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with SHINGRIX The association between vaccination with SHINGRIX and GBS was evaluated based on the claims data from the US federal health insurance program (Medicare) in people aged 65 years or older fr om October 2017 through February 2020. The risk of GBS following vaccination with SHINGRIX was assessed in self -controlled case series analyses using a risk window of 1 to 42 days post -vaccination and a control window of 43 to 183 days post - vaccination. Th e primary analysis found an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination with SHINGRIX, with an estimated 3 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults aged 65 years or older. In the secondary analysis, an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following the first dose of SHINGRIX was observed, with an estimated 6 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults aged 65 years or older, and no increased risk of GBS observed following the second dose of SHINGRI X. The available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX.

The vaccines should be administered at different injection sites. 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions Interactions with other drugs have not been established. 9.5 Drug -Food Interactions Interactions with food have not been established. 9.6 Drug -Herb Interactions Interactions with herbal products have not been established. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions with laboratory tests have not been established. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Herpes Zoster Disease Primary VZV infection results in varicella (chickenpox), after which VZV becomes latent in neurons of dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia. HZ (or shingles) results from the reactivation of latent VZV in sensory ganglia. Any person who has had varicell a is at risk of developing HZ. Age is the most important risk factor for the development of HZ with two -thirds of the cases occurring in those over 50 years of age. The risk and severity of HZ is greatest in the elderly, an age group predicted to grow in c oming decades. This age -related risk may be explained by waning immunity over time including the loss of components of VZV -specific cell mediated immunity as a result of natural aging processes. The severity of illness associated with HZ and its complicati ons also increases markedly with age. Adults 18 years and older at increased risk for HZ are heterogeneous and individuals can have different levels of immunosuppression based on their underlying disease, the type, duration and combination of therapy, as well as individual risk factors. HZ can be a severely debilitating disease that typically presents as an acute, painful, vesicular rash distributed along a single dermatome. HZ rash is preceded by prodromal pain in 70% to 80% of the cases, and can las t up to a week or longer. The prodromal pain might also be associated with fever, malaise and headache. During the eruptive phase, acute local neurological pain occurs in up to 90% of immunocompetent individuals. The median duration of acute phase pain is 2 weeks and can be very severe, disabling, and interfere with daily activities. The rash typically heals in 2 -4 weeks but may leave scars or pigmentation changes. HZ -associated pain can persist for weeks, months or even years (see HZ Complications). Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 15 of 36 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends herpes zoster vaccination. Refer to the NACI statement available on the Public Health Agency of Canada website for further information1 . HZ Complications By definition, HZ complications can only occur following HZ. HZ complications occur in approximately 25% of persons with HZ and become more common with age. The most common HZ complications are postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and HZ ophthalmicus (HZO). PHN is defined as pain that persists for at least 3 months or occurs after the HZ rash itself has resolved. Affected patients report typical neurologic pain symptoms such as intermittent or continuous, deep or superficial throbbing or s tabbing, spontaneous aching or burning, intense itching, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. PHN can only occur as a result of HZ and develops in 10% to 30% of patients, with approximately 30 -50% of patients experiencing pain for >1 year and several studies have reported PHN lasting up to 10 years. HZO can develop when reactivation of VZV occurs in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Common manifestations of HZO include keratitis as well as other complications which can occur, including conjunctivitis , retinitis, optic neuritis and glaucoma. Chronic HZO may lead to pain, facial scarring and loss of vision. Epidemiology Nearly all adult Canadians (90%) have had chickenpox and are therefore at risk for HZ. HZ occurs most frequently among older adults a nd immunocompromised persons. In Canada, it has been estimated that 30% of the population will develop HZ at some point in their lives; this number increases to almost 50% for those who live to 85 years of age (YOA). Overall incidence rates range from 20 t o 34 per 10,000 person -years, however they increase to 39 to 118 per 10,000 person -years in adults over 65 YOA. In Canada, PHN is estimated to occur in approximately 20% of adults after HZ onset overall, however it can increase to over 30% for those over 8 0 YOA. Burden of disease and hospitalization rates have also been assessed across Canada and the estimated 130,000 new HZ infections would result in 252,000 physician consultations, 2,000 hospitalizations and 20 deaths annually. Zoster -related hospitalization rates vary across Canada and have been estimated to range from 1.5 to 4.6 per 100,000 population for those aged 50 -59 YOA, increasing with advancing age to reach as high as 75 per 100,000 population in those over 80 YOA as observed in an On tario study conducted using administrative database data from 1992 -2010. 10.1 Mechanism of Action SHINGRIX is designed to induce antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune response s in individuals with pre-existing immunity against varicella zoster virus (VZV). The risk of developing HZ which increases with age and with immunosuppression due to disease and/or therapy, appears to be related to a decline in VZV -specific immunity. Alt hough no immunological correlate for protection against HZ has been identified, current knowledge suggests that VZV -specific cell -mediated immunity (CMI) is of primary importance in preventing HZ. VZV -specific antibodies (Abs) may help control viral dissem ination and may thereby help limit the severity of HZ. While VZV -specific Abs may not be directly protective against HZ, they may represent an indirect measure of the CMI response to vaccination. Page 16 of 36 The antigen component of SHINGRIX is one of the major glyco proteins from VZV and is unable to replicate. When the vaccine antigen is combined with the AS01 B Adjuvant System (composed of the plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, fraction 21 (QS -21) and 3 -O-desacyl lipid A (MPL), the vaccine increases VZV -specific CMI, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects against zoster disease and its subsequent complications. Non -clinical data show that the adjuvant component, AS01 B, induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune system through molecular pathways specific to MPL and QS -21, which act as immunoenhancers. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen -presenting cells carrying gE - derived antig ens in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to the generation of gE -specific CD4+ T cells. The adjuvant effect of AS01 B is the result of interactions between MPL and QS -21 formulated in liposomes. SHINGRIX also increases VZV -specific humoral immuni ty, which is an indicator of the responsiveness to the vaccine. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL For both lyophilized gE vial and adjuvant solution vial, store in a refrigerator ( 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

Efficacy against Herpes Zoster (HZ) In two large clinical studies, ZOE -50 and ZOE -70, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ) when compared with placebo ( Table 6 and Table 7). Study ZOE -50 in Subjects 50 Years and Older The efficacy of SHINGRIX against HZ in subjects 50 years of age (YOA) was evaluated in ZOE -50, a placebo - controlled, observer -blind clinical study conducted in 18 countries, from North America (US and Canada), Latin America, Europe, As ia, and Australia, in which 15,405 subjects received (randomized 1:1) two doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX (n = 7,695) or placebo (n = 7,710) (see Table 6). The mean age of subjects was 62.3 years. Overall, 95.6% of subjects completed both doses of SHINGRIX in ZOE -50. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ for a median of 3.1 years (range: 0 to 3.7 years). The study excluded, among others, subjects who were immunocompromised, had a previous history of HZ, were previously vaccinated against varicella or HZ, and patients whose survival was not expected to be at least 4 years, or with conditions that might interfere with study evaluations. Randomization was stratified by age: 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and 80 years in a 8:5:3:1 ratio. 2 Registered trademark, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. Used under li cense.

Analyses were conducted when a pre -specified number of HZ cases accrued. Confirmed HZ cases were d etermined by either Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (89.4%), or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (10.6%) when there were no samples available or with inconclusive PCR results. Individuals in both vaccine and placebo groups who developed HZ were evaluate d and treated as per treating physician's judgment.

The mean age of subjects was 75.6 years (see Table 7). Overall, 94.4% of subjects completed both doses of SHINGRIX in ZOE -70. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ and PHN for a median of 3.9 years (range : 0 to 4.5 years). The study exclusion criteria were the same as for ZOE -50. Randomization was stratified by age: 70 to 79 years and 80 years in a 3:1 ratio. The primary objective was to evaluate VE in the prevention of HZ compared to placebo in adults 70 years of age (YOA), as measured by the reduction in HZ risk. The efficacy of SHINGRIX to prevent HZ in subjects 70 YOA was evaluated by combining the results from studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 through a pre -specified pooled analysis in the mTVC. A total o f 8,250 and 8,346 subjects who received SHINGRIX and placebo, respectively, were included in the pooled mTVC analysis. Refer to Table 7.

SHINGRIX significantly decreased the incidence of PHN compared with placebo in subjects 70 Y OA (4 vs. 36 cases in the pre -specified pooled analysis of ZOE -50 and ZOE -70). The benefit of SHINGRIX on PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. A further reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with confirmed HZ coul d not be demonstrated due to the limited number of HZ cases in the vaccine group. Effect on other HZ -related complications A post -hoc pooled efficacy analysis to evaluate the overall VE in preventing HZ -associated complications (other than PHN), was perfo rmed on ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 including 27,916 subjects from the mTVC (n = 13,881 for SHINGRIX, n = 14,035 for placebo). The HZ -related complications evaluated were HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic disease, neurologic disease, visceral disease, and stroke. The number of HZ -related complications other than PHN in subjects 50 YOA was 1 versus 16 cases in the SHINGRIX and placebo group, respectively. Effect on Use and Duration of Pain Medication In subjects 70 YOA from Study ZOE -70 with confirmed HZ, the use of HZ -associated pain medications was reported for 10 out of 23 subjects (43.5%) who received SHINGRIX, and for 160 out of 223 subjects (71.7%) who received placebo. The median duration of pain medication use was 30 (6.0 -660.0) and 38 (1.0 and 4529.0) days, in the SHINGRIX group and the placebo group, respectively.

Efficacy against Herpes Zoster (HZ) The efficacy of SHINGRIX was evaluated in two phase 3 randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind clinical studies in immunocompromised subjects aged 18 years: 1) auHSCT recipients ZOSTER -039 - efficacy was evaluated post -hoc). In these 2 studies, although antiviral prophylaxis was permitted per local standard of care, antiviral therapy beyond 6 months were excluded in the auHSCT study. These studies were not designed to assess the impact of concomitant use of immunosuppressive therapy on vaccine efficacy or to assess the impact of specific i mmunosuppressive treatments on vaccine efficacy. Most vaccine recipients were not under IS therapy at the time of vaccination. Not all types of immunosuppressive therapies were used in the populations studied. In the auHSCT efficacy study, subjects were f ollowed for the development of HZ for a median of 21 months (range: 0 to 49.4 months). The primary efficacy analysis populations (mTVC) included 1,721 subjects who received 2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ wi thin 1 month after the second dose. The demographics of the mTVC populations were similar to the overall population in each study. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (83.7%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (16.3%). In the post -hoc ana lysis in subjects with hematologic malignancies, subjects were followed for the development of HZ for a median of 11.1 months (range: 0 to 15.6 months). The primary efficacy analysis populations (mTVC) included 515 subjects who received 2 doses of either S HINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. The demographics of the mTVC Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 28 of 36 populations were similar to the overall population in each study. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (81.3%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (18.7%). Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ in immunocompromised subjects aged 18 years and older (Table 10).

Effect on other analysis, in Zoster -002, SHINGRIX reduced HZ -related complications in auHSCT recipients 18 years (3 vs 13 cases). Additionally, this study found that, SHINGRIX reduced HZ -related hospitalizations (2 vs 13 cases) . Effect on HZ -associated pain In an exploratory analysis, i n Zoster -002, subjects with suspected HZ rated their \"worst\" HZ -associated pain on a 10 -point scale. Among subjects with confirmed HZ, 37 out of 49 subjects receiving SHINGRIX and 120 out of 135 subjects receiving placebo rated their \"worst\" HZ -associated pain as 3 or greater. In this subset of subjects, the median duration of \"worst\" HZ associated pain was 14 and 24 days, among SHINGRIX and placebo recipients, respectively. The median duration of pain medication use was 21.5 and 47.5 days in the SHINGRIX and placebo group, respectively. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 29 of 36 14.3 Immunogenicity Adults aged 50 years and older The gE -specific CD4+ T cell activity for cell -mediated immunity (CMI) was measured by intra -cellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay in terms of frequency of gE -specific CD4[2+] T -cells (i.e., CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 activation markers from amongst IFN -, TNF -, IL -2, and CD40 -L) per 106 CD4+ T cells. Anti -gE antibody m easured by anti -gE enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (gE ELISA). The vaccine response rate (VRR) for anti -gE was defined as the percentage of subjects with at least a 4 -fold increase in post -Dose 2 anti -gE antibody concentration compared with the pre -vacci nation anti -gE antibody concentration (for subjects seropositive at baseline) or with the anti -gE antibody cut -off value for seropositivity (for subjects seronegative at baseline). An immunological correlate of protection against HZ has not been establish ed; therefore, the level of immune response that provides protection against HZ is unknown. Immunogenicity in Dose Selection Study Zoster -003 The safety and immune response of SHINGRIX in adults 60 years of age (YOA) or older was evaluated in a dose selection study (Zoster -003). In study Zoster -003, there was an increase in CMI responses following the first dose of SHINGRIX, however, subjects who received a second dose of SHINGRIX developed a higher CMI response to gE after the second dose. In subjects in the SHINGRIX arm, the baseline median frequency of gE - specific CD4 T cells/106 cells was 122. This increased to 383 at two months post -Dose 1 (prior to dose 2) and to 1755 at one month post -Dose 2. Humoral Immune Response Humoral immune responses in subj ects 50 YOA were evaluated in subjects from Study ZOE -50 who were randomly allocated to the immunogenicity subset (n = 1,197 for SHINGRIX and n = 1,200 for placebo). At one month post -Dose 2, the Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) was 44.3 -fold (95% CI: 4 1.7, 47.1) greater in subjects who received SHINGRIX compared with placebo. Humoral immune responses in subjects 70 YOA were evaluated by combining the results from Studies ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 through a pre -specified pooled analysis in subjects from the im munogenicity subset (n = 1,646 for SHINGRIX and n = 1,647 for placebo). At one month post -Dose 2, the GMC was 35.4 -fold (95% CI: 32.8, 38.1) greater in subjects who received SHINGRIX compared with placebo. Anti-gE antibody responses with SHINGRIX were con sistently high in all age groups at one month post -Dose 2 and remained above pre -vaccination levels at three years post -Dose 2. Cell-Mediated Immune (CMI) Response CMI responses to vaccination were evaluated in subjects from the immunogenicity subset of 3 countries in ZOE-50 (n = 232 for SHINGRIX and n = 234 for placebo). At one month post -Dose 2, the gE -specific CD4+ T cell activity in subjects who received SHINGRIX was 18.7 -fold (95% CI: 14.0, 25.0) greater YOA and 14.9 -fold (95% CI: 8.8, 25.2) greater than placebo in subjects 70 YOA. The gE -specific CMI responses with SHINGRIX were consistently above pre -vaccination levels in all age groups at one month post -Dose 2, and persisted relative to pre -vaccination levels through three years post -Dose 2. Immunogenicity following concomitant vaccination In three phase III, controlled, open -label clinical studies, adults 50 years of age were randomized to receive 2 doses of SHINGRIX 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first dose or non -concomitantly Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster (N=830; Zoster -042). The vaccine response rate SHINGRIX with the influenza, PPV23 and Tdap vaccine respectively at 1 month post -dose 2 of SHINGRIX. The immune responses of the co -administered vaccines were unaffected, with the exception of lower geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens (pertactin) when SHINGRIX is coadministe red with the Tdap vaccine. However, clinical relevance of these data is not known. Immunogenicity in subjects with a history of HZ prior to vaccination In a phase III, uncontrolled, open -label clinical study (Zoster -033), 96 adults 50 years of age, with a history of HZ, received 2 doses of SHINGRIX 2 months apart. The vaccine response rate (anti -gE antibodies) at 1 month post -vaccination was 90.2% (95% CI: 81.7; 95.7). Immunogenicity in subjects receiving 2 doses of SHINGRIX 6 months apart In a phase III , open -label clinical study (Zoster -026) where 238 subjects 50 years of age were equally randomised to receive 2 doses of SHINGRIX 2 or 6 months apart, the vaccine response rate (anti -gE antibodies) at 1 month post -vaccination following the 0, 6 -month sch edule was 96.5% CI: 90.4; 99.2). The humoral immune response (anti -gE antibodies concentration) following the 0, 6 -month schedule was not inferior to the humoral immune response following the 0, 2 -month schedule, as the 97.5% CI upper limit of the an tibodies concentration ratio was below 1.50 [1.16 (97.5% CI: 0.98; zoster (HZ) vaccine A phase III, open clinical study (Zoster -048) evaluated the i mmunogenicity and safety of SHINGRIX in 430 adults 65 years of age with or without a previous history of vaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax3) 5 years earlier (HZ -PreVac and HZ -nonVac, respectively). Subjects in the two groups were group -matched for age, sex, race and medical conditions at a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of SHINGRIX 2 months apart. The co -primary immunogenicity endpoint HZ -nonVac for humoral immune response was met, as the upper limit of the 97.5% CI of the adjusted GMC ratio was below the predefined limit of 1.50 [1.04 (97.5% CI: 0.92; 1.17)] at one -month post -dose 2, indicating that SHINGRIX induced a strong imm une response, irrespective of previous live -attenuated HZ vaccination. As the study above used an interval of at least 5 years between the two vaccines and shorter intervals have not been studied, additional considerations of the interval may include age of vaccination with the live attenuated HZ vaccine, as well as time since last vaccination with the live attenuated HZ vaccine4 . 3 Registered trademark, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.

SHINGRIX or placebo was administered according to a 0 - and 1 - to 2-month schedule in all studies except for study in HIV infected subjects (which used a 3 dose, 0, 2, 6 month schedule). The gE -specifi c humoral and cell - mediated immune responses at 1 month post -dose 2 in terms of the median fold increase over baseline ranged from 14.1 to 40.9 in terms of anti -gE antibody concentration and 4.9 to 109.0 in terms of gE -specific CD4[2+] T -cell frequencies ( ATP cohort for immunogenicity) in all IC populations respectively. In subjects who received SHINGRIX according to a 0 - and 1 - to 2-month schedule , the humoral and cell -mediated immune responses remained above pre -vaccination levels at 1 year (and 2 years f or Zoster -002) post -Dose 2. The clinical relevance in terms of impact on efficacy, on the short and long term, is unknown . 15 MICROBIOLOGY No microbiological information is required for this drug product. 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY General Toxicology : Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance and cardiovascular/respiratory safety pharmacology.

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything about this vaccine . Talk to your healthcare professional and ask if there is any new information about SHINGRIX . What is SHINGRIX used for ? SHINGRIX is a vaccine that helps to protect adults against herpes zoster (also called shingles). SHINGRIX can be given to: adults 50 years and older; adults 18 years and older who are or will be at increased risk of shingles due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy . What causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years and as you get older, the virus becomes active again and causes shingles. Anyone who has had chickenpox may get shingles, and the chance of getting shingles increases: as you get older, and/or as factors that put you at risk of getting shingles can be different and diverse in individuals with different levels of immunosuppression (for example, underlying disease, the type, duration and combination of therapy), as well as other individual risk factors. The lifetime risk of getting shingles is as high as 30% and this risk increases to almost 50% in those who live to 85 years. Speak with your healthcare professional to understand what risk factors can put you at risk of getting shingles. What is Shingles? Shingles is a serious disease that commonly results in a very painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several weeks. Shingles sometimes also results in fever or headache. The pain can be severe, disabling and i nterfere with doing normal day -to-day activities, including restrictions on physical activities because of shingles -related pain, sleep, work, and affecting social interactions and emotional health. If you develop shingles, it may lead to serious compli cations, such as long -lasting nerve pain (postherpetic neuralgia or PHN), which can last for months or years and may be severe even after the shingles blisters heal. Shingles can also lead to scarring. PHN is the most common complication you can develop if you have shingles. PHN can be serious, disabling, and can interfere with your daily activities such as walking, sleeping and social activities. The pain from shingles can also lead to emotional distress. People who suffer from shingles have described thei r pain in many ways. Some say the pain burns or throbs. Others say it stabs, shoots, and/or feels sharp. Severe pain can result from things as minor as a breeze or the touch of clothing against the skin. Other Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 33 of 36 complications you may get with shingles can in clude bacterial skin infections, weakness, facial or muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision problems which can lead to blindness. People with shingles may need to stay in the hospital and in rare cases shingles may even result in death. How does SHINGRIX work? SHINGRIX helps your body to build its own protection against shingles. SHINGRIX does not cause shingles. SHINGRIX is a non -live, recombinant vaccine and cannot cause the disease it is designed to prevent. SHINGRIX was demonstrated to be mor e than 90% effective in preventing shingles in people who are 50 years or older, including those 70 to 80 years of age and older in clinical studies. SHINGRIX maintained protection for four years. An additional clinical study demonstrated that SHINGRIX w as also effective at producing an immune response in people who previously received the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine. In patients who had undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant and were followed for 21 months, SHINGRIX was demons trated to be 68.2% effective in preventing shingles in people 18 years or older (71.8% in people 18 to 49 years and 67.3% in people 50 years or older). SHINGRIX also produced an immune response across different populations who are 18 years or older and at increased risk of shingles due to other immunocompromising conditions or immunosuppressive therapies. As with all vaccines, SHINGRIX may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. What are the ingredients in SHINGRIX ? Medicinal ingredients : 1 dose (0.5 mL) contains 50 micrograms of glycoprotein E (gE) powder mixed with AS01 B adjuvant suspension. gE is a protein found in the Varicella Zoster Virus. This protein is not infectious. The adjuvant is made of 50 micrograms each of a plant extract ( Quillaj a saponaria Molina, fraction 21 (QS -21)) and a bacterial extract (3 -O-desacyl -4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)) and is used to improve your body's response to the vaccine. Non -medicinal ingredients : Cholesterol, dipotassium phosphate, dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline, dihydrate, sucrose and water for injection . SHINGRIX comes in the following dosage form: 0.5 mL suspension for one injection made by combining: One vial of gE powder One vial of adjuvant suspension SHINGRIX will not be given to you if: You are allergic to any ingredient in SHINGRIX (see What are the Ingredients in SHINGRIX). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. Novem ber 15, 2022 Shingrix, Herpes Zoster vaccine Page 34 of 36 To help avoid side effects and ensure proper use, talk to your healthcare professional before SHINGRIX is given to you . Talk about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you have : A severe infection with a high temperature. In these cases, vaccination may be delayed until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your healthcare professional first. A bleeding problem or bruise easily. Fainted with a previous injection or before receiving any needle injection. Other warnings you should know about: SHINGRIX is not for the prevention of chickenpox or for the treatment of herpes zoster (HZ) or postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Pregnancy and breast -feeding Ask your healthcare professional for advice before taking any medicine. There is no information on the use of SHINGRIX in pregnant or breast -feeding women. Tell your healthcare prof essional about all the medicines you take, including any drugs , vitamins, minerals, natural supplements or alternative medicines , or if you have recently received any other vaccine . Using other medicines or vaccines with SHINGRIX: SHINGRIX can be given at the same time as the unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine, the 23 -valent pneumococcal vaccine and the combined diphtheria -tetanus -acellular pertussis vaccine. The vaccines should be given at different injection sites. If SHINGRIX is given at the same ti me as 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, you may be more likely to experience fever and/or shivering. How to take SHINGRIX : SHINGRIX is given as an injection of 0.5 mL into a muscle (usually in the upper arm ). Usual dose: You will receive two SHINGRIX injections with a gap of 2 to 6 months between doses. Based on your medical condition or planned treatments, your doctor may recommend that you receive the second dose 1 month after the first dose. Your healthcare professional will tell you when you should come back for the second dose. Make sure you receive both doses of SHINGRIX. This will maximize the protection offered by SHINGRIX. SHINGRIX can be given if you have already been vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zo ster vaccine. The appropriate time will be determined by your healthcare professional. Speak to your healthcare professional for more information. Overdose: If you think you have received too much SHINGRIX, contact your healthcare professional, hospital emergency department or regional Poison Control Centre immediately, even if there are no symptoms. Missed Dose: If you miss a scheduled injection, it is important that you make another appointment.
