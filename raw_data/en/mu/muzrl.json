Quotes Otto Fr\u00e4nkel-Lundbourg: The one they encounter the word Anthroposophy in the most varied relationships of cultural life without being able to form the right idea of what it means. An attempt at the clarification is being made herein. Actually, three aspects are to be understood by the word Anthroposophy: 1. The exact the scientific method of research into the supersensible world founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). 2. The results of this research. These are also known as \"Spiritual Science\" and are the necessary complement to [Natural Science](Rudolf_Steiner_and_Science.php). They are the science of the supersensible constitution of man, of the spiritual beings in the nature and the cosmos, and they are also the extension of historical and other sciences, e.g., a scientific answer to the question: who was and is the Christ? 3. The application of the results gained through spiritual science in the practical life of the individual or of the community, for example, in [education](Rudolf_Steiner_and_Waldorf_Education.php), [medicine](Rudolf_Steiner_and_Medicine.php), curative education, pharmacy, [agriculture](Rudolf_Steiner_and_Biodynamic_Agriculture.php), sociology, as well as the diverse branches of the arts. Otto Fr\u00e4nkel-Lundbourg. What is Anthroposophy? Trans: Joseph Wetzl. St. George Publications: Spring Valley NY, 1979. Page 9. Rudolf Steiner: Anthroposophy... cannot find its way through the world by ordinary agitation or propaganda, no matter how well meant. Agitation kills true Anthroposophy. Anthroposophy must come forward because the Spirit impels it to come forward. It must show forth its life because life cannot but reveal itself in existence. But it must never force its existence upon people. Waiting always for those to come who want it, it must be far removed from all constraint even the constraint of persuasion. Rudolf Steiner. The Life, Nature and Cultivation of Anthroposophy. Rudolf Steiner Press: London, 1963. Page 17. Rudolf Steiner: Above all one must know what the true standard and content of Anthroposophy should be. It does not consist of a sum of opinions which must be entertained by 'anthroposophists'. It ought never to be said amongst anthroposophists, 'We believe this', 'We reject that'. Such agreement may arise naturally as the result of out anthroposophical study, but it can never be put forward as an anthroposophical 'programme'. The right attitude can only be: 'Anthroposophy is there. It has been acquired by persistent effort. I am here to represent it, so that what has thus been acquired may be made known in the world.' It is still much too little felt in anthroposophical circles what a difference-indeed as between day and night exists between these two standards. Rudolf Steiner.
