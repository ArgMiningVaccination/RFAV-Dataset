I have never experienced such caring and patient individuals at a doctor's office before. I am definitely seeing results from acupuncture and I highly, highly recommend Hornburg Holistics Acupuncture!!! Miranda G. I cannot say enough amazing things about Dr. Brian and his team. I was struggling with my supply to breastfeed my child and I tried every food, lactation cookie/supplement/tea/etc, pumping / nursing , you name it, I tried it. Fast forward deeper into my research, I found a study that had huge success in increasing milk supply with acupuncture. So, as a last resort, I made an appointment at Hornburg Holistics and gosh, am I so glad I did! I genuinely feel like they helped save my breastfeeding journey. Through persistence on my end and seeing Dr. Brian a couple of times a week, I was able to produce about 30 oz. a day. I am so grateful for Dr. Brian and his team for creating such a welcoming environment and really helping me feed my child! Becky K.
