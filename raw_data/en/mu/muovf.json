Appendix Tables 361 Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report i Executive Summary History of the Project This report provides the findings from a survey entitled \" UC Hastings College of the Law Assessment of Climate for Learning, Living, and Working ,\" conducted at UC Hastings Law . In 2020 , UC Hastings Law contracted with Rankin & Associates Consulting (R&A) to conduct a College -wide study . Nineteen UC Hastings Law faculty, staff, students, and administrators formed the Community Experience Survey Working Group (CESWG ). The CESWG worked with R&A to develop the survey instrument and promote the survey's administration in spring 2021 . Owing to the COVID -19 pandemic, UC Hastings Law engaged in primarily online learning and working environments (although a small portion of students continued in residence at the Tower during this period) . All members of UC Hastings Law were encouraged to complete the survey. Responses to the multiple -choice format survey items were analyzed for statistical differences based on various demographic categories (e.g., UC Hastings Law position status , gender i dentity, disability status) where appropriate. Where sample sizes were small, certain responses were combined into categories to make comparisons between groups and to ensure respondents' confidentiality. Throughout the report, for example, the Faculty cat egory include d ladder, non - ladder full -time, and non -ladder part -time faculty members. In addition to multiple -choice survey items, several open -ended questions provided respondents with the opportunity to describe their experiences at UC Hastings Law . Com ments were solicited to 1) give \"voice\" to the quantitative findings and 2) highlight the areas of concern that might have been overlooked owing to the small number of survey r esponses from historically underrepresented populations. For this reason, some q ualitative comments may not seem aligned with the quantitative findings; however, they are important data. Five-hundred eighty -one (581) surveys were returned for a 47% overall response rate. Table 1 provides a summary of selected demographic characteristics of survey respondents . Response rates by position status were 39% (n = 398) for Students, 42% (n = 85) for Faculty, and 58% ( n = 98) for Staff.

Comfort With Campus, Workplace, and Classroom Climate at UC Hastings Law Research on campus climate generally has focused on the experiences of faculty, staff, and students associated with historically underserved social/community/affinity groups (e.g., women, People of Color, people with disabilities, first -generation and/or low -income students, queer - spectrum and/or trans -spectrum individuals, and veterans).1 Several groups at UC Hastings Law indicated on the sur vey that they were less comfortable than their majority counterparts with the climates of the campus and workplace. Most survey respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the overall environment at UC Hastings Law (61%, n = 356, p. 57), the environment in their departments/program or work units ( 84%, n = 82, p. 57), the environment in their classes ( 64%, n = 307, p. 57), and the environment within the faculty (57%, n = 48, p. 57). Faculty respondents were significantly more comfortable with the overall environment than were Student respondents (Figure 1, p. 57). 1 Garvey et al. (2015); Goldberg et al. (2019); Harper & Hurtado (2007) ; Jayakumar et al. (2009); (2012); Means & Pyne (2017); Soria & Stebleton (2013); Rankin (2003) ; Rankin & Reason (2005) ; Walpole et al.

Figure 4. Respondents' Comfort With Overall Climate by Disability Status (%) Faculty Respondents - Positive Attitudes About Faculty Work Ladder Faculty Ladder Faculty respondents held positive attitudes about faculty work at UC Hastings Law and indicated that research (93%, n = 28, p. 161) was valued at UC Hastings Law . Eighty -seven percent (n = 26) of Ladder Faculty respondents agreed that the criteria for tenure were clear . Eighty -three percent (n = 24) of Ladder Faculty respondents agreed that senior administrators (e.g., Dean, Associate/Assistant Deans) took faculty opinions seriously. Significant differences between demographic groups could not be determined because of the small sample size . Non-Ladder Faculty The majority of Non-Ladder Faculty respondents indicated that UC Hastings Law values research (83%, n = 44, p. 164) and teaching (77%, n = 41, p. 164). Significant differences between demographic groups could not be determined because of the small sample least one disabilityVery comfortable Comfortable Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable Uncomfortable Very uncomfortableRankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report vii All Faculty Approximately three -quarters (79%, n = 64) of all Faculty respondents would recommend UC Hastings Law as a good place to work (p. 166). Similarly, Faculty respondents felt positive about their career opportunities (68%, n = 54, p. 168) and thought that retirement/supplemental benefits were competitive (67%, n = 53, p. 166). Staff Respondents - Positive Attitudes About Staff Work Staff respondents generally held positive view s about working at UC Hastings Law . Staff respondents felt their supervisors (86%, n = 83, p. 173) and coworkers/colleagues (85%, n = 82, p. 173) gave them job/career advice or guidance when they needed it. More than three -quarters of Staff respondents felt that their supervisors provided adequate suppo rt for them to manage work -life balance (80%, n = 78, p. 174) and that they w ere given a reasonable time frame to complete assigned responsibilities (77%, n = 75, p. 175). Stude nt Respondents - Positive Attitudes About Academic Experiences Student respondents held positive perceptions of their experiences at UC Hastings Law . A strong majority of Student respondents felt that UC Hastings Law prepared them with the knowledge and skills to be an effective attorney (67%, n = 259, p. 209). Student respondents indicated that they felt safe and supported at multiple spaces on campus . Student respondents indicated they knew where to seek advice (73%, n = 289, p. 217), felt they had adequate access to academic advising (78%, n = 306, p. 218), and were sati sfied with the quality of advising they had received from faculty members (73%, n = 288, p. 217). Student respondents thought that faculty memb ers (88% , n = 349, p. 217) and staff members (78% , n = 313, p. 217) responded to their emails, calls, or voicemails in a promp t manner . Seventy -one percent (n = 278, p. 219) of Student respondents felt that they received support from faculty and staff to pursue personal acad emic and career interests . The majority of Student respondents felt comfortable sharing their professional goals in one-on-one appointments with student -facing departments (75% , n = 296, p. 220) and with faculty (82% , n = 323, p. 220). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report viii Experiences of Exclusionary, Intimidating, Offensive, and /or Hostile Conduct Several empirical studies reinforce the importance of the perception of non -discriminatory environments for positive learning and developmental outcomes.2 Research also underscores the relationship between hostile workplace climates and subsequent productivity.3 The survey requested information on experiences of exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct. 33% (n = 189) of respondents indicated that they personally had experienced exclusionary, intimidating , offensive, and/or hostile conduct (p. 80). o Of these respondents, 30% (n = 57) suggest ed that the conduct was based on gender/gender identity , 29% (n = 54) noted that the conduct was based on political views , and 26 % (n = 49) felt that it was based on their ethnicity (p. 80). No significant differences in the percentages of respondents who had experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct existed based on their gender identity, politic al views, and/or ethnicity . However, of those respondents who experienced such conduct , the significant differences were found in the perceived bases of the conduct such as : Higher percentage s of Trans -spectrum respondents ( 78%, n = 7) than Women respondents ( 36%, n = 44), and a higher percentage of Women respondents (36%, n = 44) than Men respondents (12%, n = 6) who had experienced this conduct indicated that they thought that the conduct was based on their gender identity (p. 81). A higher percentage of Conservative/Libertarian respondents (85%, n = 11) than Moderate respondents (34%, n = 15) and Progressive respondents (29%, n = 22) thought that the conduct was based on their political views (Liberal respondents [n < 5] did not significantly differ from the Conservative/Libertarian group or Progressive group , p. 82). 2 Dugan et al. (2012); Eunyoung Garc\u00eda (2016); Hirshfield & Joseph (2012); S. J. Jones & Taylor (2012); Levin et al. (2015); Rankin et al. (2010); Silverschanz et al. (2008) Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report ix Higher percentage s of Respondents of Color (including Multiracial) (40%, n = 25) and Asian/Pacific Islander respondents (38%, n = 12) than White respondents (8%, n = 6) who had experienced exclusionary, inti midating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct indicated that the conduct was based on their ethnicity (p. 83). Most Appreciated Aspects Faculty Respondents When asked what was the most appreciated aspects of UC Hastings Law, 75% ( n = 64) of Faculty respondents indicated that they most appreciat ed the student body. Other aspects included Hastings' public mission (55%, n = 47), San Francisco location (55%, n = 47), Hastings' commitment to teaching (54%, n = 46), their faculty colleagues (54%, n = 46), and the opportunity to contribute to positive change (53%, n = 45) (p. 233). Staff Respondents When asked what was the most appreciated aspects of UC Hastings Law, 72% ( n = 71) of Staff respondents indicated that they most appreciated their relationship with coworkers. Other aspects included relations hip with supervisor/manager (69%, n = 68), benefits (63%, n = 62), fulfilling/satisfying work (63%, n = 62), and opportunities to make a positive contribution (58%, n = 57) (p. 233). Student Respondents When asked what was the most appreciated aspects of U C Hastings Law, 56% ( n = 221) of Student respondents indicated that they most appreciated the San Francisco location. Other aspects included faculty (49%, n = 194), clinical and experiential programs (47%, n = 188), alumni network (43%, n = 172), Hastings' connections to the Bay Area and Silicon Valley institutions and businesses (43%, n = 169), and engaging and effective teaching (42%, n = 168) (p.234). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report x Respondents Who Seriously Considered Leaving UC Hastings Law Campus climate research has demonstrated the effects of campus climate on faculty and student retention.4 Research specific to student experiences has found that sense of belonging is integral to student persistence and retention.5 Faculty and Staff Respondents Fifty -one percent (n = 43) of Faculty respondents and 60% (n = 58) of Staff respondents had seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law (p. 190). Of those who seriously considered leaving, 49% (n = 21) of Faculty respondents seriously considered leaving because they felt under -appreciated or under -valued and 40% ( n = 17) because of pe rsonal reasons (p. 192). Sixty - two percent (n = 36) of Staff respondents who seriously considered leaving noted it was because of low salary/pay rate and 48% (n = 28) because of limited opportunities for advancement (p. 190). Student Respondents Forty -five percent ( n = 179) of Student respondents had seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law (p. 226). Of those respondents, 55% (n = 99) seriously considered leaving because they had a desire to attend a different law school. Student respondents also considered leaving because they lacked a sense of belonging at UC Hastings Law (41%, n = 74), because of the campus climate (34%, n = 61), and/or because of a lack of institutional support (34%, n = 60, p. 227). Respondents ' Sense of Belonging A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the Sense of Belonging scale derived from Questions 105 and 109 on the survey for staff and students . Sense of Belonging questions for Faculty respondents could not be combined into a factor for analysis because of differences in wording between R&A's scale and the questions asked on the survey . Higher scores on the Sense of Belong ing factors suggested an individual or constituent group felt a stronger sense of 4 Blumenfeld et al. (2016); Gardner (2013); Garvey & Rankin (2016); D. R. Johnson et al. & Tuckwiller (2019); Lawrence Strayhorn 5 Booker (2016); G arc\u00eda & Garza (2016); Hausmann et al. (2007) Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report xi belonging at UC Hastings Law . Using this scale, analyses revealed the following significant differences in the overall test means for : Staff respondents by years of employmen t on Staff Sense of Belonging . Findings indicated that Staff Respondents with Less than 6 Years of employment had higher Staff Sense of Belonging scores than did Staff Respondents with 6 or More Years of employment at UC Hastings Law (p. 189). Student respondents by disability status and religious affiliation on Student Sense of Belonging . These findings indicated that Student Respondents with No Disability had higher Student Sense of Belonging scores than did both Student Respondents with a Single Disability and Student Respondents with Multiple Disabilities (p. 206). Challenges and Opportunities Related to Campus Climate Faculty Respondents Only 16% (n = 13, p. 166) of Faculty respondents felt that salaries for tenure -track faculty positions were competitive , and 19% ( n = 15, p. 166) of Faculty respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that child care benefits were competitive. One-fourth (25%, n = 20, p. 168) of Faculty respondents felt that meaningful committee work was fairly distributed across the faculty. A little more than one-third (35%, n = 28) of Faculty respondents felt that UC Hastings Law provided adequate resources to help them manage work -life balance (p. 167). Staff Respondents Staff respondents indicated that they felt less positive about several aspect s of their work life at UC Hastings Law . Twenty -six percent ( n = 25) of Staff respondents felt that they performed more work than colleagues with similar performance expectations (e.g., formal and informal mentoring or advising, helping with student groups and activities, providing other support , p. 174). Thirty -seven percent ( n = 36) of Staff respondents felt that they were pressured by departmental/program work require ments that occurred outside of normally scheduled hours (p. 175). Thirty -nine percent ( n = 38) of Staff respondents felt that their workload increased without Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report xii additional compe nsation as a result of other staff departures (e.g., retirement positions not filled , p. 175). Student Respondents Analyses of the Students' survey responses revealed statis tically significant differences based on disability status, first -generation status, income status, racial identity, religious affiliation , sexual identity, gender identity, political views, and practice area of interest where students from backgrounds his torically underrepresented at colleges held less positive views of their experiences than did their peers from \"majority\" backgrounds (pp. 209-213). Student Respondents ' Perceived Academic Success A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the Perceived Academic Success scale derived from Question 7 on the survey. Using this scale, analyses revealed that Not-First-Generation Student respondents had higher Perceived Academic Success scores than First-Generation Student respondents (p. 200). Subsequent analyses on Perceived Academic Success for Student respondents were significant for two comparisons: No Disability vs. Sing le Disability and No Disability vs. Multiple Disabilities . These findings suggest that Student Respondents with No Disability had higher Perceived Academic Success scores than both Student Respondents with a Single Disability and Student Respondents with M ultiple Disabilities (p. 200). A Meaningful Percentage of Respondents Experienced Unwanted Sexual Conduct In 2014, Not Alone: The First Report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault indicated that sexual assault is a substantial issue for colleges and universities nationwide, affecting the physical health, mental health, and academic success of students. The report highlights that one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college. One section of the UC Hastings Law survey r equested information regarding respondents' experiences with sexual assault. 11% (n = 65) of all respondents indicated that they had experienced unwanted sexual contact/conduct while at UC Hastings Law (p. 139). 1% (n = 6) experienced relationship violence (e.g., ridiculed, controlling, hitting , p. 139). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report xiii 2% (n = 12) experienced stalking (e.g., following me, on social media, texting, phone calls , p. 141). 9% (n = 51) experienced sexual interaction (e.g., catcall ing, repeated sexual advances, sexual harassment , sexual cyber -harassment , p. 143). 3% (n = 16) experienced unwanted sexual contact ( e.g., fondling, rape, sexual assault, penetration without consent , p. 148). Respondents identified UC Hastings Law students, current or former dating/intimate partners, acquaintances/friends, and strangers as sour ces of unwanted sexual contact/conduct (pp. 140-148). Respondents who indicated th at they did not report unwanted sexual contact/conduct were offered the opportunity to elaborate on why that was the case . The primary r eason cited for not reporting these incidents was that the incidents did not feel serious enough to report. Additional rationales included that respondents did not want to go through the reporting process because they feared nothing would happen and the contact occurred off -campus (pp. 142-150). Conclusion UC Hastings Law climate findings6 were consistent with those found in higher educa tion institutions across the country, based on the work of R&A Consulting.7 For example, 7 0% to 80% of respondents in similar reports of universities and colleges found the campus climate to be \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable.\" A somewhat lower percent age ( 61%) of UC Hastings Law respondents indicated that they were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the overall climate at UC Hastings Law (p. 57). Twenty percent to 25% of respondents in similar reports of universities and colleges indicated that they personally had experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and /or hostile conduct in the past year . At UC Hastings Law , a somewhat higher percentage of respondents ( 33%) indicated that they personally had experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct in the past two years (p. 80). The 6 Additional findings disaggregated by position status and other selected demographic characteristics are provided in the full report. 7 Rankin & Associates Consulting (2021) Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report xiv results also paralleled the findings of other climate studies of specific constituent groups offered in the literature.8 UC Hastings Law 's climate assessment report provides baseline data on diversity and inclusion, and addresses UC Hastings Law 's mission and goals. While the findings may guide decision - making regarding policies and practices at UC Hastings Law , it is impor tant to note that the cultural fabric of any institution and unique aspects of each campus's environment must be taken into consideration when deliberating additional action items based on these findings. The climate assessment findings provide the UC Hast ings Law community with an opportunity to build upon its strengths and to develop a deeper awareness of the challenges ahead. UC Hastings Law , with support from senior administrators and collaborative leadership, is in a prime position to actualize its com mitment to promote an inclusive campus and to institute organizational structures that respond to the needs of its dynamic campus community. 8 Guiffrida et al. (2002); Harper & Hurtado (2007); Harper & Quaye (2004); Hurtado & Ponjuan (2005); Rankin Reason (2005); Settles et al. (2006); Silverschanz et al. (2008); Yosso et al. (2009) Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 1 Introduction History of the Project UC Hastings Law affirms that d iversity , equity, and inclusion are cr itical to the intellectual vitality of the campus community . These values promote teaching, learning, living, and working in a pluralistic communit y of mutual respect. The f ree exchange of ideas and viewpoints in suppo rtive environments encourages students, faculty, and staff to develop and refine critical thinking and citizenship skills and supports the development of a more just society . Consistent with its strategic plan , UC Hastings Law is \"committed to building a cohesive and inclusive community by maintaining a diverse student body, faculty, and staff; creating physical spaces on campus dedicated to diverse and inclusive programming; integrating departments and employees to advance our mission; and find ing new ways to inspire and involve our alumni community.\"9 To better understand the campus climate, the senior administration at UC Hastings Law recognized the need for a comprehensive tool that would provide campus climate metrics for the experiences and perceptions of all segments of the College's students, facu lty, and staff . During spring 2021, UC Hastings Law conducted a comprehensive community experience survey to develop a better understanding of the learning, living, and working environment on campus. The survey's ultimate goal is to allow the College commu nity to build on UC Hasting Law's strengths while identifying and acting on opportunities for growth and change. This survey effort began i n 2020 when UC Hastings Law contracted with Rankin & Associates Consulting (R&A) to conduct a college -wide study enti tled \"UC Hastings College of the Law Assessment of Climate for Learning, Living, and Working.\" A 19 -member community experience survey Working Group (CESWG), composed of faculty, staff, students, and administrators, was tasked with developing a college -wide survey instrument and promoting the survey's administration , which occurred between March 2 and March 28, 2021. On September 9 https://www.uchastings.edu/diversity/ Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 2 23 and September 2021 , R&A will present the information gathered from the survey in community forums. The survey was conducted wh ile UC Hastings Law, like many institutions of higher education in America, was operating almost entirely remotely as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (although a small portion of students continued in residence at the Tower during this period). This stud y therefore represents in part a snapshot of the campus climate during the COVID -19 remote environment, although it also invited reflections on the climate in the in -person environment as well. Project Design and Campus Involvement Rankin (2003) modified the conceptual model of campus climate developed by Smith et al. (1997) to use as the foundation for UC Hasting Law's campus climate assessment. The model employs critical theory and a power and privilege perspective, which establishes that power differen tials, both earned and unearned, are central to all human interactions (Brookfield, 2005) . Unearned power and privilege are associated with membership in dominant social groups (A. Johnson, 2005) and influence systems of differentiation that reproduce unequal outcomes. UC Hasting Law's assessment was the result of a comprehensive process to i dentify the strengths and challenges of the campus climate, with a specific focus on the distribution of power and privilege among differing social groups. This report provides an overview of the results of the college -wide survey. The C ESWG collaborated with R&A to develop the survey instrument. Together, they review ed tested survey questions from the R&A question bank and developed a survey instrument for UC Hastings Law that would reveal the various dimension s of power and privilege that shape the campus experience. The UC Hastings Law survey queried various campus constituent groups about their experiences and perceptions regarding the academic environment for students, the workplace environment for faculty a nd staff, employee benefits, sexual harassment and sexual violence, racial and ethnic identity, gender identity and gender expression, sexual identity, and accessibility and disability services. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 3 Foundation of Campus Climate Research and Assessment In 1990 , the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the American Council on Education (ACE) established that to build a vital community of learning, an institution must create a community that is purposeful, open, just, disciplined, caring, and c elebrative (Boyer, 1990 ). Achieving these characteristics is part of \"a larger, more integrative vision of community in higher education, one that focuses not on the length of time students spend on campus, but on the quality of the encounter, and relates not only to social activities, but to the classroom, too\" (Boyer, 1990, p. 7) . In 1995, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) challenged higher education institutions \"to affirm and enact a commitment to equality, fairness, and inc lusion\" (1995, p. xvi). The AAC&U proposed that colleges and universities commit to \"the task of creating inclusive educational environments in which all participants are equally welcomed, equally valued, and equally heard\" (p. xxi). The report stated that a primary duty of the academy was to create a campus climate grounded in the principles of diversity, equity, and justice for all individuals to provide the foundation for a vital community of learning. The visions of these national education organizations serve as the foundation for cur rent campus climate research and assessment. Definition of Campus Climate Limited consensus exists in the research literature about the definition of campus climate (Hart & Fellabaum, 2008; Ryder & Mitchell, 2013). After an extensive review of research, Ra nkin & Associates Consulting found the scholarship of Sylvia Hurtado and her colleagues to offer the most comprehesive and well researched model to assess campus climate. Hurtado et al. (1999) examined campus climate in relation to the perceptions and expe riences of an institution's members. Specifically, they described four factors that constitute campus climate . These include, an institution's historical legacy of inclusion/exclusion, psychological climate, structural diversity, and behavior al elements. Historical legacy includes an institution's history of resistance to or compliance with desegregation as well as its current mission and policies. Psychological climate refers to perceptions of racial/ethnic tensions, discrimination, and attitudes toward an d reduction of prejudice on campuses . Structural dimensions of campus climate account for the impact of demographic diversity among faculty, staff, and students , while the Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 4 behavioral dimensions consist of social interaction, campus involvement, and classro om diversity. Building on this model, Rankin and Reason (2008) defined campus climate as \"the current attitudes, behaviors, and standards, and practices of employees and students in an institution \" (p. 264). Rankin and Reason (2008) further specified , Beca use in our work we are particularly concerned about the climate for individuals from traditionally underreported, marginalized, and underserved groups , we focus particularly on those attitudes, behaviors, and standards/practices that concern the access for , inclusion of, and level of respect for individual and group needs, abilities, and potential. Note that this definition includes the needs, abilities, and potential of all groups, not just those who have been traditionally excluded or underserved by our institutions . (p. 264) Using th is definition , grounded in the work of Hurtado and her colleagues (1992; 1999), the mission of Rankin & Associates Consulting is to develop institution -specific assessment tools and analy sis of the resulting data in order to understand and evaluate an institution's campus climate. Influence of Climate on Faculty , Staff, and Students Campus climate influences individuals' sense of belonging within social and academic institutional environments ( Museus et al., 2017; Rankin & Reason, 2005; Strayhorn, 2012 , 2013). Johnson (2012) define d sense of belonging as students' \"feelings of connection and identification or isolation and alienation within their campus community\" (p. 337). Similarly, Strayhorn (2012) characterized sense of belonging as \"students' perceived social support on campus, a feeling or sensation of connectedness, the experience of mattering or feeling cared about, accepted, respected, and valued by, and important to the group (e.g., campus community) or others on c ampus (e.g., faculty, peers)\" (p. 3). Further, Strayhorn (2012) described an individual 's sense of belonging as a \"basic human need [that takes on] increased significance in environments or situations that individuals experience as different , unfamiliar, o r foreign, as well as in context where certain individuals are likely to feel marginalized, unsupported, or unwelcomed\" (p. 10). For many underrepresented and/or underserved faculty, staff, and students, a sense of belonging on college and university campu ses is paramount . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 5 Researchers have conducted extensive studies regarding the ways in which campus climate affects sense of belonging for various student populations. For example, recent studies focused on campus climate and a sense of belonging for a) student athletes (Gayles et al., 2018) ; b) women students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields (Johnson, 2012) ; c) first-generation students (Means & Pyne, 2017) ; d) racial and ethnic minority students (Maramba Museus, 2011; Mwangi, 2 016; Tachine et al., 2017; Wells & Horn, 2015) ; e) Black men (Wood & Harris, 2015) ; f) students with disabilities (Vaccaro et al. , 2015) ; and, g) queer (LGBPQ) students (Vaccaro & Newman, 2017). Researchers also have explored the ways that an individual's sense of belonging influenced their intent to persist at an institution (Booker, 2016; Garc\u00eda & Garza, 2016; Hausmann et al., 2007; Museus et al., 2017) . Student persistence and retention are principal measure s of campus climate . Researchers have focused on social, cultural, and academic factors that influenced students' intent to persist, includin g opportunities for engagement with faculty and others from diverse backgrounds as well as access to student groups, institutional support programs , and initiatives . Research in recent years has demonstrated how the above factors specifically influence d intent to persist among Black undergraduate women (Booker, 2016; Walpole et al., 2014), Black undergraduate men (Eunyoung & Hargrove, 2013; Palmer et al., 2014), Latinx & Garza, 2016; Heredia et al., 2018; 2015), racial minority stude nts (Baker & Robnett, 2012; Johnson et al., 2014; Lancaster & Yonghong, with disabilities (Kutscher & Tuckwiller, 2019), queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum individuals (Blumenfeld et al., 2016), and graduate students (Ruud et al., 2018) . Mayhew et al. (2016) noted that \"havi ng meaningful peer interactions and relationships and experiencing overall social and academic integration and involvement\" contributed positively to student persistence and retention (p. 419). In addition to research on the relationship between sense of belonging and retention, campus climate research has focused on the relationship between campus climate and students' engagement and success (Glass & Westmont, 2014; Hurtado & 2017) and well -being (Gummadam et al., 2016) . These studies found that minority students had characteristically different experiences of engagement and success than did their majority peers. Unique perceptions associated with access Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 6 to support networks, education in pluralistic settings, and academic programs that simultaneously challenge and offer support to students , for example, were salient to positive or negative outcomes . In addition to students, studies have also examined the impact of campus climate on the persistence and retention of underrepresented faculty populations , ones that includ e Black faculty (Griffin, Pifer et al., 2011; Lynch -Alexander, 2017; Siegel et al., 2015 ), international faculty (Law rence et al., 2014), racial and ethnic minority faculty (Jayakumar et al., 2009; Whittaker et al., 2015), queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum faculty (Garvey & Rankin, 2016), and women faculty in STEM fields (Pascale, 2018). Select studies noted the importan t role of effective mentorship in the success, promotion, and retention of underrepresented faculty (Lynch - Alexander, 2017; Zambrana et al., 2015) . Unfortunately, there is scant research specific to the impact of climate on the persistence and retention of staff. Some c ampus climate assessments also measure d intersectional experiences (i.e. , the interrelationship between race, gender and/or sexuality) in relation to the perceptions and experiences of faculty, staff and students of a given institution (Booke r, 2016; Griffin, Bennett, & Harris, 2011; Hughes, 2017; -Ramos et al., 2015; Walpole et al., 2014). The following sections present campus climate research findings for select ca mpus constituents with the understanding that individuals are multidimensional and are not ascribed to only one identity marker. Faculty and Campus Climate Campus climate actively shapes the experiences of faculty, particularly related to professional success, sense of belonging, and perceptions of professional development opportunities and collegial and administrative support. Most research regarding faculty and campus climate examines the impact of racial identity, sexual identity, and/or gender identity on faculty perceptions and experiences . A summary of the literature is offered below.10 10 For additional literature regarding faculty experiences and campus climate , please visit www.rankin - consulting.com. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 7 Campus climate research found that faculty of color commonly experie nced high levels of work - related stress, moderate -to-low job satisfaction, feelings of isolation, and negative bias in the promotion and tenure process (Dade et al., 2015; Eagan & Garvey, 2015, Patton & Catching, 2009; Urrieta et al., 2015; Whittaker et al ., 2015) . In addition, campus climate research focused specifically on two-year institutions report ed similar experiences for faculty of color as well as negative perceptions of self, decreased work productivity, and decreased contributions to the institut ion as a result of a hostile campus climate (Levin et al., 2014, 2015). Dade et al. (2015) , in their research on Black faculty in predominantly White universities, found that structural inequalities, lack of cultural awareness throughout academic instituti ons, and institutiona l racism present ed substantial barriers to the emotional well -being and professional success of Black and/or African American faculty, particularly Black and/or African American women faculty. Intersectional research found that women faculty of color were not provided with professional mentorship and leadership development opportunities in a manner consistent with those provided to their White colleagues (Blackwell et al., 2009; Grant & Ghee, 2015). Accordingly , Kelly and McCann (2014) , in their study of women faculty of color at predominantly White research universities, found that pre -tenure departur e was often attributed to \"gendered and racialized tokenization and isolation, a need for more intrusive style of mentoring, and poor institution al fit\" (p. 681). Focusing on gendered and racialized service expectations, Hirshfield and Joseph (2012) found that women f aculty of color also experienced significant \"identity taxation\" within the academ y (p. 214). Their findings suggested that women faculty of color faced formal and informal expectations to provide mentorship and emotional labor in support of their students . Relatedly, when only taking gender into consideration, c ampus climate research specific to women faculty revealed experiences with gender discrimination, professional isolation, lack of work -life balance, and disproportionate service expectations within campus environments (Grant & Ghee, 2015) . Compared with their m ale colleagues , these experiences resulted in higher rates of institutional departure among women faculty (Gardner, 2013). Maranto and Griffin (2011) identified women faculty's perceived lack of inclusion and support as primary contributors to their experiences of \"chilly\" departmental climates . According to Maranto and Griffin (2011) , \"Our relationships with our colleagues create the environment within which our professional lives occu r, and i mpact our identity and our worth\" (p. 152). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 8 Additionally, r ecent research has highlighted the disparities in the quantity and types of service activities women faculty were asked to perform , particularly institutional service and advising within male -domi nated fields (O'Meara et al., 2017). Guarino and Borden (2017) found, when accounting for faculty rank, race/ethnicity, and field of study, women faculty performed substantially more service than did men faculty, particularly internal service, or service o n behalf of the department or institution . Hanasono et al. (2019) suggested that internal service, or what the authors termed \"relational service, \" was not only performed more often by women faculty, but less valued in evaluation process es, which had a subsequent negative effect on the tenure, promotion, and retention of women faculty . With respect to sexual and gender identity, campus climate research ers have examined the hostile and exclusionary institutional settings that queer -spectrum11 and trans -spectrum faculty experienced within higher education. According to Bilimoria and Stewart (2009), failure to hide one's queer or trans gender identity may result in unwanted scrutiny and alienation from fellow faculty members. As a result, queer -spectrum faculty reported feeling compelled to maintain secrecy regarding their identities. Dozier (2015) specifically identified prejudicial comments, invalidation of LGBT -related research and cultures, and social exclusion at the department -level , as the b asis for hostile climate s and reports of low job satisfaction for \"out\" gay and lesbian faculty. Blumenfeld et al. (2016) and Rankin et al. (2010) identified campus climate, specifically feelings of hostility and isolation, as significant factors in the desire among queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum faculty member s to leave an institution . From an examination of institutional geography, Garvey and Rankin (2016) found that queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum faculty also were more likely to seriously consider leaving an institution that was located in a small town and/or rural environment. For queer -spectrum faculty, hostile campus climates can result in isolation, poor job satisfaction , and a desire to leave . Race, ethnicity, gender, sexual and gender identity, when considered separately and intersectionally, impact the perceptions and experiences of faculty writ large. Further, research 11 Rankin & Associates Consulting uses the term \"queer -spectrum\" in materials to identify non -heterosexual sexual identities. Identities may include lesbian, gay, bis exual, queer, asexual, pansexual, and/or polysexual as well as other sexual identities. Ranking &Associates Consulting uses \"trans -spectrum\" as an umbrella term to describe the gender identity of individuals who do not identify as cis -gender. Identities ma y include transgender, gender nonbinary, gender -queer, and/or agender, in addition to other non -cis-gender identities . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 9 demonstrates that campus climate impacts faculty members' job satisfaction , professional and social well -being, and intent to persist at an institution . Though research applicable to staff is minimal, in the section that follows staff identities, experiences, and perceptions are examined. Staff and Campus Climate From the limi ted research available on staff members in higher education , findings suggest a lack of professional support and advancement opportunities among professional and classified/hourly staff members. Staff commonly attribute d lack of support and advancement opp ortunities to discrimination and stereotyping based on their identities and/or personal attributes, including age, race, gender, and education level ( Costello, 2012; Jones & Taylor, 2012). Garcia (2016), Jones and Taylor (2012), and Mayhew et al. (2006) found that staff members' perceptions of campus climate were constructed through daily interactions with colleagues and supervisors, institutional norms and practices, and staff members' immediate work environments. For example, in an investigation of the c ampus climate experiences of student affairs professionals working at a Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), Garcia (2016) found that compositional diversity of a department and the microclimate of individuals' office/departments directly affect ed staff me mbers' perceptions of campus climate. Garcia's findings were similar to those of Mayhew et al. (2006), who found that staff members ' experience s with their immediate office/department influenced how they perceived the broader campus climate. According to Mayhew et al. (2006), \"Staff members who perceived their local unit to be non -sexist, non -racist, and non -homophobic were consistently more likely to perceive that their community had achieved a positive climate for diversity\" across the organization (p. 83 ). In an investigation of the various forms of labor staff and administrators of color performed independent of their assign ed job duties, Luedke (2017) analyzed mentor -mentee relationships aimed at supporting first-generation Black, Latinx, and biracial students. Luedke employed social reproduction theory to study the various forms of social and emotional support staff members provide d to student s and the ways in which staff nurtured the social capital that students brought with them to college . Key to such relationships, staff members of color understood and found value in the backgrounds, skills, and abilities held by students of color Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 10 which, Luedke explained, opened the door for students to acquire various forms of cultural capital. Students and Campus Climate The majority of research regarding students' campus climate experiences focuses on the experiences of undergraduate s. Most literature about campus climate and undergraduate students examine d campus climate in the context of multiple fac tors that shape students' identities and experiences . Research findings demonstrate d that campus climate influence d students' social and academic development and engagement, academic success, sense of belonging, and well -being. Scholars also have repeatedl y found that when students of color perceive d their campus environment as hostile, desired outcomes , such as persistence and academic performance , were negatively (Booker, 2016; Eunyoung . Climate r esearch regarding the experiences of student populations that include low- income students, students with disabilities, first -generation students, veteran students, international students, American Indian/ indigenous students , undocumented students, a nd student -athletes has become increasingly available over the past decade .12 The following paragraphs offer a summary of the most robust areas of campus climate research specific to student experiences, including the role of microaggressions (i.e., indirect and/or subtle discrimination) in creating hostile and exclusionary campus climates for minorit ized undergra duate students.13 Hostile or exclusionary campus climates negatively affect students of color in various ways. For example, scholars have found that when racial minority students perceived their campus environment as hostile, there was a decline in persist ence and academic performance (Booker, 2016; Eunyoung & Hargrove, 2013; Strayhorn, 2013). Additionally, Walpole et al. (2014) evaluated the ways that race -based microaggressions contributed to hostile and exclusionary campus climates for students of color , which result ed in reduced academic success and decrease d retention and persistence. In related work, Mills (20 20) examine d Black undergraduate students 12 For additional research regarding student -specific campus climate experiences, please visit www.rankin - consulting.com . 13 This review is intended to map the broad scope of campus climate research on students; it is not intended to present comprehensive findings of all research in this area. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 11 experiences with environmental microaggressions, in contrast to interpersonal microaggressions, at a pr edomin antly White institution (PWI). Developed from the work of Sue et al. (20 10), Mills (2020) noted that environmental microaggressions were unique in that they occurr ed at systemic levels with \"no apparent offender\" (p. 1). Mills (20 20) identified six t hemes related to environmental microaggression s experienced by Black undergraduate student s: segregation (particularly within student housing), lack of representation across institutional populations, campus response to criminality or an assumption of crim inality, cultural bias in courses, tokenism, and pressures to conform to standards of whiteness. Yosso et al. (2009) examined the effects of various forms of racial microaggressions (including interpersonal microaggressions, racial jokes, and institutional microaggressions) on Latinx students.14 Reynolds et al. (2010) also noted the negative impact hostile racial climates have on Black and Latinx students' intrinsic and extrinsic academic motivations, which subsequently diminished students' academic success . Research on racially diverse women undergraduate students, particularly within science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, has explored how students' perceived sense of belonging affected their academic success and well -being. Booker (2016) d escribe d the challenges that Black/African Americ an undergraduate women face in the classroom, including microaggressions from faculty, microaggressions from peers, and expectation s that Black/African American students represent their race (s) when speaking about specific course topics. As a result, Black /African American undergraduate women experienced a decreased sense of belonging in the classroom and a perception that faculty members were no t approachable. Similarly, in a study of racially diverse women in STEM, Johnson (2012) found that perceptions of campus racial climate and students' experiences within different college environments , including residence halls, classrooms, and dining facilities , were significant predictors of students' sense of belonging. In their investigation of undergraduate students with disabilities attending four -year institutions , Fleming et al. (2017) found that their perceptions of campus climate directly affected their sense of belonging and satisfaction at their institution . In a related line of scholarship, Vaccaro et al. 14 Rankin & Associates Consulting uses the gender -inclusive term \"Latinx\" in our materials to iden tify individuals and communities of Latin decent. That terminology has been adopted in this document, even when reporting campus climate research that used terms including \"Latino,\" \"Latina,\" and/or \"Latino/a.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 12 (2015) noted the importance of sense of belonging among students with disabilities, particularly first-year students with disabilities , as they adjusted to a postsecondary educational environment. Kutscher and Tuckwiller (2019) investigated the unique cha llenges that students with disabilities experienced in higher education environments , particularly related to personal identities , academic and social engagement, and accommodations and , subsequently , their persistence . In a study of the most salient barri ers faced by students with disabilities, Hong (2015) identifi ed faculty perceptions, engagement with advisors, college stressors, and quality of support programs and services. Examining the role of social class in relation to students' first -year experien ce, Soria and Stebleton (2013) found that working -class students felt less welcome, or a lesser sense of belonging, when compared with their middle - and upper -class peers. In a study focused on private, normatively affluent institutions , Allen and Alleman (2019) found that students who experienced food insecurity frequen tly self -exclude d from food -oriented social events and missed academic and community engagement opportunities as a result of their need to work. In a study of 324 undergraduates, Ostrove and Long (2007) found that students' \"social class background was strongly related to a sense of belonging at college, which in turn predicted social and academic adjustment to college, quality of experience at college, and academic performance\" (p. 3 80). They noted that such a finding was helpful because, while social class cannot be changed, \"we can change the extent to which institutions of higher education are welcoming and inclusive with respect to social class\" (p. 384).15 Campus climate resear ch specific to the experiences of queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum students indicates that queer -spectrum and trans -spectrum individuals experienced hostility, discrimination, and lack of sense of belonging within various institutional environments (Ranki n et al., 2010; Seelman et al., 2017). Vaccaro and Newman (2017) examined to which lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, and queer (LGBPQ) students developed a sense of belonging during their first year at an institution . The authors found that stu dents' sense of belonging was influenced by their degree of outness, university messaging specific to LGBPQ individuals, and 15 For additional research regarding various m inority populations' sense of belonging in higher education, please visit www.rankin -consulting.com. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 13 meaningful social interactions with peers. Garvey et al. (2015) found classroom climate was a key indicator of how LGBPQ community college students perceived campus climate. Trans - identified students reported more negative perceptions of classroom climate, campus climate, and curriculum inclusivity than their heterosexual and queer -spectrum peers al., 20 15; Nicolazzo, 2016) . As noted by the literature, undergraduate students experience campus climate differentially, based upon their various identity formations. The extent to which a campus climate is perceived and experienced as welcoming or hostile shap es the undergraduate student trajectory. In a similar vein, graduate students also express varied perceptions, experiences and outcomes in relation to campus climate. Graduate /Professional Students and Campus Climate The available campus climate research specific to graduate students suggests that, particularly , women graduate students, graduate students of color, international graduate students of color , and trans -spectrum graduate students experienced an exclusionary campus climate . Regarding the experiences of international graduate students, research has identified significant differences according to students' nationality, race , and religion. While all international graduate students experience some level of \"acculturative stress\" owing to English language proficiency, homesickness, loneliness and isolation, research demonstrates that international graduate students of color are more likely to experience heightened acculturative stress because of extant racism and nativism on U .S. campuses (Mwangi et al., 2019; Moglen, 2017; Yen & Inose, 2003). For example, Yakaboski et al . (2018) investigated Saudi graduate students' interactions with faculty, staff, and U.S. students. Though the study's subjects shared positive interactions with faculty and staff, they also shared negative and discriminatory interactions with U.S. students , and specifically not ed a \"lack of cultural and religious understanding or acceptance and pervasive gender stereotypes for Muslim women who veil\" (p. 222). Mwangi et al. (2019) echo these findings in their study of Black African graduate students' experie nce. They note that Black African graduate students are subjected to racism, tokenism, negative stereotyping, microaggressions and overt hostility from faculty, staff and students alike. While it is understood that international graduate students experienc e some degree of transitional challenges upon Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 14 arriving in the U .S., their academic and social well -being depends upon a campus culture that will either mitigate or exacerbate their sense of otherness (Mwangi et al., 2019). While international graduate stu dents of color have unique experiences specific to their foreign status, there are some parallels to the experiences of domestic graduate students of color. For example, Shavers and Moore (2014) examined how Black women doctoral candidates experienced camp us climate through social and academic engagements. The researcher s found that Black women graduate students engage d in \"survival oriented\" or \"suboptimal resistance strategies\" to persevere through feelings of isolation, lack of community, and lack of sup port within their individual programs and the broader campus climate (p. 404). Identifying the effects of hostile campus climates for racial minority women graduate students in STEM fields , Ong et al. (2011) wrote, The existing empirical work on graduate experiences overwhelmingly identifies the STEM social and cultural climate \u2014that is, the interpersonal relationships w ith other members of the local STEM communities and the cultural beliefs and practices within STEM that govern those relationships \u2014as the l eading challenge to the persistence of women of color in STEM career trajectories\" (p. 192). Trans-spectrum (including trans and gender non -conforming) graduate students report ed similar feelings of distress in their interpersonal academic and social rela tionships. Goldberg et al. (2019) found that trans -spectrum graduate students commonly presented an outward gender identity inconsistent with their inner gender identity out of concern for their own physical and emotional safety. Trans -spectrum graduate st udent survey respondents in the Goldberg et al. (2019) study identified acts of gender identity invalidation and misgendering by peers, faculty, and advisors as a source of emotional stress. Regarding trans -spectrum graduate students' interactions with fac ulty, Goldberg et al. (2019) identified respondents' interactions with their faculty advisor as a specifically \"salient context for experiencing affirmations versus invalidation of one's gender identity\" (p. 38). Campus climate research has demonstrated th at positive engagement with peers and faculty is a critical factor in the success and well -being of trans - spectrum graduate students. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 15 Campus Climate: Institution Type Though the majority of campus climate research available pertains to four -year and predomin antly White institutions (PWIs), an increasing amount of research is currently available regarding campus climate at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic Serving institutions (HSI), two -year and/or community college institution s, and religiously/spiritually affiliated institutions .16 Today's broadening scope of campus climate research also encompasses research specific to professional school s, including schools of medicine and law.17 A summary of campus climate research specific to institutional type and student experiences is offered in the following sections . Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) In recent years, researche rs have begun to investigate campus climate specific to HBCU s. The majority of HBCU -specific campus climate research examined the experiences of minority and underrepresented populations in HBCU environments and included Black international students (Mwangi, 2016), Asian American and Latinx students (Palmer & Maramba, 2015a , 2015b), first - generation students (Longmire -Avital & Miller -Dyce, 2015), African American gay and bisexual men (Patton, 2011), and/or queer -spectrum and (Lewis & Ericksen, 2016) . HBCU -specific research has provided insight into the role of facu lty engagement in constructing minority students' perceptions of HBCUs' campus climates , often in contrast to PWIs. For example , McCoy et al. (2017) examined the role of faculty interactions in constructing racial minority students' perceptions of STEM dis ciplines. Drawing from Bourdieu 's social reproduction theory, McCoy et al. (2017) contrasted the faculty mentoring experiences of racial minority students majoring in a STEM discipline at a predominantly White institution and racial minority students major ing in a STEM discipline at an HBCU . McCoy et al. (2017) found that students perceived faculty at the PWI to be unwilling to mentor students, and instead, as commonly working to \"weed out\" students. In contrast, respondents at HBCUs characterized 16 For research regarding Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) , Tribal Colleges, or private institutions, please visit www.rankin -consulting.com. 17 Rankin & Associates Consulting acknowledges that the institutional categories provided are not mutually exclusive. For example, research described regarding Hispanic Servi ng Institutions (HSIs) may also include findings related to two -year or community college institutions. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 16 faculty a s providing positive mentoring and constructive professional development opportunities. Extending their prior research, Winkle -Wagner and McCoy (2018) found that students from a PWI described a challenging environment based on experiences of exclusion and isolation. In comparison, HBCU students characterized the composition of their STEM program as diverse and described their program and institution as supportive of individuals' n eeds. In research specific to the experiences of Asian American and Latinx stu dents, Palmer and Maramba (2015 a) found that faculty interactions were important to students' campus climate experiences. Palmer and Maramba's (2015 b) study participants noted that HBCU faculty demonstrat ed care and concern for students' well -being and that they felt supported . Hispanic -Serving Institutions (HSI) In 2017, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) noted that HSIs, defined as institutions where the total Hispanic enrollment constitutes a minimum of 25% of the total enrollment, enrolled 66% of all Hispanic undergraduates in the United States (HACU, 2019). Despite limited research regarding campus climate s at HSIs, the research available demonstrated the positive effects of at tending an HSI for Latinx students. Research suggests that Latinx students' HSI enrollment encouraged racial -ethnic identity development and contributed to greater senses of belonging , positive self -perceptions , and increased academic capabilities (Arbelo -Marrero & Milacci, 2016; Chun et al., 2016) . Additionally, Sanchez (2019) examined Latinx students' experiences of racial microaggressions and subsequent sense of belonging at HSIs and Emerging Hispanic Serving Institutions (EHSIs).18 She found that altho ugh students at both HSIs and EHSIs experienced racist stereotypes and assumptions \u2014including anti -Mexican or anti -immigrant sentiments , stereotypes about students' intelligence or college readiness, and assumptions that students were granted admittance or scholarship funding bases exclusively on their racial or ethnic identity \u2014students enrolled at HSIs experienced racial microaggressions less frequently than did their peers attending an EHSI. Regarding students' reported sense of belonging, Sanchez (2019) o ffered that students who reported a positive sense of belonging attributed their institution al affiliation to 18 Sanchez (2019) defines Emerging Hispanic Serving Institutions as \"institution[s] with 15% to 24.9% Latino full - time undergraduate enrollment \" (p. 241). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 17 \"being able to speak Spanish on campus without judgment, noticing that their campus culture embraced Latino culture, and having friendly and suppo rtive professors and staff\" (p. 249). Participants who reported a l esser sense of belonging felt that \"campus culture was geared toward White students\" and th at \"Latino cultural events or organizations on campus\" were often \"invisible\" (p. 250). Two-Year Institutions and Community Colleges The expanding scope of campus climate research also include s research about two-year and/or community college institutions . Most commonly, researchers have examined campus climate in the context of two -year institutions as it relates to certain minority populations. For example, research currently exists about the campus climate experiences of LGBTQ students (Garvey et al., 2 015), racial/ethnic minority faculty (Levin et al., 2014, 2015), Black/African American women (Walpole et al., 2014), Black/African American men (Newman et al., 2015; Wood & Harris, 2015), Latinx men (Garc\u00eda & Garza, 2016), and faculty of color (Levin et a l., 2014, 2015) in two -year community college s. Consistent with findings specific to four -year institutions , campus climate research concerning two-year institutions has found that students ' interactions and engagement with faculty and staff influenced both perceived student academic success and student s' sense of belonging. In their examination of the factors that influenced sense of belonging for Latinx men students and international students, Garc\u00eda and Garza (2016) and Garc\u00eda et al. (2019) found that s ocio- academic integration \u2014academic interactions with faculty and administrative personnel \u2014was the most salient for developing individuals' sense of belonging and, subsequently, academic success and retention. Lundberg et al. (2018) found that frequent and high-quality interactions with faculty were significant to Latinx students' learning and engagement. Regarding the experiences of Black men's sense of belonging and academic engagement with faculty, Newman et al. (2015) found that Black men's perceptions o f belonging were influenced by faculty members' racial and gender stereotypes , faculty engagement with students, and acts of validation by faculty. Jones (2013) examined the influence of the racial composition of two -year institution's student body on the institution's campus climate . Through an examination of three diversity variables \u2014 student engagement with racially and culturally different peers, students' engagement with peers Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 18 who possess beliefs different from their own, and students' understanding of racial difference \u2014 Jones (2013) found that community college student body racial diversity positively correlated with students' frequent engagement with racially different peers and peers who held different personal beliefs and values from their own. Religiously Affiliated Institutions Recent campus climate research also examined campus climate at religiously affiliated institutions . For example, in an exploration of campus climate and student spirituality at religiously affiliated or faith -based institutions , Paredes -Collins (2014) found that the campus climate for diversity was a predictor of students' spiritual well -being and increased religious behav iors independent of student racial and/or ethnic identity. For students of color, Paredes - Collins (2014) found that sense of belonging was the single direct predictor of spiritual ity. The importance of student sense of belonging also was evident in finding s of Ash and Schreiner (2016), who investigated the institutional factors that influenced intent to persist among students of color enrolled in Christian colleges and universities. Ash and Schreiner (2016) found that students' perceptions of institutional fit; the institution's commitment to student welfare ; and students' perceptions of their ability to intellectually, socially, and psychologically thrive were direct contributors (or detractors) to students' success. Negr\u00f3n -Gonzales (2015), in an investiga tion of the experiences of undocumented students at Jesuit universities, found that institutional actions (or inactions) regarding social justice directly affected students' perceptions of campus climate. In addition, Negr\u00f3n -Gonzales (2015) found that the concept of social justice was a draw and an anchor for undocumented student s enroll ed at Jesuit institutions and that institutional reticence related to immigrant rights effectively silenced undocumented students. In a review of research regarding faith, g ender identity, sexual identity, and Christian higher education, Rockenbach and Crandall (2016) acknowledge d the complex relationship between faith, gender, and sexuality and encourage d institutional leaders to, address the most basic needs of LGBTQ indiv iduals, namely, their safety, freedom from discrimination and harassment, and access to resources in support of their psychological and spiritual well -being .\" They added, \"At a minimum, leaders should establish campus policies and Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 19 community standards that protect individuals from bullying and mistreatment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity . (Rockenbach & Crandall, p. 69) Professional Schools In a study of campus climate at law schools, Rocconi et al. (2019) emphasized the need for structural diversity and diversity of interactions in order to build positive campus climate law school environments. As evidence of the importance of diversity of interactions for law school students, Rocconi et al. (2019) referenc ed the work of Daye et al. (2012), which concluded that \"students attending law schools with racially diverse populations and high intergroup contact were more likely to perceive environments of openness and mutual respect\" (p. 29). In addition to structur al or compositional diversity, Rocconi et al. (2019) found that law students' perceptions of the law school environment as providing friendly and supportive experiences , offering positive interactions with faculty, and engendering positive relationships wi th peers contributed to a greater frequency of diverse interactions. The researchers also described collaborative faculty interactions and curricul a that encourage d peer engagement as essential to realizing the full benefits of structural diversity. They f urther determined that engagement in pro bono work and participation in a student organization also contributed to an increased frequency of diverse interactions. Rocconi et al. (2019) explained, \"intentionally engaging students with others from different backgrounds through curricular and co -curricular activities can help build a supportive and nurturing environment and foster the type of interactions that harness the educational benefits of diversity\" (p. 34). Focusing on law school faculty experiences, Barnes and Mertz (2018) investigated the factors that contributed to job dissatisfaction for post -tenure racial minority law professors and post - tenure women law professors. Barnes and Mertz (2018) specifically identified institutional structures and impli cit biases related to \"issues of respect, voice, and collegiality\" (p. 441) as significant factors that contributed to job dissatisfaction among post -tenure racial minority law professors. From their qualitative analyses, Barnes and Mertz (2018) noted subj ects' descriptions of the \"subtle and continuing ways in which [they] felt disrespected in their work settings\" (p. 455), including dismissal of their concerns and being penalized or unjustly disciplined for raising issues related to equity or exclusionary /hostile policies and/or behaviors . Research subjects described the need for peer and/or support networks for navigating the challenges associated Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 20 with being a racial and/or gender minority law school professor , ones that were independent of the institutio n. Regarding medical school campus climate research, Kaplan et al. (2018) examined challenges in the recruitment, retention, and promotion of underrepresented faculty within academic medicine. Though minority faculty described their academic climate as ne utral to positive, Kaplan et al. (2018) identified three consistent themes or challenges regarding the minority faculty and recruitment, retention, and promotion. The first theme or challenge Kaplan et al. (2018) identified was a lack of critical mass or a lack of a \"sufficient number of (underrepresented) faculty at an individual institution to create community and impact change\" (p. 59). The subjects in Kaplan et al . (2018) also identified the dearth of programming or initiatives specific to the retention and promotion of minority faculty. Last, they described the need for \"a diversity champion or a group of individuals vested in diversity\" a t senior leadership levels to effectively address recruitment, retention, and promotion concerns (p. 59). Campus Climate and Unwanted Sexual Conduct In recent years, sexual harassment, stalking, intimate partner violence, and sexual assault within higher education have drawn national attention. In January 2014, in response to calls for state and federal action, President Barack Obama established the Wh ite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The Task Force released its first report, Not Alone , in April 2014, which emphasized the need for nationwide action to raise awareness of, prevent, and respond to the prevalence of sexual assaul t on college campuses . The Task Force asserted that \"we are here to tell sexual assault survivors they are not alone\" and \"to help schools live up to their obligation to protect students from sexual violence\" (White House Task Force, 2014, p. 2) . The Task Force also recommended actions that should be taken by college and university communities, specifically campus administrations, regarding on -campus sexual assault. The Task Force encouraged campus leaders to conduct campus climate surveys to identif y the prevalence of and attitude toward sexual assault on their individual college campuses ( White House Task Force , 2014). According to the report, \"The first step in solving a problem is to name it and know the extent of it - and a campus climate survey is the best way to do that\" ( White House Task Force , 2014, p. 2) . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 21 Similarly, t he U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Violence Against Women has support ed the use of campus climate surveys in their effort to reduce sexual assault, dating and intimate part ner violence, and sexual harassment on college and university campuses. According to the Office , \"Campus climate surveys are essential because they generate data on the nature and extent of sexual assault on campuses, as well as campus attitudes surroundin g sexual assault. Armed with accurate data, administrators and students can then begin to direct resources where they are most needed\" (United States Department of Justice, 2018). Inherent in examinations of sexual assault and campus climate are questions about how various members of the community experience d sexual assault and the prevalence and patterns of assault. Recent research has identified various campus populations' unique and disproportionate experiences with unwanted sexual conduct and/or contac t on college and university campuses. These populations include d: women ( Krebs et al. , 2009) , graduate students ( Rosenthal et al., 2016), lesbian and bisexual women (Martin et al., 2011), students with disabilities (Brown et al., 2017), and trans -spectrum students (Griner et al., 2017). For example, in a national study conducted by the Association of American Institutions , as cited in the National Council on Disability's 2018 report, Not on the Radar: Sexual Assault of College Students with Disabilities , researchers found that 32% of undergraduate female students with a disability experienced unwanted sexual contact, including the use of physical force or incapacitation. By comparison, the same report found that 18% of undergraduate female students without a disability experienced sexual assault (National Council on Disability, 2018) . Noting disparities in rates of sexual harassment and/or assault, Coulter et al. (2017) explained, \"For sexual identity, sexual assault was highest among bisexuals and people un sure of their sexual identity (15.7% and 12.6%, respectively), followed by gays/lesbians (9.8%), and lowest among heterosexuals (6.4%)\" (p. 729). Coulter et al. (2017) also reported that Black trans - spectrum student s had a 58% pro bability of being sexual ly assault ed and noted that this finding underscores the importance of intersectional campus climate research. Regarding graduate students' experiences, McMahon et al. (2018) found that graduate students , in contrast to undergraduate student responde nts, reported less awareness of campus resources and lower confidence in the outcomes of reporting an incident of unwanted sexual contact and conduct. While some research is now available, the complex intersections of campus climate ; unwanted Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 22 sexual conduc t; and various social identities such as gender identity, sexual identity, disability status, and racial identity underscore the need for further research ( Coulter & Rankin, 2017 ). Role of Campus Senior Leadership Improving campus climate to build diverse, inclusive, and equitable educational environments and opportunities for all is not a simple task. In their foundational research, Hurtado et al. (1999) stated, Campuses are c omplex social systems defined by the relationships maintained between people, bureaucratic procedures, structural arrangements, institutional goals and values, traditions, and the larger sociohistorical environments where they are located. Therefore, any e ffort to redesign campuses with the goal of improving the climate for racial and cultural diversity must adopt a comprehensive approach (p. 69). Smith (2015) a lso assert ed that building a deep capacity for diversity requires a commitment by all members of the academic community but , perhaps most importantly, a sincere commitment by campus leadership. Smith (2009) explain ed, \"The role of leadership cannot be underestimated in creating change for diversity.\" Additionally, Smith also shared, \"Leadership can m ake a dramatic difference to whether and how diversity is built into the institution's understanding of itself or whether it is merely a series of programs or initiatives that run parallel to the core elements of the campus\" (p. 264). To foster a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization, campus climate research suggests whether senior leadership actively supports those goals is just as important as how senior leaders engage these topics and concerns. Furthermore, h ow campus leaders approach ed topics of diversity has been shown to influence students' perceptions of diversity and willingness to engage diverse perspectives. For instance, Harper and Yeung (2013) found that student perceptions of institutional commitment to diversity positively correlated with students' willingness to engage diverse perspectives. Similarly, in relation to perceptions of racial minority faculty, Squire (2017) found that how campus leadership responds to nationally known incidents of racial inequities or discrimination affect ed faculty members' perceptions of the institution's Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 23 commitment to diversity as well as faculty members' overall experience. According to Squire (2017), \"Faculty of color noted that the ways their institutions responded to racial incidences had direct effe cts on the way that they understood their institution's values concerning diversity, equity, and justice\" (p. 740). Squire (2017) also found that faculty of color held a perception that universities, in their pursuit of serving a public good , \"should respond to community incidences in ways that are appropriate to the scope of the matter\" (p. 739). For institutions that have created or are in the process of creating a Chief Diversity Officer position, how the position is structured as well as w hat resources and authority the position retains \"sends a powerful message about the role's importance on campus and illustrates the values of an institution\" has illustrated that how senior leadership defined and demonstrated their commitment to diversity , equity, and social justice was critical to how faculty, staff, and students experience d campus climate. In their discussion of the complex role of today's college and university presidents, Green and Shalala (2017) reminded administrators that it is the responsibility of senior leadership to enhance students' \"inclusion in and belonging to the broader campus community\" (p. 15). In their foundational work regarding effective diversity -oriented leadership , Astin and Astin (2000) asserted that leaders must engage in transformational leadership practices, where senior leaders serve as community -oriented change agents. The researchers emphasized that effective leadership requires modeling of specific leadership behaviors. These behaviors and skills included a commitment to collaboration and shared purpose, demonstrations of authenticity and self-awareness, and the ability to respectfully and civilly disagree with others (p. 71) . Astin and Astin (2000) also highlighted the essential skills of empathy and listeni ng for effective transformative leadership. Noting the value of behavior modeling, they wrote, [I]f the president is able to model the principles of transformative leadership in her dealings with her cabinet and if she openly advocates that cabinet member s do the same with their immediate colleagues, she could well create a ripple effect that can transform the culture of an entire institution (p. 86). Williams and Wade -Golden (2013) concurred that transformational leadership practices were critical for contemporary institutions of higher education. According to Williams and Wade - Golden (2013), \"Diversity issues cannot exist on the margins. To the contrary, issues of access, Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 24 retention, curricular diversity , and engaged scholarship represent a new 'academic diversity cannon' that has become fundamental to fulfilling the mission of academia in the new millennium\" (p. 171). Fortunately, campus climate research and assessment can provide today's senior leaders with both the information and skills necessary to bu ild equitable and just environments for all members of their campus communities. Taken together, an examination of student, faculty and staff perceptions and experiences of campus climate across institutional type and setting provide an expansive view of the importance of campus climate and the role of senior leadership in enhancing the collegiate experience. The diversity of racial/ethnic backgrounds, gender, sexual and gender identity, economic class, and other indexes of social status/affiliation reveal the robust dynamics at play in enhancing persistence, retention, and academic and social well -being. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 25 Methodology Conceptual Framework R&A defines diversity as the \"variety created in any society (and within any individual) by the presence of different poi nts of view and ways of making meaning, which generally flow from the influence of different cultural, ethnic, and religious heritages, from the differences in how we socialize women and men, and from the differences that emerge from class, age, sexual ide ntity, gender identity, ability, and other socially constructed characteristics.\"19 Rankin (2003) modified the conceptual model of campus climate developed by Smith et al. (1997) to use as the foundation for UC Hasting Law's campus climate assessment . Research Design Survey Instrument. The survey instrument was constructed based on the work of Rankin (2003), and with the assistance of the CESWG . The CESWG reviewed several drafts of the initial survey proposed by R&A and vetted the questions to be contextually appropriate for the UC H astings Law population. The final UC Hastings Law campus -wide survey contained 121 questions,20 including 17 open -ended questions for respondents to provide commentary. The survey was designed so respondents could provide information about their personal campus experiences, their perceptions of the campus climate, and their perceptions of UC Hastings Law 's institutional actions, including administrative policies and academic initiatives regarding diversity issues and concerns. The survey was available in an online format. S urvey responses were submitted to a secure -site database that did not log respondents' IP addresses, and then tabulated for appropriate analysis. Any comments provided by participants were separated from identifying information at submission so comments were not attributed to any individu al demographic characteristics. 19 Rankin & Associates Consulting (2021) adapted from AAC&U (1995). 20 To ensure reliability, evaluators must properly structure instruments (questions and response choices must be worded in such a way that they elicit consistent responses) and administer them in a consistent manner. The instrument defined critical terms, was revised numerous times, underwent expert evaluation of items, and was checked for internal consistency. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 26 Sampling Procedure. Laura Wilson -Youngblood, Associate General Counsel, reviewed the project proposal, including the survey instrument, and found it was exempt from Institutional Review Board review. Prospective participants received an invitation from Chancellor and Dean David Faigman , which contained the URL link to the survey. Respondents were instructed that they were not required to answer all questions and that they could withdraw from the survey at any time before subm itting their responses. The survey included information explaining the purpose of the study, describing the survey instrument, and assuring the respondents of anonymity. The final dataset included only surveys that were at least 5 0% completed. Limitations. Two limitations existed to the generalizability of the data. The first limitation was that respondents \"self -selected\" to participate in the study. Self -selection bias, therefore, was possible. This type of bias can occur because an individual 's decision to participate may be correlated with traits that affect the study, which could make the sample non -representative. For example, people with strong opinions or substantial knowledge regarding climate issues on campus may have been more apt to p articipate in the study. The second limitation was response rates that were less than 3 0% for some groups. For groups with response rates less than 3 0%, caution is recommended when generalizing the results to the entire constituent group. Data Analysis. Survey data were analyzed via SPSS to compare the responses (in raw numbers and percentages ) of various groups. Missing data analyses (e.g., missing data patterns, survey fatigue) were conducted and those analyses were provided to UC Hastings Law in a separa te document. Descriptive statistics were calculated by salient group memberships (e.g., gender identity, racial identity, position status) to provide additional information regarding participant responses. Throughout much of this report, including the narr ative and data tables within the narrative, information is presented using valid percentages.21 The data tables in Appendix B provide a ctual percentages22 with missing or \"no response\" information. The purpose for this difference in reporting is to note the missing or \"no response\" data in the appendices for 21 Valid percentages were derived using the total number of respon ses to an item (i.e., missing data were excluded). 22 Actual percentages were derived using the total number of survey respondents. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 27 institutional information while removing such data within the report for subsequent cross tabulation s and significance testing using the chi -square test for independence. Chi-square tests provide only omnibus results; as such, they identify that significant differences exist in the data table but do not specify if differences exist between specific group s. Therefore, these analyses included post hoc investigations of statistically significant findings by conducting z-tests between column proportions for each row in the chi -square contingency table, with a Bonferroni adjustment for larger contingency table s. This approach is useful because it compares individual cells to each other to determine if they are statistically different (Sharpe, 2 015). Thus, the data may be interpreted more precisely by showing the source of the greatest discrepancies. The statistically significant distinctions between groups were noted whenever possible throughout the report. Furthermore, R&A used the guidelines outlined in this paragraph to describe quantitative results . In summarizing the overall distribution of a Likert -scale question in the survey, \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" were combined. For example, \"Sixty percent ( n = 50) of respondents 'strongly agreed ' or 'agreed ' that.... \" If the responses for either \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" resulted in n < 5, then the combination of \"strongly disagree\" and \"disagree\" may have been used instead. When at least one statistically significant result emerged between demogr aphic analysis groups, only one category of the Likert metric w as reported , indicating exactly where the significant difference was located. For example, \"A higher percentage of White/European American respondents (40%, n = 10) than Multiracial respondents (20%, n = 5) 'disagreed ' that.... \" If more than one significant difference exist ed, R&A offered multiple sentences to describe the results for that survey item . Factor Analysis Methodology. The survey contained questions that measured two outcomes related to campus climate: Student respondent s' Perceived Academic Success (Question 7) and Sense of Belonging for students (Question 105) and staff (Question 109). The Perceived Academic Success scale was developed using Pascarella and Terenzini's (1980) Academic and Intellectual Development Scale . This scale has been used in a variety of studies examining student persistence. The Sense of Belonging scales were i nformed by Strayhorn's (2012) qualitative examination of students' sense of belonging . Rankin & Associates has developed Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 28 survey questions to quantitatively measure sense of belonging for students, faculty, and staff. Sense of Belonging questions for Faculty respondents could not be combined into a factor for analysis because of differences in wording between R&A's scale and the questions asked on the survey . The questions on the scale s were answered on a Likert metric from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\" \"strongly agree\" and 5 for \"strongly disagree\"). For the purposes of analysis, only respondents who answer ed all scale sub -questions were included in the analys es. Confirmatory factor analyses using parallel analysis were conducted. The factor loading of each item was examined to test whether the intended questions combined to represent the underlying construct of each scale.23 The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale was calculated to determine if the scale produce d consistent results . Factor Scores . The factor score for each of the scales was created by taking the average of the scores for the sub -questions in each factor. Each response for individuals who answered all the questions included in a given factor was as signed a score on a five -point scale. The factor was then reverse coded so that higher scores on the Perceived Academic Success factor suggest ed a student or constituent group perceived themselves as more academically successful and higher scores on the Sense of Belonging factor s suggest ed an individual or constituent group felt a stronger sense of belonging at UC Hastings Law . Means Testing Methodology. After creating the factor scores for respondents based on the factor analys es and where n's were of suff icient size, the means for respondents were analyzed to determine whether the factor scores differed for categories in the demographic areas determined by the CESWG . When only two categories existed for the specified demographic variable , a t-test for difference of means was used. If the difference in means was significant, effect size was calculated using Cohen's d. Any moderate -to-large effects were noted. When the specific variable of interest had 23 Factor analysis is a particularly useful technique for scale construction. It is used to determine how well a set of survey questions combine to measure a latent construct by measuring how s imilarly respondents answer those questions . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 29 more than two categories, an ANOVA was run to determine whether any differences existed . If the ANOVA was significant, post -hoc tests were run to determine which differences between pairs of means were significant. Additionally, if a difference in means was significant, effect size was calculated u sing partial Eta2 and any moderate -to-large effects were noted. Qualitative Comments Several survey questions provided respondents the opportunity to describe their experiences at UC Hastings Law , elaborate upon their survey responses, and append additiona l thoughts. The survey solicited comments 1) to give \"voice\" to the quantitative findings and 2) to highlight areas of concern that might have been overlooked by the analyses of multiple -choice items because of the small number of survey respondents from h istorically underrepresented populations at UC Hastings Law . For this reason, some qualitative comments may not seem aligned with the quantitative findings; however, they are important data. The R&A team reviewe d24 these comments using standard methods of thematic analysis. R&A reviewers read all comments and generated a list of common themes based on their analysis. This methodology does not reflect a comprehensive qualitative study. Comments were not used to develop grounded hypo theses indepe ndent of the quantitative data. 24 Any comments provided in languages in addition to English were translated and incorporated into the qualitative analysis. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 30 Results This section of the report provides a description of the sample demographics, measures of internal reliability, and a discussion of validity. Several analyses were conducted to determine whether signific ant differences existed in the responses between participants from various demographic categories. Where sample sizes were small, certain responses were combined into categories to make comparisons between groups and to ensure respondents' confidentiality . Where significant differences occurred, endnotes (denoted by lowercase Roman numeral superscripts) at the end of each section of this report provide the results of the significance testing. The narrative also may provide results from descriptive analyses that were not statistically significant yet were determined to be meaningful to the climate at UC Hastings Law . Description of the Sample25 Five-hundred eighty -one (581) surveys were returned for a 42% overall response rate. Response rates by position status were 39% (n = 398) for Students, 42% (n = 85) for Faculty (including 73% ( n = 30) for Ladder Faculty, 75% ( n = 24) for Non -Ladder Full -Time Faculty, and 24% ( n = 31) for Non -Ladder Part-Time Faculty ), and 58% (n = 98) for Staff. The sample and population figures, chi -square analyses,26 and respons e rates are presented in Table 1. All analyzed demographic categories showed statistically signific ant differences between the sample data and the population data as provided by UC H astings Law . Staff respondents were overrepresented in the sample. Student respondents were underrepresented in the sample. Men respondents were underrepresented in the sample. Women respondents were overrepresented in the sample. Trans -spectrum respondents were in the sample but there were no data on this category in the population. Black/African/African American, Middle Easte rn, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, South Asian, and Multiracial individuals were overrepresented in the sample. No data on 25 Frequency tables for each survey item are provided in Ap pendix B. 26 Chi-square tests were conducted only on those categories that were response options in the survey and included in demographics provided by UC Hastings Law . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 31 Jewish individuals in the population were provided .

Validity is the extent to which a measure truly reflects the phenomenon or concept under study. The validation process for the survey instrument included both the development of the survey items and consultation with subject matter experts. The survey items were constructed based on the work of Hurtado et al. (1999) and Smith et al. (1997) and were informed by instruments used in institutional and organizational studies by the consultant over the past 20 years . Several researchers working in the area of camp us climate and diversity, experts in higher education survey research methodology, and members of UC Hastings Law 's CESWG reviewed the bank of items available for the survey. Content validity was ensured , given that the items and response choices arose fr om literature reviews, previous surveys, and input from CESWG members. Construct validity \u2014the extent to which scores on an instrument permit inferences about underlying traits, attitudes, and behaviors \u2014correlated measures being evaluated with variables kno wn to be related to the construct. For this investigation, correlations ideally ought to exist between item responses and known instances of exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct, for example. However, no reliable data to that effec t were available. As such, attention was given to the way questions were asked and response choices given. Items were constructed to be nonbiased, non - leading, and nonjudgmental, and to preclude individuals from providing \"socially acceptable\" responses. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 33 Reliability - Internal Consistency of Responses .27 Correlations between the responses to questions about overall campus climate for various groups (survey Question 104) and to questions that rated overall campus climate on various scales (survey Question 110) were moderate -to-strong and statistically significant, indicating a positive relationship between answers regarding the acceptance of various populations and the c limate for those populations. The consistency of these results suggests that the survey data were internally reliable. Pertinent correlation coefficients28 are provided in Table 2. All correlations in the table were significantly different from zero at the .01 level; that is, there was a relationship between all selected pairs of responses. A strong relationship (between .57 and .65) existed for all four pairs of variables, which included: Positive for People who Identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Queer and Not Homophobic; Positive for Women and Not Sexist; Positive for People of Low Socioeconomic Status and Not Classist (socioeconomic status); and Pos itive for Persons with Disabilities and Not Ableist.

The correlation coefficient indicates the degree of linear relationship between two variables (Bartz, 1988) . 28 Pearson correlation coefficients indicate the degree to which two variables are related.

Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 34 Sample Characteristics29 For the purposes of several analyses, the CESWG decided to collapse certain demographic categories to make comparisons between groups and to ensure respondents' confidentiality. Analyses do not reveal in the narrative, figures, or tables where the number of respondents in a category totaled less than five (n < 5). Respondents' p rimary status data were collapsed into Student respondents, Faculty respondents, and Staff respondents.30 Of respondents, 69% (n = 398) were Students, 15% (n = 85) were Faculty , and 17% (n = 98) were Staff respondents ( Figure 5). Figure 5. Respondents ' Collapsed Position Status (%) Regarding respondents' primary position s, Table 3 indicates that Staff respondents held various position types across campus.

Further, analysis revealed that 19% ( n = 16) of Faculty respondents noted that they typically taught a clinic or field -placement class at least one semester per year. Additionally, 15% ( n = 13) of Faculty respondents taught in the Legal Research and Writing Program. More than half of the sample ( 63%, n = 363) were Women; 34% (n = 198) were Men.31 Two percent each of respondents identified as Genderqueer ( n = 9) or Nonbinary ( n = 13), and less than five respondents identified as Transgender .32 Two percent ( n = 10) respondents did not provide a gender identity. For analysis purpose s, the CESWG elected to collapse the categories Transgender, Genderqueer, Nonbinary , and those respondents who chose more than one gender identity into the \"Trans - spectrum\" category ( 3%, n = 18). The CESWG also decided not to include the Trans -spectrum category in some analyses to maintain the confidentiality of those respondents. 31 Fifty -nine percent (n = 344) of respondents identified their gender expression as feminine, 2% (n = 14) as genderfluid, 34% (n = 195) as masculine, 1% (n = 8) as androgynous, and 1% (n = 5) as \"a gender expression not listed here.\" 32 Self-identification as transgender /trans -spectrum does not preclude identification as man or woman , nor do all those who might fit the definition self -identify as transgender /trans -spectrum . Here, se lf-identify as transgender /trans -spectrum have been reported separately to reveal the presence of an identity that might otherwise have been overlooked. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 37 Figure 6 illustrates that more Women Student respondents ( 66%, n = 261) than Men Student respondents ( 30%, n = 119) completed the survey. In addition, 4% ( n = 15) of Student respondents identified as Trans -spectrum. Seventy -one percent ( n = 67) of Staff respondents were women and 27% (n = 26) were men . Sixty -two percent ( n = 50) of Faculty respondents identified as men and 37% ( n = 30) as women. Note: Responses with n < 5 are not presented in the figure . Figure 6. Respondents by Gender Identity and Position Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 38 Most respondents identified as Heterosexual33 (75%, n = 413), and 25% (n = gay, bisexual, ( Figure 7). Four percent ( n = 23) of respondents did not indicate their sexual identity and were recoded to Missing/Unknown. Figure 7. Respondents by Sexual Identity and Position Status ( n) Of Staff respondents, 31% (n = 24) were 25 to 34 years old, 30% (n = 23) were 35 to 44 years old, 29% (n = 22) were 45 to 54 years old, less than five were 55 to 64 years old , and less than five were 65 to 75 years old (Figure 8). Of Faculty respondents, less than five were 25 to 34 years old, 21% ( n = 11) were 35 to 44 years old, 36% (n = 19) were 45 to 54 years old, and 19% each were 55 to 64 years old (n = 10) and 65 to 74 years old (n = 10). 33 Respondents who answered \"other\" in response to the question about their sexual identity and wrote \" straight\" or \"heterosexual\" in the adjoining text box were recoded as Heterosexual.

Regarding racial identity, 46% ( n = 265) of the respondents identified as White/European American (Figure 9). Fifteen percent ( n = 84) of respondents identified as Asian/Asian American . Respondents were given the opportunity to mark multiple boxes regarding their racial identity,34 allowing them to identify as biracial or multiracial. Thirteen percent ( n = 73) were 10% were Hispanic/ Latinx (n were Black /African /African American ( n = 23) or Middle Eastern ( n = 21), 3% identified as South Asian ( n = 15), 2% were Jewish ( n = 13), and less than five each were Pacific Islander or American Indian/Native American/Indigenous . Zero respondents identified as being Alaska Native. Five percent ( n = 27) of respondents marked the response category \"a racial/ethnic identity not listed here .\" 34 While recognizing the vastly different experiences of people of various racial identities (e.g., Chican x versus African American or Latinx versus Asian American), and those experiences within t hese identity categories (e.g., Hmong versus Chin ese), Rankin & Associates Consulting found it necessary to collapse some of these categories to conduct the analyses as a result of the small numbers of respondents in the individual categories. 0 01119 10 Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 40 Note: Responses with n < 5 are not presented in the figure. Figure 9. Respondents by Racial/Ethnic Identity (%) For analysis purposes, the CESWG created four racial identity categories. Given the opportunity to mark multiple responses, many respondents chose only White35 (50%, n = 278) as their identity ( Figure 10). Additional respondents were Asian/ Pacific Islander36 (18%, n = 102), Black, 35 Per the CESWG, Jewish was listed as a choice under race/ethnicity for anyone who in fact wished to so identify their race or ethnicity. However, given the small number of persons who chose this option, for purposes of analysis it was necessary to merge those individuals with another race/ethnicity category . It was decided to merge the Jewish category with the White/European American category given that a large majority of respondents who identified as Jewish also identified as White. 36 Per the CESWG, this group includes the Asian/Asian American, Pacific Isl , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 41 Indigenous, Latinx, and Middle Eastern37 (18%, n = 101), or Multiracial38 (13%, n = 73) respondents. Figure 10. Respondents by Collapsed Categories of Racial Identity (%) The survey question that queried respondents about their religious or spiritual affiliations offered many response choices . For the purposes of this report, the responses were collapsed into four categories .39 Forty -nine percent ( n = 284) of respondents indicated No Religious Affiliation (Figure 11). Twenty -five percent ( n = 143) of respondents identified as having a Christia n Religious Affiliation. Sixteen percent ( n = 91) of respondents chose an Additional Religious Affiliation and 5% (n = 31) identified with Multiple Affiliations . Six percen t (n = 32) of respondents did not indicate their religious affiliation and were reco ded to Missing/Unknown . 37 Per the CESWG , respondents were combined into larger categories for analysis purposes . The Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Middle Eastern group included respondents who identified as Alaska Native, American Indian/Native American /Indigenous, Black/African/African American , Hispanic/Latinx/Chicanx , Middle Eastern , and Native Hawaiian . This group is used when Asian/Asian American , Pacific Islander , and South Asian are also distinguished. For some analyses , all racial minori ties are grouped together when low numbers of respondents existed (referred to, in this report, as Respondents of Color). Multiracial respondents were included in the Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Middle Eastern category or the Respondents of Color category when low numbers of Multiracial respondents existed . 38 Per the CESWG , \"Multiracial\" was inclusive of anyone who selected more than one of the provided racial identities. 39 With the CESWG 's approval, for some analyses religious/spiritual affiliation was collapsed into two categories: Religious Affiliation and No Religious Affiliation.

Each of these issues was examined in relation to certain demographic characteristics and status of the respondents. Where sample sizes were small, certain responses were combined into categories to make comparisons between groups and to ensure respondents' confidentiality . Comfort With the Climate at UC Hastings Law The survey posed questions regarding respondents' levels of comfort with UC Hastings Law 's campus climate. Table 18 illustrates that 61% (n = 356) of the survey respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the overall climate at UC Hastings Law . Eighty -four percent (n = 82) of Staff respondents were \" very comfortable\" or \"comfortable \" with the c limate in their departments/program or work units , 64% (n = 307) of Student and Faculty respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate in their classes and 57% (n = 48) of Faculty respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate within the faculty.

Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 73 Qualitative comment analyses Fifty -four Respondents with Disabilities shared about experiencing a barrier or difficul ty at UC Hastings Law. Five themes emerged from Respondents with Disabilities regarding facilities and resources, exams, virtual learning, online platforms and services, and mental health. Facilities and Resources. One theme that emerged from Respondents with Disabilities was inaccessible facilities and resources. Respondents noted inaccessibility issu es such as stadium seating inhibiting hearing and ramp in 200 building. A respondent noted, \" ... It would be SO MUCH more welcoming if the entrance was more inviting and accessible for people with disabilities. Not all classroom doors have automatic open but tons... Emergency Preparedness: during the drills individuals who need help exiting the building are told to wait in a specific area on their floors. I have been with other students and staff who have disabilities, and NO ONE came. We eventually just took th e elevator out to exit. Parking: would be nice to have discounted parking for those who are handicapped and must drive... Restrooms: Put the towel dispenser near the sink! Anyone using a mobility device must then use wet hands to navigate to the towel dispen ser.\" Other concerns noted included having to have people wait because of the need to use separate entrances; crosswalk asphalt being bumpy, potholed and cracked thus requiring the need to constantly look down ; and the timing of the green lights being incredibly short which leaves one person to NEVER being able to completely cross the street before the light changes . One respondent discussed the process of getting physical and online resources stating , \"The process of going through HR was cumbersome and tim e-consuming. Eventually, my disability was accommodated. \" Exams. Respondents with Disabilities indicated another challenge was receiving appropriate accommodations for class exams and the California bar exam. Respondents explained that the online exams wer e not conducive to their needs because they were not able to , \"Not being able to print my first set of exams for Fall '20 was frustrating. The two exams I had to take during that period had several pages and with my disability it was not conducive to scro ll through that many pages and then have to go back and type my answer. What was worse was then when it changed to being able to print I could see how much of a difference that made. I had a poor experience with Examplify [sic] and the lack of the Hastings administration understanding that printing exams would be important. We were penalized for being online - if we were in person I would Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 74 have had a hard copy\" and \"I had to take my first exam without a printed version of the LONG FACT PATTERN with PICTURES and had to keep scrolling up. it was awful and a huge time waster and I feel like my performance suffered.\" Another respondent described changes to exam schedules and use of artificial intelligence during exams, \"I know records is understaffed and it most likely is not the faculty's fault , but making last minute changes regarding online exams days or sometimes even right in the thick of finals caused high levels of anxiety for myself and many of my peers. I also would like to note here that the use of AI fo r the [redacted] exams is so terrible and adds unnecessary stress to these already stressful times.\" Respondents shared challenges with getting accommodations for the California bar exam, \"It should not cost so much money to get accommodations on the bar . I know that's not a Hastings issue, but I don't feel like Hastings cares or recognizes how restrictive the process is or wants to change it to support students,\" and \"I tried to reach out to DRP in order to facilitate my accommodations for the MPRE. DRP failed to follow -up after being contacted multiple times over a month and a half span and due to this, I was unable to register with accommodations for the MPRE. I reached out for a meeting well before DRP requested it, I followed up to see when I could ge t a meeting, and time and time again I was told to reach out again if nothing was scheduled. ... I shouldn't have to beg for an appointment in order to receive a piece of paper that says what accommodations I have at Hastings. There is too much red tape arou nd a simple paper that records could provide or someone within DRP (or through an online request) without the need for a meeting or otherwise that was the only reason I couldn't register for the MPRE.\" Virtual Learning. Respondents with Disabilities indica ted that the transition to virtual learning changed their learning experience. Respondents noted, \"Remote/zoom classes has been very difficult because of the lack of an academic environment to get students in the learning zone, and the isolation and lack o f classroom discussion,\" and \"Remote instruction, which is obviously necessary and certainly has some benefits, has occasionally been anxiety provoking for me... .\" Respondents added that the online format had made it more difficult for them to learn, \"My condition makes it difficult to read things on computer screens so moving to completely online format has been challenging,\" \"It's not easy to focus when on zoom. It's not easy to use exam soft when my brain jumps around, and I can't have everything up at readable size all at the same time,\" and \"LRW in my experience didn't transition well to the online environment and was Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 75 especially challenging (I think the obstacles it presents because of my impairment would have made it more challenging than the doctrinal courses to begin with, even if classes were in person).\" Online Platforms and Services. Respondents with Disabilities indicated challenges with accessibility of online platforms. Respondents stated, \"Most issues I face a rise with the difficulty navigating MyHastings, Canvas, WebAdvisor etc. There are so many different programs and none of them are very clear. I often miss specific dates/deadlines because I miss a small link at the end of a random webpage,\" and \"My Hasting s is really not intuitive, and I find it incredibly inaccessible and overwhelming for ADHD; it makes it hard to stay informed on most campus related things, and I rely on friends to tell me about important information sessions and deadlines. A normal, stra ightforward website would have been infinitely more helpful.\" Respondents identified specific user issues within these platforms and services, \"With IT, WebAdvisor needs a major update as the user interface is a bit outdated and at times difficult to use. MyHastings, while a better interface, can be overwhelming with so much information on the page making it difficult to separate what's important from what is less critical... Canvas also has some challenges as well, with too many menu options and different pl aces for communication. For example, the Inbox and Announcements need to be combined. Printing on Canvas needs to be easier as well,\" and \"Westlaw and Lexis are bad at accommodating my impairment. Not the worst I've encountered, but for a for -profit compan y providing a service through their website they are poor at directly providing meaningful functionality in a format that is accessible. They have both even made printing PDFs less accessible, Lexis, for example, only prints an image. If you try to copy an d paste from a PDF from Lexis, it corrupts the characters sent to the clipboard (i.e. it's not possible to natively paste text from a Lexis generated PDF of a case). Westlaw does this somewhat better by allowing the user to add extra steps on her end. The Bluebook online is terrible regarding the level it accommodates my visual impairment. From implementation of the site's functions to execution of the display, and incorporation of features to accommodate impairments, it's pretty frustrating and a generally unhelpful resource. Please let them know they need to do better. The LRW legal grammar online website (I can't recall the 3rd party website's name) was passable but has a lot of room for improvement.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 76 Mental Health. Respondents with Disabilities who share d that their disability was a mental health condition indicated that UC Hastings Law needed to provide more resources to support mental health conditions. A Respondent explained, \"When thinking about the disability affecting my learning and living conditio ns I was thinking more along the lines of a mental condition versus physical. Hence, why the biggest issue would not really be facilities, but more of support services...\" Respondents also indicated that their mental health conditions were exacerbated during this past year through comments such as , \"I think this is a general experience for a lot of people with mental health issues around the world right now but zoom school has not been the best decision for my mental health. In fact, it has exasperated many o f my issues. Further, it is unclear how to get my insurance to cover my therapy appointments. I tried for weeks and finally gave up because I could not figure it out,\" \"having to take time off for my mental health, anxiety, and medication and was accommoda ted in that way ,\" and wanting to \" request a modified schedule given my increased ... symptoms this year but am afraid that it will be viewed poorly or used as a reason to demote me or fire me.\" Respondents also noted challenges getting mental health support such as , \"Give better, more varied, more opportunities for mental healthcare. Law school is a serious threat to mental health and calling it out, telling folks that it exists is far from enough... ,\" and being given list of therapist that did not meet parame ters. One participant expounded, \"I think more therapy sessions should be allowed per year. I am fortunate enough to have very high quality non - UCSHIP insurance that covers therapy, however finding a therapist that accepts insurance is nearly impossible i n the city. I've spent weeks trying to get an introductory appointment without success... The mental health struggles of law school are well documented, and the school has been very open about trying to create resources to help. However, under their current model, you can only receive help, on average, once a month. For someone going through a crisis, that is simply not enough. If Hastings wanted to truly support mental health struggles, they would make therapy more accessible and not place arbitrary limits o n how much mental health support an individual can receive. There is no such arbitrary limit on student services, the CARES office, or any other Hastings support service. It defies logic to put up acknowledge a crisis of mental health but then limit the am ount of support a student can receive.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 77 Barriers for Transgender /Genderqueer /Nonbinary Respondents One survey item asked Transgender /Genderqueer /Nonbinary respondents if they had experienced barriers in facilities or identity accuracy at UC Hastings Law within the past year.

CAR E advocate went to [redacted] who said [that it] did not rise to a level that warranted punishment so reporting would be futile,\" and \"I was afraid my issue was minor. I was afraid that I would further complicate an already tense situation. I was afraid of rocking the boat.\" Nothing Would Change. Student respondents also indicated that they believed nothing would change after reporting the incident. Respondents stated, \"Because I knew that it wouldn't change anything. These were not one -off experiences, it has been a consistent experience throughout my law school career,\" and \"Campus officials appear unwilling to deal with issues of bullying. I felt that if I reported this person's conduct, administrators would sweep the issue under the rug and not even atte mpt any sort of an investigation.\" Other Student respondents shared similar sentiments such as , \"Hastings is a business at the end of the day, and the administration does not prioritize the feelings of a student, especially a [minority identity redacted] student. Students are at Hastings for 3 years (although they could give money back in the future). The Board of Directors has to improve Hastings's rankings and increase profits in the short term. If I voiced my experience about a professor, there is nothi ng the administration is willing to do. My first year, a classmate was sexually harassed by another classmate, and the administration told her she could change classes or try distancing herself from the male perpetrator. What a lack of action to a serious issue,\" and \"I do not trust members of the staff. I have heard about instances where deans [redacted] [were] [ sic] dismissing or minimizing the complaints of students. . . . I've honestly experienced so much abuse at the hands of colleagues related to my d isability. The staff seems so concerned with racial equity, it completely forgets disability.\" One respondent stated that they believed complainants were left worst off if they reported the conduct, \"I've never found reporting upsetting/discriminatory comm ents to be helpful. Typically, it just notifies the perpetrator that you reported them, and there's no actual support or protection offered to you afterwards. So then instead of one person saying something harmful, it feels like the administration condones it and makes me feel powerless and like I've wasted my time and energy asking for help from someone disingenuous.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 94 Power Dynamics. Student respondents also indicated they chose not to report the exclusionary conduct because the culture of the College and unequal power dynamics made it difficult to report. Student respondents stated, \"The conduct is representative of the institution, faculty, and students as a whole. I don't think Hastings will hear my voice or find my views valid because the institution it self is overtly one -sided,\" \"I felt and was told that the conduct that was directed at me was a part of the culture of law school and the group that I was in,\" and \"...It has happened to me several times, and I think it may [be] because of my gender identity , but I also feel like law school promotes the idea that some people and their ideas are more valuable to the discussion than others.\" Student respondents also shared specific challenges with reporting related to power dynamics such as, \"The other experien ce was a disturbing comment in [redacted] by a (male) adjunct professor regarding an opposing counsel looking like a 'day time stripper',\" and \"Since I was [redacted], I did not have the energy to fight it.\" Respondents also added, \"The person was a campus official and staff member. This conduct isn't done in private but often in rooms filled with people who just watch,\" and \"It was a professor and dean, and I'm a student. You wouldn't have done anything.\" Staff respondents Retaliation and Power Dynamics . Staff respondents shared that they chose not to report the incident because of fear of retaliation and organizational power dynamics within UC Hastings Law. Staff respondents stated, \"After speaking with my supervisor I decided against making an official re port as it was suggested to me that it might incur retribution that wouldn't be official or provable but would further degrade my day -to-day work experience,\" \"Because past reports have resulted in negative outcomes for the person who reported...,\" and \"Th e individuals are the high - ranking department heads. When directing them to follow the rules according to the [redacted] they ignore or bypass the authority of my department and go directly to the head managers or board for approvals.\" Two Staff respondent s particularly mentioned challenging power dynamics with faculty members and the administration, \"Faculty are usually smart enough not to commit one big offending act. It's more of a pattern of a thousand little cuts that are difficult to report one at a t ime,\" and \"I just didn't trust anyone in administration. They always take the side of the Manager or Faculty. I also do not want to be retaliated upon....\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 95 Faculty respondents Nothing Would Change . Faculty respondents indicated that they believed that nothin g would be done if they reported the incident. Respondents stated, \" Such actions are not subject to any type of sanction. I did not report for it would be pointless ,\" \"Reporting would have served no purpose ,\" and \" Did not think that anything would come of me reporting it. \" One respondent elaborated further about why they believed nothing would change after reporting exclusionary conduct, \" Addressing my concerns would require changing the way legal academia works and those who run Hastings are invested in that system. It has worked for them. So , I thought there was no point to making a complaint .\" Qualitative comment analyses One hundred eight Student, Staff, and Faculty respondents further elaborated on their experiences with exclusionary, i ntimidating, and/or hostile conduct. For Student respondents, four themes emerged: bias related to racism, sexism, and ableism ; interactions with professors ; bias related to gender identity ; and conservative viewpoints. For Staff and Faculty respondents , one theme emerged around identity related bias. Student respondents Bias Related to Racism, Sexism, and Ableism. Student respondents further elaborated on their experiences of bias related to racism, sexism, and ableism. Respondents shared their experience s of bias related to racism such as a \"Person in class made racial comments during orientation [regarding Mexicans] and also through a group chat stating that if we wanted to work this summer, we could always find jobs [on farms] ,\" and \"Comments that are racially insensitive, make assumptions about my academic potential, and seem to imply that I slow down an efficient law school process by simply being in the room.\" Other respondents shared similar experiences such as being asked if they were graded well because \"the professor was just confused with [their] work and/or an incompetent professor ,\" \"being physically harassed by security guards based on . . . racial identity, verbally harassed by a professor based on unwarranted claims, and discriminated [against] by fellow students\" and being subjected to anti-Asian hate in which a Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 96 \"few students were supportive, while another student [said] that what had happened , and was witnessed by other people a s well , did not actually happen, even though that student was not even present in the location.\" Respondents also noted instances of sexism that occurred during class, for example, \"I often feel that the men (not all of them, of course) in my inn speak over the women in break out rooms or will disregard their ideas. Also, they often will support another man's ideas but not a woman's,\" and \"Me and another female -identifying student were basically silenced and interrupted during a breakout room due to our fel low male students within the group. We were not encouraged to speak up about our opinions on the practice problem .\" They also noted remarks such as telling women that they needed to smile more. Student Respondents with a Disability described their interac tions with other students stating , \"Students said I faked my disability. Student gave a speech on how the majority of students getting accommodations are faking it for a GPA boost,\" and \"He began interrogating me about my accommodations and what disabiliti es I had that warranted accommodations. In that moment I felt so powerless and stupid. I felt as though I had to defend my disability....\" One respondent mentioned challenges students have faced by being outed as a student with a disability, \"In a highly com petitive environment students feel threatened by testing accommodations, so they resent those who receive them. The DRP essentially outed a whole class of DRP students last year when they totally messed up the preferred seating, and their solution made it clear to everyone in class who the DRP students were. All of the microaggressions and harassment stemmed from that one serious mistake.\" A respondent cited earlier also noted an interaction with a professor in which the professor used the word \"retarded \" for an entire class to describe people with mentally disabilities. Interactions with Professors. Student respondents indicated that they experienced exclusionary and hostile conduct from professors. Examples provided by respondents include a Student of Color challenging a professor's interpretation of a policy related to racial segregation with the professor pushing back harder than before, and a Black student being told that they were not acting like a lawyer because police officers involved in the killing of a Black person hadn't yet been fully prosecuted. Respondents also mentioned , \"I had a profess or who confused the names Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 97 and identities of the Asian American students in his class --I never witnessed [redacted ] confuse anyone else's names,\" \"My negative experiences [with in a specific course ] were not directed at me specifically, but he repeatedly said racist things about Black people (I'm not Black), ableist things, sexist things, classist things,\" and \"2 of my male professors repeatedly throughout the semesters I had them, made racially and gendered derogatory remarks couched as 'jokes' or 'pedagogy' .\" Bias Related to Gender. Student respondents elaborated on their experiences of bias related to gender. Respondents described conduct that perpetuated acceptance of gender -based bias such as, \"The climate in our classrooms can be quite hostile at times, especially when we talk about police brutality, rape, murder, racism, etc., it's often male students who make insensitive or hurtful comments about why certain people deserved the negative experiences that happened to them. As someone who has survived rap e learning about it in criminal law was deeply triggering because my professor failed to create a safe space and allowed students to shame victims in the hypotheticals and place blame on them...\" and \"Same person also made a remark in class stating how the y did not understand why having sex with a minor should be criminalized and that it should be a civil suit instead. This was right after a case about a 15 yr old girl who was raped... .\" Respondents also stated that inappropriate behavior occurred at the College such as , \"This is not the first professor I have heard who has indiscretions. There are many rumors about male faculty having student relationships which is a sad reputation for our school to have,\" and \" I've been misgendered countless times at UC Ha stings and forced to work with faculty members who are known for being predatory yet continue to work at UC Hastings.\" Respondents also described acts of sexual violence such as , \"3 different students tried to force themselves on me sexually .... I was told these incidents of sexual assault were one time things and to not report by title XI,\" and \"Repeatedly said no to another student who I thought was my friend. Trusted him to get me home, but he made advances at me instead after I said no many times and he eventually stopped and left.\" Conservative Viewpoints. Student respondents also stated that their conservative viewpoints were not welcomed on campus. Respondents echoed statements such as , \"I understand we are in San Francisco but if your political opinion on something is not left or extremely liberal you are automatically deemed an outsider and made to feel not wanted.\" Respondents also added, \"I Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 98 consider myself somewhat conservative. I a m also a religious person. I am not hard -right. I wasn't a Trump supporter...I have found people who are more in line with my perspectives, but we have to talk in secret for fear of career suicide. I am afraid to express who I am on campus. I understand my v iews are mainstream or at least acceptable in 95% of the country, but Hastings is my academic community,\" and \"The classroom setting is where I felt the most uncomfortable at Hastings. I am a very outgoing individual, however, I only spoke in class when as ked a question. I felt the treatment of students views different from the majority was incredibly unfair and disheartening. Every time a student would bring up their opinion that was even remotely 'conservative ' in class, that student would be attacked and shunned from the class. This experience happened in classes that I took all three years at Hastings.\" Staff and Faculty respondents Identity Related Bias. Staff and Faculty respondents elaborated on instances of identity related bias. Staff and faculty r espondents stated, \"I have felt on more than one occasion that the male - dominated leadership of the school has been dismissive of the perspective, expertise, and leadership of women faculty and staff members,\" \"Female faculty in this institution do not receive the respect they merit from their accomplishments. I am also shocked at the shift in the makeup in the top administration at the school from one of the most diverse groups to one of the most homogenous,\" and \"Faculty members have been dismissive becau se of my age and gender. This is a constant theme with some male faculty members.\" Furthermore, respondents shared how their intersecting identities related to their experiences of identity related bias, \"Hastings, like other law schools, values and priori tizes research scholarship and is led by faculty who produce scholarship. Because of the way structural racism, misogyny, and class work in the US, the people who produce that scholarship tend to be white, male, from one of seven elite law schools, and fro m generally privileged backgrounds. Individuals who contribute in other ways on campus via teaching, practice/advocacy, administration, etc are more diverse but, structurally, do not have a vote in College governance because they are not tenured faculty... . The deep root of how power and value works at Hastings needs to be addressed. If faculty who produce research scholarship (and a fairly narrow kind of scholarship) continue to be the primary source of power and priority, we will never change the climate at Hastings. As an example, we have an opportunity to hire new faculty soon. ...While most colleagues I've talked to agree with ['hire Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 99 more diverse faculty '] in principle, some with more enthusiasm than others, when you drill down to what they value and will l ook for in new faculty, it is such a narrow range of qualifications that the practical effect will be to exclude candidates of color, women, and people of lower socioeconomic status (people who don't as frequently come from top -tier law schools)... ,\" \"I am misgendered on a daily basis by students, staff, and faculty. There has been no training in more than a year to improve these experiences... ,\" and \" ...raising concerns about how the past year has specifically impacted Black [redacted] has resulted in negative responses and a negative review not for the content but for how it was communicated (tone -policing). It was also noted that, \"There is no reciprocal feedback model where staff get to share with supervisors what it is like to be supervised by our leaders. We are expected to improve without regard for whether the standards should be at all shifted/ changed or are not responsive to the current pandemic and civil rights movement... .\" Qualitative comment analyses One hundred eight y-three Student, Staff, and Fac ulty respondents elaborated further on their personal experiences in the community surrounding the campus. Among Student respondents, three themes emerged about the unsafe and dangerous area surrounding campus, divide between the college and surrounding ar ea, and students who had never visited campus. Two themes emerged from Staff respondents about the unsafe and dangerous area surrounding campus and the humanitarian crisis. Among Faculty respondents, only one theme about the area being unsafe and dangerous emerged. Student respondents Unsafe and Dangerous Area. Student respondents described the area surrounding the campus as \"unsafe \" and \"dangerous. \" Respondents elaborated on experiences of witnessing deaths and drug use, having property stolen and damaged, and being followed. Respondents shared concerns and feelings such as, \"The tenderloin neighborhood which surrounds our school campus is scary \" and \"It doesn' t feel safe -- there is a heightened anxiety... .\" Other respondents shared how the community area had shaped their educational choices, such as avoiding night classes ; not staying late on campus to study in the library, meet with peers, or attend events ; and not feeling safe going to local shops/cafes or the College parking lot . Two Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 100 respondents stated that they were grateful for the remote learning that did not require them to commute to campus . For example one explained, \"We have been remote for quite a bi t. I love being in person, but I appreciate not having to go to the tenderloin every day. I'm a [tall] male and felt very unsafe at times. I cannot imagine how my colleagues feel.\" Divide Between the College and the Surrounding Area. Student respondents n oted that there appeared to be a division between the College and the surrounding area: \"I have never truly felt as if I was a part of the community surrounding our campus. If anything, it seems like Hastings actively tries to create a separation between campus and the Tenderloin/the Civic Center. They do this by con stantly reminding students of the apparent dangers of the community (crime alerts, safety protocols, etc.). Though I understand the utility of these programs, it definitely does not encourage students to actively be part of the surrounding community,\" and \"I feel deeply uncomfortable by the way other students talk about the community surrounding campus. In my experience, there is a sharp divide between students and other community members, and students are condescending to the people who live nearby.\" Sever al respondents also mentioned the difficult relationship between the College and the local community, \"I knew what to expect from the Tenderloin when I enrolled. It seems that there are many other students, however, who are very uncomfortable with the home less population and voice that discomfort rather negatively through stereotyping and comments about 'smell '. I think Hastings would benefit from sensitivity training in this area. After all, students are entering a pre -existing community that has existed b efore their presence and will exist long after,\" and \" ...I loved getting to know the community surrounding campus. However, I was deeply disappointed with how my classmates and how the school generally discusses our neighbors in the Tenderloin. Unfortunately , the people I've met at Hastings seem to have derogatory, or at best, ambivalent, attitudes towards the unhoused people in the area. I expected better from a great SF university, and the 'solutions ' enacted so far aren't good enough. I don't think we can continue to police the unhoused in the Tenderloin under the guise of student safety, and I think that also requires diversity training for all students to better understand the issue of homelessness and its intersections with race and poverty. It's the mai n disappointment in my experience with the Hastings climate thus far - the way people talk about unhoused folks in the Tenderloin is dehumanizing, racist, and ignorant.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 101 Never Visited Campus. Student respondents shared that they were unable to answer the question because of never visiting campus. Respondents stated, \"I'm a 1L and have so far only had virtual classes. I do not live near campus. I don't have an informed, up -to-date perspective o n UCH's surroundings,\" \"I am a 1L who has only experienced Hastings online so I believe my experience has been very different from 2L and 3L Hastings students,\" and \"I have never visited the area surrounding UC Hastings and cannot attest to the community s urrounding it.\" Staff respondents Unsafe and Dangerous Area . Staff respondents stated that the area surrounding UC Hastings Law was \"unsafe \" and \"dangerous. \" Respondents recounted experiences dealing with defection near their property, witnessing drug d eals, being offered drugs, and being harassed by people who seemed to have a mental ill ness. Respondent s explained, \" ...I have always felt safe in the buildings themselves, but the outside environment is horrendous ...,\" \"The community affects my working habit s as well. I would love to be able to sometimes stay a bit late to finish work up or chat with students, but I need to leave before nightfall because it is unsafe \" and \"I appreciate that they are trying to help by hiring Urban Alchemy etc., but it is becom ing a bit unbearable.\" At the same time, respondents also commented on the relationship between the College and the community, \" As a white [person], I can see that there are systems of systemic racism that are part of our society that must be addressed. Lots of people benefit from privilege at Hastings, also many do not. The school as a beacon of San Francisco as one of the sole public law schools in the country, we got to continue to evolve and change, from staff, faculty, systems, alumni, everyone... . We should be having more conversations as a community surrounding race, privilege, white supremacy and include the community that we sit in in the Tenderloin. It's time we really checked the heck outta our privilege (there's many that should do this) and really see if we can walk our walk and walk our talk,\" and \"While I was stunned when I first encountered drug users and unhoused people in the tenderloin/civic center area, I was very surprised how quickly I adapted. There is one mentally unstab le person who lives in the area who unnerves me when I see him on the BART platform, but on the whole I feel comfortable here. I get nervous about so many outsiders being brought to the area by Hastings and imposing our values on others who will be here lo ng after we leave.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 102 Humanitarian Crisis. Staff respondents indicated that the area surrounding campus was a humanitarian crisis. A respondent stated, \"The community surrounding campus is a daily source of sadness and dismay. \" Respondents described seeing people in mental distress, drug use, violent arguments, injuries, and lack of basic needs. Respondent s noted, \" Seeing that kind of desperation and human beings without dignity becomes somewhat traumatizing over time. Some days it is difficult to come to wo rk because I know I'll have to see all of that,\" and \"There are so many community members in a high -level of distress around the community and the College 24/7. There is a huge difficulty for the College to not criminalize our community members, provide ac cess to resources, and help the students, staff, and faculty feel safe. I do not envy the higher -ups having to navigate this complexity at all ... The community also has a beautiful community garden, outreach teams offering support, local museums and restaura nts creating community spaces, and has great access to multiple public transportation options and bicycle lanes.\" Faculty respondents Unsafe and Dangerous Area. Faculty respondents shared their overall thoughts about the surrounding community: \"...Going t o UC Hastings every day is a traumatic, unsafe experience to which the college has not paid sufficient attention,\" and \"Our neighborhood is incredibly depressing. I dread coming into school every day.\" One respondent elaborated on their interactions within the community, \"I have had a number of jarring experiences in and around the Tenderloin. These include being spit on, being called the N -word, and seeing numerous physical altercations. None of these experiences included members of the Hastings community. \" Respondents also debated on what College's role should be to make the community less dangerous, \"It's difficult to witness so much suffering around campus, and it's very frustrating to feel like the city isn't working towards long -term solutions. I would like the whole neighborhood to feel safer --for us and those who live there (housed and unhoused). I feel very ambivalent about Hastings ' role--some of our involvement in the community seems helpful, but I always think we and our students have the potentia l to do more,\" and \"While I appreciate Urban Alchemy cleaning up the one block in each direction, we need a lot more than that. Another lawsuit may be needed to get the police to disperse the drug dealing crowds along Hyde Street a block to a few blocks no rth of campus.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 103 Observations of Exclusionary, Intimidating, Offensive, and/or Hostile Conduct Respondents' observations of others experiencing exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct also may contribute to their perceptions of campus climate. Forty -three percent (n = 248) of survey respondents observed conduct directed toward a person or group of people in person or online that they believe created an exclusionary (e.g., shunn ing, ignoring ), intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile (bullying, harassing) learning , living, or working environment at UC Hasting Law53 within the past two years.

Qualitative Comment Analyses Eighty -seven Student, Staff, and Faculty respondents elaborated on their observations of conduct that created an exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile learning , living, or working environment. Three themes emerged around hostile learning and working environment for underserved identities ; conduct related to racism ; conduct related to sexism, genderism, and ableism ; and opposing perspectives. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 112 Hostile Learning and Working Environment for Underserved Identities . Respondents further elaborated on their observations of a hostile learning, living, or working environment for underserved identities at UC Hastings Law. A respondent provided several exa mples , \"...I have witnessed, and personally experienced white male professors brush off and silence woman students who challenge them. I have witnessed professors misgender a student right while introducing them [redacted]. Professors and students stare at a nd sometimes directly ask BIPOC students to speak up regarding issues of their race. I have witnessed, on multiple occasions, a male student (who is publicly known to make women feel uncomfortable . . .) target and intimidate women. His behaviors of harass ment are categorized in 'boy 's club' mentality, he uses his power to embarrass and put down women in whatever capacity he can, if he is not actively making sexual advances on them. A white male classmate has thrown food at a group of BIWOC (off campus) whi le other classmates and friends of his just watched. Two white males questioned a Black woman student's ability in a professional competition, saying to her white woman team partner that they feel sorry for her for being paired with her because she is clea rly only accepted into the team because she's Black. I've witnessed a white student challenge a Black student's high grade, asking her if she really thinks she deserved the grade she got . A . . . member from the CDO told a first semester Latino student who is pursuing corporate law, to perhaps wait until his grades come in before going for big law, a comment that is most likely not asked of white men. I was publicly yelled at my first few weeks of school by someone who sa id that I did not deserve [redacted] . Respondents also shared how a hostile working environment impacted relationships, \"There are certain tenured faculty who feel they can treat staff dismissively and rudely. I've seen faculty make comments indicating tha t they feel their work is important but 'administrative stuff' is beneath them or not worth their time. This has usually been in the context of those staff trying to help tenured faculty with something they need. It's really toxic. While not overtly about race, gender, class and privilege, it is implicitly about all of those things,\" and \"There are faculty members who are non -collegial and cliquish [ sic] in the extreme. Often their exclusions are along race, gender and perceived class lines.\" Another respon dent emphasized the need for the administration to change the hostile working and learning environment stating , \"Hastings needs to work on providing further diversity training to its faculty and improving its response to reported incidents of bias and disc rimination. Several Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 113 classmates of mine have experienced demeaning comments based on their race and/or sex. When these individuals and others witnessing the incidents expressed their concerns to the administration, they consistently felt like they were bein g brushed off. In one particularly egregious incident, where a...black student was marginalized and excluded in class, the administration's response was wholly inadequate. [It] did not involve the professor who committed the offense. ...The students who compla ined are not the ones creating the problem. Rather, professors and other students [in my classes] consistently create a hostile academic environment through racist, sexist, and otherwise exclusionary behavior. They are the ones the university needs to talk to....\" Conduct Related to Racism. Respondents elaborated on specific observations of conduct related to racism. One respondent shared examples of witnessed microaggressions such as African American student s being asked if a grade was based on merit, or if the professor just gave that grade, insinuating that it was a \"hand down ,\" told to bring \"black girl magic, \" and told that they were intimidating. Another stated \"At school events, students have gotten drunk and been openly racist to me and some of my friends. In class, particularly in classes that touch criminal issues, we are so insensitive to the way that Black and brown bodies have been criminalized. Professors do a poor job of highlighting these issues and provide too much space for 'devil's advoca te' arguments that are completely racist, disregarding the experiences of Black and brown people. Worse still, our classes are made up of mostly white people which leaves POC students, particularly Black students, alone in dealing with these issues. \" One r espondent also described the impact of this conduct on students' future sense of connection to UC Hastings Law, \"W e just got to be more inclusive of alumni events of all races, religions and ethnicities. When I started at Hastings, I was shocked and not sh ocked to learn that the school did not have a good relationship with alumni of color and/or didn't have too many alumni affinity groups set up to provide spaces for alumni of color ... I've heard from many alumni in the past they did not feel included at Hastings. This was mainly exclusionary and shunning actions that I have heard about ....\" Opposing Perspectives . Respondents elaborated on exclusionary conduct related to opposing perspectives. Respondents shared politically charged experiences such as , \"Differing political views are not tolerated here and you are automatically assumed to be something you are not if you don't fully agree with the prevailing left/extreme liberal ideology here ,\" and \" Students with a Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 114 'liberal ' or one -issue 'progressive ' view, get far more attention and 'silence ' a Professor or Professors who dare to question their views. And they refuse to identify themselves, so it can be discussed or confronted. \" Other respondents echoed these sentiments, \" Just overall extreme sensitivity an d intolerance to opposing views. Disrespectful behavior towards our professors without a modicum of grace or understanding that we are all learning and that mistakes are OK, people ar en't perfect, and the online platform obviously has the power to magnify even the slightest misstep into a large issue ,\" and \" Hastings, as a whole, is welcoming. It is not, however, welcoming as a whole toward legal or political positions that are labeled 'conservative. ' I have seen multiple instances in which a student or facu lty member expressing an objective observation, not a personal opinion, which aligns with those positions labeled 'conservative ' either shunned, looked down upon, referred to as racist, or had the merits of their position completely disregarded. This has b een particularly true when the discussion occurs in areas of criminal law and procedure, constitutional structure, the role of government, and other areas which are critical to fostering a well -rounded legal education. \" One respondent also elaborated on an example of an in-classroom discussions about police in which they felt that the general response to others was \"mean -spirited, not in good faith, and undercut their lived experience. \" Perceptions of Diversity at UC Hastings Law A set of questions asked St udent, Faculty, and Staff r espondents about their perceptions of the diversity of the UC Hastings Law students and employees, the extent to which classes attend to matters related to race, class, and gender, and students' and faculty members' training and ability.

Three questions were n ot asked of Staff respondents. Chi- square analyses of differences are noted in tables above. Figure 38 through Figure 46 illustrate the responses based on position status.

Figure 46. Faculty Interact Effectively Cross -Culturally by Respondents' Position Status (%) Summary Sixty -one percent ( n = 356) of respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate at UC Hastings Law , 84% (n = 82) of Staff respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate in their departments or work units , 57% (n = 48) of Faculty respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate within the faculty , and 64% (n = 307) of Student and Faculty respondents were \"very comfortable\" or \"comfortable\" with the climate in their classes . The findings from i nvestigations at higher education institutions across the country (Rankin & Associates Consulting, 2 020) suggest that 7 0% to 8 0% of respondents felt positively toward their campus climate. Staff respondents at UC H astings Law rated their department or work unit climates slightly higher than that , while respondents had less positive views about the overall climate , the climate within the faculty , and the climate in their classes at UC Hastings Law . Twenty percent to 25% of individuals in similar investigations indicated that they personally had experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct within the past year (Rankin & Associates, 2020) . At UC Hastings Law , 33% (n = 189) of respondents noted that they personally had experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct within the last two years . Most of the exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct was based on gender/gender identi ty, political views , and ethnicity . Quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that such conduct reflects bias related to social identity. These results parallel the findings of other climate studies of specific constituent groups offered in Neither Agree nor Disagree Disagree Strongly DisagreeRankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 135 litera ture, where higher percentages of members of historically underrepresented and underserved groups had experienced various forms of exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct and discrimination than did percentages of those in the majorit y (Ellis et al., 2018; Harper, 2015; Harper & Hurtado, 2007; Kim & Forty -three percent ( n = 248) of UC Hastings Law survey respondent s indicated that they had observed conduct directed toward a person or group of people in person or online at UC Hastings Law that they believed created an exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile learning, living, or working environment withi n the past two years . Most of the observed exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct was based on racial identity, political views , and gender/gender identity. Similar to personal experiences with such conduct, members of minority identities more often witnessed exclusionary contact than did their majority counterparts. i A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents by degree of comfort with the overall climate by position status : 2 (8, N = 581) = 21.2, p < .01. ii A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Student respondents by degree of comfort with climate in their classes by position status : 2 (4, N = 479) = 35.5 , p < .01. iii A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents by degree of comfort with the overall climate by gender identity : 2 (4, N = 553 ) = 39.0 , p < .001. iv A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Student respondents by degree of comfort with climate in their classes by gender identity : 2 (4, N = 456) = 16.6 , p < .01. v A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents by degree of comfort with the overall climate by racial identity : 2 (12, N = 554 ) = 35.6 , p < .001. vi A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Student respondents by degree of comfort with the climate in their classes by racial identity : 2 (4, N = 461 ) = 10.1 , p < .05. vii A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents by degree of comfort with the overall climate by disability status : 2 (4, N = 547) = 19.2, p < .001. viii A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Student respondents by degree of comfort with the climate in classes by disability status : 2 (4, N = 455) = 16.5, p < .01 . ix A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of Student respondents by degree of comfort with the climate in classes by disability status : 2 (4, N = 380) = 12.5, p < .05. x A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents who indicated that they experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct based on gender identity by gender identity : 2 (2, N = 181) = 18.9, p <.001 . xi A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents who indicated that they experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct based on political views by political views : 2 (3, N = 175) = 27.4, p <.001 . xii A chi -square test was conducted to compare percentages of respondents who indicated that they experienced exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct on the basis of ethnicity by racial identity : 2 (2, N = 171) = 21.7 , p < .001.

Less than five respondents officially reported the incident(s). Qualitative Comment Analyses Forty -two Student, Staff, and Faculty respondents explained why they chose not to report the unwanted sexual interaction. Two themes emerged from responses including catcalling is common and nothing would be done. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 147 Catcalling is Common . Respondents shared that they chose not to report the catcalling because of the frequency of catcalling. Respondents stated, \"I get cat-called on the street ALL THE TIME, so reporting feel pointless especially when the state of CA doesn't have decent laws making it illegal like other countries,\" \"Cat -calling and harassment on the street happens all the time,\" and \"Cat -calling or other offensive sexual comments are so common I would have to report something every week. I didn't see the point when there isn't any solution.\" Respondents shared similar reasons for not reporting catcalling such as , \"I am honestly not sure why I did not repor t the cat -calling to a campus official or staff member. Cat -calling is a major issue for women in today's world, but I guess I just honestly felt like making the report would not make a huge difference. This has been something going on since I can remember . Probably as early as high-school and most definitely throughout my undergraduate career. It seems like no matter how aware or how much light we try to shine on this issue it does not improve,\" and \"Gross dudes cat -calling or engaging in verbal sexual har assment is quite common on the streets around Hastings and on the walk to/from BART. Reporting this every single time would take too much of my time and would feel pointless because there's not much that can be done to stop gross random dudes. I just ignor e it. It is mostly middle aged men that hang out on the streets around Hastings and sometimes groups of younger man who hang out by the BART entrances. There is only one time I felt mildly sexually harassed by another member of the Hastings community. A Hastings employee in his mid/late 60's, who I knew and had a friendly acquaintance with, called out [redacted]. This did make me feel uncomfortable and I did not think it was appropriate. I did not report it though because it did not reach the level of 'report-able' for me .\" Nothing Would be Done. Respondents stated that they did not believe UC Hastings Law would do anything about the incident. Respondents stated, \" I felt nothing would be done about it ,\" \"No support at Hastings. Did not feel Hastings would b e open to hear ing it,\" and \" I did not believe that Hastings would do anything to resolve the issue or to make sure that it didn't happen again, given the pervasiveness of the homeless and drug issue surrounding campus .\" Other respondents added, \" Didn't see the point. Felt like my experience would be minimized and scrutinized and nothing concrete would be done ,\" \"W hat're they going to do about it? Nothing .\" and \" The advance was made by a current Hastings student, who has repeated instances of being under the Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 148 influence at Hastings events and grabbing females ' butts. Again, nothing Hastings would have done about the incident .\" Unwanted Sexual Contact Three percent ( n = 16) of respondents indicated that they experienced unwanted sexual contact (e.g., fondling, rape, sexual assault, penetration without consent) while a member of the UC Hastings Law community. Subsequent analyses of the data to determine statistically sig nificant differences by select demographics were not possible because of low response numbers. Of respondents who indicated they had experienced unwanted sexual contact , 56% (n = 9) indicated it happened 13 to 23 months ago. Student respondents were also asked to share what year of Law School they experienced unwanted sexual contact. Of Student respondents who indicated that they experienced unwanted sexual contact, 86% (n = 12) noted that it occurred in their first year and less than five respondents noted that it occurred in their second year. Fifty -six percent ( n = 9) of the respondents who indicated on the survey that they experienced unwanted sexual contact identified UC Hastings Law students as the perpetrators of the conduct. Respondents also identified an acquaintance/friend (38%, n = 6). Asked where the unwante d sexual contact incidents occurred, 75% (n = 12) of respondents indicated that they occurred off campus and 38% (n = 6) indicated they occurred on campus. Respondents who experienced unwanted sexual contact off campus indicated that the incidents occurred in places such as \" at home,\" \"streets,\" and \"walking down Market St. to a bar .\" On- campus locations included \"Tower.\" Asked how they felt in response to experiencing unwanted sexual contact, 56% each felt distressed (n = 9) or somehow responsible (n = 9), 50% (n = 8) felt embarrassed, 44% (n = 7) felt frustrated , and 31% (n = 5) each felt afraid , resigned , or sad (Table 54).

Zero respondents officially reported the unwanted sexual contact. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 150 Qualitative Comment Analyses Fourteen Student, Staff, and Faculty respondents explained why they chose not to report the unwanted sexual contact. Two themes emerged from responses: distrust of the reporting process and contact occurred off campus. Distrust of the Reporting Process . Respondents shared that they did not report the unwanted sexual contact because of the reporting process. Respondents stated, \"The first time it happened I was untenured and alone [redacted] and the last thing I needed was a Title IX festival... . Knowing the perversity of the Title IX process, it was clear to me that the main person to suffer from institutional intervention was me and I have had no cause to regret my decision,\" \"I am familiar with the reporting process and have found it to be futile,\" and \"I d idn't want to go thru that process.\" Another respondent feared that reporting would affect their reputation if their name was shared, \"It was embarrassing, and I didn't want to be known as that girl who that happened to. People would define me by that expe rience.\" Contact Occurred Off Campus. Respondents stated that they did not report the contact because it occurred off campus. Respondents stated, \" It was unrelated to campus or school, and just happened at a bar so I didn't think it was related to Hasting s or had to be reported at Hastings ,\" \"I was fondled by a stranger in the Tenderloin... again nothing I could have done ,\" and \" It happened off campus and was not done by someone within the Hastings community , so I did not see a need to report. \" Knowledge of Unwanted Sexual Contact/Conduct Definitions, Policies, and Resources Several survey items queried respondents about the degree to which they knew about campus policies, resources, and reporting options and responsibilities at UC Hastings Law (Table 56). Ninety -six percent ( n = 552) of respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that they were aware of the definition of Affirmative Consent , and 88% (n = 510) of respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that they generally were aware of the role UC Hastings Law Title IX Coordinator with regard to reporting incidents of unwanted sexual contact/conduct.

Unjust Hiring Practices Twenty -eight percent ( n = 51) of Faculty and Staff respondents indicated that they had observed hiring practices at UC Hastings Law that they perceived to be unjust (e.g., hiring supervisor bias, search committee bias, lack of effort in diversifying recruiting pool). Of those Faculty and Staff respondents who indicated that they had observed discriminatory hiring at UC Hastings Law , 49% (n = 25) noted it was based on racial identity, 33% ( n = 17) based on scholarship approach or content, 31% ( n = 16) based on ethnicity, and 29% ( n = 15) based on educational credentials (e.g., BS, MS, Ph D).

Of the Staff respondents who indicated that they had observed unjust employment -related discipline or action , 38% each noted it was based on age (n = 6) or length of service (n = 6). Qualitative comment analyses Thirty -seven Staff and Faculty respondents further elaborated about their observations of what they considered unjust employment practices related to hiring, promotion , tenure, reappointment , reclassification, or employment -related disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal. Two themes emerged around unjust hiring practices , revamping hiring practices, and unjust evaluations, promotions, and dismissals. Unjust Hiring Practices . Respondents elaborated on their perceptions of unjust hiring practices and how they relate to decreasing diversity at UC Hastings Law in statements such as , \"Hastings has become a much less diverse institution over the years. Candidates who come from privilege, who have had the advantage of attending the highest ranked schoo ls, and who carry out traditional scholarship, are the only ones who get through. There is also a bias against candidates who have been advocates prior to seeking a career in teaching. They are presumed to be incapable of performing the type of scholarship which is valued at Hastings. Many of them have gone on to obtain teaching positions at schools more highly ranked than Hastings,\" and \"... At times putting requirements/preferences on our hiring practices (for certain types of educational profiles, certain types of publications, certain types of connections in a field, universal vote procedures on a vetting committee --who may understandably value different things) means that we can unintentionally, but in ways that are preventable, continue to privilege thos e who already benefit from privilege, and disadvantage those who have not. When we know certain metrics favor those in privilege, and then reward those who receive those without acknowledging the embedded discrimination, we too, are discriminating... I bel ieve this unintended discrimination show [s] up in a number of ways (one example is the fact that the LTCF are all women, and primarily white women) and a similar composition exists for the newly hired LRW profs.\" Respondents also noted bias toward particu lar credentialing and backgrounds explaining , \"Some/many of my colleagues are Prestige Obsessed: Certain kinds of scholarship and Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 158 professional background and scholarly backgrounds (Ivy or Bust) are all that matters. Even when serving on the Appointments Co mmittee, I saw promising candidates who had been excellent real-world advocates, or who had not gone to Harvard or Yale not even considered for interviews. Conversely, I saw Golden Boys from prestigious backgrounds (doing, frankly, uninteresting work) rece ive screening interviews even if we did not have a slot for them . I see these kinds of comments in our decision -making meetings when deciding who to hire. All this by way of saying, I understand some of the reasons that ladder faculty are disproportionatel y White and Male,\" \"We all seem to agree on the need to diversify the faculty, yet we keep hiring white men. The usual explanation is that we make offers to other candidates but get turned down (see low salaries, above). However, we keep looking at the sam e pool, with the same criteria, so we get the same result. Some positive movement now through creating pipelines, but we could be doing more,\" and \"Many of UC Hastings ' white faculty often has an inflated view of itself - when comparable colleagues of colo r apply, they perceive them as 'not up to par' when in fact they mirror the current faculty. We have not made offer [s] to qualified faculty of color who end up at 'higher placed' institutions . We seem to see the 'potential' of white applicants but not of potential faculty of color.\" Revamping Hiring Practices. Staff and Faculty respondents provided suggestions to change hiring practices, \"Lack of faculty diversity, especially among those who teach fall 1L doctrinal courses, is the giant elephant in the roo m whenever we purport to present Hastings as a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. It's a difficult problem to solve, but it's time to get creative. An 'easy' place to begin would be to use VAP and overflow visitor hiring as at least a ba ndaid solution. I also firmly believe there should be a pathway for long -term Lecturers to eventually get LTCF status or the substantial equivalent (in terms of job security, compensation and, importantly, voting rights). ... I've seen the faculty grow incre asingly stratified along status/class, which isn't helping if the goal is to be a welcoming/inclusive community,\" and \"I have sensed an insufficient interest in and crediting of alternative kinds of educational and professional experiences, that happen, no t by coincidence, to include a high proportion of people of color, coupled with the fairly typical obsession with the standard criteria for faculty hiring that tends to produce our overwhelmingly privileged white professoriate.\" Other respondents added, \". .. There is a lack of diversity here and we need to get to the bottom of Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 159 it. I'm not sure hiring managers know how to improve the racial diversity of applicant pools. I have seen job posting [s] explicitly seek people who graduated from certain schools, tho ugh I'm not sure if that is illegal,\" and \"I think our efforts towards prioritizing diversity in hiring have increased significantly in recent years, even though they have not yet resulted in new hires. It might be that the Administration will have to cons ider financial incentives to attract high - performing minority candidates who are in high demand elsewhere, which could create equity concerns. However, if we are truly committed to creating a more diverse faculty and student body, then we might need to com pete more effectively in the marketplace for faculty talent, including at the entry level.\" Unjust Evaluations, Promotions, and Dismissals. Respondents indicated that People of Color face unjust evaluations, promotions, and dismissals at UC Hastings Law. R espondents stated, \"AFSCME members were laid off. White people got promoted and hired. Those who work hard - Asians, Latino and the handful of Black people that we have - don't get a chance for fair pay and professional advancement,\" \"I know of at least on e staff member who was demoted and given lower pay as a result .... I believe I received an unfair evaluation based in part on an issue I expressed specifically as a [redacted],\" and \"...It seems that as some people approach the point at which they could retire , they are laid off or their position eliminated. Also, the result of mass lay-offs/position eliminated always seems to affect BIPOC people the most.\" Staff and Faculty respondents expressed concern about what they considered to be unjust dismissals of Women of Color at UC Hastings Law. Respondents wrote, \"The pandemic -triggered staffing cuts and early retirements in summer 2020 seemed to disproportionately lead to the departures of BIPOC staff members,\" \"The last round of staff layoffs seemed to have a dis proportionate number of senior - age women of color with more than 10 years of Hastings employment; there was no regard for employment seniority... .\" and \"When we started COVID, Hastings laid off 7 -10 women, most of them of color. While the school sent out nic e notes about them, I just wonder and worry about them. ... They were at Hastings for 25+ years.\" Faculty Respondents' Views on Workplace Climate and Work -Life Balance Three survey items queried Faculty respondents ( n = 85) about their opinions regarding various issues specific to workplace climate and faculty work. Question 31 queried Ladder Faculty respondents (n = 30), Question 33 addressed Non -Ladder Faculty respondents ( n = 55), and Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 160 Question 35 addressed all Faculty respondents (n = 85). Chi -square analyses were conducted by faculty status ( Ladder, Non -Ladder Full -Time, and Non-Ladder Part -Time , as well as Full-Time and Part-Time58), gender identity, racial identity, sexual identity, years of employment, and caregiving status . Owing to low response numbers, significant differences were unable to be reported. Ladder Faculty Respondents Table 58 through Table 60 illustrate Ladder Faculty respondents' perceptions of faculty work at UC Hastings Law. Chi-square analyses were not able to be conducted owing to the small number of Ladder Faculty respondents. Eighty -seven percent (n = 26) of Ladder Faculty respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that the criteria for tenure were clear. Seventy percent ( n = 21) of Ladder Faculty respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that tenure standards/promotion standards were applied equally to faculty. Fifty -nine percent ( n = 17) of Ladder Faculty respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that they w ere supported and mentored during the tenure -track years.

One theme emerged from responses: overvaluing of research. Overvaluing of Research . Ladder Faculty respondents stated that research is valued above teaching and ser vice at UC Hastings Law . Respondents stated, \"We publicly claim to value teaching, service, and scholarship, but generally give remuneration only for the latter. There are Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 163 little consequences (with regard to chairs and/or promotions) for faculty members wh o reject service obligations or are unserious about their teaching. This makes those of us that shoulder more of these responsibilities resentful, and less likely to want to do these things in [the] future,\" and \"Hastings pays lip service to the value of t eaching and service, but for faculty hired in the last 15 years or so, quantity of scholarship and high -profile engagements are the only meaningful criteria of faculty merit.\" Respondents also explained that value was inherently tied to financial awards of fered by UC Hastings Law , \"Our tenure standard in our Faculty Rules privileges teaching and research over service, explicitly. We have more monetary rewards for research than we do for teaching,\" and \"It is crystal clear that UC Hastings values scholarly r esearch -- as it should. It's clear because nearly all of the financial rewards (Distinguished and other Chairs, summer funding, sabbatics, Faculty Foundation Award) go to promote and reward research. While we are told that teaching is equally valued, as f ar as I can tell, there is one single award, the Rutter Award, that targets excellence in teaching. Yes, [senior administrator] reads our teaching evaluations... But where the College puts its financial rewards says everything, we need to know about the re lative weight given to teaching vs. research.\" Non-Ladder Faculty Respondents Survey Question 33 queried Non -Ladder Faculty respondents on their perceptions as faculty with non-tenure -track appointments.

They believe LTCF do not bring equal value to the institution but must be tolerated for political reasons. I have personally experienced state ments from that group of faculty that support my opinion.\" Other respondents shared how their experiences were influenced by the research and teaching dichotomy, \"Publishing research articles is the coin of the realm. If you don't get compensated for doing it, you don't have as much influence across the institution. (When I [say] influence, I mean both the cachet that my ideas get in meetings and that I have felt not listened to, sidelined and silenced. I have left meetings many times feeling that someone r egarded me as less intelligent than tenure -track faculty.)

Two themes emerged from the responses : inadequate salaries and lack of knowledge or not applicable. Inadequate Salaries . Faculty respondents further elaborated on salaries at UC Hastings Law. Respondents explained that their salaries were not on par with other school systems in the region and how it affected their ability to recruit for UC Hastings Law, \"We MUST reach pay parity with UC sooner rather than later. We are now 20,000 below UC Davis at every faculty ladder step. That has to change. It is ridiculous to try to recruit new ladder faculty with a 2010 pay scale in the most expensive market in the country,\" and \"This is a great faculty to be on, minus the fact that our pay is too low - not just relative to UCLA, but relative to UC Irvine and UC Davis. That needs to change. I have trouble recruiting new colleagues in good faith at this point because our pay scale will n ot meet their needs throughout the life cycle unless they are rich, and I don't want to only recruit wealthy people onto our faculty.\" Respondents also factored in cost of living and its impact on their salaries, \" Measuring how competitive salary and benef its are is tricky. Compared to similarly -ranked law schools, we're well -paid. I got a huge raise when I came to Hastings. But when you factor in the Bay Area cost of living, we're less well paid than colleagues at comparably -ranked school s,\" \"I do recogniz e that our compensation packages are not competitive with other schools ' compensation packages, especially given the cost of living in the SF Bay Area ,\" and \" Our salaries are truly depressing - esp. given the cost of living. \" Lack of Knowledge or Not Appli cable. Another theme that emerged from Faculty respondents was that they did not know the answer to the question or the question was not applicable. Respondents shared that they did not have knowledge to answer particular survey questions, Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 170 \"Wish there had been an answer 'no opinion ' for some of these pages. E.g., whether committee work is distributed across the faculty?

Qualitative Comment Analyses Thirty -eight Staff respondents elaborated on their experience as staff member s at UC Hastings Law. Two themes emerged : work -life balance , and understaffing and workload. Work -Life Balance . Staff respondents shared challenges with work -life balance in their role at UC Hastings Law. Respondents stated, \" My work -life balance wa s okay before the pandemic - I could take vacation time and generally get work done, although there were some times when the workload would be heavy. Since March 2020, the expectations on me have increased substantially, and my supervisor has asked me to w ork nights and weekends to get everything done (on top of not being able to take vacation time for a full year) ,\" and \" Work and life balance is a nightmare at Hastings. My supervisor is expecting me to be available for work 24/7, I have Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 177 been receiving work -related texts, messages, calls, and emails after work hours every day, during the weekend and holidays. Everything is at the last minute. \" Respondents also mentioned the lack of boundaries around work expectations as an additional component in the lack of work -life balance, \" I do not feel that work life balance is the norm in my department, and I feel that a lot of boundaries are crossed by those in higher positions. You could list a dozen projects that you have on your plate, but you have to verbally say 'and I'm at capacity ' or you'll have another thing added ,\" and \" The administration at Hastings has a strong desire to support work -life balance and tries to do things to support those with family obligations up to a point, but when it becomes overly burdensome, administration will push for work to come before family responsibilities. This has become very clear during pandemic. Some senior leadership have made statements unsupportive of parenting responsibilities and taking time off. Although v erbally encouraged to take time off, you are also expected to get your work done without additional support. These things are impossible and in direct conflict. \" Understaffing and Workload. Staff respondents indicated another challenge was understaffing and heavy workloads. Respondents explained, \" Hastings is so leanly staffed that everyone in my department is at or over 100% capacity. If there were ever a change (for example, a medical leave), we would have a very difficult time making it through without people going well over 50 - 60 hours per week ,\" and \" Departments are run as thin as feasible at times, and workloads generally increase for staff without additional compensation. My colleagues joke that a promotion here is more responsibility, and accountabi lity without at any pay increase or new title. I know people on staff that are doing two or three jobs at other UC campuses...or are temporarily expected to have additional workload , but it never is resolved. \" Other respondents cited reductions and budget cuts in staffing as reasons for understaffing and increased workloads. Respondents stated, \" My staffing levels were reduced due to layoffs as a result of budget problems from [the] COVID 19 pandemic. Upper management did not announce reductions in service levels or response times by the using departments or customers subsequently we are stretched thin by resources and barely meet timelines ,\" and \" Over the past year, I have had to take on 2 FTE positions because of budget cuts and layoffs. My workload has in creased x3 without compensation, help, title change, or discussion about if I was okay with that. Constantly having to be okay with that performing at the highest level because there is so much to be done. \" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 178 One respondent also added that understaffing of diverse staff has led to increased workloads, \"Many BIPOC and LGBT+ staff are supporting students in significant mental health distress. Referring students to Carbon Health is unacceptable and insufficient. We are in the middle of a civil rights movement a s well as a pandemic. Students need more support from a mental health professional. Staff who reflect 'diverse ' identities are forced to show up outside of regular hours and take on additional work in order to show up to the values we have by working in hi gher education in the first place. This could be addressed by prioritizing hiring a diversity dean focused solely on that role (ideally also a director and or associate director to support) increasing the staffing for LEOP and DRP and hiring a mental healt h counselor. \" One set of question s in the survey queried Staff respondents about their opinions on various topics, including their support from supervisors at UC Hastings Law . Table 76 to Table 80 illustrate Staff responses to these items. Owing to low response rates, no significant differences were found between groups. Sixty percent (n = 59) of Staff respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that UC Hastings Law provided them with resources to pursue training/professional development opportunities ( Table 76). Seventy -six percent ( n = 72) of Staff respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that their supervisors provided them with resources to pursue training/professional development opportunities.

Qualitative Comment Analyses Thirty -three Staff respondents elaborated on their experience as staff member s at UC Hastings Law. Three th emes emerged including hierarch ical structure, inadequate salaries, and flexibility in hours and remote work. Hierarchical Structure . Staff respondents indicated that there was a hierarchical structure at UC Hastings Law with staff toward the bottom of the hierarchy. In particular, Respondents discussed specific experiences of hierarch ical and inconsistent treatment between staff and faculty, \"Before the pandemic, work from home was not really an option unless you were a faculty member. Faculty were always allowed to work from home with impunity. Despite showing that work from home can be efficient and productive for staff during the pandemic, senior leadership has expressed demands that staff return to in -person work ASAP without any consideration for staff health and safety and without any perceived need other than a desire to have staff onsite . No similar demands have been placed on faculty,\" and \"There are a few exceptions, but UC Hastings faculty generally seem to regard staff as unskilled help. Research , conferences, and sabbaticals seem to be far more important to faculty then being active in the community and developing substantive professional relationships with staff.\" Another Staff respondent also stated, \"From what I've experienced, the faculty att itude towards staff and to me in particular is -- and I don't use this term lightly --toxic. After decades of being a member of this community, if I pass a member of the faculty on campus, they usually ignore my greeting. If the greeting is not outright ignor ed, I regularly get a vague glance of recognition. When they do figure out who I am and what I do, I have come to expect that the faculty will treat me like they can do my job better than I can and dismiss and disdain my experience as a professional. There are some notable exceptions who have acknowledged and support my role and performance, but Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 183 otherwise, the faculty comes across as self -absorbed and disdainful of staff generally and me personally.\" Respondents also discussed the hierarchical relationship between senior administrators and staff, \"I believe certain senior administrators value staff opinion, while I'm not sure that others do. Specifically, it feels as if the only way for a lower ranking staff member to get to speak with [a senior administrator ] is [a matter of luck] ,\" and \"I don't feel that senior administrators value line staff at all. Their distrust of the union has created a very adversarial atmosphere. The many years between contracts, the emails sent by upper management, the comments I have witnessed in meetings by deans, all seem to demean staff needs and minimize our economic reality.\" Outside of these specific interacti ons, Staff respondents also indicated that hierarch ies existed in committees and promotions, \"Participation in committees is difficult as there is an attitude of hierarchy,\" and \"Advancement is limited here due to the smaller campus size and hierarchical nature. Many people I know who do great jobs are overlooked for promotion and outside hires are chose [n] instead.\" Inadequate Salaries. Another theme that Staff respondents discussed was the lack of competitive salaries at UC Hastings Law . Respondents wrot e, \"I am consistently MORTIFIED when I see job postings from Hastings. We do not pay staff enough and it seems the starting ranges haven't changed in years. I don't share job postings with my networks, because many of the salary ranges would be laughable. The low pay means we aren't as competitive, and there is a lot of strain on workers who have to commute form long distances (because they can't afford rent closer to the city). Had I not been permitted to work remotely I would have quit. The salary just is n't enough,\" and \"Pay is not competitive as compared to other UCs. This is a retention issue for salary staff who may be new to director roles and are likely to move on to locations that can provide a living wage. Staff are presently below the minimum wage needed in the Bay Area. Staff who are partnered or married, come from familial wealth, have a prior career where they made six -figures are able to get by but the rest of us are forced to consider leaving if we want to start a family, buy a home, or ever b e able to pay off student debt... .\" Respondents also added, \"Staff salaries [are] not competitive which is why we have retention issues; other UC 's are more competitive. I am grossly underpaid and have voiced this many times ...\" and \"I know that we are in a bu dget crisis, but I feel that staff salaries are not super competitive and the process by Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 184 which to obtain a raise is long and complicated. [Redacted] level staff in particular seem to not make as much as is consistent with some of their qualifications - including holding advanced degrees and there is some inequity in how much union members are making compared to [redacted] level staff. I think that there is also a huge disparity in how much faculty make and staff, especially professionally degreed staff, mak e especially when it seems like in many cases, staff are working harder and longer hours than faculty.\" Flexibility in Hours and Remote Work. Staff respondents discussed flexibility in hours and opportunities to work remotely. Respondents explained that f lexibility and remote work varied by office and supervisor, \"I t depends on the person on the departmental level, whether the department head will use the tool that Hastings provided . Per my department, there are not flexible work schedules. I have to stay after 5:00 pm every day, can 't even take my week off ...\" and \" Flexibility is afforded to others but not for all. Some managers/staff who have not earned their keep are given the flexibility. It really depends on who your division head is. If he likes you, yo u can do whatever you want, come to work whenever you please, make mistakes and not own up to it ....\" Other respondents called for the need for more flexibility and remote work, \"Re-iterating the flexible work schedules to allow for some days in the office and some days remotely. It would help with commuting and commuting costs! \" and \" Coming from another law school, it's been surprising how rigid the work hours are here. There is zero flexibility even while being remote with the added -on expectation t o work late into the evening. I'm not sure if this is Hastings overall or just my department. \" Staff Respondents' Perception of Climate Table 83 to Table 85 depict Staff respondents' attitudes about certain aspects of the climate in their work units and in general at UC Hastings Law . Subsequent analyses were conducted to identify significant differences in responses by Staff status ( Managerial Staff and Non - Managerial Staff ), gender identity, racial identity, sexual identity, disability status, years of employment and caregiving status . No significant findings are publ ished in this section owing to low numbers in many of the response categories for these variables. Twelve percent ( n = 11) of Staff respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that coworkers in their work units prejudged their abilities based on their perceptions of their identity/background. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 185 Fifteen percent ( n = 14) of Staff respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that their supervisor/manager prejudged their abilities based on their perceptions of their identity/background and 20% ( n = 19) of Staff respondents \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that faculty prejudged their abilities based on their perceptions of their identity/background.

Staff Respondents' Sense of Belonging at UC Hastings Law As mentioned previously in this report, the survey contained another outcome related to campus climate, Sense of Belonging , which was informed by Strayhorn's (2012) qualitative examination of sense of belonging. Factor Analysis Methodology A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the nine sub -items of survey question 109, which produced the Staff Sense of Belonging factor ( Table 86). Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 187 Table 86. Survey Items Included in the Staff Sense of Belonging Factor Analyses Scale Survey question Staff Sense of Belonging I feel valued by coworkers in my department. I feel valued by coworkers outside my department. I feel valued by my supervisor/manager. I feel valued by Hastings students. I feel valued by Hastings faculty. I feel valued by Hastings senior administrators (e.g., Dean, Associate/Assistant Dean ). I believe that Hastings climate encourages open discussion of diffic ult topics. I feel that Hastings values my skills. I feel that Hastings values my work. The factor score for Staff Sense of Belonging was created by taking the average of the scores for the sub -questions in the factor. The factor was then reverse coded so that higher scores on the Staff S ense of Belonging factor suggest ed an individual or constituent group felt a stronger sense of belonging at UC Hastings Law. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale was . 884, which is high, meaning that the scale produced consistent results.59 Means Testing Methodology After creating the factor scores for respondents based on the factor analyses, where n's were of sufficient size, the means for respondents were analyzed to determine whether the factor scores differed for categories in the following demographic areas: Staff status ( Managerial Staf f, Non -Managerial Staff ) Gender identity (Women, Men) Racial identity (Respondents of Color including Multiracial, White ) Sexual identity ( Queer -spectrum , Heterosexual) Years of employment (Less than 6 or More Years)60 Caregiver status ( Caregiving , Non -Caregiving ) 59 For a detailed description of these methods, refer to the \"Research Design\" portion of the \"Methodology\" section of this report . 60 Owing to the low number of responses in some categories, Respondents with 6 - 15 Years and Respondents with More than 15 Years were combined for analysis purposes. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 188 The following sections offer analyses to determine differences for the demographic characteristics mentioned above for Staff respondents (where possible).

Qualitative Comment Analyses Forty -nine Staff and Faculty respondents explained why they seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law . Staff respondents shared two themes in regard to salaries and supervision while Faculty respondents elaborated on a si ngle theme pertaining to salaries. Staff respondents Salaries . Staff respondents shared that their salary was one of the reasons that they considered leaving UC Hastings Law . Respondents commented, \" The main thing is the low pay - I will never be able to buy a house in the bay area, and it feels like working at Hasting is taking out a loan from my future self who won't be able to retire ,\" \"The school isn't paying a living wage. The current pay rate is okay for now but not sustainable over the long term ,\" and \" I am not paid for my level of education, my level of professional development, or my contributions to my work. \" Other respondents discussed how their salary compared to other institutions in the area, \" I seriously considered leaving because I was hi ghly under -compensated for my job position compared with others who hold my same position at other Bay Area universities ,\" and \" I can make 30 to 40 percent more pay at other agencies/institutions and I took a pay reduction to come work at Hastings ....\" Super vision. Staff respondents indicated that supervision was a crucial reason why they considered leaving. Some staff respondents shared negative experiences working with supervisors such as , \"W e are constantly micromanaged. We are doing more work as we were l eft with less staff members ,\" and \"No work -life balance. Micromanagement. Toxic work environment. No clear instruction/structure from the supervisor... .\" One respondent further elaborated on their experience with poor supervision, \" There are areas where I ha ve been recognized in this profession as excelling, innovating, and bringing something unique that I am not permitted to explore or try in my role. They note, \" I have been micromanaged at a level that is not sustainable and that would need to change for me to stay. Supervisors struggle to provide positive feedback, point out what I'm doing well, offer praise, or say thank you ....\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 195 Faculty respondents Salaries . Faculty respondents explained that they considered leaving because of their salaries, especially in comparison to their counterparts at the University of California. A Faculty respondent stated, \"This is a tremendously expensive place to live. ... I got one small base salary increase (when the scale was increased, of 1.5% or so). Other than that, I experi enced declining real income every year I was pre -tenure, to the point that I was increasingly financially distressed with every rent increase. ... Meanwhile, UC Davis pays their entry level hires more than my base salary ...!\" Other respondents echoed these sen timents and wrote, \"The lack of opportunities for career advancement and poor compensation for adjuncts are the primary reasons I've been considering a position with more substantial academic opportunities,\" and \"The Bay Area is extremely challenging for a young family on an academic salary.\" Summary The results from this section suggest that most Faculty and Staff respondents generally held positive attitudes about UC Hastings Law policies and processes. With regard to discriminatory employment practices , 28% ( n = 51) of Faculty and Staff respondents had observed unfair or unjust hiring, 21% (n = 39) had observed unfair or unjust promotion, tenure, and/or reclassification, and 13% (n = 23) had observed unfair or unjust disciplinary actions. Racial identity, age, position, and scholarship approach or content were the top perceived bases for many of th e reported discriminatory employment practices. Most Staff respondents agreed that they had supervisors or colleagues/coworkers who gave them job/career advice or guidance when they needed it; that they were included in opportunities to help their careers ; and that their supervisors provided adequate support to manage work -life balance . Less than positive attitudes were also expressed by Staff respondents. For example, some Staff respondents felt that staff salaries were not competitive, and that Hastings was not supportive of flexible work schedules . A majority of Ladder Faculty and Non -Ladder Faculty respondents agreed that their teaching was valued by UC Hastings Law, but some expressed views that criteria used for contract renewal were not applied equa lly to all positions and that they performed more work to help students than their colleagues. Most Ladder and Non-Ladder Faculty respondents indicated that Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 196 UC Hastings Law valued research and teaching. Most Ladder Faculty felt that Senior Administrators t ake faculty opinions seriously. Also, Faculty respondents perceived salaries for tenure -track faculty, and non -tenure -track faculty as not competitive. Over half of Faculty respondents (51%, n = 43) and Staff respondents (60%, n = 58) had seriously conside red leaving UC Hastings Law in the past year. The top reasons why Faculty and Staff respondents had seriously considered leaving included low salary/pay rate, limited opportunities for advancement, tension with supervisor/manager, and increased workload . lxviii A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Staff respondents who indicated that they observed unfair hiring practices by position status : 2 (1, N = 182) = 5.6, p < .05. lxix A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Facul ty and Staff respondents who indicated that they had observed unjust promotion, tenure, reappointment, and/or reclassification practices by gender identity : 2 (1, N = 173) = 3.4, p < .05. lxx A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Staff respondents who indicated that they had observed unjust promotion, tenure, reappointment, and/or reclassification practices by sexual identity : 2 (2, N = 170) = 12.0, p < .01. lxxi A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty and Staff respondents who indicated that they had observed unjust employment -related discipline or action, up to and including dismissal by years of employment : 2 (2, N = 178) = 6.9, p < .05. lxxii A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Staff respondents who were able to complete their assigned duties during scheduled hours by staff status: 2 (4, N = 98) = 11.3 , p < .05. lxxiii A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Staff respondents who had seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law by sexual identity : 2 (1, N = 552) = 7.5, p < .05. lxxiv A chi-square test was conducted to compare percentages of Faculty respondents who had seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law by racial identity : 2 (1, N = 77) = 6.4, p < .05. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 197 Student Perceptions of Campus Climate This section of the report reviews survey item responses from UC Hastings Law students. Several survey items queried Student respondents about their academic experiences, their general perceptions of the campu s climate, and their comfort with their classes. Students' Perceived Academic Success Factor Analysis Methodology As mentioned earlier in this report, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on one scale embedded in Question 7 of the assessment. The scale, termed \" Perceived Academic Success \" for the purposes of this project, was developed using Pascarella and Terenzini's (1980) Academic and Intellectual Development Scale (Table 97). This scale has been used in a variety of studies examining student persistence. The first six sub -questions of Question 7 of the survey reflect the questions on this scale. The questions on the scale were answered on a Likert metric from \"strongly agree \" to \"strongly disagree\" (scored 1 for \"strongly agree\" and 5 for \"strongly disagree\"). For the purposes of analysis, respondents who did not answer all scale sub -questions were not included in the analysis. Two percent ( n = 8) of all potential respondents were removed from the analysis because of one or more missing responses. A factor analysis was conducted on the Perceived Academic Success scale. The factor loading of each item was examined to test whether the intended questions combined to represent the underlying construct of the scale.61 The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale was .861, which is high, meaning that the scale produced consistent results. Table 97. Survey Items Included in the Perceived Academic Success Factor Scale Survey item number Academic experience Q7_A_1 I am performing up to my full academic potential. 61 Factor analysis is a particularly useful technique for scale construction. It is used to determine how well a set of survey questions combine to measure a latent construct by measuring how s imilarly respondents answer those questions . Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 198 Table 97. Survey Items Included in the Perceived Academic Success Factor Scale Survey item number Academic experience Perceived Academic Success Q7_A_2 I am satisfied with my academic experience at Hastings. Q7_A_3 I am satisfied with the extent of my intellectual development since enrolling at Hastings. Q7_A_4 I have performed academically as well as I anticipated I would. Q7_A_5 My academic experience has had a positive influence on my intellectual growth and interest in ideas. Q7_A_6 My interest in ideas and intellectual matters has increased since coming to Hastings. The factor score for Perceived Academic Success was created by taking the average of the scores for the six sub -questions in the factor. Each respondent who answe red all the questions included in the given factor was assigned a score on a five -point scale. The factor was then reverse coded so that higher scores on the Perceived Academic Success factor suggested a student or constituent group perceived themselves as more academically successful. Means Testing Methodology Where n's were of sufficient size, separate analyses were conducted to determine whether the means for the Perceived Academic Success factor were different for first -level categories in the followin g demographic areas: Gender identity (Women, Men) Racial identity (Asian/Pacific Islander, White, Black/Indigenous/ Latinx/Middle Eastern) Sexual status (First -Generation, Income level (Lower -Income, Middle -Income, Higher -Income) Disability status (Single Disability, No Disability, Multiple Disabilities) Religious affiliation (Christian Affiliation, Additional Religious Affiliation, N o Affiliation, Multiple Affiliations) Practice area interest (Government, Private Practice, Public Interest/Social Justice, Unsure/Undecided) Political views (Conservative/Libertarian, Moderate, Liberal, Progressive) Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 199 When only two categories existed for th e specified demographic variable, a t-test for difference of means was used. If the difference in means was significant, effect size was calculated using Cohen's d. Any moderate -to-large effects were noted. When the specific variable of interest had more t han two categories, an ANOVA was run to determine whether any differences existed. If the ANOVA was significant, post -hoc tests were run to determine which differences between pairs of means were significant. Additionally, if a difference in means was sign ificant, effect size was calculated using partial Eta2 and any moderate -to-large effects were noted. Means Testing Results The following sections offer analyses to determine differences for the demographic characteristics mentioned above for Student respo ndents (where possible). Gender Identity No significant difference existed in the overall test for means for Student respondents by gender identity on Perceived Academic Success , t(370) = -0.054, p = .957 ( Table 98).

Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 215 Multiple Support Spaces On -Campus . Student respondents indicated that they felt safe and supported in multiple spaces on campus. Student respondents shared, \"I mostly feel safe and supported in classrooms, or in one -on-one meetings with faculty. I have had wonderful experiences with the faculty of on -campus clinics,\" \"I love the people in CDO, Student Services, and the Health Center. Also, the security guards are all so nice and chill, it makes a difference seeing them every morning...\" and \"LEOP, OASIS, student orgs... My interactions with student -facing and senior staff have been nothing but encouraging. I struggled with mental health issues d uring my first semester and the support I received from all of these different groups helped me decide to stay at Hastings, so I generally feel safe in the spaces where I sought help.\" Respondents discussed overall positive interactions with staff and facu lty, \" I love [named redacted] - . . . one staff member who has been SO helpful in both an academic and non -academic setting. When I look back on my time at Hastings, I think [name redacted ] has had the biggest influence (along with [named redacted] -) in making me feel supported at Hastings ,\" \"I have made great connections with some professors, and they definitely have been go -tos during this process so far,\" and \"I feel most safe and supported by student advisors, as well as professors who have provided guidance in multiple arenas.\" Student re spondents mentioned specific programs . Respondents talked about the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP) being a space of support, \"I feel very safe and supported both academically and non -academically by the LEOP program,\" and \"I feel most supported with my LEOP community which includes the professors involved with LEOP who offer office hours... and all the students.\" Other respondents wrote, \"LEOP is the only place I felt safe and supported,\" and \"I feel safe in LEOP. I'm surrounded by diverse facul ty and students in the program. I don't feel judged and I'm able to discuss academic/personal goals and experiences.\" Respondents also shared experiences working with Disability Resource Program, \"The DRP - ... they have the most amazing program to support n ot only academics but also physical and mental wellbeing in dealing with whatever disability we may have and how that interacts with law school and our academic performance. The staff there is extremely responsive and hears student concerns, they are not d ismissive. They helped me get to a solution and made a stressful situation bearable and I feel like I can go to them for any support I might need,\" and \"I love ...the ENTIRE Disability Resource Program crew. Everyone is so helpful, and I am 100% Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 216 sure that I would not have been able attend Hastings (successfully) without their help... . I have spoken to them and shared my struggles and received support that I didn't know existed. I have just recently started struggling with my disabilities more than ever and I wa s worried that I would seem like I didn't honestly need support. I felt like an imposter even though I really struggle with things you can't physically see... DRP completely embraced me and supported me more than I could have imagined. Please continue to all ocate resources to DRP and DRP please keep up your tireless efforts to help differently -abled students have a level playing field!\" Student respondents indicated student organizations were important spaces of support as well. Respondents wrote, \"Mainly my communities within my student organizations; everywhere else feels too professional to speak as openly or let my guard down as much given the prestige and emphasis on looking professional that everyone places on the field,\" and \"I feel most supported in student -led organizations, especially affinity group ones. I also feel most supported by student mentors through various student orgs.\" Another respondent added, \"At this point, I feel highly supported by faculty, staff, and administration, but I think it's largely the result of my involvement with student organizations and I'm unsure if I would have the same supportive environment without it.\" Additionally, Student respondents indicated that academic concentrations and clinics were critical spaces of safety and support stating, for example , \"Hastings Health Law & Policy Concentration and Faculty have always been incredibly supportive to me and other students academically, professionally, and personally,\" \"I feel most support in my concentration and among the faculty, staff, and students involved. I also feel most supported in the Community Justice Clinic and the faculty, staff, and students involved with CJC. Both of these groups feel like a smaller community within Hastings where people have similar interests and take the time to support each other,\" and \"The Social Justice Lawyering Concentration and Community Group Advocacy Clinic has been the safest spaces I've been involved in that leaves an open discussion to be vulnerable and affirmed. If not for these t wo spaces, I would have downvoted my views on the general climate at Hastings.\" Student Respondents' Perception of Academic and Professional Support The survey queried Student respondents about their perceptions about UC Hastings Law , the quality of advisi ng, communication with faculty and staff, and professional development Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 217 encouragement from faculty and staff .

Qualitative comment analyses One hundred twenty -four Student respondents elaborated on their experience as a student at UC Hastings Law. Themes emerged from Student respondents around positive interactions with staff, faculty, and departments; the Career Development Office; academic advis ing; and support for students with varying practice area interests. Positive Interactions with Staff, Faculty, and Departments. Student respondents shared positive experiences with staff, faculty, and departments at UC Hastings Law. Respondents described interactions with staff and faculty such as, \"Hastings's faculty and staffs are nice. If I have some concerns and I am not sure who to email, I can email the most likely person, and the person will help me forward to the appropriate department,\" \"I apprecia te how quick staff/faculty members respond to emails. They also provide clear and adequate instructions and information through emails,\" and \"Generally speaking, the best part about Hastings is its staff. The faculty in particular care and are top notch.\" Respondents also mentioned positive interactions with specific staff members and departments, \"I've been incredibly supported through LEOP and OASIS, as well as from my professors. I'm honestly impressed and have told advisors as such! ... my advisor helped me to feel supported and capable of success, and my professors have been Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 223 my best cheerleaders in [Cohort] thus far. All of the staff I've interacted with clearly care about students and their success...\" and \"[Redacted] in the Career Development Office hav e been monumentally helpful to me during my summer job search... [redacted] in the Disability Resource Program is a phenomenal resource . . . generous with . . . insight and advice, and very approachable. Recently, a friend of mine was struggling with their mental health, and I directed them to [redacted] because I knew that [redacted] was knowledgeable, approachable, and would be able to help my friend directly and/or give her other resources and contacts to pursue.\" Other respondents wrote about their expe riences with specific faculty members, \"I cannot stress enough the support I've received from my professors to pursue personal academic and career interests. They have been instrumental to my job searching experience and have alleviated stressors students ordinarily have during periods like OCI. It is because of this support that I encourage potential law [students] to attend UC Hastings. Our professors are extremely well - resourced with large networks, and try their best to get your foot in the door at any firm, company, or organization imaginable,\" and \"I rely on Professor [redacted] and Professor [redacted] and my [redacted] TA ([redacted], who is absolutely amazing) for academic, professional, and emotional advice. Thanks to other amazing faculty members like [redacted] I started going to therapy and I hope all of the changes and advice and improvements help me professionally and academically.\" Career Development Office. Student respondents had mixed experiences interacting with the Career Development Offi ce. Some respondents shared positive experiences such as, \"CDO has been a great tool for job applications,\" and \"The CDO in particular has been amazing... I relied more on the CDO and my professional network to select classes than I did academic advising.... \" Respondents also added, \"[Redacted] in the CDO has been the most encouraging and lovely person. She has been incredibly supportive in my career goals and has gone above and beyond to help me and make my law school career all the more positive,\" and \"[Red acted] in the CDO is by far the best [redacted] I have ever interacted with. She was and is so willing to always answer questions, set meetings outside of her meeting slots, respond to emails, and so much more. She makes my life, as a student, so much less stressful. She helped me find a job and she continues to help me even after securing employment after graduation....\" However, some respondents mentioned a lack of support from the office because of their rankings, \"Specifically in regards to Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 224 CDO, I feel like I am given less in -depth advice because I am not within the top 10% of my class. I have heard from other classmates a similar story --that because they were not top 10% CDO pushed them to PI/PS. It is extremely discouraging and prejudicial,\" and \"I fee l unsupported as a student who is in the middle tier of the class. ... CDO has done very little to provide support for the job search.\" Other respondents indicated that they were also discouraged from applying for opportunities because of their grades, \"Enco urage more students to apply for clerkships, fellowships, jobs. Students who are not in the top 15% are actively DISCOURAGED from seeking these opportunities out and it is demoralizing (and incorrect!),\" and \"CDO discouraged me from becoming a law clerk or going for a judicial internship because I was first generation law student and didn't have straight As.\" Academic Advising. Student respondents shared their experiences with advising at UC Hastings Law. Respondents stated, \"Academic advising is a complet e joke. We are basically given the same advice we could receive from a worksheet - there is little interest or advice given in relation to our career interests or development, just basic requirements,\" \"I have met with multiple academic advisors and have r eceived nothing beneficial from them,\" and \"I have received very little support in academic advising. When I set an appointment and asked concrete questions, I was given no answers to assist me in preparation of my academic plan.\" Respondents called for more advising support, \"I feel like there could be a better network created for students to have an advisor or counselor to help with picking classes during 1L year. I messed up a little and took a couple of classes I really didn't need or want to take think ing they were required but they were not, and now I won't be able to take all of the classes I want,\" \"Hastings could do a better job of proactive advising. Instead of waiting for students to come to them, they could do a better job of flagging classes tha t the student needs to take or if they are missing a course going into their 3L year...\" and \"Hastings should also assign all students an assigned faculty advisor who will personally check in with them throughout their 3 years at Hastings. It would be so muc h more personal and would really positively impact a lot of 1Ls during what is known to be the most stressful semester in law school.\" One respondent described how under staffing affected their ability to receive adequate advising, \"The limited staffing of student -facing departments prevents students from being able to book appointments during the most crucial times of the school year. Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 225 Hastings MUST expand Student Services/Academic Advising/CDO to better serve the needs of its substantial student body.\" Support for Students with Varying Practice Area Interests. Student respondents described limited resources and support available for students with interests outside of \"big law.\" Respondents stated, \"...The school seems to be really on top of big law, clerksh ips, and working for the courts. But it seems to lack in knowledge of what it takes to get a job with public interest groups or with the government,\" \"There is an obvious bias for students with more traditional legal paths and potential for traditional suc cess,\" and \"Generally, there seemed to be an overwhelming support for students that were not pursuing careers in the public sector. I wish that Public Interest/Public Sector would be disaggregated to show a more robust career area. Similarly, I wish that H astings would be more supportive of non -litigation career paths, namely a transactional career path....\" Respondents also noted that the College provided limited job resources. For example, \"Strongly disappointed with CDO in particular... Did not let public interest students know of EJW registration until it was too late to sign up. I personally know multiple grads of the Class of 2020 who got jobs through EJW and we were only notified when only table talks were open and live bidding was done. No guidance for P ublic Interest deadlines, had to find them all on my own. Blatant bias towards emphasizing students to secure firm/Big Law jobs for future deep pocket alums over public interest job searches,\" and \"The career development office only seems interested in pro viding support if you are interested in big law. This is a public school. Our most visible alum has been a public servant since she graduated. What's with the big law obsession?\" Respondents not interested in big law described feeling unsupported overall, \"As someone pursuing[practice area interest redacted], a field that is traditionally less lucrative than other areas of law, I did not feel like I was adequately supported by STAFF. UCH Staff and administration seems solely focused on increasing ranking an d producing lawyers who will later donate significant amounts of money. (However, most faculty in the field were INCREDIBLY helpful.),\" and \"My interests are somewhat antithetical to the 'normal' business law track, and I have found some of my Career Depar tment interactions to be less useful than my own research. Faculty and staff have both been incredibly supportive - not the fault of any person, more about the way the institution steers toward big law & gov't work.\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 226 Students Who Have Seriously Considered Leaving UC Hastings Law Forty -eight percent ( n = 280) of respondents had seriously considered leaving UC Hastings Law .

Qualitative Comment Analyses One hundred Student respondents explained why they seriously considered leaving. Two themes emerged for Student respondents: UC Hastings Law brand and ranking , and the academic environment. UC Hastings Law Brand and Ranking . Among Student respondents, one theme emerged about the College's brand and ranking, specifically how it affected students' ability to secure future job Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 229 opportunities after completing their degree. Student respondents explained, \"Thought about leaving because of school's ranking and I go t into higher ranked schools. I thought going to a higher ranked school would help my employment options,\" \"I have enjoyed my time at Hastings, but I am considering transferring closer to home and to a higher -ranked law school because I ended with a great GPA after my first semester and (1) it could increase my future job prospects...\" and \"Due to classroom climate and concern for future job prospects I have considered this. I am afraid that I will not have the same opportunities here as I might have at a higher ranked school.\" Respondents also connected these concerns about the college's ranking with the quality of their education, \"I truly believe [I] will have a better education somewhere else. Our [redacted] department really needs helps. I can't believe I had to reach out to other people at other law schools for resources,\" and \"I believe I would receive a better legal education at Berkeley Law.\" Academic Environment. Student respondent s shared that another reason they considered leaving was the academic environment. Respondents explained, \"I felt like it was hopeless to continue staying in law school with my low academic performance. I felt lost in my classes, and unable to compete with those who wor ked extensively in law and have family members who are lawyers. It felt like even professors assumed all students knew things that I didn't know,\" and \"I find academic life to be extremely stressful. Especially the competitive nature of law school and the importance of first year grades in securing a job after school. It feels like my entire future is riding on this year and it seems to be going sideways for me. I guess I was considering leaving to cut my losses and avoid a huge sunk cost.\" Another responde nt indicated that they felt a lack of support from UC Hastings Law, \"I struggled and continue to struggle academically, to the point that it affects my mental health. I haven't truly felt supported in the sense that the school is invested in my academic gr owth or potential to graduate.\" Student respondents discussed additional challenges with academic bureaucracy, \"I just felt like at every turn Hastings chose to make its students ' lives difficult by having unnecessary academic requirements, unsympathetic administrators, and not really taking into account the stresses its students feel...\" and \"The Academic Supervision requirements - meetings with student services, the dean, enrollment in certain classes - made things more overwhelming and anxiety -inducing tha n they needed to be. I Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 230 knew I was doing poorly, and I knew why. It wasn't something those meetings could help me with so I felt like I had to lie about the real reasons I was struggling, especially in my first year.\" Summary Student respondents held posit ive perceptions of their experiences at UC Hastings Law.

The findings in this section suggest that respondents generally agreed that the actions cited in the survey have, or would have, a positive influence on the campus climate. Notably, some Faculty, Staff, and Student respondents indicated that man y of the initiatives were not available on UC Hastings Law 's campus. If, in fact, these initiatives are available, UC Hastings Law would benefit from better publicizing all that the institution offers to positively influence the campus climate. Qualitative comment analyses One hundred sixty -nine Student, Staff, and Faculty respondents provided specific recommendations for improving the campus climate. Two themes emerged from Student respondents : increase diversity and need for dialogue. One theme emerged from Staff respondents regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion education and training. Two themes emerged from Faculty respondents : increase diversity at UC Hastings Law and diversity, equity, and inclusion training and training quality. Student respondents Increase Diversity . Student respondents stated that UC Hastings Law should increase its diversity. Respondents noted, \"Acknowledging the lack of diversity in certain areas within Hastings - particularly black students as there is usually only one or two black students in most classes and this is important in conversations about race. It's pretty tone deaf and hypocritical to discuss systemic racism without being critical of the composition of our own student body,\" and \"Our campus's diversity i s improving, but we still could benefit from further diversity, particularly in terms of socioeconomic status. I know way too many students who rely on their parents for money still, which is a sad reflection on our nation's economic structure, but which i s even more sad because it indicates that students who can't rely on their parents won't be as likely to succeed. Hastings should do more outreach to educational institutions at a lower level -- community colleges, or even high schools --to advise resources t o students early on in their lives and hopefully inspire them in some way too.\" Other respondents added that diversity needed to increase among not only the students, but also staff, faculty, and administrators, \"I think having a more diverse campus would help! \" and noted that for some identities \" there may be only one Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 249 other \" in a class. Hire more BIPOC professors. Hire more professors who understand poverty. Hire professors who will stop using Black folks' murders to teach criminal law,\" and \"Hiring a more diverse faculty and staff; admitting a more diverse student body. There should not be (required) classes with 50 -70 students and only 0 -3 Black or Indigenous students. It is embarrassing and problematic.\" Student respondents indicated that increasing the diversity at UC Hastings Law would improve the campus climate, \"I think at Hastings we talk a lot about inclusion and making everyone feel welcome. However, I think the campus could do a much better job of hiring f aculty members and professors who embody that diversity better. I still feel most of our professors at Hastings represent the stereotypical white male and I have yet to see any professor really that looks like me. To even have an Asian p rofessor at all feels rare. Just generally a wider pool of p rofessors could greatly contribute to the climate and really show greater diversity and inclusion that we preach so much\" and \"...One of the main components to improving the campus climate is to increase diversity in the student body, administration, and tea ching staff. It is quite sad for me to think that although this is meant to be an anonymous survey, based on the information I provided, as a student of color, it would be easy to know who I am. This connects back to the lack of diversity. During my first year starting at Hastings, one of the remarks to the incoming class was how diverse our class was. When I looked around and was surrounded by mostly white students, I did not understand how that statement could be true. When I enter into any of my classes, I am automatically emotionally and mentally behind most of my peers. Students do not look like me and most of the staff do not look like me. I think Hastings must make an effort to increase diversity in our school.\" Need for Dialogue. Another theme that e merged from Student respondents was the need for dialogue among students, staff, and faculty. However, respondents varied in the types of dialogue that they believed were needed. Some Student respondents mentioned the need to discuss difficult topics aroun d identity and intersectionality, \"Provide spaces where all groups at Hastings (student orgs, the general student body, and staff generally) can engage in conversations about campus climate (not just an open door policy but actual events that bring forward these sorts of topics),\" and \"I think it is important to talk about tough issues about intersectionality, race, class, etc., rather than pretending that everything is fine because we have a Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 250 diverse population of students. It might help facilitate a safe s pace for students, faculty, and staff to have these difficult conversations.\" Other respondents indicated that they would like these dialogues incorporated into the academic curriculum, \"Appreciate increased integration of racial and socioeconomic perspect ives into classes and would like more of that,\" and \"I think during 1L there is an opportunity to make for diversity -based lectures a part of the 1L experience. By the second semester the IRAC lectures are really overkill. At that point students who still need help should seek it out on their own. I think instead of continuing with these writing lessons those time periods could be used to talk about inequality in the legal system and society as a whole.\" Other respondents wrote about a need for dialogue on controversial and political topics, \"They should encourage productive and real conversations amongst students and faculty. Having one - sided discussions and shunning those that disagree is counterproductive and will only injure students in their careers. S pecifically, students that are constantly told that their view is the only one that is correct will suffer when dealing with a judge or opposing counsel with wildly differing views,\" and \"There have been times in classes when a question of how to get to a more progressive place (ex. prison abolition) is shot down as being conservative or supporting the 'bad side'. When in reality there needs to be space to explore these more progressive ideas and there needs to be inclusive and accepting dialog on how we ca n get to the desired end result. As well as space for people to express an alternative end goal.\" One respondent also added, \"Allow for [and] encourage discussion from multiple points of view, not only the more liberal points. A majority of the law and jud ges, especially in the Supreme Court are conservative, and if we are not taught conservative arguments, or genuinely why people believe opposite to others, then we are never going to stand a chance in the real world. The legal profession at this time just isn't as inclusive as it could be. I would like to learn how to deal with the sexism that I will inevitably receive throughout my career as a woman in law, along with learning how to deprogram and work against that sort or discrimination.\" Staff respondent s Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Education and Trainings. Staff respondents indicated a need for more diversity, inclusion, and equity education and training at UC Hastings Law . Respondents stated, \"More training for staff and faculty. I know there is tr aining coming up, but this is a very Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 251 new development. Also, a real commitment to addressing the kind of discrimination that our students and staff face due to various identity statuses... .\" and \"Providing mandatory DEI training programming for students, staf f and faculty multiple times per year. Providing students with a baseline history related to race/racism and all other isms in the law as a part of the 1L curriculum in their 1st semester.\" Respondents also stated, \"...Ongoing training for DEI -- make it man datory, especially for senior staff who have the most power and are probably the most conservative/stubborn about change... .\" and \"More diversity training, more small group breakout sessions.\" Faculty respondents Increase Diversity . Faculty respondents expre ssed concerns about the lack of diversity at UC Hastings Law. Respondents stated, \"There needs to be a greater effort to have diversity -- especially in areas of race, gender and class -- throughout the institution, but especially among the senior administ rators. Over the course of my time at Hastings, I have seen the senior administration become more white, and more male, and that has impacted decisions and values across the institution.\" and \"The current administration's all -White faculty composition is a huge problem. It sends a powerfully dispiriting message to students, faculty and staff that we are a White -dominated institution. Students and faculty of color need to see themselves in leadership roles if they're going to feel included and welcomed. The only other demographic on the administration are Asian women. How can we expect to come across as welcoming and inclusive if we don't have Black and Latinx people in our key administrative positions?\" Respondents also discussed increasing diversity throug h hiring processes, \"Always have an open, national recruiting process for faculty positions with clear job description information. Be more transparent about types of faculty positions, expectations across classifications, and associated pay bands. Expand the range of faculty who can vote. Expand criteria for new faculty hiring - include more practitioners and a broader range of scholars from a broader range of law schools and backgrounds,\" \"Faculty hiring need to de -emphasize and de -valorize Ph.D. degrees as an indicator of scholarly promise. The pool of Ph.D.s is notoriously not racially diverse, we need to look in the realms of practicing attorneys to find, develop, and support candidates of color,\" \"Broaden criteria for hiring of new faculty to increase d iversity,\" and \"Hire more diverse Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 252 faculty. It can be daunting to walk into a faculty meeting and see a sea of nondiverse faces. We should value to an even greater extent first -generation faculty/staff/administrators. It is important for first gen students to be taught by/counseled by first gen faculty/staff/administrators.\" Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Training and Training Quality . One theme that emerged from Faculty respondents was a need for diversity, equity, and inclusion training. Respondents stated, \"Develop a workshop series where faculty and BIPOC students can discuss and develop concrete tools for creating a classroom environment that is both welcoming/inclusive and facilitates an open dialogue of diverse viewpoints,\" and \"We ne ed trainings for faculty that go beyond the surface level of what we've already received. We need facilitated opportunities for the really difficult conversations about how to handle racism in our classrooms, conflict between students and between students and faculty, and how to handle racism/classism in our own hiring practices. We also need to work more with students around resolving conflict and building community. The inter -student conflicts this year have seemed particularly toxic.\" Respondents also di scussed varying levels of effectiveness depending on quality and format of these trainings. Respondents explained, \"I don't think one -time trainings help. Toolkits let people deal with these issues in their own time. However, repeated opportunities to prob lem-solve on these issues would be helpful, perhaps from different angles or using specific simulations . And a few of these should be mandatory because otherwise we preach to the choir...\" and \"One frustration I have is with the quality of some of the traini ngs focused on diversity, equity, and subjects like Title IX compliance. Some (particularly those handled by [Center for Worklife Law staff ]are informative and done well. For many, the subject matter is important but I don't learn much of anything.\" Other respondents echoed these concerns about quality, \"We need sophisticated training not on diversity, equity and inclusion but on UNCONSCIOUS bias which is everywhere at the institution,\" and \"DEI training is sometimes helpful if done correctly. I think highl y of the trainings [Center for Worklife Law staff ] leads... I feel there has been a lot of somewhat generic training lately and that the overall effect is for people to tune out. For faculty, I would prefer a model of academic inquiry that allows us to debat e advantages and disadvantages of anti -racism as a conceptual framework and classroom tool.\" .\" Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 253 Most Appreciated Aspects of UC Hastings Law When asked what was the most appreciated aspects of UC Hastings Law, 75% ( n = 64) of Faculty respondents indicated t hat they most appreciated the student body (Table 130).

Rankin & Associates Consulting , LLC Campus Climate Assessment Project UC Hastings College of the Law Full Report 255 Moving Forward Embarking on this campus -wide assessment is further evidence of UC Hastings Law 's commitment to ensuring that all members of the community work, learn, and live in an environment that nurtures a culture of inclusiveness and respect. The primary purpose of this assessment was to investigate the climate within UC Hastings Law and to shed light on respondents' personal experiences and observatio ns of living, learning, and working at UC Hastings Law . The results add empirical data to the current knowledge base and provide more information on the experiences and perceptions of the community as a whole and of the various identity groups within the UC Hastings Law community. As part of its response to COV ID-19, the federal government designated colleges and universities as essential and, as such, higher education must continue to serve its students and employees and society at -large. UC Hastings Law 's \"Assessment of Climate for Learning, Living, and Workin g\" was under taken during throes of the COVID -19 pandemic , as colleges and universities shutter ed their campuses or adapted to hybrid models of learning and working . Certainly , these circumstances have influenced the recent experiences of UC Hastings Law 's community of students, faculty, and staff members and have been noted, to an extent, in this report. Assessments and reports, however, are not enough to effect change. Developing a s trategic actions and implementation plan is critical to improving the cam pus climate , even as institutions of higher education grapple with emotional, financial , and other operational challenges resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic . UC Hastings Law will want to use the assessment data to build on the successes and address the challenges uncovered in the report to follow through with its commitment at the outset of the project . R&A encourages the CESWG and the UC Hastings Law community to develop and undertake two or three measurable action items based on the findings in this report. Furthermore, UC Hastings Law may choose to repeat t he assessment process at regular intervals to respond to the ever-changing climate and to assess the influence of the actions initiated as a result of the current assessment .

Any comments that participants provide are also separated at submission so that comments are not attributed to any individual demographic characteristics. Anonymous quotes from submitted comments may be included in the final report to give \"voice\" to the quantitative data, but only after ensuring comments don't include identifying information. Depending on what you say, others who know you may be able to attribute certain commen ts to you. In insta nces where certain comments might be attributable to an individual, Rankin & Associates will make every effort to de - identify those comments or will remove the comments from the analyses. Individuals will not be identified and only group data will be repor ted. Rankin & Associates will not report any group data for groups of fewer than five individuals to protect confidentiality.
