Young adults are currently more stressed than any other generation. An online survey called 'Stress in America' reported an average stress level of 5.4 out of 10 among 18 to 33-year-olds (Hagen & Nayar, 2014; American Psychological Association, 2021). When young adults such as these become parents, they may transmit their tension to their children. In addition, children may internalize stress and hide distress from their parents to keep them from worrying. With high levels of stress becoming a norm in younger households, instilling positive coping mechanisms in an educational setting benefits students, their parents, and future generations. For that reason, we are specifically going to look at the concept of offering yoga in education and whether this approach instills stress relief mechanisms and improves self-regulation. Before you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Positive Psychology Exercises for free. These science-based exercises explore fundamental aspects of positive psychology, including strengths, values, and self-compassion, and will give you the tools to enhance the wellbeing of your clients, students, or employees. The implementation of a daily yoga practice in the classroom has specific benefits in school settings, such as reducing stress and bullying behaviors (Thomas & Centeio, 2020). Students come to school with a variety of different experiences and mindsets based on their living situations and biological predispositions. And because of difficulties they experience, children and adolescents can internalize their stressors to help deal with self-imposed expectations placed on them by their circumstances. Having yoga as an option to help reduce stress and learn mindfulness may be able to help students respond better to stressful situations. Why Is Yoga Important in Schools? 6 Benefits Practicing yoga daily in school facilitates improvement in mental, social, and physical wellbeing, minimizing self-destructive behaviors in the classroom and reducing stress among students (Chen & Pauwels, 2014). Other positive outcomes that daily yoga practice offers are listed below (Hagen & Nayar, 2014). Improved concentration and memory Practicing daily yoga can help children, specifically those with attention issues, have increased focus. As a result, their concentration, memory, and academic performance can improve, as yoga requires you to focus heavily on the moment. Respect for peers and others Since yoga requires you to be aware of your surroundings, it can help facilitate respect for others, as everyone's practice is unique and self-directed. Self-regulation Improving self-regulation can help children with their emotions. The pace of yoga allows for children to take the time to identify the emotions they are experiencing and implement strategies to regulate them. Self-confidence Since yoga focuses on deep breathing and other breathing exercises, it increases a child's ability to remain calm by increasing oxygen flow to the brain. This makes it more likely that children can stay calm, which can result in increased self-confidence, since it is less likely they will be dominated by negative emotions. Feeling of wellbeing As yoga increases a child's self-confidence and ability to self-regulate, children are more likely to experience higher levels of general wellbeing. Physical fitness Yoga specifically helps improve posture and muscular control. These components help with physical fitness, as it allows children to be more aware of their body and increase physical strength. Children's mental health and yoga: 3 Research findings Several research studies have highlighted the benefits of yoga in improving mental and physical health. Specific improvements that are significant to classroom settings include improved outcomes in behavior, stress reduction, and emotional balance. To help test outcomes in classroom settings, researchers will often incorporate daily yoga interventions over a period of a few months to a year to study the impact on children's mental health. Butzer et al. (2015) and Chen and Pauwels (2014) both incorporated 15-minute yoga activities daily. Butzer et al. (2015) reported improvements in second- and third-graders' behavior, specifically in attention span and the ability to focus on work and stay on task. They also noted improvements in social-emotional learning. Chen and Pauwels (2014) implemented the Yoga Ed Tools for Teachers program for a full year for approximately 5-15 minutes per day. Results showed that daily yoga practice improved student mental, social, and physical wellbeing. These emotional indicators suggest that students who practice yoga may feel less stressed and more resilient when confronted with stressful situations. Overall, yoga was found to be an excellent remedy for reducing negative emotions and distress in children. Last, Telles et al. (2019) studied adolescents between the ages of 11 and 15 as they engaged in an 18-minute pranayama yoga intervention for three days. Even though the intervention time was short, there was significant improvement noted in attention and general anxiety reduction. These results indicated that yoga helps promote overall emotional balance. Although research provides generalized benefits, there are more specific benefits associated with integrating yoga into your classroom outlined in the next section. Creating Yoga Programs and Lesson Plans Although yoga benefits children, especially in classroom settings, it may be overwhelming for teachers to get started. Integrating a new activity into daily routines and lesson plans can be challenging, especially when there are so many other curricular initiatives that need to be covered. Similar to planning other lessons, it is important for teachers to lay the groundwork for the lesson. Identifying areas of the curriculum that highlight emotional awareness and then looking at areas where your students would most benefit are good first steps. Another tactic is to do a stage activity with your students to see if they can identify what situations trigger difficult emotions and what the sensations are. Our My Feelings My Body worksheet is an excellent starting point in helping children identify the sensations in their body and how they are reacting to them. When making your lesson plans, add in reminders relevant to the pace and students' ability to engage fully in their practice (Myers, n.d.). Make sure you are starting with easier poses and work your way up to more difficult ones. Once you've decided what kind of yoga practice you are integrating into your classroom, make sure you are making notes where you remind students to breathe or take a break. That way, you can use these cues to help you and your students stay on track and derive the most meaning from classroom yoga. How to Teach Yoga to Children in Schools If you are interested in integrating yoga into your daily classroom activities but need help to get started, check out the tips below (adapted from Action for Healthy Kids, n.d.). Create a space and choose a consistent time to practice Designate a time for yoga practice and add it to your class's daily schedule. Always begin with a shorter session and move any furniture necessary to allow children to spread out. Plan your lessons with intention Teachers should consider the purpose of integrating daily yoga into the classroom. By coming up with a theme or emotional purpose (e.g., having a daily emotional goal), children can work toward something. Including visualization and breathing exercises will also help children work toward the goals you are setting. Integrate opportunities for relationship and community building among peers Yoga does not have to be an individual practice all the time. Incorporating cooperative games where children help each other and engage in visualization activities as a group can help with community building and increase trust among classmates. Use resources If you're overwhelmed, don't be afraid to ask your colleagues for help. This article will also provide you with several books, online courses, activities, and exercises you can use in your classroom when getting started. Which yoga is best for mental health? Although all types of yoga can be beneficial in improving mental health, hatha yoga has been proven to have the most significant impact on reducing anxiety and stress. It improves chronic fatigue, general self-esteem, general wellbeing, and quality of life (Taspinar et al., 2014). Unlike other types of yoga that are more vigorous, hatha yoga focuses on simple positions with lots of time for breathing and meditation. Due to its simplicity and ease of integration for individuals of all fitness levels, this type of yoga is the easiest type to integrate into different settings. When practicing hatha yoga with children, there are some non-movement-based strategies that can be integrated into daily practice, such as the following (adapted from Integral Yoga Magazine, n.d.): Singing/chanting Students can simply chant 'ohm' at the beginning and end of their practice. 'Ohm' is a sacred chant of the universe that helps them recognize their connection to other living creatures and the universe. Students should try to make the 'ohm' sound from their throat and feel free to say it as loud as they want to. Mental body scans Get students to close their eyes and focus on one body part at a time. Start from the top of their head to the tips of their toes and get them to tighten, then relax, every individual part. Story telling Reading a story to children at the end of their practice, while they keep their eyes closed and relax, will allow them to reflect on the story being told. Brief meditation Teachers can play soothing music or a meditation script for children and allow them to follow the prompts provided or reflect on a central question. When integrating yoga in the classroom, there are several activities, poses, and exercises that you can introduce to your students. The activities, poses, and exercises mentioned below are especially easy to integrate into the classroom environment. Activities When integrating yoga, it is important to have activities that introduce this concept. A good introduction to yoga is by having a \"be well\" discussion every morning after all the students arrive. Teachers can choose a central theme for the discussion that focuses on daily routines that help improve health, such as getting enough sleep, drinking water, and having a healthy diet. The discussion can also be centered on spreading positivity such as gratitude, good citizenship, and being a peacemaker. Having this discussion will help put students in a positive mindset, which makes them more open to the calming mindset that yoga requires. Take 5-10 minutes throughout the day for self-directed relaxation time. During this time, students can engage in quiet mindfulness and reflection activities, such as journaling, coloring, and listening to a guided meditation story. After doing this self-directed reflection activity, children can start their daily yoga in a good mindset. It is best to integrate these activities at the beginning of the day or after recess so that students are refreshed and have an empty slate to engage in relaxation and meaningful reflection. After engaging in these activities, teachers should start integrating yoga poses and exercises to keep the practice consistent. Poses and exercises The poses and exercises teachers choose to integrate depend on how much space they have in their classroom and the focus they have chosen for their students. To help teachers get started, we have provided five simple poses for students' yoga practice. The poses are organized in a flow sequence so students can move easily from one pose to the next. Teachers should demonstrate the poses in real time or hold up a picture of what they should look like. Make sure children are doing the poses on both sides and holding each pose for at least one minute, focusing on their breathing. Mountain pose Instructions: Get children to stand straight with their arms at their sides with their palms facing outward. Descriptors: Stand tall like a tree with your shoulders back, palms facing up. Extension: Ask children to raise their hands above their head parallel to their ears with palms open. Tree pose Instructions: From the mountain pose, get children to transfer their weight to one side. They will then place the bottom of one foot on the inside of the opposite thigh or calf (avoid the knee). Ask children to place their palms together in a praying position at their chest. Descriptors: Stand tall like a tree, make a bike stand with one of your feet, and place your hands in a praying position. Extension: More flexible children can extend their leg up to their thigh and raise their hands above their head (similar to mountain pose extension). Warrior pose Instructions: From the tree pose, move into a lunge position with one foot back and one forward. Get children to bend their front knee and hold their palms in a praying position over their head with their arms straight. They can then look up toward the sky. Descriptors: Move into a runner's lunge. Turn your front foot forward like you are running and press both hands together over your head. Extension: Spread arms parallel at their sides like a plane. Cat/Cow pose Instructions: Get children to move onto their hands and knees with their arms straight and legs arm's length apart. Get them to tuck their head and arch their back. Descriptors: Get down on all fours like a baby who is learning to crawl. Tuck your head in between your arms and lift your spine up like a cat waiting to pounce. Extension: Get children to lift their heads and lift their bottom up. Child's pose Instructions: Begin on all fours in a tabletop position. Get children to push their arms forward alongside their torso, palms facing down. Descriptors: Lower down to the floor and put your arms and legs in a table position. Push your arms forward as far as you can with your arms straight and relax. Extension: Children can start on their knees and push forward with their arms. Teacher Trainings in Yoga for Children With a growing number of yoga training options for teachers, choosing the right program to suit your classroom is important. When looking for a training provider, consider the following: Is the style of yoga a good fit for your class? There are many styles of yoga that vary in speed, technique, and underlying theory. Be sure to choose to train in a style that will suit the educational aims of your class (e.g., emotion regulation, improving physical strength). Is the training suited to your age group? Kids will benefit more from a classroom yoga program when the poses are at a difficulty level suited to their age. Be sure to keep this in mind and select a course that includes the foundational basics. Is it formally accredited? To ensure you're getting the highest quality training, consider looking for a training provider recognized or accredited by a formal association or body, such as Yoga Alliance. Another tip for finding good in-person training is to take a class with the trainer beforehand. That way, you can see if their teaching style is likely to suit you and the needs of your classroom. 3 Education requirements Most teacher trainings in yoga do not require any additional requirements except to be a teacher. These depend on where teachers are located and working across the world. At a minimum, teachers are required to have: A three or four-year bachelor's degree Training in a teacher education program or a Bachelor of Education License or registration with an accredited organization that certifies them to teach in their country of residence It may also be beneficial for teachers pursuing this pathway to have a health and physical education background, since yoga is rooted in movement and healthy living. 3 Best Courses and Online Training Options Many reputable courses are available for teachers to help develop their skills integrating yoga in the classroom.

Take a look at the following free resources from our site: Meditation Grounding Scripts for Children This reference sheet includes two guided meditations, useful for helping calm a class of students. Two versions of the meditation are provided to suit different age groups. Deep Breathing for Kids This script is a great warm-up to a yoga lesson. Across 11 steps, it teaches children the value of deep, calm breathing for soothing intense emotion and inducing calm. Teaching Others About Mindfulness This worksheet helps children plan a lesson to teach their peers about mindfulness. Through the exercise, students will consider how to explain the benefits of mindfulness and recommend techniques and resources to their peers. When I'm Scared... This worksheet may be a useful supplement to a lesson about emotions and the body. It helps children explore what it feels like when they are afraid and sets the stage for a discussion about yoga as a tool for emotion regulation. Children are being brought up in an increasingly fast-paced world with new and more complex stressors. Yoga is one avenue for kids to learn to handle such stressors while also being a great form of physical activity. When taught well, yoga can be a powerful tool to help children discover the interaction between a healthy body and mind. Educators, therefore, have an opportunity in the classroom to introduce kids to one such pathway to wellness - one that also happens to benefit learning and classroom management. We hope you've found the poses and activities explored throughout this post useful or that they've inspired you to consider yoga in your classroom.
