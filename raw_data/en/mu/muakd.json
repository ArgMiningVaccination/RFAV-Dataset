Please go to Substack to read full article. For those of you new to this page, my name is Molly and I am an herbalist. I have been studying and practicing the beautiful art of herbal medicine for over 9 years (one year away from my master certification!). I took a leaf of faith and wrote this post to give readers a crash course into herbalism. Although it takes so much thyme to learn, we will just skim the surface and I will offer some basic education on the art of herbal medicine. Hopefully this will give you some encourage-mint to sow the seeds of your mind to learn more about herbalism. My background A little background on my experience, I began my journey in 2014, when I took a plant-based healing course at the University of Vermont with my first herbal mentor Barbara Raab. I fell in love with the subject and my teacher noticed I had an affinity for it. She recommended me to [Urban Moonshine](https://www.urbanmoonshine.com/) as a production intern. From there, I started studying in university and doing outside courses with mentors such as Rosemary Gladstar and Guido Mas\u00e9. After graduation, I spent the summer being an apprentice with my herbal teacher Kate Westdijk at Spoonful Herbals. From there, I went back to California, became a self-taught wild forager and got deeper into my herbal training for many years to come. I am now a certified clinical herbalist and have worked in New Zealand, Australia and run my own private practice. I also consult for herbal companies, especially on their content marketing and product teams. I have taught courses and gotten deeper into my relationship to the plant kingdom.

Herbal medicine, or herbalism, is the art and science of using plants to support health and wellness. It draws from ancient herbal knowledge to grow with modern medicine and research. Plants have safely been used for thousands of years, with origin of use dating back to almost 60,000 years ago. Why use herbs? Herbs can be more easily assimilated in the body than pharmaceuticals because they are biologically more natural complex compounds. This means the body can recognize and absorb them with fewer side effects compared to pharmaceuticals. \"Herbs act on multiple targets, unlike some synthetic drugs that target only one molecule while their effects on other molecules in the pathways or systems are unknown\" (Tao, 2005). This is where the question of safety comes into play with prescription drugs since they can cause chemical imbalances and severe side effects in the body. Another reason to trust herbal medicine is because it focuses on the overall chronic or acute condition of the individual. It gets to the root cause of an ailment, rather than the allopathic Western approach, which simply minimizes symptoms. A trained herbalist is able to uncover the root of a disease by addressing the entire human being, looking into the five components of a person's health - physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual. Herbs can then be used to gently support the body to boost immunity, manage stress, lower inflammation, support liver detoxification, and nourish tissues to name a few. Herbalism is a safe way to enhance the span and quality of life. Herbal energetics Herbal energetics are the major constituents that give herbs their various actions that can be detected using human senses. This observation and detection are what modern western herbalist call energetics. Herbs can be divided into energetic categories, based on their taste constituents and basic affects on the body. The energetics properties of herbs blend together to create thousands of unique, herbal profiles. How herbs effect energy production Warming refers to herbs that stimulate or speed up metabolism, increase energy production and warmth, and bring blood flow and vitality to tissues that are pale and cool. Cooling refers to herbs that sedate or slow down metabolism to decrease energy production while cooling or soothing irritation, and redness. Neutral describes herbs that are neither warm nor cool. They do not have a strong effect on circulation or cellular metabolism. How herbs affect the density of tissues Moistening refers to herbs that increase the moisture content of tissues, which means they lubricate and soften dry, bristle or hardened tissues. Drying refers to herbs that remove excess fluid from the tissue, causing it to become more firm and dense, relieving conditions of dampness and swelling. Balancing is the term we use for herbs that normalize tissues that are either damp or dry, helping to balance the amount of moisture and solids (minerals) within the tissues. How herbs affect, muscle tone, flow and secretion Constricting refers to herbs that increase the tone or tension within muscles and other tissues, which stops excess flow and secretion. These herbs tone up tissues that have become overly relaxed or weak and that are leaking or secreting fluid, such as blood or mucus. Relaxing refers to herbs that relax muscle cramps and spasms, relieving access tension in the tissues. This promotes easier flow and movement and can help to increase deficient secretion. Nourishing is the term we use for herbs that provide essential nutrients that aid tissue healing, improving tissue structure and function.

Herbal actions are essential to formulating medicine and understanding how herbs interact with humans. For example, Honeysuckle's herbal actions include: astringent, depurative, diuretic, expectorant, anti-bacterial, anti-viral. An herbal property is used to describe herbal actions in more detail, often to further describe the herb's qualities and attributes. For example, Balmony encourages the flow of bile with an action called cholagogue. However, it is has a gentle property to it, as opposed to Yellow Dock. So, it can be classified as a gentle cholagogue.

They are the voodoo practitioners, witch doctors, medicine women, and indigenous people of color first. Many of the remedies we know and love come from traditional indigenous knowledge. We must honor that, but also decolonize our ancestral past. Many of these amazing plants have been stolen for capitalist gain. So, it is important we recognize our privilege and work to respect the people and wisdom that was passed to us. Let's also empower all herbalists of color, race, gender and sexual orientation, including queer herbalists, trans herbalists. HERBALISM IS FOR EVERYONE. Recommended resources Consider an apprenticeship Go outside and spend time with the plants Start gardening Training Through training my current assistant/apprentice, we will be exploring both the scientific and spiritual side of herbalism. My teaching style focuses on not only the energetics of the plants, but of the herbalist as well. My current apprentice is a kinesthetic learner, so a lot of our work will be using the five senses with creative projects, medicine making and direct plant quality time. (of course readings and assignments are always needed as well to enhance our knowledge and help us grow as learners) If you are curious how we are approaching training, feel free to reach out to me directly!
