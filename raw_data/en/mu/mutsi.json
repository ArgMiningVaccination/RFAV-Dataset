Aspartic acid (H2asp), enantiopure, racemic and meso tartaric acid (H2tart), di-para-toluyltartaric acid (H2dptta) and dibenzoyltartaric acid (H2dbta) represent environmentally benign water-soluble proligands which may be deprotonated for oxygen coordination. Chelating ligands such as tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and 2-aminomethylpyridine (AMPY) efficiently reduce the dimensionality of the target compounds, and additional aqua ligands complete the coordination environments. In this line of argument, the discrete mononuclear complexes [Cu(AMPY)(asp)(H2O)] and [Cu(Hdbta)2(H2O)4] were obtained; for the latter, only a preliminary structure model can be presented which, however, agrees with the powder diffraction pattern of the bulk. From enantiopure and racemic tartaric acid and TMEDA the closely related chain polymers [CuII(H2tart)(TMEDA)(H2O)2)]n were obtained; the racemic compound consists of individual homochiral strands of opposite chirality. The high steric demand of di-para-toluyltartaric acid leads to one-dimensional [Cu(dptta)(EtOH)(H2O)2]n with coordinated ethanol (EtOH) in the distant Jahn-Teller site of the coordination sphere. Cu(II), meso-tartaric acid and TMEDA aggregate to a trinuclear coordination compound [CuII2CuI(H2tart)(Htart)(TMEDA)2]. Its peripheral cations show the expected Jahn-Teller geometry of Cu(II), but the unambiguous assignment of the oxidation state +I for central cation required susceptibility measurements: their results prove the presence of only two and only very weakly interacting divalent cations, separated by a diamagnetic center.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-06-06", "cleaned_text": "Coordination Compounds Featuring Non-Toxic Chiral 1,4-Dicarboxylic Acids and Copper(II) [https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst10060485](https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst10060485) [A 10 Years Journey: Chemical, Physical, and Biological Properties and Applications of Crystals]( /journal/crystals/special_issues/10-Year_Crystals )) Abstract: [3](#B3-crystals-10-00485)] acetate and established the monohapto, chelating and bridging coordination modes, respectively, for the carboxylato ligand in these solids. Carboxylic acids may also act as bridging building blocks in coordination polymers (CPs) [ [4](#B4-crystals-10-00485)]. Among the many potentially attractive properties of CPs, we have focused on their dynamic responses to external stimuli such as temperature [ [5](#B5-crystals-10-00485), [6](#B6-crystals-10-00485), [7](#B7-crystals-10-00485), [8](#B8-crystals-10-00485)] or moisture [ [9](#B9-crystals-10-00485), [10](#B10-crystals-10-00485)] in previous publications. In order to be really useful beyond basic research, the constituents of such dynamic materials should show low toxicity. Many carboxylic acids are found in the GRAS list, i.e., among the substances generally recognized as safe, e.g., by the FDA [ [11](#B11-crystals-10-00485)]. Carboxylic acids often show good solubility in water, and the chiral pool provides inexpensive and efficient access to a relevant number of enantiopure compounds. Amino acids meet the latter requirement par excellence, and their coordination chemistry has been investigated extensively even more prone to act as bridging components than their monofunctional congeners and have been frequently employed for the construction of coordination polymers [ [39](#B39-crystals-10-00485), [40](#B40-crystals-10-00485)] and metal-organic frameworks [ [41](#B41-crystals-10-00485)]. In this contribution, we introduce six new coordination compounds in which dicarboxylic acids act as terminal ligands or as linkers between divalent Cu cations, and we address the influence of chirality and the effect of blocking ligands on their crystal structures. [Figure 1](#crystals-10-00485-f001)provides a summary of the reactions and the structurally characterized products. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Compound 1 [Figure 2](#crystals-10-00485-f002)). The main complex molecule occupies a general position in the orthorhombic space group P21212 and features a strongly Jahn-Teller distorted pseudo-octahedron about the Cu(II) cation. [43](#B43-crystals-10-00485)]), the structures are deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database [ [44](#B44-crystals-10-00485)] under these six letter reference codes), 4,4-bipyridine S1.3.1](#app1-crystals-10-00485). [Table bonds. In addition, neighboring molecules along [0 1 0] interact via stacking, with shortest C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances of 3.4 \u00c5. 2.2. Compound 2a the resulting hydrogen bond bonds. 2.3. Compound 2b trinuclear complex: and the bridging hydroxy O4 and their symmetry equivalents lead to a necessarily planar and almost regular all-oxygen coordination about Cu1. The peripheral Cu cations interact with the second carboxylato moiety and both of the tartrate and N,N chelating TMEDA ligand in an overall distorted square-pyramidal coordination. A comparable tartrate coordination about Cu(II), with carboxylato O in the Jahn-Teller positions, has been found by H\u00f6rner and Kl\u00fcfers [ [51](#B51-crystals-10-00485)]. Additional contacts occur between the Cu cations and significantly more distant O atoms; not only the interatomic separations of 3 \u00c5 but also the angles subtended at the transition metal allow to exclude them from the coordination sphere ( [Figure 6](#crystals-10-00485-f006)). [Table S10](#app1-crystals-10-00485)summarizes all hydrogen bonds. [Figure 7](#crystals-10-00485-f007)as vs. T plot at and vs. B plot at . The product and the magnetization M allow to retrieve information about the effective magnetic moment of open-shell cations involved and about their interaction. At , the value of is , which is well within the expected range of two, but not three non-interacting Cu(II) centers ( per Cu(II) center [ [52](#B52-crystals-10-00485)]). Upon cooling the compound, the values continuously decrease reaching at , and subsequently drop off to at . Therefore, the vs. T plot reveals an almost spin-like behavior and, due to the drop off at low temperatures at such a small field, a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two Cu(II) centers, while the magnetic anisotropy should be rather small. In addition, the molar magnetization as a function of the applied field B at is in agreement with this observation: is linear up to and increases with decreasing slope up to . At this field, the magnetization reaches without being saturated. This value is below the saturation value of about estimated from the value at using per single center. Since additionally the linear part can be observed over a rather wide range at this temperature (about the double of non-interacting centers), the magnetization data suggest an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between two Cu(II) centers. We use an effective isotropic Hamiltonian () to estimate the magnetic properties of the compound, and consider the deviation from the ideal spin-like system by a temperature independent paramagnetic contribution () to the magnetic susceptibility [ [52](#B52-crystals-10-00485)]. The least-squares fit yields the red lines shown in [Figure 7](#crystals-10-00485-f007)and the parameters per Cu(II) center as well as and . These parameters confirm a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two Cu(II) centers with a common g-factor. Therefore, the magnetic data exclude three Cu(II) centers in 2b, and the third copper center has to be of diamagnetic nature, e.g., Cu(I) or low spin Cu(III). [Figure 8](#crystals-10-00485-f008)) confirms the correspondence between the single crystal structure and the bulk, we must take the result of the susceptibility measurements into account for our structure model. The central Cu1 can therefore not be assigned oxidation state +II. The higher oxidation number +III would require additional de-protonation of the tartrate ligand. However, the only available site carrying a potentially acidic hydrogen, O3, donates this H atoms in a short O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O contact. In addition, low spin Cu(III) coordinated by four weak ligands is unprecedented, and tartaric acid should be considered a reducing rather than an oxidizing agent. In contrast, the alternative formulation of the trinuclear aggregate as [CuII2CuI(meso-H2tart)(meso-Htart)(TMEDA)2] is compatible with all known facts: (a) the disordered proton on O4 is not involved in any short contact. (b) Cu(I) is a popular coordination center in the presence of weak ligands. (c) An aqueous solution of an amine and tartaric acid may well be responsible for partial reduction to a mixed-valent copper complex. [Figure 9](#crystals-10-00485-f009). Complexation by the dicarboxylic acid and the N,N chelating ligand results in higher extinction and a shift of the absorption maximum. The latter corresponds to a visible color change from azure blue for copper acetate to a more navy blue hue during the reaction and to the color of the solid target product 2b. 2.4. Compound 2c [Figure 10](#crystals-10-00485-f010): Both the Cu(II) cation and the midpoint of the C2-C2 bond in the tartrate anion are located on two-fold crystallographic axes, and hence polymer strand is homochiral. Crystallographic inversion in the orthorhombic space group Pccn necessarily implies an overall racemic structure, with neighboring strands of opposite chirality. [Table S11](#app1-crystals-10-00485)summarizes all hydrogen bonds. 2.5. Compound 3a [Figure Cu(II) center is five-coordinated, with ligands O11 and O10 and by the carboxylate O atoms O8 and O8 in equatorial and the ethanol O atom O9 in apical position. The crystal structure is stabilized by a maximum of O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds which connect the constituents to layers in the (0 0 1) plane. [Table S12](#app1-crystals-10-00485)summarizes the classical hydrogen bonds. Adjacent H-bonded layers interact along [0 0 1] via T stacking, with shortest C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distances of 3.7 \u00c5. 2.6. Compound 3b [Figure 12](#crystals-10-00485-f012)). We will repeat diffraction experiments on smaller crystals of this compound at a synchrotron source. We note, however, that the powder pattern of the bulk closely corresponds to the simulation based on our incomplete and preliminary model ( [Figure 13](#crystals-10-00485-f013)). [Figure 14](#crystals-10-00485-f014)) almost coincide. 3. Conlusions: Structural Trends and Construction Principles [53](#B53-crystals-10-00485)]. AMPY in 1 and several alternative chelates mentioned above block the extension along the chain and lead to discrete complexes. In contrast to the idea of dimensional reduction [ [54](#B54-crystals-10-00485)] outlined below, the aminodicarboxylate adopts a different binding mode about the Cu(II) center. catena-(bis-\u00b5-hydrogenoxalato)diaqua-bis(hydrogenoxalato)dicopper(II) hexahydrate [ [56](#B56-crystals-10-00485)] Succinic represents the simplest 1,4-dicarboxylic acid. In combination with Cu(II), it allows for extended structures in one dimension [ [58](#B58-crystals-10-00485), [59](#B59-crystals-10-00485)] and for higher dimensional networks [ [60](#B60-crystals-10-00485), [61](#B61-crystals-10-00485)]. Obviously, the large substituents in di-para-toluyltartrate restrict the connectivity in the structure of 3a to extension in one dimension. [54](#B54-crystals-10-00485)]. Simply spoken, it suggests to cut out sections of higher-dimensional frameworks, leading to aggregates of lower dimensionality which retain essential features of the coordination. This concept provides insight into our solids 2a and 2c derived from enantiopure and racemic tartaric acid, respectively. The close relationship between 2a and 2c has already been explained: 2a is based on enantiopure tartrate and, hence, necessarily homochiral. The racemic analogue 2c is composed of homochiral strands of opposite chirality. In both solids, each tartrate dianion acts as a bridging chelate, with each carboxylate and its neighboring hydroxy group coordinating a Cu(II) cation. This coordination is highlighted by the rectangular frame around the ligand in [Figure 10](#crystals-10-00485-f010)and occurs in a related compound: the reaction product of enantiopure tartrate and Cu(II) without additional chelating 2 H2O]n [ [62](#B62-crystals-10-00485)] is a two-dimensional solid and shows very similar bridging functionality for the dicarboxylate. In 2a and 2c, the blocking ligand TMEDA reduces the connectivity from 2D to 1D. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Synthesis and Crystallization 4.1.1. Compound 1 4.1.2. Compounds 2a/b/c [Figure 8](#crystals-10-00485-f008)), however, confirms that the microcrystalline solid corresponds to the established structure. Elemental analysis calculated for 2c: [Cu(rac-H2tart)(TMEDA)]n \u00b7 2 H2O: C powder patterns confirmed that bulk and single crystals essentially share the same structure. The monoclinic angle in 2a is very close to 90; a very small temperature-dependent increase of this angle will result in a pronounced separation of the (at 100 K almost co-inciding) reflections 1 1 1 and 1 1 -1 around 2 ca. 18. This effect is explained in [Figure S2](#app1-crystals-10-00485). The powder pattern ( [Figure 13](#crystals-10-00485-f013)) also confirms that the basic structural features of our preliminary structure model for 3b are correct. 4.2. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction 4.2.1. Data Collection [63](#B63-crystals-10-00485)] and a multi-scan adsorption correction was performed using SADABS [ [64](#B64-crystals-10-00485)]. Intensity data for 2a, 2c and 3a were collected at the beamline P24 at PETRA-III of the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg. Measurements were performed on a kappa diffractometer with a Dectris PILATUS3 X CdTe for Synchrotron [65](#B65-crystals-10-00485), [66](#B66-crystals-10-00485)] was used for reflection harvesting, unit cell determination and integration of the data. 4.2.2. Structure Solution and Refinement [67](#B67-crystals-10-00485)] and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2, using all independent reflections [ [68](#B68-crystals-10-00485)]. Crystal data, data collection parameters and convergence results for the single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments have been summarized in [Table S1](#app1-crystals-10-00485). Non-hydrogen atoms were assigned anisotropic displacement parameters unless stated otherwise. H atoms attached to carbon were introduced into calculated positions and treated as riding, with isotropic displacement parameters constrained to multiples of Ueq of their parent atom. Where data quality was sufficient, hydrogen atoms attached to N or O were refined freely. Further details of structure refinements are available in the Supporting Information.
