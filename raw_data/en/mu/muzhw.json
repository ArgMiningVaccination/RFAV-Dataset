Most children receive the recommended vaccinations, but disparities remain. zzduring the covid-19 pandemic, children have missed routine well-child care and related vaccinations. if vaccination rates decline below levels required to maintain herd immunity, dangerous outbreaks of preventable diseases could follow. zzit is urgent that children and adolescents catch up on missed vaccinations now to protect themselves and their communities before they return to school, camp, sports, and other in-person settings. immediately addressing missed routine vaccines may also help streamline the widespread implementation of a covid-19 vaccination strategy for children and adolescents. zzPublic education campaigns about the need to catch up on missed vaccinations as well as their safety and efficacy, together with close coordination between state and local health departments, schools, and other partners, can help increase childhood vaccination rates quickly. zzat the federal level, improvements to the v accines for children program would help the program work more efficiently and reach additional children with vaccines at no cost, consequently narrowing gaps in vaccination rates by race, ethnicity, family income, and insurance status.Introduction vaccines are a safe and effective method of reducing the burden of infectious disease. on an individual level, they prevent severe illness, death, and long-term consequences of disease such as neurological disorders. on the community level, they forestall dangerous outbreaks of infectious disease and save money that would otherwise be spent on treating preventable illnesses.1 children who receive vaccines on the recommended schedule protect themselves and their communities while also decreasing future health care costs. 2 the advisory committee on immunization Practices (aciP) provides a list of recommended vaccines that guide immunization schedules for children, adolescents, and adults.3 the negative impact of covid-19 on well- child visits and routine childhood vaccination threatens to exacerbate the spread of preventable diseases and requires urgent attention. By 2019, an estimated 70.5 percent of children born in 2016 and 2017 were up to date on the seven-vaccine series recommended by aciP for young children. 4 however, this rate varied by race and ethnicity, poverty level, and insurance status (see Figure 1). Black, non-hispanic children were the least likely to receive all vaccines in the series (65.8 percent), while asian, non-hispanic children were the most likely (75.1 percent).5 compared to 76.9 percent of privately insured children, only 65.7 percent of children covered by Medicaid were up to date, a disturbing disparity that is perhaps partially explained by socioeconomic barriers.6 only 62 percent of children below poverty had received the recommended vaccines, while 74.1 percent of all other children had received the full series.7 in 2019, under- vaccinated communities contributed to measles outbreaks across the United states (U.s.), leading to the highest number of cases seen nationwide since 1992.8 2 action on childhood vaccinations July 2021 a decrease in vaccination rates could result in fewer communities reaching her d immunity for preventable diseases. a locality achieves herd immunity when the spread of an infectious disease is unlikely because a certain percentage of the population is immune to the disease. the percentage necessary to achieve herd immunity for each disease varies based on the level of infectiousness; these estimated thresholds guide vaccination requirements to ensure every community remains healthy (see table 1).

While visits to providers' offices fell by 58 percent for all age groups in the last week of March 2020 compared to the beginning of the month, visits for young children ages three to five dropped 75 percent\u2014the largest decline seen by any age group. 10 in June, the number of visits started to incr ease again, but by the end of 2020, pediatric office visits remained 24 percent lower than baseline levels (see table 2).11 Researchers estimate that there was a cumulative 27 percent decline in pediatric office visits over the course of 2020. 12 these declines in utilization cr eate financial challenges for the pediatric delivery system and threaten children's timely access to needed care.

By February 2021, data from Michigan showed that more than half the state's counties were below the target 70 percent vaccination rate for young children, with some even dipping below 60 percent. 22 Further, indicating that the path to rebuilding community protection is far from assured, multiple waves and new variants of covid-19 have led to significant spikes in virus transmission rates, leading some states and localities to impose, loosen, and re-impose restrictions on movement and gathering.23 Without an intentional effort to Pediatricians Family Physicians Patients' Loss of Health Insurance Coverage Patient and/or Parent Financial Concerns Figure 2.

Providers and advocates should start by highlighting the precautions pediatric practices have put in place to ensure patient safety during visits. Pediatricians have made changes such as removing toys and seating from their waiting room, mandating that all staff and visitors wear masks, and separating sick- and well-child visit times and locations. 25 some practices have even started offering drive-through vaccination appointments for children.26 Parents will likely be more at ease bringing their child to the pediatrician knowing that there are stringent infection-control measures in place. another critical step in restoring safe vaccination levels is widespread and culturally competent messaging communicating the efficacy and safety of childhood vaccines. studies show that promoting vaccination as the default or norm, using storytelling and imagery, and promoting dialogue between patients and trusted providers successfully combats vaccine hesitancy. 27 humorous messaging can also be an effective means of reducing defensive reactions and reaching hesitant parents.28 the american academy of Pediatrics' (aaP) #callYourPediatrician campaign offers amusing materials in English and spanish to remind parents about routine vaccinations and assure them about the safety of visiting pediatricians (see Figure 3). 29 the american Rescue Plan enacted in March 2021 includes $1 billion in funding for the cdc to address vaccine hesitancy through evidence-based education campaigns. 30 Finally, as communities plan for children to return to school in-person, well-designed school vaccination requirements and dedicated school communities can increase vaccination uptake. these interventions can take place at multiple levels of governance. For example: zzLegislative level: in april 2021, connecticut lawmakers limited exceptions to school vaccination requirements by disallowing non-medical exemptions. this applies to students attending pre-K-12 schools, day care centers, and institutions of higher education.31 zzHealth department level: in order to increase Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rates in 2019- 2020, the colorado state health department provided local health departments with technical assistance, media toolkits, and lists of elementary schools with poor coverage rates.32 in turn, local health departments worked with schools to launch simulation exercises and provide incentives for families to vaccinate their children. 33 zzSchool district level: in Pennsylvania, even as the state extended the deadline for providing proof of immunization to schools for the 2020-21 school year, Philadelphia school nurses conducted extensive outreach and the district partnered with providers to offer vaccines in school buildings in october and november 2020. 34 reminding parents about routine vaccinations and assuring them about the safety of visiting pediatriciansFigure 3.

Eligibility: in order to be eligible to receive vaccines through vFc, children must be enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured, american indian or alaska native, or underinsured. children enrolled in the children's health insurance Program (chiP) through a Medicaid-expansion program (M-chiP) are eligible for vFc vaccines, but children enrolled in standalone chiP (separate chiP) programs are ineligible. t o simplify vaccine administration, the vFc program should be expanded to include all chiP enrollees. Vaccines in the medical home: currently, underinsured children whose health insurance does not adequately cover vaccines are eligible to receive vFc vaccines only at Federally Qualified health centers (FQhcs) and Rural health clinics (Rhcs), or other sites designated by the state. For some children, this means that they have to leave their doctor's office and travel to a separate location in order to receive a vaccine, even if their pediatrician is a vFc provider. this disruption to the medical home increases the likelihood that children will forgo vaccinations and creates a gap between the trusted relationship in the medical home and the clinical team administering vaccines. Administrative and operational challenges: vFc providers must take on a number of costs to participate in the program, including separate storage and monitoring for vFc-provided vaccines and private stock. t ypically, providers must maintain separate inventory of vFc-provided and private stock of identical vaccines, and cannot \"borrow\" doses between funding sources. helping to offset these upfront costs and allowing equal exchange of doses between vFc and private inventory would increase vFc provider participation and program efficiency. in particular, providers need flexibility to borrow between inventory to get their patients caught up on the recommended immunization schedules and avoid missed opportunities to vaccinate. Payment: Multi-component vaccines protect individuals against multiple diseases with a single administration. however, the payment system for vFc vaccine administration has not kept up with improvements in vaccine delivery, and vFc providers are often underpaid to administer modern, multi-component vaccines. When a pediatrician administers a vaccine with multiple components, such as MMR, they counsel the child or family about each component of the vaccine. this is reflected in the way that practices usually bill for vaccine administration: one charge for the counseling and administration of the first component of the vaccine, and an additional, smaller charge for the time spent fully addressing families' questions and concerns about each additional component of the vaccine. as of June 2021, cMs interprets the vFc statute to only allow Medicaid to pay for the cost associated with counseling parents and addressing vaccine hesitancy for the first component of a vaccine. as a result, Medicaid does not pay for the full cost of vaccine administration and counseling, which is a disincentive for providers to participate in vFc or accept more vFc-eligible children into their practice. With more multi-component vaccines expected on the market soon, vaccine science is evolving and Medicaid payment policy should keep up. 37 action on childhood vaccinations 7 July 2021 COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Adolescents there are several anticipated challenges in administering covid-19 vaccines to children. the Pfizer-Biont ech vaccine has been authorized for emergency use among children and adolescents ages 12 and older.* clinical trials are underway in children as young as six months for the Pfizer-Biont ech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and could produce safety and efficacy data as soon as Fall 2021. 38 the sole authorization for the Pfizer-Biont ech vaccine means that 12- to 17-year-olds may not be able to receive a vaccine at the same location as other members of their family if a location only has Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines available. a survey of parents in February 2021 found that a large minority of parents\u201427 percent of mothers and 14 percent of fathers\u2014were extremely unlikely to vaccinate their child against covid-19. 39 vaccine hesitancy and resistance can best be addressed within the context of the medical home, where parents and children can have their questions and concerns addressed by a trusted care team. as pediatricians work to ensure children catch up on routine childhood immunizations, they can also counsel families about the covid-19 vaccine and, in some cases, administer the covid-19 vaccine. cdc guidance allows coadministration of covid-19 vaccines and routine childhood immunizations\u2014that is, administration of a covid-19 vaccine and other vaccines on the same day. Previously, the cdc recommended implementing a 14-day buffer between any covid-19 vaccine dose and any other vaccination, but data have shown that such a delay is unnecessary. 40 Unfortunately, many primary care practices are not able to access covid-19 vaccines in order to offer it to their patients, though federal and state governments have recently begun to increase the distribution of vaccine to primary care providers.41 in early 2021, the distribution of covid-19 vaccine prioritized mass vaccination sites and sites that could accommodate extremely cold storage. Even as the distribution of covid-19 vaccines has expanded to smaller sites, the process still limits orders to extremely large volumes such as a minimum of 1,170 Pfizer vaccine doses. once received, the Pfizer vaccine doses can only be stored for two weeks at typical vaccine temperature ranges, and once thawed and diluted, each six-dose vial must be used within six hours. 42 these windows of time are not feasible for many practices outside of special events like a vaccine clinic. the current disconnect between vaccine administration and one of the most trusted sources of information\u2014the primary care medical home\u2014leaves little opportunity for providers to counsel patients. children in immigrant families may face additional barriers to covid-19 vaccines. some vaccine sites currently require certain types of government- issued identification and social security numbers to access vaccines, even though these are not required federally. 43 one-quarter of children in the U.s. have at least one foreign-born parent.44 consequently, specific identification requirements for parents could present a barrier to vaccine access for over 18 million children. 45 it is important that the cdc clarify that lack of documentation cannot be a reason to deny a person a vaccine. Patient cost-sharing is not likely to be a barrier for covid-19 vaccination. all Medicaid and chiP enrollees under the age of 21 are eligible to receive a covid-19 vaccine at no cost. 46 For people who are uninsured, the caREs act provides funding for the federal government to purchase the vaccine, and the Provider Relief Fund covers administration costs. in addition, the caREs act requires private insurance to cover covid-19 vaccines starting 15 days after recommendation from aciP .47 this requirement is in effect through the end of the Public health Emergency, and insurers must cover the cost of covid-19 vaccines even if it is not designated for \"routine use.\"48 consequently, many vaccine sites ask for insurance information in order to bill insurance if possible, and that question may stop some individuals from seeking the covid-19 vaccine. * note: as of the date of this writing, Moderna has indicated that its data supports the safety and efficacy of its vaccine in children adolescents ages 12-17, and will seek emergency use authorization from Fda. 8 action on childhood vaccinations July 2021Design and layout provided by Nancy Magill.Conclusion Policymakers and stakeholders should take several steps now to make sure children and adolescents are fully caught up on recommended vaccinations, with special attention to subgroups of children and adolescents who are less likely to have received recommended vaccinations since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. Ensuring children and adolescents are fully vaccinated will help prevent an outbreak of diseases such as measles, which could overwhelm an already over-burdened public health system. trusted messengers should be deployed to inform families about the efficacy and safety of childhood vaccines and the importance of catching up on missed doses immediately. state and local health departments, working with schools and other community-based organizations, can help reach children and adolescents who are more likely to have missed recommended vaccinations, such as children covered by Medicaid/chiP . Finally, covid-19 has created a window of opportunity for policymakers to make needed improvements to vFc, helping this successful program reach even more children and adolescents. this brief is jointly produced by the american academy of Pediatrics (aaP) and the Georgetown University center for children and Families (ccF) as part of \"Keeping Kids connected to care during covid-19 and Beyond,\" a project supported by the david and lucile Packard Foundation and the annie E. casey Foundation.
