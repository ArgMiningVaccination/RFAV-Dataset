Aromatherapy massage is [massage therapy](http://altmedicine.about.com/od/treatmentsmtoq/a/massage.htm) but with highly concentrated plant oils, called [essential oils](http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/1/a/Aromatherapy.htm), added to the massage oil or lotion. How does aromatherapy massage work? The nostrils are attached to a part of the brain called the limbic system. The limbic system controls emotions and influences the nervous system and hormones. When you inhale essential oil molecules, messages are transmitted to the limbic system and affect heart rate, stress level, blood pressure, breathing, memory, digestion, and the immune system. Essential oils are also believed to be absorbed through the skin. Each essential oil has different healing properties. For example, some calm while others energize. Here are some widely used essential oils and their properties: - calming - chamomile, lavender, geranium - uplifting - ylang ylang, clary sage, rose, neroli - energizing - rosemary - cleansing - rosemary - decongesting - eucalyptus, pine, tea tree Why do people get aromatherapy massage?

It also slightly, but not significantly reduced limb volume. However, carefully chosen aromatherapy oils did not appear to be more effective than massage without aromatherapy oils. - Sixteen first-time mothers received a 30-minute aromatherapy massage two days after delivery, while 20 mothers received standard post-partum care. The aromatherapy massage group had significantly decreased ratings of post-partum blues and anxiety and had increased vigor and attachment to their babies. - Research suggests that patients with cancer, particularly in the palliative care setting, are increasingly using aromatherapy and massage. What can I expect during an aromatherapy massage? After the consultation, one or more essential oils are selected based on what you need and are mixed in with the massage oil or lotion. The subtle aroma of the essential oils fill the air around you during the massage. After the massage, the massage therapist may suggest a blend that you can use at home in between massage treatments. Precautions Massage is not recommended for certain people: - infectious skin disease, rash, or open wounds - immediately after surgery - immediately after chemotherapy or radiation, unless recommended by your doctor - prone to blood clots. There is a risk of blood clots being dislodged. If you have heart disease, check with your doctor before having a massage - pregnant women should check with their doctor first if they are considering getting a massage. Massage in pregnant women should be done by massage therapists who are certified in pregnancy massage. - massage should not be done directly over bruises, inflamed skin, unhealed wounds, tumors, abdominal hernia, or areas of recent fractures. Additional tips - don't eat a heavy meal before the massage - if it's your first time at the clinic or spa, arrive at least 10 minutes early to complete the necessary forms. Otherwise, arrive 5 minutes early so you can have a few minutes to rest and relax before starting the massage. Treatment Times. - We recommend at least an hour to gain full benefit - A \u00bd hour, treatment is not strongly recommended but acceptable if you are very pushed for time. We would only have time to treat one specific area of the body. - If you have complex or multiple issues, one longer treatment or a series of regular hourly sessions is considered to be most effective.
