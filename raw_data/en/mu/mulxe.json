The database search was completed with a manual search of the reference lists of included articles. Data concerning country, study period, number ofparticipants, type of applied vaccine, time points of sampling and outcome measureswere collected from the selected manuscripts. The data are summarized and synthesized in a descriptive way. Results: 30 manuscripts were included in this review. Data on safety of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation indicate no s evere vaccine-related local and systemic reactions, both after rst and second dose, neither in the mother nor the nursing child. No signi cant amount of vaccine components seems to appear in breast milk. Milk supply data after vaccination are inconclusive as there are no quantitative data available. Somewomen however observe a temporary increase or reduction in milk supply, without long-term effects. All prospective cohort studies demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2-speci c antibodies in breast milk of nursing mothers vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Nearly all studies were conducted with mRNA vaccines. Conclusion: There is evidence that the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and poses no additional risk to the breastfeeding woman or the breastfed baby. Aftervaccination of the mother during the lactation period, antibodies appear in the milk,which could protect the infant against COV ID-19.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, appears with a variety of clinical manifestations. In most cases, the disease startswith in fluenza-like symptoms and evolves in some patients towards acute respiratory d istress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. However, other symptoms like, gastrointestinal,dermatological, neurological, cardiovascular, and renalmanifestations have also been reported ( 2). Breastfeeding women can, similar to other populations, get infected by the SARS-CoV-2-virus. In October 2020, the European Commission listed a number of key steps for effective vaccination strategies ensuring access tosafe vaccines across Europe ( 3). By the end of 2020, a worldwide vaccination strategy deployed. In multiple countries, people in residential centers, along with health care providers (HCPs) were prioritized for vaccination. At the start of the vaccinationstrategy, mRNA-based, adenovector-based vaccines, inactivatedwhole virus and subunit vaccines were approved and used ( 4,5).The availability of new vaccines against COVID-19 and the recommendation to prioritize HCPs for vaccination, urged for guidance about vaccination during lactation as many of theseHCPs are of fertile age. Initially, multiple governmentalguidelines advised against vaccination during the lactationperiod, disregarding a breastfeeding woman 's likelihood of developing a severe form of the COVID-19 after exposure to the virus. At a later stage, the vaccination campaign was extended to the general population, including women of fertile age. Thisled to discontent and a rm counter reaction in the scienti c literature ( 5,6). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( 7), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) ( 8) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) ( 9) have since reversed their stand and now advise to offer the vaccine to breastfeeding women ( 10). Although the currently marketed COVID-19 vaccines are non-replicating vaccines andtherefore theoretically pose no risk ( 9,11,12), several institutions still mention that robust safety and immunogenicity data in thispopulation of women is lacking. Indeed, none of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized or in phase 3 have been trialed for women who are breastfeeding. Some of these vaccines are now being tested in an academicsetting. As vaccination in the postpartum period and duringlactation could however result in clinically relevant immunologicfactors in breast milk that are protecting the child in early life, itis of importance that women have this information to decide whether to take the vaccine. Exclusively breastfeeding for the rst six months, and after six months in combination withcomplementary foods, is recommended by the World HealthOrganization ( 13) and UNICEF ( 14), given the many physically and psychologically bene ts of breastfeeding, for both mother and child. Risking a mother to stop breastfeeding earlier thanintended because of vaccination, should be regarded as a threat to the health of both. On the other hand, refusing vaccination also entails risks for the mother, with an increased risk ofinfection and development of (severe) COVID-19. We aim to review the literature to get an insight in the effects of vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines during the lactationperiod. This entails the safety of vaccination during lactation, the immune response in lactating women and the excretion of immunological factors in breast milk. Neonates rely on thetransfer of immunity viathe placenta and breast milk, since they are born with an immature immune system. The role ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG) transferred viathe placenta is well established, but less is known about the transfer of antibodiesand the mechanisms by which these antibodies provide protection to the neonate viabreast milk ( 15). It is therefore plausible that the immune response triggered by vaccinatinglactating women may be different from the general population.Muyldermans et al. COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852928 2The conclusions will contribute to the knowledge on COVID-19 vaccination and the results will bene t the population with respect to public health. METHODS Study Design and Searches We searched Ovid Embase Classic+Embase, PubMed and BioMed Central for articles published between December 1st 2020 and December 31st2021. The search strategy contained terms and combinations related to COVID-19 vaccination during lactation, including the MeSH terms \"COVID-19 Period \".T h e nal literature search was performed on the 31stof December 2021. The database search was completed with a manual search of thereference lists of included articles (i.e. \"snowballing \"). The quality of reporting was supported by the use of the PRISMA guidelines ( 16). The detailed overview of the search strategy is provided in Appendix 1 . Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection Manuscripts were eligible for inclusion if (1) study participants were women vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine during thelactation period and (2) the results reported on the safety of vaccination during lactation OR on the excretion of COVID-19 vaccine components in breast milk OR the excretion ofimmunological factors in breast milk after COVID-19vaccination OR on the impact of COVID-19 vaccination onthe breast milk production. Manuscripts published in English,French, Dutch, German or Spanish were included. Studies thatfocused on women with speci c pathologies (e.g. transplant patients) were excluded. JM and ET independently screened titles, abstracts and full-texts of the retrieved manuscripts foreligibility. Each manuscript showing uncertainty regardinginclusion criteria was discussed with the other authors untilconsensus about inclusion. Data Collection, Synthesis and Analysis Data concerning country, study period, number of participants,type of applied vaccine, time points of sampling and outcomemeasures were collected from the selected manuscripts. Thedatasets were summarized and synthesized in a descriptive way. RESULTS Included Studies In Total, 2,373 manuscripts were identi ed. We screened 2,163 titles and 60 abstracts for eligibility. We screened the full text of26 manuscripts and excluded 7. Eleven manuscripts were addedviamanual search of the references ( Figure 1 ). We included manuscripts reporting on women that were vaccinated with the messenger RNA (mRNA) mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and vaccines BNT162b2 nCoV-19 (Oxford - (Johnson Johnson) and the inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Of the 30 included references, 1 study reports on the excretion of COVID-19 components in breast milk ( 17), 20 studies report on the excretion of antibodies in breast milk ( 18-36), 1 study report on the excretion of other immunological factors ( 37) and 1 study reports on the impact of vaccination on breast milkproduction ( 38). Two studies report on both side effects and the excretion of COVID-19 antibodies ( 39,40), 1 study reports on the excretion of COVID-19 antibodies and the excretion ofvaccine components ( 41), 3 studies report on side effects and the impact of vaccination on breast milk production ( 42-44) and 1 study reports on side effects, the impact of vaccination onbreast milk production and on breast milk production ( 45). Side-Effects in the Mother After COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Six publications report on side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation in a total of 7,241 women, of which 4,509vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine, 2,669 with the mRNA-1273 vaccine and 23 with the JNJ-78436735 vaccine ( 39,42-45). In a rst study ( 42), data from 17,525 women vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine were included of which 6,815 were lactating women. The other women were either pregnant women(n = 7,809) or women from fertile age planning to get pregnant atthe moment of the rst vaccine dose (n = 2,901). Of the vaccinated lactating women , 4,156 received the BNT162b2 vaccine, 2,596 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine, 23 received the JNJ-78436735 vaccine and from 40 women it was not known which vaccine they received. The most common adversereactions in all participating women after a rst vaccine dose were pain at the injection site (16,019/17,525; 91.4%) and fatigue(5,489/17,525; 31.3%). Fatigue was more reported after thesecond dose (10,399/17,525; 69.2%). No difference in the rateof adverse events by vaccine-type was reported across all groups ( 42). Another study ( 43) (n = 180, of which 128 lactating women received the BNT162b2 vac cine and 52 the mRNA-1273) reported similar proportions of general side-effects for both theBNT162b2 (89.4%) and mRNA-1273 (98.1%) vaccine after therst dose in lactating women. The most common reactions in lactating women after a rst dose were pain at the the mRNA-1273 vaccine reported signi cantly with women recei ving the BNT162b2 vaccine. Local symptoms including redness at injection site (15/52 vs. 3/123, 31.9% vs. 2.6%), swelling at injection site (14/52 vs. 8/123,29.8% vs. 6.1%) and itching at injection site (8/52 vs. 5/123, 17.4% vs. 4.4%) were more common after the second dose with theMuyldermans et al.

In a third study ( 45), (n = 48), fever, chills, muscle or body aches, fatigue and/or tiredness and joint pain were signi cantly less reported by lactating women after the rst dose than after the second dose. All 21 particip ants (100%) who received the mRNA-1237 vaccine reported symptoms at injection, whileonly 21 (78%) of 27 BNT162b2 p articipants reported symptoms at injection site (p=0.02). During the study, twoinfants were diagnosed with COVID-19. One week after thesecond dose, mild symptoms by one infant were reported, while the infant 'sP C Rt e s tw a sp o s i t i v e ,t h em o t h e rw h ow a s vaccinated had a negative test. A positive plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgA (immunoglobulin A)was found in another infant, despite the mother reported noknown prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving the vaccine postpartum. A likely natural asymptomatic COVID-19 infectioncould be indicated, since anti bodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were found in the mother 's plasma ( 45). Af o u r t hs t u d y( 39)( n=8 4 )r e p o r t e ds i m i l a ra d v e r s e reactions after the rst and second dose in lactating women. Forty-seven women (55.9%) reported one or more vaccine-related side effect after the rst dose of which 40 local pain at injection site (47.6%), and 8 fatigue (9.5%). After the seconddose, 52 women (61.9%) reported side-effects, of which 34 localpain at injection site (40.5%), 28 fatigue (33.3%) and 10 fever (11.9%) ( 39). In the nal included study ( 44), local reactions at the injection site (redness, pain or swelling) were reported by 57of 88 women (64.8%), headache, muscle pain or joint pain wasreported by 52/88 (59.1%) and fatigue by 54/88 (61.4%). Five out FIGURE 1 | Flow diagram of literature search and manuscript selection.Muyldermans et al. COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852928 4of 88 (5.7%) lactating women reported neck or axillary lymph node swelling after their second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.Mastitis was reported by three (3.4%) women and breastengorgement which resolved after 24 hours was reported byone woman ( 44). In a fth study ( 40) (n = 26) one or more side effects were reported by 57% of the participants after the rst dose. After the second dose, one or more side effects were reported by 81% of theparticipants. After the rst dose, the most reported side effects were local pain or swelling (6/26, 28.6%) and muscles aches (5/26, 23.8%). After the headache (5/ 26, 23.8%) were the most frequently reported side effects ( 40). Overall, we can conclude that side-effects in lactating mothers after COVID-19 vaccination are similar to other individuals likepregnant women and women who are planning to get pregnant(42). The most common side-effects shown in these studies were fatigue, fever, headache, chills, muscle pain and pain at injection site. These side-effects are mild and similar to side-effects described in the general population ( 46). Studies showed increased reactions following the second dose of BNT162b2and mRNA-1237 vaccines compared to the rst dose ( 39,42, 43,45). Side-Effects in the Infant After COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Three studies evaluated side-effects in the infant after a COVID- 19 vaccination to the mother, including a total of 7,043 infants(4,311 of whom the mother was vaccinated with the BNT162b2vaccine, 2,669 with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, 23 with the JNJ-78436735 vaccine, 40 of which the vaccine type was notspecied) ( 42,43,45). In the rst study (n = 6,815) 208 breastfeeding mothers reported to have concerns about the infant after the rst dose (3.0%) and concerns were reported by 267 breastfeeding mothersafter the second dose (4.4%) ( 42). In another study (n = 180) the most common side-effects seen in the nursing children weresimilar for both mRNA vaccines following the cant difference between the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccineafter the second dose was drowsiness after the second vaccine dose. Mothers who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine reported signicantly more drowsiness in the infant after the second dose in comparison to mothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine(3/53 vs. 0/129; 6.4% vs. 0.0%; p=0.02) ( 43). In another study with 48 participants (27 BNT162b2 and 21 mRNA-1273), 12%(6/48) of mothers reported to have seen at least one symptom after the rst vaccine in their infants. These included gastrointestinal (2/48; 4.0%; BNT162b2), sleep acne (1/48;2.0%; mRNA-1273). No mothers reported an infant symptomafter the second vaccine dose ( 45).Excretion of COVID-19-Vaccine Components in Breast Milk Two manuscripts report on the excretion of COVID-19 vaccine particles in breast milk, including a total of 16 women (15vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine and 1 with the mRNA-1273 vaccine) ( 17,41). The rst study included 6 women receiving a COVID-19 vaccine of which 5 women were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 1 with the mRNA-1273 vaccine. When testingbreast milk samples, no mRNA was found in their milk 4-48hours post-vaccination ( 17). The second study included 10 women receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine of which milksamples were analyzed at four timepoints (pre-vaccination, 1-3days after the rst dose, 7-days after the rst dose and 3-7 days after the second dose). Across all timepoints, a minimal transfer of BNT162b2 mRNA in human milk was found. Very low levelsof vaccine mRNA were only found on rare occasions (4/40) andthis within the rst week after the rst dose or second dose. Detectable levels of vaccine mRNA were not shown in 90% (36/40 samples) of the samples. The highest concentration of BNT162b2 mRNA found was 2 ng/mL. In the worst-case scenario, this would mean 0.67% of the given vaccine dosebeing transferred to the infant in 100 mL of breast milk ( 41). mRNA vaccines contain a part of the genetic code of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, more speci cally that of the SARS-Cov-2 S spike or \"S\"protein. They are encapsulated in very small specialized particles consist ing of fats, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol. The small amount of polyethylene glycol- 2000 in the BNT162b2 vaccine was also not found in breastmilk ( 45). Excretion of Antibodies in Breast Milk The eventual list of included manuscripts covering the excretion of antibodies in breast milk is presented in Tables 1 ,2. It covers an overview of the number of participants, applied vaccines, timepoints of breast milk collection and IgG and IgA responsesin breast milk for every study. Our nal sample comprised of 18 published ( 18,19,21-33,39,40) manuscripts reporting on 716 women receiving a COVID-19 vaccine during the lactationperiod and 6 preprints ( 20,35,36,41,45,48) on 151 women receiving a COVID-19 vaccine during the lactation period. In total, 665 women were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine, 125 with the mRNA-1273, 13 with the JNJ-78436735, 44 with theChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 20 with the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Thestudies were performed in 9 different countries (i.e. USA, Israel,Spain, Brazil, Italy, Polan d, Portugal, Singapore and The Netherlands). The presence of antibodies in breast milk (mainly IgA and IgG) after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during lactation,have been demonstrated by several prospective cohort studies.Nearly all studies were conducted with mRNA vaccines (SeeTables 1 ,2). Only one study included participants vaccinated with the JNJ-78436735 vaccine ( 48), one study included participants vaccinated with the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Vaccine (22) and two studies included participants vaccinated with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine ( 19,32).Muyldermans et al.

COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852928 7In total, 17 published and 6 preprint studies researched the presence of IgA in breast milk after COVID-19 vaccination ( 18- 24,26,28,29,31-33,35,36,39,40,45,47,48). In general, the included studies show particularly an increase of antibody titersin breast milk after the second dose and that this is highlycorrelate with the levels present in the mother 'sb l o o d .A n increase of anti-SARS-CoV-2 speci c IgA was found in most studies one week after the rst dose. In the different studies, the interval between the rst and second dose of mRNA vaccines was between 21 and 35 days, however, the participants of the twostudies using the adenovector-based vaccines ChAdOx1 nCoV-1,did not receive a second dose. After the intermediate timepoint between the rst and second vaccine dose, a decrease of IgA was reported towards the second dose. In most studies, the highestconcentrations were observed one week after the second dose(18,20-23,28,29,32,33,36,39,40,45). Three studies compared IgA between the mRNA-based vaccines a signi cant difference in the mean IgA titers in breast milk of mothers vaccinated with BNT162b2 vs.ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (p=0.02). For mothers who received themRNA-1273 vaccine, the BNT162b2 vaccine and the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine (one dose) respectively, the mean antibodytiters observed in milk were 0.10 ( \u00b1SD 0.07), 0.11 ( \u00b1SD 0.12) and 0.04 ( \u00b1SD 0.07) (AU, Arbitrary Units) ( 19). Another study found that IgA levels were higher after the rst dose mRNA-1273 vaccinated women compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (one dose)(p<0.0001) and BNT162b2 (p=0.002). After the second were observed between the mRNA-based vaccines.After the noti cation of severe episodes of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, participants did not receive a second dose. Therefore there is noinformation on antibody responses in breast milk available afterthe second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ( 32). A third study compared the mRNA-based vaccines with the JNJ-78436735 vaccine. Positive levels of Spike-speci c IgA, exhibiting a mean endpoint titer of 15, was found in 23% of the JNJ-78436735 recipient milk samples. Comparing to the mRNA-1273 vaccine group, this was signi cantly lower (p=0.025) ( 48). In total, the presence of IgG in breast milk after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in the lactation period was researched in 17published and 4 preprint studies ( 18,19,21,23-26,28-33,35,36, 39,47,48). In some samples, an increase of anti-SARS- CoV-2 speci c IgG was found one week after the rst dose and increasing towards 2 weeks after the rst dose. After the second dose, also an increase of IgG antibodies was seen ( 18,21,23,25- 29,32,33,36,39). ChAdOx1nCoV-19 or JNJ-78436735 ( 19,32,48).

In addition, the presence of binding neutralizing antibodies was revealed in two studies evaluating the immunogenicity of mRNA-based vaccines ( 24,36). These data may indicate that breast milk has the potential to add to infant protection bypassively transferred antibodies through breast milk. Excretion of Other Immunological Factors in Breast Milk Only one manuscript reported on the excretion of other immunological factors than antibodies. The study included 14women, all receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine. The study showedthat vaccination is not only able to increase the amount ofantibodies in breast milk, but also induces spike-reactive CD4+ T cells in breast milk, especially after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. These spike-reactive CD4+ T cells may have aprotective function in the upper respiratory tract of infants ( 37). Impact of Vaccination on Breast Milk Production Five manuscripts report on the impact of vaccination on breast milk production and included a total of 11,586 lactating womenreceiving a COVID-19 vaccine ( 38,42,43,45). These studies report on 4,399 women vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine,2,669 with the mRNA-1273, 23 with the JNJ-78436735 and for40 the vaccine type was not speci ed (42,43,45). One of these studies vaccinated 4,445 women with either the mRNA-1273 or the BNT162b2 vaccine. This was not speci ed (38). In arst study (n = 180), a temporary reduction in breast milk supply was reported by some women after vaccination with aCOVID-19 mRNA vaccine (71% BNT162b2, 29% mRNA-1273).A decrease in milk after the vaccine was reported by 7.3% (9/126) and 8.0% (9/123) women after the rst and second dose, respectively. The percentage of womenreporting a decrease in milk production after the mRNA-1273vaccine was 11.5% (6/52) after the rst dose and 23.4% (11/52) after the second dose. The difference between the BNT162b2vaccine and the mRNA-1273 was statistically signi cant (p<0.05). Milk supply returned to normal within three days in all cases. In contrast, an increase in milk supply was reported bysome women. More production was reported after the rst dose by 3.3% (4/126) of mothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine,but was not reported by mothers receiving a rst dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. After the second dose, 3.6% (4/123) ofmothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine reported anincrease in milk supply, and 6.4% (3/52) of mothers who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Finally, a milk color change to blue-green color was reported by 3 mothers after vaccineadministration (2/126, 8.0%, BNT162b2; 1/52, 7.1%, mRNA-1273) after the administration by 2 mothers (1/123, 4.0%, BNT162b2; 1/52, 6.2%, mRNA-1273) a second study, 4,455 breastfeeding mothers who received either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the mRNA-1273 vaccine lled in an online survey. An increase in milk supply was reported by3.9% of mothers and a decrease was reported by 6.0% of mothers(38). In a third study of 6,815 lactating women, 339 participants reported a decreased milk supply no longer than 24 hours after therst dose (5.0%) and 434 participants after the second dose (7.2%) ( 42). In another, relatively small study with 48 mothers, 2 mothers reported a slight decrease in milk production in the rst 24-72 hours after the rst and second dose ( 45). An interruption of breastfeeding after the rst dose by 155 of 6,815 participants (2.3%) and 130 of 6,056 individuals after thesecond dose (2.2%) was reported by Kachikis et al. (2021). Whether the breastfeeding interruption was a deliberate choice of the mother, imposed upon from the health care provider or aconsequence of decreased production was not speci ed (42). One study looked at milk production after receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine (n = 88). A change in milk supply wasreported by one woman, increase or decrease was not speci ed. One woman reported a transient bluish-green color of her breast milk after her rst vaccine dose. This was not reported after her second dose ( 44). DISCUSSION Main Findings of the Review We reviewed the literature on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation in women and neonates. Subsequently, wesummarized the effects of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation on the excretion of COVID-19 vaccine components in breast milk, the excretion of immunologic factors in breast milkand on the production of breast milk. In general, currentlyavailable data point towards a reassuring safety pro le of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation with comparable side-effects in lactating compared to pregnant, non-pregnant and non- lactating women of childbearing age. While vaccine components are barely or not detectable in breast milk, most studies report thepresence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in breast milk atseveral timepoints post vaccination, up to 8 weeks after the secondvaccine dose. Additionally, a large proportion of the antibodies inbreast milk exhibits neutralizing capacity against the virus offeringpotential additional protection to the nursing infant. The impact on milk supply appears to remain very limited.Muyldermans et al. COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852928 10Combining the Reported Study Outcomes Since neonates are born with an immature immune system, they rely on the transfer of antibodies viathe placenta and breast milk for their protection during the rst vulnerable months and years of life. The mechanisms by which the antibodies in breast milkprovide protection to the neonate still remain unclear ( 15). At the moment of publication, worldwide, 47 out of 224 countriesrecommend COVID-19 vaccination for some or all lactatingwomen whereas 77 countries state that lactating women canreceive, may receive or can choose to receive the vaccine. In 8 countries, only certain groups of lactating people (e.g. health care professionals, women with underlying conditions) can or maychoose to receive the vaccine. One country state that lactatingwomen should not receive the vaccine, with certain exceptionsand 23 countries do not recommend COVID-19 vaccination forlactating women. For 68 countries, there is currently no information on their policy regarding COVID-19 vaccination during lactation ( 10). Despite the fact that the strategy of vaccinating lactating women with COVID-19 vaccines is frequently recommendedon a global level, none of the COVID-19 vaccines currentlyauthorized or in phase 3 have been trialed for women who arebreastfeeding. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, it is important to consider whether vaccination during lactation is safe and effective. The safety of administrating inactivated vaccines tolactating women was already shown for other vaccine-preventable infectious diseases ( 49) and also sIgA and IgG after postpartum vaccination against pertussis and in fluenza are proven to be secreted into breast milk ( 15). Three studies, all using mRNA-based vaccines, focused on the safety and side-effects of COVID-19-vaccination in lactatingwomen ( 42,43,45). Among all participants, the most common described side-effects were pain at the injection site, fatigue, chills,headache, muscle/body aches, fever and vomiting. These side-effects are similar to the ones seen in the general population ( 46). The excretion of COVID-19 vaccine components in breast milk was investigated in two studies ( 17,41). Although these studies were small, it is reassuring that no or very lowconcentrations of mRNA were detected ( 17,41). If low concentrations of mRNA reach the breastfed infant throughbreast milk, it is very likely that there will be no uptake by thegastrointestinal system. The small amount of polyethylene glycol- 2000 (PEG-2000) in the BNT162b2 vaccine is not found in breast milk. This is important to know, since PEG-2000 can causeanaphylaxis in very rare cases ( 45). No studies were performed on the excretion of COVID-19-vaccine components in breastmilk after vaccination with any other type of COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple studies showed that sIgA and IgG against the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein are present in breast milk after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination ( 20,21,26,37,50,51). These studies show that the antibody titers (sIgA and IgG) in breast milk mainlyincrease after a second dose and that they are strongly correlatedwith the antibody levels present in the mother 's blood. In most published studies, antibody levels are measured relatively shortlyafter vaccination, i.e. within 2 to 8 weeks after the second dose. At the time of publication, most studies focused on measuringantibody levels until 2 to 8 weeks after the second dose. Long-term results on antibody levels after vaccination are not published yet. Nearly all studies were conducted with mRNA vaccines. Only one study was conducted with the JNJ-78436735 vaccine ( 48), one study was conducted with the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. vaccine(22) and two studies were conducted with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine ( 19,32). Five studies looked at the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on milk production ( 38,42-45). Only a few women reported a temporary reduction in breast milk supply. Milk supply returnedto normal within one to three days. Some women reported anincrease in milk supply. Strengths and Limitations of the Review To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete andextensive review on the effects of COVID-19 vaccines whenadministered to lactating women. The insights of this review are important for policy makers that can adapt guidelines and inform women on whether to take the vaccine or not duringlactation as vaccination during lactation could result in clinicallyrelevant immunological factors in breast milk and therefore offeradditional protection to the infant. Despite speci c selection criteria of the studies included in this review, differences in vaccine schedules, sample collection timepoints, sample processing and data monitoring complicated head-to-head comparisons between studies and performing ameta-analysis was not possible. This also means that at thispoint, it is not possible to compare the different vaccineplatforms used in lactating women. Also, since COVID-19 vaccination is a rapidly evolving eld, pre-prints or publications might have been missed when published between submission and publication of the manuscript. The review did not include studies on COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the effect of antibodies in theirbreast milk. Recommendations for Future Practice and Research Side-effects for both mother and infant were researched in only four studies. Sample sizes were however large enough to provide arst indication of safety. However, the effect of vaccination on the milk production was studied based on (retrospective)reporting by the mother, which could have led to a recall bias.Quantitative research into the effect on milk supply could givemore insights and could be used for further recommendationsabout vaccination during lactation. Additionally, it is essential that research on speci c breastfeeding related side-effects is performed. This includes for example breast engorgement orthe development of mastitis. These are currently often not takeninto account. It would also be of interest to know whetherchanging the vaccine administration place (i.e. leg instead ofarm) would lead to less breastfeeding related side-effects. At this point, most studies researched the excretion of antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine. The two studies that used the adenovector-based vaccineChadOx1-S were stopped after administration of the rst dose.Muyldermans et al. COVID-19 Vaccination During Lactation Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852928 11At the moment, in most countries, adenovector-based vaccines are no longer used in women of childbearing age, but there areother vaccines developed with this platform for other diseases,such as Ebola. The information on the effect of adenovector-based vaccines in lactating women could be interesting toextrapolate to other vaccines in development that have the potential to be used in women of fertile age. Research on the safety, side-effects and excretion of antibodies after a full vaccineschedule including booster vaccination is therefore adamant.Worldwide the booster vaccination (a third vaccination aftermRNA-based vaccines or the ChadOx1-S vaccine or a secondvaccination after the JNJ-78436735 vaccine), is being recommended ( 52,53). At the moment there are no published studies on the effects of COVID-19 booster vaccination inlactating women. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the subclass,glycosylation pro le and functional properties of vaccine- induced antibodies would be of interest to enlighten theimmunology during breastfeeding. This could be completed along more research into cellular and humoral immune responses during lactation. Lastly, one of the main questionsare whether these immunological factors excreted into breastmilk also have protective effects for the infant. Additionally, as the WHO and UNICEF recommend 6 months exclusive breastfeeding and afterwards until the age of2 years in combination with complementary foods ( 13,14), more knowledge on the effects of vaccination on the long term is indispensable. Most studies focused on breast milk analysis up to2 or 8 weeks after the second dose. Therefore, there is a need forfollow-up studies taking samples with longer time intervals andlonger follow-up. Safety of vaccination during lactating period need to be assessed at early stages of product development. In order to achieve this, vaccine manufacturers and regulators must workclosely with specialists in lactation, infectious diseases and publichealth experts in order to improve maternal and infant healthand to build con dence in vaccines. Breastfeeding women therefore need to be included in clinical trials and the need forappropriate safety data is critical. CONCLUSION There is no evidence that the administration of a COVID-19vaccine poses an additional risk to the breastfeeding woman orthe breastfed infant. Data on safety of vaccines against SARS- CoV-2 virus indicate no severe vaccine-related local and systemicreactions, both after rst and second dose. Milk supply data after vaccination indicate that some women report a temporaryreduction in milk supply, without a long-term effect and milksupply returned to normal within a few days whereas other women reported a stimulation of breast milk production. All prospective cohort studies have demonstrated the presence ofantibodies (mainly sIgA and IgG) in breast milk of nursingmothers vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Nearly all studies wereconducted with mRNA vaccines. These studies mainly showedthat the antibody titers in breast milk mainly increase after the second dose and are associated with the levels present in the mother 's blood. After vaccination of the mother, antibodies appear in the milk, which could better protect the infant against COVID-19.Professional associations and g overnment health authorities should recommend offering COVID-19 vaccines to breastfeeding women, as the potential bene ts of maternal vaccination while breastfeeding outweigh the theoretical risks.
