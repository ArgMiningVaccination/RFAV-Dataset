I can finally breathe. As a public-health communicator and vaccination advocate, [I was already waiting not so patiently](https://www.insider.com/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-kids-why-i-enrolled-2021-9) for the release of COVID-19 vaccines for 5- to 11-year-olds. [As the mother of a 10-year-old with a serious case of FOMO](https://www.insider.com/what-pediatricians-are-seeing-as-they-vaccinate-more-eligible-children-2021-11), I'd been getting questions regularly from my son about [when he would be able to get his vaccine](https://www.insider.com/why-parents-shouldnt-lie-about-their-childs-age-vaccine-2021-11). When he woke up on November 3, I asked him if he wanted to go get his shot that morning or wait until the weekend. \"Right now!\" he replied, running to his room to get dressed. \"Let's go, Mom. We can eat breakfast in the car!\" On the way we talked about how a vaccine is like a teacher for your immune system, giving it information just in case the virus shows up with a pop quiz. At the vaccination site we were greeted by bright, friendly faces and an accumulation of local media. The line was quick, and we were ushered inside with a celebratory feel. My son was ecstatic that therapy dogs were present and had a conversation with a golden retriever named Tank while I signed his consent form. He and a couple of the other kids talked about how nervous and excited they were and what they were planning to do after they're vaccinated. When it was time to get his vaccine, he rolled up his sleeve, looked at the photographer, and said, \"You can't see this because I have my mask on, but I am smiling right now.\" His vaccinator talked with him the whole time, and before he knew it, she was finished. I finally got to breathe In the observation area we talked about how it felt to be vaccinated. He said: \"I was a little worried. But actually it was pretty great \u2014 just like the flu shot, and really even better because I got to meet Tank.\" While we waited our 15 minutes, as he was running around just being a kid, I experienced a profound sense of relief that we had been able to take the first step toward durable protection for him. For me, the relief is palpable. We have been more cautious than average because of my spouse's position with the US Navy and my training and advocacy in public health. We both felt that we needed to lead by example, and that extended to our risk assessment for our son. Honestly, I had goosebumps and took what felt like the deepest breath I had taken in a very long time. He was all smiles in the car and insisted we call his dad to share the good news. So far his only side effect has been happiness On the day of his first dose, his only symptom was a slightly sore arm. It didn't stop him from playing tennis with his Grammy that afternoon. The following morning when I asked him if he was having any side effects, he said, \"Happiness!\" He bounced through the morning on his way to school, high-fiving his teacher as he passed through the gate. We spent some time talking about the first things we'd want to do two weeks after his second dose. His first request was a trip to Italy, and when told to think slightly smaller, he requested a trip to the local trampoline park. Don't tell him, but we might be able to do both. As a military family used to travel, my husband and I are just as excited as he is to open our world up wider once we are all vaccinated. "}
