June 8, 2010 Dear Colleagues, The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DO HMH) continues to identify herbal remedies that may contain high levels of heavy meta ls. Products have been identified through interviews of adults with elevated blood lead level s and DOHMH investigations of available products in NYC stores. Some products were either prescribe d by traditional, holistic, naturopathic, complementary or alternative medicine practitioners or were self-prescribed. During a recent lead poisoning case investigation, DOHMH identified elev ated levels of lead in an herbal supplement called Vita Breath. Case Report In January of 2010, an individual with a blood lead level of 22\u00b5g/dL was reported to the NYC DOHMH Adult Lead Program. She reported self-prescr ibing herbal supplements purchased at an Expo held in New York City. One of the products, V ita Breath, manufactured by American Herbal Laboratories Inc. in Rosemead, California, was foun d to contain 1,100ppm lead. She was using the supplement for incontinence and to test the \"streng th of meridians\". This case finding has resulted i n a nation-wide consumer warning by the United States Food and Drug Administration, available at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnounc ements/ucm210448.htm . In addition, the manufacturer recently issued a recall for the suppl ement. What Providers Should Do DOHMH recommends that health care providers ask pat ients about their use of prescription as well as non-prescription health remedies including suppl ements, vitamins, tonics, herbal, Ayurvedic, acupuncture, and mineral products. Health remedies may be manufactured or home-made, and may be available for purchase in NYC or obtained outsid e the U.S. If patients report using the Vita Breath or other t raditional, complementary and alternative remedies, providers should advise them to get a blood lead te st. To report heavy metal poisonings or products that may contain heavy metals, providers should cal l DOHMH at 212-788-4290 during business hours, or the NYC Poison Control Center at 212-764- 7667 during non-business hours and weekends.
