Doctors have been worried about this for a long time, and now it's starting to happen. As the Covid-19 vaccine has started to become available beyond health care workers, people are starting to refuse to take their shot. If people won't take the vaccine that could end the coronavirus pandemic, what comes next? One of the most common reasons people develop fears of vaccines has to do with a common misunderstanding about side effects. But what most of the public doesn't know is that doctors who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 were delighted when the vaccine gave them symptoms. When doctors got sore arms, fatigue, muscle aches, or fevers after their Covid-19 vaccine, they celebrated. That's because those symptoms are not dangerous 'reactions,' but positive signs that the immune system is [responding to the vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). Feeling yucky after the Covid-19 vaccine means it's working. As a pediatrician, educating parents about normal responses to vaccines is one of the first things I do. And that's because there's so much misinformation about vaccines. Take the dreaded fever for instance: the belief that fever is dangerous has been passed down from generation to generation. It's not. We were told we need to bring our fevers down or something bad will happen. We don't, and it won't. It's not the fever that is dangerous, it's that certain diseases that cause fever are (and most of those diseases are now vaccine-preventable). Or as Bruce Y Lee [writes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/01/27/these-coronavirus-vaccines-can-have-side-effects-but-cannot-give-you-covid-19/), \"There's a difference between feeling sick and being sick.\" The thing about fever is that it's not actually caused by the viruses or infections that invade your body. Fever is something your body does for itself. Fevers are part of a beneficial response our immune system creates to boost our metabolism and the effectiveness of our white blood cells and fight off infections. So when we get a fever after a vaccine, it means our immune system is doing exactly what we want it to do. We want the immune system to take notice and mount a response. For some that might mean a fever, but for almost everyone, it means a sore arm or swelling around the site of the vaccination. And... "}
