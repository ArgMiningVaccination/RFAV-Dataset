It focuses on interactions between the environment and the gastrointestinal, endocrine, and immune systems. Functional Medicine is a more personalized medicine that requires detailed knowledge of your medical history, your lifestyle habits, your social history. Functional Medicine is another approach to finding the cause of the patient's condition. How does Dr. Johnson Approach Functional Medicine in her Practice: We try not to look at just the signs and symptoms but consider your lifetime exposure to toxins, nutrition, stress, injury, and relationships to evaluate why you are having these signs and symptoms. This is a more personalized approach with a lengthy one on one conversation with the Doctor to discuss your health concerns and get to the root cause of why you have these health issues. Dr. Johnson does not prescribe drugs for a \"quick fix\" treatment approach but focuses on the \"WHY\" and treatment protocol. Due to the \"Opioid Crisis\", our approach is more nutritionally based and lifestyle based, utilizing supplements and natural medicine. What is involved with Functional Medicine Visit: Visits are based on what the patient is looking for with each treatment. Our clinic does not do large treatment packages. We are a fee for service clinic. There are several options for the patient. Our \"fee for service\" visits are based on the time spent with the doctor. Labs, supplements, and other treatments (i.e. chiropractic, acupuncture) or products are additional costs. We will not diagnose a condition but will work to bring your health back to an optimal condition, which supports the body in a healing process. VISITS with the Doctor: Payment must be made prior to scheduling an appointment. Our refund policy is at the bottom of the page "}
