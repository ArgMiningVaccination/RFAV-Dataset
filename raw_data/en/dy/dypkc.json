Let experts like Deepak Chopra explain.", "sitename": "Mashable", "date": "2023-03-16", "cleaned_text": "Mashable series that explores the intersection of meditation practice and technology. Mantras are having a moment. But that doesn't mean they're being used correctly. On [TikTok](https://mashable.com/category/tiktok), the #mantra hashtag alone has more than 1.6 billion views. The search term \"mantra meditation\" has been used 3.7 billion times. Often creators share mantras that they say can help \"manifest\" good health, luck, and (most disturbingly) [large piles of cash](https://www.tiktok.com/@cassieinspires/video/7036769611982982405?lang=en). Some will use traditional Sanskrit mantras, but don't know the correct pronunciations. And in most cases, influencers chant a mantra aloud \u2014 without explaining to followers that traditional mantra practice typically involves repeating a simple word, syllable, or phrase in your head, silently. Take the \" [Lucky Girl Syndrome](https://mashable.com/article/lucky-girl-syndrome-tiktok-manifestation),\" a trend that glamorizes positive thinking. \"Lucky Girl Syndrome mantra,\" chock full of aspirational affirmations, has notched more than 2.1 billion views \u2014 but has little to offer in the way of traditional mantra meditation. Still, there's good reason to seek out mantra training. [Research suggests that genuine mantra meditation](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-to-know-mantras-meditation) improves well-being, increases calm, and reduces anxiety. Ancient traditions, like Hinduism and Buddhism, incorporate mantra meditation for achieving inner peace and spiritual transformation. In other words, a random affirmation can't compare to mantras handed down for generations by yogis, monks, and other spiritual figures. In an interview, Dr. Deepak Chopra described a mantra in the Sanskrit tradition as something that can \"cancel out\" our thoughts \u2014 which always find creative ways to disrupt the still, profound moments most of us crave. \"What's left is what we call pure consciousness, which is total silence,\" says Chopra \u2014 the author of over 90 books on mindfulness, meditation, and yoga, including his latest, [Living in the Light: Yoga for Self-Realization](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Light-Self-Realization-Deepak-Chopra/dp/0593235428). \"You have gone beyond the mind to the deepest level of your being\" If that sounds appealing, here are three things you should know: 1. What type of meditation is mantra meditation? Amongst the various styles of meditation, mantra is its own category. The most popular forms of mantra meditation come from ancient Hindu and Buddhist practices. Transcendental Meditation, developed in the 1950s by Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, relies on mantra but is not based on any religion or philosophy. While many religions include phrases, sayings, or chants that can be repeated for a certain spiritual purpose, Sanskrit mantras are said to come from ancient yogis who received the sound or syllable from a divine source during deep meditation. Some have no meaning; others have specific definitions. \"Om,\" for example, is associated with the sound of consciousness. A mantra is a 'thought without a story,' says Deepak Chopra Rishima Bahadoorsingh, who teaches traditional sound practices including Sanskrit mantra meditation, in Vancouver, British Columbia, likens the practice to yoga poses for the mind. Just as physical postures attune the body, a mantra can create inner calm. \"It's something to, quote, unquote, save us from the world we're living in right now and whatever we're caught up in,\" says Bahadoorsingh. If you already practice [mindfulness meditation](https://mashable.com/article/best-mindfulness-apps), you can think of a mantra as similar to using breath, sound, or physical sensation as an anchor. When distraction strikes, as it almost always does, simply return to the mantra. As you repeat the syllable or phrase, thoughts may fall away. Chopra describes a mantra as a \"thought without a story.\" 2. How to do mantra meditation Those new to mantra meditation \u2014 and overly familiar with #MantraTok \u2014 may be surprised to learn that Sanskrit mantra meditation is typically done silently. The process of learning a mantra begins by saying it aloud, then whispering it, and finally without speaking, moving the lips, or making a sound. Chopra says meditating in a quiet space can be most effective, but he's also practiced while walking and traveling on airplanes and trains. Transcendental Meditation prescribes 20 minutes of practice twice a day, but for Chopra there is no minimum length; sessions can be short, medium, or long. There is one key caveat: You must learn the mantra's proper Sanskrit pronunciation. Otherwise, Bahadoorsingh suggests, the sound may not have the same effect. Think of the comforting sound of ocean waves versus the howl of a police siren, for example. A mispronunciation is unlikely to be that drastic of a shift, but Bahadoorsingh says that it can still create a different \"energetic effect,\" possibly rendering the mantra ineffective. This is one reason to learn mantra meditation from a trained or experienced instructor. Bahadoorsingh, an Indian-Canadian instructor, has studied in India with gurus and belongs to a spiritual community in Vancouver. She suggests that people interested in learning mantra meditation seek out teachers who can share the traditions they draw on, and from what gurus they learned. While social media can offer inspiration for a mantra meditation practice, incorrect pronunciations can be particularly troublesome. \"It's almost like the game of telephone where one person says it, then another person says it, and it keeps going,\" says Bahadoorsingh. Without a teacher who can share the correct phrasing, beginners won't know the difference \u2014 or what they're missing. Some people may turn to social media for mantra meditation instruction because mantra meditation isn't featured on many top meditation apps, such as Ten Percent Happier, Calm, or Headspace. The Insight Timer app hosts numerous mantra meditations, including [Bahadoorsingh's 10-day course](https://insighttimer.com/meditation-courses/course_chant-traditional-mantra-and-sanskrit-verses) on traditional mantra and Sanskrit verses. (Accessing the course requires a Member Plus subscription, which costs $60 per year. The course is also available on her [personal website](https://rishima.ongraphy.com/courses/10-Day-Audio-Course-on-Mantra-62e2c76e0cf2792349e05d19?redirectToMicroFE=true) for $19.99.) As Chopra notes, it's impossible to control who attempts to teach mantra meditation on social media, and some will adopt the practice in less-than-ideal ways. If a creator can claim even a fraction of those #mantra views as their own, it'll boost their clout and follower count. \"It's unavoidable - whenever there's something attractive, there are not only influencers, there are people who suddenly become experts,\" he says. ( [Chopra is on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@deepakchopra?lang=en) but doesn't post about mantra meditation.) Like Bahadoorsingh, he recommends seeking out a knowledgeable, skilled mantra meditation teacher. 3. What is a good mantra for meditation? A book like Chopra's [Total Meditation: Practices in Living the Awakened Life](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Meditation-Practices-Living-Awakened/dp/1984825313) can also provide important foundational information. Published in 2020, the book includes a chapter on mantra meditation, which lists 52 mantras and their phonetic pronunciations, as well as directions for practicing. Short mantras include \"Hrim,\" which is pronounced hreem and means \"I am truth and joy,\" and \"Hum,\" which is pronounced hoom and means \"I am the power of transformation.\" While there are mantras associated with good fortune, Chopra says it's not enough to set an intention and use a mantra for abundance, for example. Instead, you must use ritual practices to \"concentrate your thought and energy\" and then to channel that, coupling it with a change in behavior. In other words, beware of influencers peddling a Sanskrit mantra that claims to help you attract more money. \"You're going to have people take advantage of this ancient practice and trivialize it,\" says Chopra. Once you've selected a mantra that works well for you, don't obsess with maximizing your repetitions. In fact, trying to overachieve during mantra meditation defeats the point, and can have unpleasant effects. Bahadoorsingh recalls attempting one mantra that was too advanced, which she found online. She finished feeling dizzy and needed her guru to help ground her. In general, Chopra says to avoid mantra meditation if you have a serious mental illness, history of psychosis, or take sedating or otherwise heavy medication. [Similar to other forms of meditation](https://mashable.com/article/why-mindfulness-isnt-working-for-me), the silence and focus of mantra meditation can prompt anxiety, or bring traumatic experiences to the surface. Whatever mantra you chose, Bahadoorsingh says, be mindful of creators and influencers who use mantra as a \"catchall phrase.\" They may position it as a gimmick, or strip the mantra of its ancient and cultural roots to make it more accessible. \"I feel that it's possible to both practice mantra and honor these ancient spiritual traditions, which have existed for thousands of years within India and also the surrounding areas,\" "}
