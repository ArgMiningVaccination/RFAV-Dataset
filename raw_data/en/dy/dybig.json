Another commonly heldview is thatscience literacy isamajor factor indiscouraging students from choosing science ortechnology careers. Stillothers point outthatwidespread connections between science literacy thewell-being ofthenation's research enterprise or society ingeneral thatmayseem likecommon because they believe thatincreased knowledge oftheorganization's role inadvancing research will improve theinstitution's reputation, making iteasier togainpublic support forother organizational goals. Finally, many public science andtechnology commu- nications programs\u2014particularly those conducted by government laboratories right toknow.\" Since a large research is funded with taxdollars, theinstitutions andthe researchers using those funds haveanobligation to language how thatmoney com- munications programs forthepublic, theBest Practices conference steering committee (seepage vi) ofscience communicators, andresearchers approached itstaskofidentifying model andother science-oriented organizations such asmuseums do conduct public communications programs, what does thecommunications research literature tellusabout themost effective ways Laboratory atthe National Aeronautics Center inHuntsville, Ala., char- tered working group toidentify the most compelling questions 1 academic science andtechnology communications programs asimplemented by research institutions States or abroad. Thelaboratory planned tousethecommittee's findings todetermine high-priority communication research areas forfuture funding andtoapply best practice lessons learned from other organizations to improve itsownandNASA's communications programs.

Funding con- straints atNASA Marshall, however, forced postpone- ment ofthese plans until funding forthe sponsor proposals from awide variety ofinstitutions andto that results from theconference would beeffec- tively disseminated toDOE national laboratories. The steering committee, co-chaired byJoann Rodgers oftheJohns Hopkins Medical Institutions andEarle Holland ofOhio State University, met in Chicago inMay2001 toestablish forselecting programs asbest practices, journalists frommedia organiza- tionswhocommunicate wellwith andtechnology institu- butdecided tolimit entries toprograms thattake place primarily outside session entries totheconference were solicited viaadsinscience-writing, trade publications (e.g.,PRWeek, Education); direct mkil, e-mail and phone andtechnology government agencies, corporations, ornon-profit education institutions such asmuseums ornon-profit Web-based enterprises; orfrom third parties such as public relations agencies engaged bythese entities in theircommunications efforts. Tohelpencourage entries from universities, non-profits, andother organ- izations with limited travel funds, upto50selected presenters were eligible fora$750 manuscript feeto help offset travel costs, aswell asfreeconference registration.

Participants included science communication specialists from universities, national laboratories, research institutions, andhospitals; journalism profes- sessions onMarch 7and8consisted ofkeynote addresses, topical lectures, from evaluation ofscience communica- tionprograms totargeting hard-to-reach audiences. An opening reception, conference dinner, continental breakfasts, andlunches provided opportunities for informal networking among participants (see Appendix B). Research-Driven Communications While institutions routinely review pastresearch in agiven technical field before funding additional proj- todesign their programs. In many cases, managers ofpublic communications pro- grams come from related fields such asjournalism, political science, education, oraspecific scientific or technical discipline andarenotaware that thisresearch literature agencies ofscience nications technology communications mostfromacademic andCEOs theexpectations ofitsstrategic publics\u2014those groups affect its operations. TheExcellence project concluded thatthebest public relations programs hadthefollowing qualities incommon: Public relations isaunique management func- tionthathelps anorganization social, itsenvironment, andserves astrategic managerial role aswell asatechnical role. Public relations departments strategically plan, administer, andevaluate public relations programs. Public relations helps toshape theunderlying conditions oforganizational excellence (for example, through employee communications programs). Public relations isempowered bythedominant coalition (thepeople with themostpower mention theinstitution, formeasuring thesuccess surveys and inter- views, aswell asobservation (such aswatching visitors interact with exhibits) thenumber ofmedia isapoor measure ofthesuccess ofacommunications program, except possibly formonitoring theperformance of media relations General surveys ofattitudes, image, andreputation arealsopoor metrics ofcom- munications programs because they areaffected by many other things such asday-to-day decision making byanorganization's management that arebeyond an organization's public relations programs. The Excellence project equivalencies theNational Science Foundation's Science Residual public: People who interest- ed,norvery wellinformed about science and technology issues. Inthe2001NSF of respondents metthecriteria ence science television shows, visit science Web sitesandscience museums, andbuy 5 science books. Communication with thisaudience can have theeffect ofspreading themessage more broadly since science attentives tend tobemore pohtically active than average, have higher than average levels of education andincome, arecomparatively well informed about science andtechnology issues, and have ahigh levelofcross-talk with other audiences.'''

Research andEvaluation Good communications crucial, andmost often overlooked aspect ofcommunications. Commercial communicators study their audiences extensively, and now thatmore non-profit institutions arecommuni- cating directly toaudiences, rather thanthrough inter- mediaries such asjournalists, public affairs specialists need tostudy their intended audiences aswell. Methods include ofthepitfalls include notclearly stating the goals thatadditional effort needs tobe focused onboth formative andsummative evaluation. Conclusions andRecommendations Science andtechnology communication with the public byresearch, education, andother institutions is undergoing arenaissance ofideasandtechniques.
