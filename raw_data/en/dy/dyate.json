Alternative Medicine Practitioner The holistic approach of medical care focuses on treating patients as a whole person, and not individual ailing parts. Through this, people suffering from certain conditions or diseases such as [PCOS](https://centrespringmd.com/what-is-pcos-integrative-therapies-and-improving-fertility/) receive treatments that focus on healing their body as a whole. Specifically, holistic medicine practitioners provide medical advice on changing lifestyle habits and diet for long-term PCOS relief and cure. PCOS Myths According to Holistic Medicine Practitioners 1. PCOS is rare. Worldwide, there is a lack of awareness regarding PCOS (1). In fact, at any given time, there are women around the world who are suffering from it but do not realize it. In many cultures and countries, talking about menstruation and fertility, even with a doctor, is considered taboo (1). Therefore, a lot of women simply assume they are infertile, or something is wrong with their bodies. Are you are experiencing [PCOS symptoms](https://centrespringmd.com/pcos-causes-integrative-treatment/)? Make an appointment with a [holistic health practitioner](https://centrespringmd.com/how-a-holistic-primary-care-doctor-helps-the-whole-family/). 2. Something you did or are doing caused you to have PCOS. This myth is connected to the first one. Since many people suffering from PCOS don't realize they have it, it is also harder for medical experts to analyze its origin. Surprisingly, 1 in 10 women suffers from PCOS, which is caused by a [hormonal imbalance](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/hormone-imbalance/) and problems with metabolism (2). 3. Women with PCOS cannot get pregnant. You most definitely can get [pregnant with PCOS](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/fertility-support/). Using an ovulation calculator shows you the days you are most likely to be fertile (3). Increase your chances of getting pregnant.

PCOS is linked to insulin resistance and therefore can affect women of all different [weight proportions](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/weight-management/) (4). Similarly, many diabetics are of a healthy weight. Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for [diabetes](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/diabetes-support/), heart disease, and [obesity](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/obesity/) (5). Although, being overweight is not a guarantee you will suffer from PCOS. 5. Lose weight to get rid of PCOS. While you can lose weight to help [balance your hormones](https://centrespringmd.com/services/hormone-balancing-replacement/), there is no cure for PCOS (6). Do not expect to be cured of PCOS just because you lose weight. Holistic Medicine Practitioners Near Me Are you suffering from PCOS or worried that your symptoms might be PCOS?
