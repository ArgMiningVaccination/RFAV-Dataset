Immunologist Dr. Steven Templeton on Healthy Infections, the Appearance of Safety, and Shutdown Culture](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/are-we-too-afraid-of-germs-immunologist-dr-steven/id1471411980?i=1000626690904&l=ar) Are We Too Afraid of Germs? Immunologist Dr. Steven Templeton on Healthy Infections, the Appearance of Safety, and Shutdown Culture \"Up until early 2020, the idea that you would wear a cloth face covering to prevent giving someone else a respiratory infection or acquiring it yourself\u2014there was no evidence to support that. But after things had been shut down for a while, there seemed to be a need to give the public something that they could believe was going to make them safer\u2014convince them that maybe they could go out if they just wore something over their face. That was enough. That was the appearance of safety, giving them that control\u2014the illusion of control.\" In this episode, I sit down with Dr. Steven Templeton, professor of immunology at Indiana University School of Medicine and the author of a new book, \"Fear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.\" \"It's offering people this idea that they can completely eliminate risks\u2014for their children, for themselves,\" says Dr. Templeton. Could our fear and excessive avoidance of germs and microbes actually be backfiring? And how will the rise of what Dr. Templeton calls a \"safety culture\" impact future generations? - ['Reign of Terror' on Campuses Post-George Floyd and the Threat of AI Internalized Bias: Cornell Law Professor Bill Jacobson](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/reign-of-terror-on-campuses-post-george-floyd-and/id1471411980?i=1000626630445&l=ar) 'Reign of Terror' on Campuses Post-George Floyd and the Threat of AI Internalized Bias: Cornell Law Professor Bill Jacobson \"Group results are going to be baked into the system without any regard for the individual. And it's going to take place at such a deep level that it will be very hard to prove. The administrator at Cornell or Harvard or Yale can say, 'I know nothing about this. We don't discriminate. We're just using software that says it's bias-free. Don't sue me!'\" In this episode, I sit down with Cornell law professor William Jacobson. Out of Cornell's 1,700 faculty members, he is the only one openly conservative, and for over a decade has faced threats, harassment, and organized campaigns to eject him from the school. \"The one diversity that you will never hear implemented on campuses is diversity of viewpoint,\" says Mr. Jacobson. He is the founder of the Legal Insurrection blog and foundation, which exposes and takes action against DEI discrimination in higher education, medical schools, and the corporate world. \"When you look at these DEI statements, they not only require you to recite that you agree with this, they also want you to show how you have tailored your career to advance it,\" says Mr. Jacobson. We discuss the rise of critical race theory on college campuses and its spread to other institutions, and the importance of elevating the individual over group identity. We also dive into the recent Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action, and the threat of AI algorithms infused with DEI principles. \"Right now, we're on the cusp of this explosion of baked-in quotas through technology. Now is the time that people have to learn about it,\" says Mr. Jacobson. - [Kevin McKernan Talks COVID Vaccine DNA Contamination, the Monkey Virus SV40 Promoter, and What's Actually in the Vaccines](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/kevin-mckernan-talks-covid-vaccine-dna-contamination/id1471411980?i=1000626138852&l=ar) Kevin McKernan Talks COVID Vaccine DNA Contamination, the Monkey Virus SV40 Promoter, and What's Actually in the Vaccines \"There was a case where Dr. He in China did some genome edits on two children\u2014on two babies. He made two CRISPR babies. That guy went to jail, all right? Suddenly, fast forward to today: we're willing to take that risk on billions of people.\" Kevin McKernan worked at the Human Genome Project at MIT as manager of research and development. Today, he is the chief scientific officer and founder of Medicinal Genomics, and is researching DNA contamination in the COVID-19 genetic vaccines. \"There are limits on how much DNA can be in a vaccine precisely because of the concern over DNA integration,\" says Mr. McKernan. \"What we do know is in both shots, there is residual DNA, and this DNA is either right above the regulatory limit or tenfold higher.\" How do the different mRNA vaccine components impact the body? What's really going on with the SB 40 monkey virus promoter that's in them? Why should we be concerned about lipid nanoparticles and DNA open reading frames? And how is synthetic mRNA fundamentally different from naturally-occurring mRNA? \"Australia has different guidelines on what constitutes gene therapy, and it looks like these vaccines may, in fact, fall under that category, given the fact that there's DNA in them and they're using LNPs. And we now know that some of the DNA in there has been used and documented as a gene therapy tool,\" says Mr. McKernan. - [A Medical Scandal as Horrific as Lobotomies: Dr. Miriam Grossman on 'Gender-Affirming Care' and What Parents Must Know](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/a-medical-scandal-as-horrific-as-lobotomies-dr/id1471411980?i=1000626137446&l=ar) A Medical Scandal as Horrific as Lobotomies: Dr. Miriam Grossman on 'Gender-Affirming Care' and What Parents Must Know Sponsor special: Up to $2,500 of FREE silver AND a FREE safe on qualifying orders - Call 855-862-3377 or text \"AMERICAN\" to 6-5-5-3-2 \"These kids that are going through gender-affirming care, they become lifelong patients. They become lifelong consumers of pharmaceuticals,\" says Dr. Miriam Grossman. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and author of \"Lost in Trans Nation: A Child Psychiatrist's Guide Out of the Madness.\" In this episode, Dr. Grossman breaks down what's causing the sharp rise in teenagers saying they're transgender, what every parent needs to know about so-called \"gender-affirming care,\" and a series of steps parents can take at home and at school to protect their children. \"What you want to do is put the school on notice, even if your child is only entering kindergarten. You want the school to know that you do not want your child exposed to gender ideology. ... You do not give your permission for your child to meet with the guidance counselor without your knowledge or with any other third party without your knowledge. And you certainly do not give permission to the school to socially transition your child,\" Dr. Grossman says. - [The Battle Against Communist Reeducation in Hong Kong: Freedom Fighter Frances Hui Shares Her Remarkable Story](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/the-battle-against-communist-reeducation-in-hong-kong/id1471411980?i=1000625737044&l=ar) The Battle Against Communist Reeducation in Hong Kong: Freedom Fighter Frances Hui Shares Her Remarkable Story \"A lot of my friends that I grew up with, that I met during my activism, a lot of them are either in jail or they're in exile,\" says Frances Hui. She joined the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong when she was only 14 years old. Now she's living in exile in the United States. While the Chinese regime is \"putting millions of Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps, when they are also doing that to Tibetans, when they're also putting thousands of Hong Kongers in jail, they realize none of these human rights abuses comes [at] any cost ... That bar for accountability keeps getting lower and lower,\" Ms. Hui says. In this episode, we discuss her remarkable story, the Chinese regime's attempts to brainwash people and rewrite history, and her hopes and fears for her city. \"I was fortunate enough that I experienced that golden era of Hong Kong. I got to be engaged in civil society. I [could] go to the streets and fight for my own freedom ... But a lot of the young people now ... they don't get to grow up in that environment,\" Ms. Hui says. \"We are going to have a generation that [doesn't] know what's right or wrong.\" - [Oli London: How TikTok Fueled My Gender Confusion](https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/oli-london-how-tiktok-fueled-my-gender-confusion/id1471411980?i=1000625733784&l=ar) Oli London: How TikTok Fueled My Gender Confusion \"Bad behavior is rewarded by TikTok. You're given an incentive to behave like that ... So when we see influencers acting crazy, and then people sharing their transition journey, it gets more and more extreme, to the point where you have someone like Dylan Mulvaney saying that he wants to become pregnant.\" Social media influencer Oli London became known for undergoing many surgeries in his quest to look like a Korean man and then, during the pandemic, a Korean woman. He was one of the first influencers to join TikTok, and he says the social media platform fueled his gender confusion. Now he's sharing his story in his new memoir \"Gender Madness: One Man's Devastating Struggle with Woke Ideology and His Battle to Protect Children.\" \"So many kids look up to influencers more than they look up to teachers or doctors. They respect them more. So if an influencer says something\u2014and it could be very harmful\u2014teens will just follow it blindly, like a cult, almost like a religion. So I feel like I had a responsibility, and I woke up,\" Mr. London says. "}
