Refer to the [Clinical Laboratory Scientist License (CLS)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OSPHLD/LFS/Pages/CLS.aspx) (Examinations section). Our program produces highly qualified graduates who are ready to immediately enter the clinical laboratory profession. Our staff includes clinical instructors who are knowledgeable and experienced clinical laboratory scientists, as well as physicians, leaders and other professionals who embrace the role of educator. In keeping with the Scripps mission, we educate trainees in a caring environment and mentor them to make a positive difference in the communities we serve. Currently, our CLS program does not charge a tuition. Just as Scripps believes all patients should have access to affordable and quality health care, we believe future scientists should have access to affordable and quality education. Please note that students are responsible for costs associated with housing, transportation, textbooks, licensing/certification exam fees, immunizations required for health clearance and medical insurance. A stipend is not offered at this time. Mission statement The mission of the Scripps Health Clinical Laboratory Scientist Training program is to provide a program that uses proven educational methodologies to teach best practices in clinical laboratory medicine in both theory and practice, to continuously strive for improvement in outcomes, and to graduate competent, highly skilled professionals who are passionate about quality patient care and outcomes. Program goals Program goals were developed in alignment with our program's mission, vision and objectives. The goals of the training program are to provide an educational experience for the clinical laboratory science trainees so that graduates will: - Demonstrate entry-level technical competence and sound, independent judgment and problem-solving abilities in clinical laboratory professions. - Successfully pass licensing and certification examinations and successfully compete for entry-level employment positions as a contributing member of the healthcare community. - Demonstrate high standards of professional behaviors and ethics, and a passion for continuous learning. Vision statement Upon successful completion of the program, the graduate will transition to a contributing member of the healthcare team, providing quality, timely and cost-effective laboratory results and consult to healthcare providers. The graduate will continue to grow in knowledge and skills, become involved in process improvements, and support the profession through mentorship and publicity. What is a clinical laboratory scientist? A clinical laboratory scientist is a health care professional who performs a variety of chemical, hematological, immunologic, microscopic and bacteriological diagnostic analyses on body fluids, such as blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, synovial fluid and other specimens. A CLS uses sophisticated biomedical instrumentation and technology. The role requires a blend of manual dexterity and reasoned judgement to provide accurate laboratory results that form the basis of approximately 70-80% of all medical decisions. Clinical lab scientists are qualified to pursue laboratory and leadership careers in many environments, including hospitals and clinics, reference and forensic institutions, industry (such as biotech and research), and public health. This role is also referred to as a medical laboratory scientist (MLS) or medical technologist (MT). CLS careers at Scripps Health You might be asking yourself, \"Is a clinical laboratory scientist a good career for me?\" A clinical laboratory scientist is a good career for people who enjoy the intrigue and challenge of science and medicine while making a difference behind the scenes by contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Why seek CLS training opportunities at Scripps Health over the many CLS programs in California? As a legacy organization in San Diego, Scripps is consistently honored for clinical innovation, quality care and leadership.

The knowledge and skills of a clinical laboratory scientist are in high demand and valued not only by hospital clinical laboratories, but also by other employers in research, forensics, physician office laboratories, veterinary laboratories, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and in other health care industries, such as those in marketing, sales, service, product development, equipment and supplies. There continues to be a critical need for medical professionals with MLS certification and/or CLS licensure, as laboratories strive to keep up with the demand of new and more complex tests and to replace retirees. What is a clinical laboratory scientist's salary? Clinical laboratory scientist jobs are stable and satisfying. Salaries can range from $40,000 to over $100,000, depending on experience, geographical location and level of responsibilities. In San Diego, typical new grad salaries may exceed $90,000 per year. How do I become a clinical lab scientist in California? Successful completion of our 12-month CLS certificate program leads to conferring of a certificate of completion and qualifies you to sit for an approved certifying organization examination, such as the American Society for Clinical Pathology Board of Certification (ASCP BOC) [MLS generalist examination](https://www.ascp.org/content/board-of-certification/get-credentialed). For a comprehensive list of other approved examinations, see the [California Department of Public Health website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OSPHLD/LFS/Pages/Approved-Certifying-Organization-Examinations.aspx#CLS). Completion of the Scripps Health CLS Training Program and receipt of a passing score on the American Society for Clinical Pathology Board of Certification (ASCP BOC) MLS generalist exam, or other California qualifying certification exam, meets CLS licensing requirements in California as well as confers a national MLS certification as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. Refer to the [ASCP BOC State Licensure information page](https://www.ascp.org/content/board-of-certification/get-credentialed/#state-licensure). What is a clinical laboratory scientist license? A California CLS license (CLS generalist license) allows you to work and report results in all specialty areas of a clinical laboratory. A CLS limited license allows you to work and report results in a specialty or subspecialty section of a clinical laboratory defined by the license. Refer to the [CDPH-LFS website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OSPHLD/LFS/Pages/CLS.aspx) for specifics on generalist and limited licenses, scope of practice, academic requirements, training or experience, and examinations. CLS licensure is required in California. Other states may require only medical laboratory scientist (MLS) certification, which may be referred to as medical technologist certification or MLS certification. Programs that offer training for certification are known as medical laboratory scientist (MLS) or clinical laboratory scientist (CLS) training programs. How do I obtain a CLS trainee license (TRL) in California? A CLS Trainee License (TRL) allows you to train or intern (not work) as a licensed clinical laboratory scientist trainee in a CDPH-LFS department approved CLS training program. The TRL is required by all CLS training (internship) programs in California. Refer to the [CDPH-LFS website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/OSPHLD/LFS/Pages/CLS-Trainee.aspx) on how to obtain a TRL. Where can a clinical lab scientist work? Clinical laboratory scientists find challenging employment positions in a variety of laboratory settings.
