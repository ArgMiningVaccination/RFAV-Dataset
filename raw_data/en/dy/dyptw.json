A clothed body therapy, Shiatsu utilizes the same meridian structure (lines of energetic flow) as in acupuncture. Finger pressure (shi = finger, atsu = pressure) along these meridian pathways distinguishes Shiatsu bodywork from other Asian mat styles. It is often referred to as \"acupuncture without the needles.\" As in acupuncture, talking and palpation are among the assessment tools used to hone-in on the receiver's needs. Along with asking, I use abdominal palpation to addresses my clients body in the exact moment he or she comes to receive body work. Most characteristic of my work is direct pressure along the torso, limbs, hands, feet and head, joint rotations, joint mobilization, stretches, and specific pressure on treatment points. [Shiatsu](shiatsu.html) is the foundation of my therapy services. Using the meridian pathways commonly associated with acupuncture this technique addresses the human being on physical, mental and emotional levels. Shiatsu is a Japanese \"mat\" style, like other body therapies of Asia, and is always done with the receiver clothed. This bodywork technique is compatible with most massage and therapeutic modalities. My commitment as a Shiatsu Practitioner is to educate and empower people to actively participate and improve their health. Please see my Shiatsu page for more information or to book an appointment at one of my office locations in Boulder, CO. This ancient healing art is the modality best suited for me. Being petite and limber, shiatsu allows me to use my entire body weight when necessary. Shiatsu affords me the ability to connect with the receiver while observing mind and body coordination within myself. It has been my honor to witness incredible healing events since beginning my practice in 1998. I have treated cancer survivors, women through pregnancy, infants and children, athletes, people in deep transitional phases and folks with work-related discomfort. Shiatsu is appropriate for all ages. The powerful pharmacy of essential oils and supplements from [Young Living](youngliving.html) are the core of my healing and nutritional recommendations.
