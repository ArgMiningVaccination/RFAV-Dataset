I couldnt be happier, this company needs to have the ability to invest in stock lol...i feel like a goddess when i smell and use these products. I feel blessed to have fumbled across you on Shop one day while browsing! I loveeeeee this oil so much, it feels amazing on my skin, doesn't leave a oily residue and smells so good. Makes my face look so good, bright and hydrated. Definitely recommend this. Will continue to buy 100%. I have a good arsenal of scalpnoils on use as pre shampoo treatments for scalp health, strength growth. I loved thenoowehouse formula here especially with Neem which is a very healing variety but can smell disgusting. It blends effortlessly into this formula among being the perfect consistent of not too light or heavy/greasy. Per than I now adore if for both hair, body, and a cuticle oil which is beyond rate to find in one formula for me among omega so healing! Only thing that works for extremely dry hands Excellent product! I love everything about it: the smell, the texture and the fact that one drop is enough for my whole face. I also use it on my hair. "}
