The presence of Brett yeast causes a depreciation of the quality of aged fine wines, producing molecules of unpleasant odors and biogenic amines that are harmful to human health. More specifically, standard quartz crystal (S-QCM) and homemade 4 nm gold transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-grid patterned quartz (multi-TEM QCM) are herein proposed for biofunctionalization steps with different ssDNA sequences. By employing a rapid and efficient drop and collect protocol, the specific detection of 1 pg/\u00b5L ssDNA Brett of a short sequence and 100 ng/L DNA of B. bruxellensis extracted from a wine sample (VR2008) is reported.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-05-18", "cleaned_text": "Quartz Crystal Microbalance Genosensing of Brettanomyces bruxellensis Yeast in Wine Using a Rapid and Efficient Drop and Collect Protocol [https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11050562](https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11050562) [DNA and Small Molecular Complex Crystallization]( /journal/crystals/special_issues/molecular_complexcrystallization )) [1](#B1-crystals-11-00562)]. Unfortunately, the presence of Brettanomyces bruxellensis spoilage microorganisms during the wine production, principally in the aging phase, affect the aroma quality and may be responsible for important economic losses. [2](#B2-crystals-11-00562)]. The presence of volatile phenols, 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol, are specifically responsible for [3](#B3-crystals-11-00562), [4](#B4-crystals-11-00562)]. and off-flavor\" N-heterocyclic compounds such as 2-acetyl-tetrahydro-pyridine (ATHP) The acoustic transduction named quartz microbalance (QCM), uses a thin piezoelectric circular plate sputtered with two gold electrodes on both sides [ [20](#B20-crystals-11-00562)] under liquid conditions where the addition or removal of any mass from the crystal would disturb the resonant frequency [ [21](#B21-crystals-11-00562)].

[Table 1](#crystals-11-00562-t001). Before acoustic measurements, all three ssDNA sequences were stored at 20 \u00b0C. 2.5.

Evaluation of Gold Grain Sizes Formed through TEM Grid on Quartz Crystal 2.12. Processing the QCM Data 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. SEM Characterization of S-QCM Gold Electrode Before and After 4 nm Au Evaporation [Figure 3](#crystals-11-00562-f003)A), while after the evaporation of the gold thin film (4 nm) through TEM-grids ( [Figure 3](#crystals-11-00562-f003)B) the random formation of nanostructures were observed between pre-existent larger nanoislands gold structures [ [24](#B24-crystals-11-00562)]. The size distribution of the gold nanoparticles was also analyzed over four selected zones ( [Figure 3](#crystals-11-00562-f003)C) based on the recorded SEM image ( [Figure 3](#crystals-11-00562-f003)B). Thus, whatever the selected zone, a narrow distribution of the nanoparticles in the range of 4-12 nm was estimated, while the most abundant nanoparticles sizes were 8 nm NPs (from 27.5 to 35%). Overall, the size distribution of NPs is almost symmetrical over the four zones with some negligible size differences in the formation process. 3.2. Genosensing of ssDNA-Brett on S-QCM Gold Electrode\u2014Positive and Negative Controls Using Drop and Collect Protocol [Figure 4](#crystals-11-00562-f004)) were proposed based on the variation of the frequency frequency = (fref fi) calculated by subtracting the reference vibration frequency of the quartz (fref) prior dropping to the measured frequencies (fi) versus the concentration of tested ssDNA Brett probes. The frequency\u2014fi was measured after collecting the 10 L drop and washing the gold electrode with S-ddwater, and after the signal stabilization. [Figure 4](#crystals-11-00562-f004), in the presence of the CS-positive control, f is always negative, decreases monotonically with respect to the logarithm of the content (R2 = 0.9627), which confirms the expected analytical performance of the biosensor for the detection of the specific target. The detection limit is 1 pg/\u00b5L and is in good agreement with the Sauerbrey's equation, which predicts a decrease in frequency at the increase the added mass on the quartz surface. Moreover, f is mainly positive for NCS-negative control showing an anti-Sauerbrey's behavior. These results underline the selectivity of the acoustic Brett biosensor, which can unambiguously distinguish between CS-positive and NCS-negative controls. 3.3. Brett S-QCM Crystal [Figure 5](#crystals-11-00562-f005)). because the mass of the ssDNA short sequences (CS-positive control) was not comparable with the longer dsDNA extracted from the wine sample VR2008. 3.4.
