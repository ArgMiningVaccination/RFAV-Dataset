The brand's website claims that after years of searching for the perfect supplement, the popular celebrity and influencer decided to do it herself. But do Lemme Gummies contain research-backed ingredients at effective doses, or are they another underwhelming celebrity product? Do they contain any questionable additive ingredients? What retailer sells Lemme for the best price? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of Lemme gummies? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze the ingredients in two of the most popular Lemme gummies supplements (Matcha and Debloat) based on medical studies to give our take on whether they're likely to support optimal health, or if they're a waste of money. We'll provide a cost comparison to show which retailer sells Lemme for the best price, and feature real, unsponsored customer reviews. Ingredient Analysis - Matcha Gummies The active ingredients in Lemme Matcha Gummies are shown above. Vitamin B12 is often included in energy supplements and we're not sure why. A [meta-study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000524/) published in the Nutrients journal found no convincing evidence for this vitamin to support cognitive function or fatigue. We haven't come across any convincing medical evidence that vitamin B12 supplementation is beneficial in those without a vitamin B12 deficiency, nor does Lemme cite any on their product page. Organic matcha is included at a dose of 50 milligrams (mg). This is a relatively low dose. One single teaspoon of matcha provides a dose of 2,000 mg [according to](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/595513/nutrients) the USDA. This means that one teaspoon of matcha has a dose 40x higher than the amount in one serving of Lemme Matcha. We haven't come across any medical evidence that matcha at this low of a dose has health benefits, nor does the brand cite any on their product page. Coenzyme Q10 can support energy production, although we can't find any medical evidence it does so at the 20 mg dose in Lemme Matcha. Most of the medical studies we've reviewed while researching this article use a CoQ10 dose at or over 100 mg. Added sugar is included, and while the dose of 3 grams (g) is relatively low, a 2019 [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31246081/) suggests that added sugar in excess can increase risk of obesity and diabetes. It may be worthwhile for health-conscious American consumers to avoid added sugar in supplements, since there's already so much added sugar in the American diet. The inactive ingredients in Lemme Matcha are shown below: Citric acid is a preservative and flavor enhancer that can cause whole-body inflammation, as we documented in our review of [Apetropics](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/apetropics-one-chews-review) gummies. Overall, we can't find any evidence that any of the active ingredients in this formulation support energy at their included dose, nor does the brand cite any. We do not currently recommend this supplement. [Pique Matcha Green Tea](https://piquelife.sjv.io/DVDEGn) is our top matcha product because it only contains three ingredients (organic green tea, organic matcha and organic spearmint) and is free of added sugar and citric acid. Interested consumers can check out Pique Matcha Green Tea [at this link](https://piquelife.sjv.io/DVDEGn) to the product page on the brand's official website. Before analyzing the ingredients in Lemme Debloat, we'll share a YouTube video that features doctors with some harsh words about the Lemme brand. Doctors Review Lemme Gummies A YouTube video from the popular \"Tea Spill\" channel has over 500,000 views and features doctors discussing whether or not Lemme Gummies are likely to be effective or harmful: Ingredient Analysis - Lemme Debloat The active ingredients in Lemme Debloat are shown above. Probiotics are [clinically shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33978391/) to support gut health and help the gut heal from dysbiosis (when the imbalance of \"good\" and \"bad\" bacteria is off), and 3 billion colony-forming units (CFU) is one the low end of the range of what we consider to be an effective maintenance dose. Xylooligosaccharides is a prebiotic ingredient, but we can't find any medical studies showing it to be effective at a dose as low as exists in Lemme Debloat (80 mg). A [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5019895/) published in the Gastroenterology Research and Practice journal reported that xylooligosaccharide supplementation improved the balance of beneficial versus harmful bacterial strains in the gut, but the dosage used was 1,200 mg per day, or 15x the dose in Lemme. Added sugar is included in this blend, and we discussed in the previous ingredient analysis section why we don't recommend supplements with this ingredient. The inactive ingredients in Lemme Debloat are shown below: Citric acid is included, and we discussed the potential health downsides of this ingredient in the previous ingredient analysis section. Natural flavor is a healthier alternative to artificial flavor, and as we documented in our review of [Proper CBD Gummies](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/proper-cbd-gummies-review), some flavoring additives have toxicity concerns according to at least one medical review. Overall, we consider Lemme Debloat potentially likely for supporting gut health, however we don't currently recommend the supplement due to the inactive ingredients. [Supergut Fiber Mix](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2011129&u=3153363&m=124607&urllink=www%2Esupergut%2Ecom%2Fresistant%2Dstarch%2Dfiber%2Dmix%2F%3Fsku%3D300101%2D1&afftrack=) is our top gut health supplement pick, because it contains resistant starch and is free of added sugar, flavoring agents and citric acid. A [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352178/) published in the Advances in Nutrition journal analyzed data from various clinical trials and concluded that resistant starch intake was associated with improved gut health, weight loss in overweight and obese individuals, and improved insulin resistance.
