It's wonderful. Chamomile is also a good remedy for gas, but not as powerful as fennel. Diane, When I had my first son, my mother in law told me to give him a fennel water bottle for gas. I thought it was an Italian superstition! LOL When my younger brother developed ringworm, my Dad took a sheet of newspaper and shaped it into a cone. He tucked the end at the open part of the cone under and into the crossing layers, so that end would not unravel and that part was flat. Next he set it on a ceramic plate. He started the tip of the cone on fire and let the tar sweat accumulate on the plate. Then he used his index finger to scope up the tar and rubbed it on the ringworm area. It worked well. Ringworm was completely gone in a few days. I see the term \"cold stomach\" mentioned several times in the Herb Folklore list. Could you tell me what the term means & where it originated? A cold stomach was caused by a sluggish digestion (as opposed to a hot stomach, which had a lively appetite and digestion - think of teenagers who can eat tons of food and still be hungry). Food, especially hard to digest food like meat, was not digested quickly and was said to sit in the stomach, causing lack of appetite, indigestion, gas, and a feeling of heaviness. Pungent, bitter, and warming herbs and spices like fennel, dill, ginger, anise, etc., were needed to 'stimulate' the digestion to action, and also to help with the side effects of indigestion and gas. Earliest I can find is Galen in the 2nd century AD, but he might have found it in Hippocrates five or six centuries earlier. The only proven treatment is to take a thyroxine supplement every day to replace your body's natural hormones. Speak to your physician. There are some natural alternatives to stimulate the thyroid, however herbs can cause harm as well as good so it would be important to work with a herbalist. For example, herbalists often recommend increasing sea vegetables, such as bladderwrack capsules, which are rich in iodine, or you could sprinkle seagreens onto your meals. The minerals selenium and zinc are important; you could find them in a daily multi-vitamin or supplement. Some practitioners recommend avoiding foods in the brassica family (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts and cauliflower) and soya products. Kelp is also an excellent source of real iodine. Kelp can be found in tablet form and is usually inexpensive. I am searching for a natural cure for my lazy thyroid. Tests prove that it is not functioning as it should, but the hormone that the doctor prescribs is not a cure just a fix of sorts. Any help is appreciated. MamaB I'm searching for an old folklore tale re: Wolf * Plants * Trees & Man and the agreement between plants and animals was that man was good as he cleared and culivated healing herbs to help the trees and animals heal and he cured diseases----- so the wolf did not eat him. Can anyone help. I heard it as a child and that was 45 years ago. "}
