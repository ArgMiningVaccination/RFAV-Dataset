This report was requested by the American Urological Association in preparation for clinical guideline development. These reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technol ogies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to de veloping their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research or ganizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review prio r to their release. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence report s and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality.

Director, Center for Outcomes and Evidence Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Shilpa H. Amin, M.D, M.Bsc, FAAFP EPC Program Task Order Officer Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Acknowledgments We are indebted to a tireless gr oup of colleagues who made this re port possible. Each step of systematic reviews draws on the skills and attention of an entire team. Dr. Shilpa Amin has been an insightful task or der officer who brought spec ial considerations and decisions into focus. She was patient with our many questions, created a strong link with our project partner, and provided practical advice as we tackled challenges. Ms. Rachel Bazan was our energetic student worker. She spent hours helping to track and file documents, always positive, and always ready to ensure that the project investigators had what they needed to do their work. Dr. Liana Castel served as a quality grader and brought to th e project her expertise in study design and analytic methods. We thank her for he r thoughtful attention to the process of quality grading and willingness to help. Her comments on approaches to study reporting, particularly as they related to the implications of loss to followup and drop out, were especially valued. Ms. Allison Glasser provided research assistan ce on this report, including combing papers for specific data points requested by the investigators and formatting summary and evidence tables. We appreciate her eagerness to learn and em ploy systematic review methods and her commitment to ensuring that tables were fo rmatted exactly to specification. Ms. Glasser demonstrated great flexibility unde r pressure filling many needs. Dr. Mark Hartmann brought his extraordinary a ttention to detail - and his commitment to perfection - to completion of the evidence tables. He spent many, many hours checking and rechecking tables both for formatting and for conten t. His ability to point out inconsistencies and enhance uniformity was key to ensuring smooth development of the evidence tables. Ms. Sarah McLellan was a source of energy for al l as she enthusiastically went about formatting evidence tables and completing and organizing appendices. We are gratef ul to lean on such detail oriented and focused research staff w ith a gift for encouraging others. Ms. Toye Spencer oversaw the completion and formatting of the summary tables, and other critical elements of the report as a whole. Sh e transferred data from investigator-developed spreadsheets into more tables than we imagined - and made sure that formatting was consistent, keeping track of the innumerable sets of changes that came her way. Ms. Rachel Walden is a key member of the library science staff - her support of Ms. Jerome, including her creative insights and detailed approach to litera ture searching was invaluable. Her thoughtful attention to detail in re viewing abstracts and articles fo r inclusion in the review was a generous gift to the project and to the EPC as a whole. iv Structured Abstract Objectives: The Vanderbilt Evidence-based Practice Center systematically reviewed evidence on treatment of overactive bladde r (OAB), urge urinary incontinence, and related symptoms. We focused on prevalence and incidence, treatment out comes, comparisons of treatments, modifiers of outcomes, and costs. Data: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE\u00ae, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Review Methods: We included studies published in English from January 1966 to October 2008. We excluded studies with fewer than 50 pa rticipants, fewer than 75 percent women, or lack of relevance to OAB. Of 232 included pub lications, 20 were good qua lity, 145 were fair, and 67 poor. We calculated weighted averages of outcome effects and conducted a mixed-effects meta-analysis to investigat e outcomes of pharmacologic treatments across studies. Results: OAB affects more than 10 to 15 percent of adult women, with 5 to 10 percent experiencing urge urinary incontinence (UUI) m onthly or more often. Six available medications are effective in short term studies: estimates fr om meta-analysis models suggest extended release forms (taken once a day) reduce UUI by 1.78 (95 percent confidence inte rval (CI): 1.61, 1.94) episodes per day, and voids by 2.24 (95 percent CI: 2.03, 2.46) per day. Immediate release forms (taken twice or more a day) reduce UUI by 1.46 (95 percent CI: 1.28, 1.64), and voids by 2.17 (95 percent CI: 1.81, 2.54). As context, placebo reduces UUI episodes by 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30), and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. No one drug was definitively superior to others, including comparison of newer more selective agents to older antimuscarinics. Current evidence is insufficient to guide c hoice of other therapies including sacral neuromodulation, instillation of oxybutynin, and inje ctions of botulinum toxin. Acupuncture was the sole complementary and alternative medicine treatment, among reflexology and hypnosis, with early evidence of benefit. Th e strength of the evidence is insufficient to fully inform choice of these treatments. Select behavioral interven tions were associated with symptom improvements comparable to medications. Limited evidence su ggests no clear benefit from adding behavioral interventions at the time of initiation of pharmacologic treatment. Conclusions: OAB and associated symptoms are common. Treatment effects are modest. Quality of life and treatment satisfaction measures suggest such improvements can be important to women. The amount of high quality literature available is meager for helping guide women's choices. Gaps include weak or absent data about long-term followup, poor ly characterized and potentially concerning harms, information about be st choices to minimize side effects, and study of how combinations of approach es may best be used. This is problematic since the condition is chronic and a single treatment m odality is unlikely to fully reso lve symptoms for most women. v Contents Executive Summary.................................................................................................................. 1 Evidence Report ..................................................................................................................... 13 Chapter 1.

Executive Summary Introduction Importance of Overactive Bladder Treatment At minimum, 11 to 16 million women in the United States cope on a daily basis with symptoms that include sudden strong urges to urin ate, difficulty delaying voids, frequent trips to the bathroom, and in many cases involuntar y loss of urine when urgency strikes.1-4 They may wear pads for accidents, plan ahead for access to bathrooms, and modify their social and work lives to accommodate their symptoms. Some are very distressed by the symptoms whether mild or severe, and others find mechanisms to ad apt, reporting little troubl e with symptoms or interference with normal routines. Others report their symptoms negatively influence quality of life factors as varied as self-e steem, self-assessment of attrac tiveness, and sexual function. Many women believe that some amount of urinary incon tinence is inevitable with aging. The majority of women with these symptoms do not talk with their health care providers concerning their bladder dysfunction, and providers may not systema tically inquire. As a result, a small minority receive treatment. Popular wisdom encourages self-management of symptoms of OAB through reduction of fluid intake, cutting back on caffeine, modifying voiding habits, and taking note of what individual factors influen ce severity of symptoms. For this review, we operationally defined OAB as \"idiopathic urinary urgency and frequency with or without associated urge urinary incontinence in adult fe males, not related to neurogenic conditions or as a result of (s tress incontinence) surgery.\" The report is focused on treatments that are prescribed or provided by a healthcare pr actitioner and have been formally investigated including: Pharmacologic treatments, including prescr iption medications, both pills and patches Surgeries and procedures, such as sacral neuromodulation and botulinum injections Behavioral interventions, such as behavior modification programs and bladder training Complementary and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture and reflexology OAB management is usually individualized to address the component symptom(s) that the patient finds most bothersome. Wh ere possible, we have tried to address treatments with respect to the primary component symptoms of OAB: urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency, so that the women, their health care providers, payors, policy-makers, and others have a detailed picture of the expected ou tcomes of available treatments. Key Questions In preparing this report, we have answered the following key questions: KQ1. What is the prevalence and incidence of overactive bladde r as estimated in representative populations? KQ2. Among women with overactive bladder, what are the short and long-term outcomes of the following treatment approaches, or combinations of treatment approaches? 1 a. Pharmacologic treatments b. Procedural and surgical treatments c. Behavioral and physical therapy treatments d. Complementary and alternativ e medicine treatments KQ3. Where direct comparisons have been made between or among treatment modalities of interest, which modalities achie ve superior outcomes with respect to benefits, short and long-term risks, and quality of life? KQ4. Are the short and long term outcomes of these treatment approaches modified by clinical presentation, physical exam findings, urodynamic fi ndings, menopausal status, age or other factors? KQ5. What are the costs associated with these treatment approaches? Methods Literature search. We employed multi-term search strategies to retrieve research about treatment of overactive bladder in women, incl uding exploration of three databases: PubMed, MEDLINE\u00ae, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also hand-searched the reference lis ts of relevant article s to identify additional studies. Controlled vocabulary terms served as th e foundation of our searches in each database, complemented by additional keyword phrases to re present the myriad ways in which overactive bladder is referred to in the c linical literature. We also employed indexing terms within each of the databases to exclude undesired publication types (e.g., reviews, case reports, CME handouts) and items published in languages other than En glish. We excluded studies that (1) were published in languages other than English; (2) did not report info rmation pertinent to the key questions; (3) had fewer than 50 participants [at enrollment]; (4) were not original studies; and (5) provided data only for stress or mixed urinary incontinence. Study selection. Two reviewers separately evaluated abstracts for inclusion or exclusion. If one reviewer concluded the abst ract should be included for full review of the article, it was retained. For the full article review, two reviewer s read each article and decided whether it met our inclusion criteria. Discordance was resolved by third-party adjudication. Quality assessment. The research team used a quality assessment approach that ensured capture of key points most relevant to this literature. Quality was assessed by two reviewers independently, who resolved differences throug h discussion, review of the publications and coming to consensus with the team. Data extraction. All team members shared th e task of entering information into the evidence tables. After initial data extrac tion, another member of the team reviewed the article and checked all table entries for accuracy, completeness, a nd consistency. The two abstractors reconciled disagreements concerning the informa tion reported in the evidence tables. Evidence synthesis. The information included in tables reflects those outcomes most consistently reported in the literature: urge in continence episodes and number of voids per day. (Studies with weekly or other metrics that c ould be converted to dail y metric are included.) When common measures were available across studies using roughly comparable assessments (i.e., index questions, time intervals, etc.), we compiled tables to summarize outcomes of treatments. Measures of quality of life, interference with daily activ ities, degree of distress from symptoms, and satisfaction with the outcomes of treatment were also common and helpful metrics in this literature. 2 For behavioral, surgical, and complementar y and alternative treatments, we produced evidence tables, summary tables of common outco mes where possible, and provided analysis in text form. For pharmacologic treatment, we prod uced similar summary tables and conducted a limited meta-analysis. Conduct of meta-analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed and examined for homogeneity among studies. Studies that repor ted weekly rates for UUI (urinary urge incontinence) episodes and voids were standard ized to daily rates. When only ranges of continuous variables were reported (instead of standard deviati ons), we estimated the standard deviations by dividing the range by four.5 Study results were combined and summarized using two meta-analysis techniques, weighted aver ages and fixed effects regression models.6 Minimum variance weighted averages of the mean daily de crease in UUI and voids per arm were computed using weights that were inversel y proportional to their standard errors. To borrow strength across arms, we used fixed effect regression models with robust standard errors (to account for the clustering by study), and weighted the study arms inversely proportional to their standard errors of the mean. Each arm was treated as a fixed effect, and study was not included in the model except in the sense that the clustering was addr essed by the robust standard errors. Fixed effects models were also adjusted for mean age and proportion of women in each arm. Literature search yield. As a result of the search, 2,559 non-duplicate articles were identified. Two hundred thirty-two articles we re included in the review, representing one hundred seventy-nine distinct studies, with 75 articles pertaining to KQ1, 150 to KQ2, 34 to KQ3, 32 to KQ4, and 5 to KQ5. Reasons and proce ss for exclusions are described in the full report. Conflict of interest. We used a two-step process to describe the contribution of industry- sponsored research to the evidence base. The first step was to calc ulate the proportion of publications that explicitly stat e the source of the f unding for research, and the second step was to calculate the proportion supported by industry among those that report funding source . These counts are important because several studies have shown that industry-sponsored research tends to produce results that are favorable to the drug manufacturer even when the research is conducted in academic medical centers.7-9 Results KQ1. Prevalence and incidence of overactive bladder Content of the literature. We identified 75 publications,2-4, 10-81 from 60 distinct study populations. Fifteen studies were conducted in United States populations; 24 in European populations; 13 Asian; and 8 in other countries. Thirty-eight of these studies (63 percent) appeared in print after the 2002 International Continence Societ y (ICS) revised definitions and 37 percent of these reported specifically about incidence or pr evalence of OAB. One study prior to the standardized definitions used fully co mparable definitions and the term \"overactive bladder\". The strength of the evidence for unde rstanding prevalence of OAB is moderate and for understanding incidence is weak. Prevalence estimates. A total of 15 studies provided information specifically about OAB prevalence in adult women. These studies incl uded a total of 64,528 women in 16 distinct populations. Estimates of prevalence ranged fr om 7.7 to 31.3 percent. Across all studies the 3 average prevalence of OAB was 16.1 percent. Ex cluding the highest and lowest estimates, an estimated 15.1 percent of wome n meet criteria for OAB, with 8.2 percent of those surveyed, having OAB with a component of urge incontinence. Combined estimates from the two populations from the United States are similar 15.1 percent w ith OAB and 11.0 percent with a component of urge incontinence. A larger number of studies (n=48) examined urge urinary incontinence as the primary prevalence estimate of interest. Twenty-eight appeared after the ICS 2002 standardization of definitions. Across populations, prevalence of urge incontinence ranged from 1.5 to 22.0 percent. Average urge incontinence prevalence was 9.7 percent in the United States, 10.6 percent in Europe, and 9.6 percent in Asia. Incidence and resolution. Ten studies provided incidence data and two reported on resolution of symptoms. Estimates for annual incidence of OAB ranged from 2.6 to 143 cases per thousand, with higher estimates in the oldest population groups. A proportion of cases, 23 percent to 35 percent, resolve over a year's time; however the majo rity of women have symptoms for years. No studies ev aluated lifetime natural history. KQ2: Outcomes of Treatment for Overactive Bladder Pharmacologic treatment. Content of the literature. We identified 13 randomized c ontrolled trials (RCTs) of oxybutynin for treatment of OAB. A total of 22 study arms compared oxybutynin at varied doses, formulations, and intervals. These studies included five placebo arms. Most participants were recruited from specialty populations with seven studies performed in the United States, 82-88 three in Europe,89-91 and one each in Japan,92 Taiwan,93 and South Korea.94 These studies included a total of 2,575 women in treatment arms, and 383 women in the placebo arms. For tolterodine there were 19 RCTs, including 29 drug arms and 13 placebo arms. Most were multinational studies conducted at centers in Eu rope, the United States, Australia, and Asia. A total of 6,564 women were in the treatment arms, with 3,109 women in the placebo arms. Two RCTs compared fesoterodi ne at 4 and 8 mg to placebo for reducing symptoms of OAB and met criteria for inclusi on in the systematic review.95, 96 These studies included a total of 1,017 women in the treatment arms, and a to tal of 518 women in the placebo arms. Three RCTs investigated solifen acin compared to placebo fo r reducing symptoms of OAB.97- 99 These studies included a total of 1,541 women in the solifenacin treatment arms, and a total of 638 women in the placebo arms. Four RCTs provided data on the effectiveness of darifenacin.82, 100-102 These four studies included at total of 690 women in the darifenacin treatment arms and a total of 304 women in the placebo arms. Five RCTs evaluated trospium for reduction of symptoms of OAB. Four trials compared trospium to placebo, and one compared trospi um to oxybutynin. Four were conducted in the United States,103-106 and the fifth at multiple centers in Europe and Asia.90 These studies included a total of 1,309 women in the trospium treatme nt arms, and a total of 1,130 women in the placebo arms.103-106 Three studies assessed the role of oral estrogen therapy in different doses and formulations in the alleviation of OAB symptoms.107-109 All studies were performed in Europe and Scandinavia with a total of 514 women. Two were RCTs and one was a prospective cohort. After review and analysis of all 110 studies, of which four were good quality, 75 fair and 31 poor, including 68 4 RCTs, the strength of the evidence for managing OAB with pharmacologic treatment is weak to moderate for short term outcomes and weak for long term outcomes and harms. Outcomes of treatment. All pharmacologic treatments were effective at improving one or more OAB symptoms when compared to placebo. Reductions ranged from 0.9 to 4.6 in incontinence episodes per day across all drug treatments and from 0.7 to 4.2 in voids per day. Study by study, extended release formulations achie ved modestly better effects than immediate release, statistical significance varied. No one drug was definitively superior to others by preponderance of evidence, including more rece ntly approved drugs. As estimated by meta- analysis, extended release forms (taken on ce a day) reduce UUI by 1.78 (95 percent CI: 1.61, 1.94) episodes per day, and voids by 2.24 (95 per cent CI: 2.03, 2.46) per day. Immediate release forms (taken twice or more a day) reduce UUI episodes by 1.46 (95 percent CI: 1.28, 1.64) per day, and voids by 2.17 (95 percent CI: 1.81, 2.54) per day. Of note, placebo reduces UUI episodes by 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30), and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. Even in the context of sm all to moderate affect on symp toms, pharmacologic treatments were generally associated with increased quality of life and reductions in measures of impact or distress, compared to baseline and to placebo. Table 1 below provides estimates of treatment effects for pharmacologic treatments represented by more than one trial arm. Some dr ugs and doses of drugs are not reported because the publications with trial arms for that treat ment did not provide sufficient information to estimate variance in meta-analysis models.

Since baseline episodes of UUI per day ranged from 1.6 to 5.3, and voids per day from 7.2 to 13.7, these reductions (Table 1) reflect modest margins of benefit from baseline above placebo. Data was not consistently provided across studi es to estimate the proportion of women who became symptom free. 5 Procedural and surgical treatment. Content of the literature. We identified 18 studies about surgical treatments and procedures for OAB. Eleven were of sacral neuromodulation, one of peripheral neuromodulation, and one of electromagnetic therapy. Three studied bladder instillation or injection of drugs; one was on bladder distention; and one about bladder transe ction. This literature included 13 case series studies: nine prospective110-118 and three retrospective.119-121 One study had both retrospective and prospective components.122 Given consideration of 18 studies , of which 11 were fair quality and seven poor, including five RCTs, the st rength of the evidence for managing OAB with procedural and surgical treatment is weak for all aspects of understa nding outcomes of care. One study was a prospective cohort that compared outcomes among participants receiving sacral neuromodulation to participants who had lead placement without act ivation of electrical stimulation.123 Four studies were RCTs: one looked at sacral versus evaluated stimulation versus sham,125 and two evaluated instillation of a drug into the bladder versus placebo - one using oxybutynin126 and one using resiniferatoxin.127 Outcomes of treatment . Among the trials of procedures and surgery, one study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of sacral ne uromodulation over usual care for the reduction of episodes of incontinence per day (average re duction of 7.1 compared to 2.1 increase among subjects who had failed medical management).124 One trial demonstrated benefit of instillation of oxybutynin compared to sterile wate r in the reduction of voids pe r day (average reduction of 6.8 compared to 2.4)126 and another reported benefits from botulinum toxin treatment which is compatible with the findings of a recent Coch rane Collaboration literature review and meta- analysis.128 Behavioral interventions. Content of the literature. We identified nine studies th at included only behavioral approaches; no two studies compared the same se t of approaches. They included assessment of bladder training, multicomponent behavioral trai ning, with or without biofeedback, pelvic muscle exercises or training, va ginal electrical stimulation, and caffeine reduction. The literature base included three retrospective case series.129-131 All three were conducte d in community-based clinical settings. One prospective cohort study compared three ap proaches to providing bl adder training: self- administered, coaching, a nd cognitive strategies.132 Five studies were RCTs. One compared bladder training to a \"control\" condition.133 One compared bladder trai ning to pelvic muscle exercises.134 One included three arms: pelv ic floor muscle training, pe lvic floor muscle training assisted with biofeedback, and vaginal electrical stimulation.93 Another compared three different approaches to multicomponent behavioral training: biofeedback, verbal feedback and self- administered.135 A last study compared bladder traini ng to bladder training with caffeine reduction.136 After review and analysis of 29 studies, of which 14 were fair quality and 15 poor, including 17 RCTs, the strength of the evidence for managing OAB with behavioral approaches treatment is moderate to weak for short term outcomes and weak for long term outcomes and harms. Outcomes of treatment. No two studies could be comb ined to produce summary data. Overall, behavioral approaches can be effectiv e in reducing episodes of incontinence and daily voids. Multicomponent approaches are most effective, and they perform relatively equivalently to pharmacologic treatment. Gene rally speaking, improvements were modest, with decreases in 6 incontinence episodes of up to 1.9 per day, and re ductions in voids per da y of up to about four. The addition of caffeine reduction reduced freq uency, but made no differe nce in reduction of incontinence episodes. There is no evidence that behavioral approaches enhance the effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy for reducing episodes of incontinence or voiding, although they may improve patient satisf action and quality of life measures. Complementary and alternative therapies. Content of the literature. We identified three studies that used complementary and alternative medicine therapies to treat OAB: a fair quality trial of acupuncture,137a fair quality trial of foot reflexology,138 and a poor quality prospectiv e case series of hypnotherapy.139 There is weak to no evidence for complementary and alternative approaches to managing OAB. Outcomes of treatment. The small trial of acupuncture has intriguing results related to decreased frequency of voiding and reduced symptoms of urgency which are associated with changes in cystometrics related to improved bladder capacity that are logical intermediates of the improvement in symptoms. Women felt they were improved as measured by scales that capture bother and quality of life. Evidence is insufficien t to support definitive choice of acupuncture but offers preliminary information that promises modest improvements similar to those reported in many pharmacologic trials. Reflexology is represented by a small trial with unmasking of participants that could have biased the results. No evidence supports choice of this modality. Likewise, hypnotherapy is not supported by the scant information provided by one cas e series with little detail, patient reported outcomes, or statistical assessment. Given the scope of placebo effects demonstrated in other well-conducted studies of OAB treatment, it is difficu lt to know whether to attribute any effect to hypnotherapy. Conflict of interest. Changing trends in editorial standard s have resulted in more complete reporting of funding source and author conflict of interest over the period in which the OAB literature was developing. Sources of funding were not reported for the majority of publications that appeared in the 1980s; and no publications in th at decade reported on author conflict of interest. In the 1990s through the en d of 2008, nine (56 percent) stud ies of procedural treatments (including sacral neuromodulati on and bladder instillation or injection) reported source of funding, and six of the nine studi es (67 percent) were industry sponsored. The other three were institutionally funded. Among studies of medications, 89 (77 percent) reported source of funding and among those, 82 (92 percent) were industry sponsored. Among studies th at had a behavioral component, 13 (68 percent) reported on funding source and four had industry support. Author conflict of interest was poorly re ported until the current decade, with fewer than half of all publications providing information. Within papers th at did report conflict of interest, more than half of the authors (272 of 407) i ndicated that they had a financia l relationship with one or more companies relevant to the research. KQ3: Comparisons of Treatments Comparisons between pharmacologic treatments. Content of the literature . Twelve RCTs included direct comparisons of pharmacologic approaches. Specific comparisons have been made in the literature for the following pairs of drugs to identify differences in reduction in urge urinary incontinen ce or voids per Tolterodine IR to Solifenacin97 Outcomes of treatment. In the majority of comparisons, neither drug was reported more effective at reducing either incontinence episodes or voids per day with a few exceptions. Both oxybutynin and tolterodine in their extended releas e forms demonstrated superiority in reducing urge incontinence episodes over tolterodine immediate release.83, 140, 142 Oxybutynin extended release was more effective at reducing voi ds per day than tolterodine in immediate83 or extended release formulations.84 Comparisons between procedural and pharmaceutical treatments. Content of the literature . One RCT compared sacral neurom odulation to medical therapy. In this study, 98 participants were randomized to immediate sacral nerve stimulation or delayed sacral nerve stimulation. The delay group contin ued unspecified medical management for a six month period before having the procedure. Outcomes of treatment . This study, which randomized after successful test stimulation, found a reduction in daily urge incontinence episode s from 9.7 to 2.6 in the sacral neuromodulation group, compared to an increase of 9.3 to 11.3 in the medical management group at 6 months (p<0.01) for patients with refract ory OAB.124 At 18 months, 76 percen t of participants receiving sacral neuromodulation reported that they were completely dr y or had experienced a reduction in symptoms of 50 percent or greater. Note that th e comparison is not ideal, as subjects continuing to receive medical therapy had already failed medical management. Comparisons between behavioral and pharmacologic treatments. Content of the literature. Seven studies (nine papers) incl uded behavioral and pharmacologic arms in direct comparisons.93, 143-150 This literature included one prospective cohort study,147 and six RCTs.93, 143-146, 148-150 The behavioral approaches examined bladder training,151 146-150 multicomponent behavioral approaches,143-145 and electrical stimulation.93 One study significantly greater redu ctions in incontinence episodes with multicomponent behavioral modification compared to oxybutynin,143 but no studies found a difference in reductions in voids per day. In the same study that found greater reductions in incontinence with behavioral trea tment, participants reported hi gher satisfaction with behavioral compared to pharmacologic interventions. Comparison of combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatm ent to pharmacologic alone. Content of the literature. Six studies examined the effect of adding a behavioral intervention to drug compared to drug alone.150-155 In all but one study, the drug was tolterodine. The literature included five RCTs150-152, 154, 155 and one randomized open-label trial.153 Outcomes of treatment . No added benefit for reducing inco ntinence episodes or voids per day was found by adding behavioral treatments to pharmacologic approaches for reduction in 8 incontinence. Two studies associated the addition of behavioral m odification with reductions in voids per day, but two reported no difference. KQ4: Modifiers of Treatments Age. Eight publications examined the relations hip of age to response to pharmacologic treatment.83, 102, 156-161 Tolterodine was the focus of four of these studies;156-158, 160 and one compared oxybutynin to tolterodine.83 The largest study of tolterodin e using clinically adjusted doses, was from an open-label clinical cohor t of 2,250 patients from 462 urology practices in Germany. Participants on average were taking 2 mg per day and age did not predict response.157 No studies reported lack of efficacy for reduc ing UUI, voids per day, or symptom distress among older participants. While effect was in some cas es reduced, it was not the case that age predicted worse treatment response. Older individuals do benefit from treatment. Prior treatment. Eight publications investigated whether prior treatment with antimuscarinics predicte d treatment response.85, 86, 102, 162-165 of oxybutynin transdermal system85 and tolterodine IR,162 participants who had previously been on medication for OAB had comparable outcomes to those who were treatment na\u00efve. The tolterodine study specifically commented on pr ior treatment failures, noting improvements among those who had failed prior treatments that were above placebo but not statistically significant; few participants were in this ca tegory making conclusions difficult to reach.162 Baseline severity. Two studies contrasted t hose with UUI at baseline to those without. In an open-label study of 3,824 participants with nine months of treatment , urgency, frequency, nocturia, and OAB scales were similarly im proved regardless of UUI baseline status.166 In the other, open-label, study of solifenacin, with th e exception of nocturia, the point estimates for improvement in individual OAB indicators were better in the group with UUI at baseline though not in each instance statistically significan tly better than among those without UUI.167 Severity of UUI, grouped as severe for those with 21 or more episodes per week, did not prevent tolterodine from having an effect a bove placebo, and both severe and non-severe groups had a high percentage reduction in incontinence episodes per da y: a decrease of 67.6 percent among those with severe UUI and 71.4 percent among those with mild to moderate UUI.168 In another study, those with severe baseline symptoms were less likely than ot hers be symptom free at 12 weeks.157 Cure rates were reported to be compar able when comparing participants with UUI to those with MUI.169 Urodynamic findings. Five publications rela ted baseline urodynamic findings to outcomes of treatment.89, 170-173 Three did not identify ur odynamic findings that pr edicted poor response or non-response to treatment. Both women with and without detrusor instab ility had comparable benefits from treatment.171 Classification of participants as having detrusor overactivity or sensory urgency based on urodynamics was not statis tically significant as an effect modifier or predictor of treatment outcomes.170 The third study to group participants by urodynamic findings had group sizes (n = 6, 25, 36, 40) too small to make definitive assessments but suggested in the two larger groups that those with low volume and high pressure profiles had comparable results to those with low volume and low pressure profiles. Among women with proven detrusor instability, those with detrusor activity in response to provocations like washing hands or running water, were less likely to improve, 172 and women who reported coita l incontinence were more likely to be non-responders to treatment.173 9 Urodynamic findings. Five publications rela ted baseline urodynamic findings to outcomes of treatment.17, 98-101 Three did not identify ur odynamic findings that predicted poor response or non-response to treatment. Both women with and without detrusor instab ility had comparable benefits from treatment.99 Classification of participants as having detrusor overactivity or sensory urgency based on urodynamics was not statis tically significant as an effect modifier or predictor of treatment outcomes.98 The third study to group participants by urodynamic findings had group sizes (n = 6, 25, 36, 40) too small to make definitive assessments but suggested in the two larger groups that those with low volume and high pressure profiles had comparable results to those with low volume and low pressure profiles. Among women with proven detrusor instability, those with detrusor activity in response to provocations like washing hands or running water, were less likely to improve,100 and women who reported coita l incontinence were more likely to be non-responders to treatment.101 BMI. A single trial of tolterodine ER, tolterodi ne IR, and placebo (n=1,235) reported that women who were above the mean for BMI (> 27kg/m2) were more likely to have UUI at baseline but achieved comparable resu lts after 12 weeks of treatment. Gender. Authors frequently reported that men, es pecially older men, fared less well in resolution of symptoms of OAB.85, 106, 156, 157, 174 This evidence review was focused on outcomes of treatment among women. However, in order to retain landmark studies we included a number of studies that enrolled men as long as the pr oportion of women in the study was 75 percent or more. This means that treatment effects may be attenuated when men are included. KQ5: Costs of Treatments Content of the literature . We identified five studies on fi nancial costs related to OAB that met criteria for inclusion.175-179 All studies included assessment of direct medical costs, and two included costs due to lost produc tivity. One study additionally asse ssed financial implications for pain and suffering. Costs of treatment. Total direct health care costs for women with OAB in 2000 were estimated at $6.9 billion, of which $1.1 billi on were for pharmacologic treatment and $550 million for surgical treatment. The rest was estimated for \"consequences\" costs, which would include things like falls, longer hospital length of stay and skin conditions. Medication costs for OAB with the two most commonly used drugs ( oxybutynin and tolterodine) ranged from $56 to $360 over a twelve month period for newly diagnose d patients. However, total health care costs were highest for patients who ta ke oxybutynin, relative to tolterodi ne in any formulation, with costs lowest for patients on tolterodine ER. E xplanations for this were not apparent. Discussion The study of OAB as a syndrome is entering its second decade. As is typical of advancing areas of research, publications based on case se ries are giving way to observational cohorts. Trials, beyond those required for FDA approval of indication for OAB, are appearing in the literature and health services researchers are inves tigating population-level f actors such as cost of care and risk of rare but serious side effects of treatments. The 2002 ICS standardization of terminology180 was associated with a productive trend toward greater attention to and clarity of operational definitions in research. Documentation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline characte ristics, and change in symptom profiles have 10 become more detailed and nuanced in the last five to seven years. Improved clarity about research definitions for conducti ng the study and analyzing data wa s the case even when authors departed from ICS definitions. Simultaneously im portant research gains have been made in crafting, refining, and validating questionnaire and interview instruments for classifying symptoms, assessing severity of symptoms, desc ribing impact of OAB on quality of life, and measuring satisfaction with outcomes. Despite th is momentum the overall content of the current literature is fair to poor with a preponderance of study desi gns that do not provide strong evidence. We find a concerning lack of high-quality evid ence to inform clinical decision-making for millions of women in the United States. Medications can provide symptom relief which is often not complete, but valued by women who struggle with OAB. Well-conducted trials of greater duration and sophistication, separa te from drug development and marketing efforts, are crucial. Because benefits of current treatments are m odest, opportunities exist to study how to gain synergy from combinations of types of treatments. We must note that lack of evidence of benefits is not equivalent to evidence of no bene fit. A number of treatme nts that are potentially promising warrant continued inves tigation. Cross-cutting concerns about the quality of research must be addressed to achieve literature that can be meaningfu lly synthesized. Current literature does not permit definitive conclusions about relative benefit, harm, or costs to achieve similar results. Given how common and concerning OAB is, a priority on prom oting high-quality research in the United States is imperative. Women and their care providers deserve better information to guide their choices. 11 12 13 Evidence Report 14 Appendixes and Evidence Tables for this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/bladder/bladder.pdf 15 Chapter 1. Introduction Importance of Overactive Bladder Treatment At minimum, 11 to 16 million women in the United States cope on a daily basis with symptoms that include sudden strong urges to urin ate, difficulty delaying voids, frequent trips to the bathroom, and in many cases involuntar y loss of urine when urgency strikes.1 They may wear pads for accidents, plan ahead for access to bathro oms, and modify their social and work lives to accommodate their symptoms. Some women are ve ry distressed by the symptoms whether mild or severe, and some find mechanisms to adap t, reporting little troubl e with symptoms or interference with normal routines. Others report their symptoms negatively influence factors as varied as self-esteem, self-assessment of a ttractiveness, and sexual function. Many women believe that some amount of incontinence is inev itable with aging and the majority of women with these symptoms do not talk with their h ealth care providers about their concerns with bladder function. As a result, a sm all minority receive treatment. Defining OAB Overactive bladder syndrome, referred to as OAB in this report, is formally defined as: urgency, which is the complaint of sudden need to void; with or without urge incon tinence, involuntary loss of ur ine with urgency symptoms; usually with frequency, which is the individual's percepti on that she voids too often during the day, and is often defined as mo re than eight voids during waking hours; usually with nocturia, which is awakeni ng from sleep to empty the bladder. This operational definition was formally standa rdized as part of a consensus process of experts, in 2002 by the Internati onal Continence Society (ICS) as pa rt of an effort to promote healthcare professionals' and researchers' use of common terminology in the care and study of women with OAB. Components of the syndrome have had varied, and at times conflicting, nomenclature that include detrusor an d irritable bladder. In each cas e, these terms shared a causal model that hypothesizes that mistimed or poorly regulated bladder cont ractions create the sensation of sudden need to void with or without leakage. However clinical study of bladder muscle function using urodynamic testing to measure characteristics like bladder capacity, pattern and timing of bladder contractions, and bladder volume at which women first experienced the urge to void, di d not reveal uniform test resu lts among women who had identical complaints. Lacking a reliable biologic marker to define and describe the severity of the condition with objective tests of the bladder itself, clinicians, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and others came to conceptualize th e symptoms of OAB, which often appeared in combination, as a syndrome. Syndromes are medical conditi ons defined by the symptoms, which are the sensations (urgency), changes (frequency), or events (inc ontinence episodes) experienced by the individual. A syndrome is not defined by a known biol ogic cause. The pathophysiology of OAB is incompletely characterized and the syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion reached when other causes of the symptoms, like urinary tract infec tion, urethral inflammatio n, or neurologic causes of incontinence are ruled out as the cause. OAB symptoms ma y be life long, relapsing and remitting; or may completely resolve; which ma nifestations of the syndrome a woman has may also vary over time. However followup studies that track women who have OAB find that on average it is a chronic condition that women experi ence for a year or more at a time, and may have into the indefinite future. Little is known about causes and most physiology and clinical research aimed at understanding etiology is now focused at the de scriptive and hypothesis development and testing phase of investigation. The most promising theori es postulate abnormalities in control of bladder function resulting from aberrations in neurologic signals from the bladder (sensation) and in central and peripheral nervous system regulation. OAB and Awareness of the General Public Prior to the mid-1990s research and clinical care focused on descri bing and managing frank incontinence. The term \"overactive bladder\" wa s introduced into the lexicon in the mid-1990s by Pharmacia (acquired by Pfizer in 20 02) to describe the frequent urge to urinate as part of its advanced marketing campaign of Detrol (tolte rodine). The company framed this as an opportunity to \"destigmatize\" a ra nge of symptoms encompassing urgency, frequent voiding, and urge incontinence, so that patients would not be afraid to speak with their doctors about the problem.181 The construct - and subsequent marke ting success - of OAB medications revolved around encouraging women to reflect on how their sy mptoms influenced their quality of life and the degree to which the symptoms caused inconv enience, emotional distress, withdrawal from activities, or sexual problems. As a result, a broader spectrum of women, extending beyond those with incontinence, became candidates for treatment. This included those who were inconvenienced by or worried about frequent urination or who engaged in what has been referre d to as \"defensive voiding\", emptying the bladder in an attempt to extend th e interval between symptoms or to reduce the amount of urine that leaks w ith incontinence, and \"toilet mapping,\" being aware of where bathrooms are and canvassing new locations to be sure the options are known. The group of those encouraged to consider treatment also cam e to include women who perceive they urinate more than \"normal\" and women whose jobs or lifestyles do not accomm odate frequent, strong urges to urinate. Early advertisements featured school crossing guards and jurors who could not readily take a break. Momentum toward a very broa d definition in marketing was a factor in the updated consensus definition of OAB by the ICS in 2002, so that the biomedical community would have an opportunity to formally sta ndardize the definition with specificity. Marketing of drug and the drug indication to ph ysicians occurred through the usual channels, such as paid educational trips, speaki ng engagements, outsourcing drug studies, etc. 182, 183 Nearly simultaneously, as a result of less restrictive rules about direct to consumer marketing, women were reached directly thr ough the power of television and print media in new ways.184 Use of \"buzz drivers,\" or people paid to promote the drug during news broadcasts or celebrity interviews came into play as new marketing techniques. 185 By 2006, the first drug to specifically target the broader definition of OAB hit the blockbuster mark of $1 billion in sales for the year. 186 Two drugs, tolterodine tartrate and oxybut ynin, were the only drugs approved in the United States specifically for OAB until 2004 when tr ospium, darifenacin, and solifenacin were introduced.187 Fesoterodine, a odine was approved in October 2008. Oxybutynin is now available in a transdermal fo rmulation. Thus over roughly a decade - a very short time window in clinical medicine - both the condition of OAB and pharmaceutical treatments for OAB became part of the consci ousness of the public and the general medical community alike. 16 Treatment Options Popular wisdom encourages self-management of symptoms of OAB through reduction of fluid intake, cutting back on caffeine, modifying voiding habits, and taking note of what factors like phase of the menstrual cycle, food choices, or contraceptives may influence severity of symptoms in order to adapt or reduce the im pact of OAB. Over-the-counter remedies like cranberry capsules and herbal preparations are reported to promote bladder health, reduce bladder irritation, or reduce the urgency associat ed with bladder infections while also taking antibiotics, have crossed-over in to use by women who have the sy mptoms without an infection. While perhaps quite common, these strategies are not well-reflected in the sc ientific literature. This report is focused on those treatments that have been formally investigated including: Pharmacologic treatments, including prescr iption medications, both pills and patches Surgeries and procedures, such as sacral neuromodulation and botulinum injections Behavioral interventions, such as behavior modification programs and bladder training Complementary and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture and reflexology Note that when initiated, treatment should be prompted by distress over symptoms and their influence on quality of life. The symptoms are not de facto harmful, though consequences such as sleep interruption or risks of falls and fractures from rushing to the toilet may be harmful.188, 189 As a result OAB management is usually indivi dualized to address the component symptom(s) that the individual finds most bothersome. Where possible we ha ve tried to address treatments with respect to the primary component sympto ms of OAB: urgency, frequency (daytime and nighttime), and urge urinary inco ntinence, so that the women, th eir health care providers, payors, policy-makers and others have a detailed pi cture of the expected outcomes of available treatments. This Evidence Report Scope of the Report Evidence reviews of therapeutics seek to identify and systematically summarize objective information about the evidence related to: Effectiveness of specific, well-defined treatments Relative benefit of one treatment over another Common side effects and seri ous risks of a treatment Whether individual characteristics help predict who will benefit or be harmed Degree to which individuals find the treatment acceptable or satisfactory Costs of care or risk-benefit assessments Key Questions For this review, we operationally defined OAB as \"idiopathic urinary urgency and frequency with or without associated incontinence in adult females, not related to neurogenic conditions or as a result of (incontinence) surgery.\" This review is restricted to OAB, rather than exclusively mixed incontinence, stress incontinence, painful bladder syndrome, and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We have synthesized evidence in the published literature to address these key questions: KQ1. What is the prevalence and incidence of overactive bladde r as estimated in representative populations? 17 KQ2. Among women with overactive bladder, what are the short and long-term outcomes of the following treatments, or combinations of treatment approaches: a. Pharmacologic treatments b. Surgical and procedural treatments c. Behavioral and physical therapy treatments d. Complementary and alternativ e medicine treatments KQ3 . Where direct comparisons have been made between or among treatment modalities of interest, which modalities achieve superior outcomes with respect to benefits, short and long- term risks, and quality of life? KQ4. Are the short and long term outcomes of these treatment approaches modified by clinical presentation, physical exam findings, urodynamic findi ngs, menopausal status, age, or other factors? KQ5. What are the costs associated with these treatment approaches? Analytic Framework for the Treatment of OAB Women The analytic framework in Figure 1 summarizes the conceptual model used to guide this systematic review by focusing the key questions on critical health care -related pathways and decision points. We recognize a number of other factors like provider pr escribing preferences and types of testing performed for a patient presenting with symptoms are part of this pathway. However little literature was available to inform other nodes in the process of care. Figure 1.

Population prevalence 18 Organization of this Evidence Report Chapter 2 describes our methods including our search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, approach to review of abstracts, to review of full public ations, and for extraction of data into evidence tables, compiling evidence, and when possible conducting meta-analysis. We also describe the approach to grading of the quality of the literature and to describing the strength of the literature. Chapter 3 presents the results of the evid ence report by key question, synthesizing the findings across treatment type. We report the numb er and type of studies identified and we differentiate between total numbers of publications and unique studies to bring into focus the number of duplicate publications in this literature in which multiple publications are derived from the same study population. We emphasize th e effect of treatment on the core symptom complex of OAB. Chapter 4 disc usses the results in Chapter 3 and enlarges on methodologic considerations relevant to each key question. We also outline the current st ate of the literature and challenges for future research on OAB. We have prioritized reporting on clinically relevant commonalit ies for United States care settings, being aware of the fact that primary care generalists a nd specialists alike are called upon to evaluate and treat OAB patients. We placed greatest value on the studies, and the content within studies, that is most likely to be applicab le to help guide patient care, such as treatment selection, as well as inform anticipatory guidance about likely magn itude of treatment effects and risk of both nuisance side e ffects and serious harms. Technical Expert Panel (TEP) We identified technical expert s on the topic of OAB in the fields of urology, urogynecology, gynecology, primary care, nursing, and patient advocacy to provide assistance during the project. The TEP (see Appendix E) was expected to cont ribute to AHRQ's broader goals of (1) creating and maintaining science partnerships as well as public-private partnerships and (2) meeting the needs of an array of potential customers and us ers of its products. Thus, the TEP was both an additional resource and a sounding board during the project. The TEP included twelve members serving as technical or clinical experts, incl uding an AUA representative. To ensure robust, scientifically relevant work, we called on the TE P to provide reactions to work in progress and advice on substantive issues or possibly overlooked areas of research. TEP members participated in conference calls and discussions through e-mail to: Refine the analytic framework and key questions at the beginning of the project; Discuss the preliminary assessment of the literature, including inclusion/exclusion criteria; Provide input on the information and cat egories included in evidence tables; Develop a hierarchy of particip ant characteristics and outcome s to systematically assess; Advise about the clinical availability, us e, and most common doses for therapeutics. Because of their extensive knowledge of the literature, including numerous articles authored by TEP members themselves, and their active invol vement in professional societies and as practitioners in the field, we also asked TEP members to participat e in the external peer review of the draft report. 19 20 Uses of This Report This evidence report addresses the key questions outlined above using methods described in Chapter 2 to conduct a systematic review of published literature including a meta-analysis of effects of pharmacologic treatment. We anticipate th at the report will be of value to all urologic and women's health care providers, including A UA (our partner), the American College of Obstetrician Gynecologists, the American Ur ogynecologic Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Nurs e Practitioners, and other clinical groups who care for women from menarche through the remai nder of their lives, such as the American Geriatrics Society. In addition, th is review will be of use to the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Health Resources and Services Administration - a ll of which have offices or bureaus devoted to women's health issues. This report can bring practi tioners up to date abou t the current state of evidence, and it provides an assessment of the quality of studies that aim to determine the outcomes of therapeutic options for the management of OAB. It will be of interest to individual women and the general public because of the high prevalence of OAB and the recurring need for women and their health care providers to make the best possible decisions among numerous options. We also anticipate it will be of use to private sector organizations concerned with women's health, such as Our Bodies Ourselve s, the National Women's Health Network, the National Association for Continence, the Soci ety of Urodynamic and Female Urology (SUFU), and the Simon Foundation for Continence. Researchers can obtain a concise analysis of the current state of knowledge in this field. They will be poised to pursue further investigations th at are needed to understand the prevalence and natural history of OAB, to clar ify risk factors, develop prev ention strategies, develop new treatment options, and optimize the effectiveness a nd safety of clinical care for those with OAB.

Methods In this chapter, we document the procedures that the Vanderbilt Evidence-based Practice Center used to develop this comprehensive evid ence report on the treatment of OAB in women. We first describe our strategy for identifying articles relevant to our five key questions, our inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the process we used to abstract relevant information from the eligible articles and generate our evidence tables. We also discuss our criteria for grading the quality of individual articles a nd for rating the strength of the ev idence as a whole. Finally, we describe the peer review process. Literature Review Methods Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Our inclusion/exclusion criteria were developed in consultati on with the TEP, to capture the literature most tightly related to the key questions. Criteria are summarized below. Table 1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Category Criteria Study population Adult, community-dwelling females Publication languages English only Admissible evidence (study design and other criteria) Admissible designs Randomized controlled trials, cohorts with comparison, case-control, and case series Other criteria Original research studies that prov ide sufficient detail regarding methods and results to enable use and aggregation of the data and results Patient populations must include women with overactive bladder Studies must have relevant population 50 participants Studies must address one or more of the following for overactive bladder: Treatment modality Symptom management approach Short- and long-term outcomes and quality of life Prevalence and/or incidence Relevant outcomes must be able to be abstracted from data in the papers We excluded studies that (1) were not publishe d in English; (2) did not report information pertinent to the key questions; (3) had fewer than 50 female participants [at enrollment]; (4) had less than 75 percent female participants or fail ed to report results by ge nder; and (5) were not original studies. For this review, the relevant population for all key questions was women with overactive bladder, defined as \"idiopathic urinary urgency and frequency with or without associated urge urinary incontinence, not relate d to neurogenic conditions or as a result of (incontinence) surgery.\" The same inclusion/excl usion criteria were applied to identify papers for treatment- related key questions. We applied additional restri ctions for inclusion and exclusion of incidence and prevalence publications for KQ1. To inform this question about the epidemiology of OAB and/or its component symptoms , we required that the study methods specify a population base a priori from which a sample of individuals was draw n as a representative selection to estimate the true proportion of prevalent and incident cases of OAB in the larger population. Additional information is provided in the results for KQ1. For KQ5, we required that publications provide data on direct costs in United States dollars for treatments reviewed in this report. Treatment studies that included at least 75 pe rcent women were included. This level was selected with expert input to av oid restricting to studi es with only female participants as a large proportion of this literature includes both men and women, and to establish a threshold below which the difference in underlying processes (e.g. , BPH in men) might substantially influence treatment effects. Studies with lower proportions of women were include d if they presented results separately for women; or indicated that an interaction with gender was tested and found not to exist; or gender was contro lled in the analysis. Publications about incontinence that did not distinguish between, or present re sults by urge, stress, and/or mixe d incontinence were excluded. Literature Search and Retrieval Process Databases. We employed multi-term search strategies to retrieve research about treatment of overactive bladder in women, including exploration of three databases: PubMed, MEDLINE\u00ae, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Lite rature (CINAHL). We also hand-searched the reference lists of relevant articles to identify additional studies for review. Search terms. Controlled vocabulary terms served as the foundation of our search in each database, complemented by additi onal keyword phrases to repres ent the myriad ways in which overactive bladder is referred to in the clinic al literature. We also employed indexing terms within each of the databases to exclude undesi red publication types (e.g., reviews, case reports, CME handouts) and items published in languages other than English. Tables 2 to 4 outline our search terms and the yield from each database. Our searches were executed between April and October, 2008, and we re not limited by date. From PubMed, we identified 2,400 items for further review; EMBASE yielded 318 items, including 310 already identified in PubMed and 8 unique items; CINAHL yielded 264 citations, including 240 duplicates with PubMed and 24 new articles for review. Table 2.

Yield of literature searches. Figure 2 presents the yield an d results from our searches. Beginning with a yield of 2,559 arti cles, we retained 232 articles covering 221 studies that we determined were relevant to answer our key ques tions and met our inclusi on/exclusion criteria. 23 Figure 2.

The excluded papers focused exclusively on populations of i ndividuals with movement disorders, spinal cord injuries, or multiple sclerosis, for example. As a result, they did not meet the criteria for an \"idiopathic\" syndrome which was a requirement of the report. 24 Article selection process. Once we identified articles th rough the electronic database searches, review articles, and bibliographies, we examined abstracts of articles to determine whether studies met our criteria. Two reviewers se parately evaluated the abstracts for inclusion or exclusion, using an Abstract Review Form (Appendix B). If one review er concluded that the article could be eligible for the review based on the abstract, we retained it. The group included three physicians (KH, DB, RW), and two senior health services rese archers (MM, SM). Of the entire group of 2,559 articles, 586 required fu ll text review. For th e full article review, two reviewers read each article and decided whether it met our inclusion criteria, using a Full Text Inclusion/Exclusion form. Reasons for ar ticle exclusion are listed in Appendix D. Literature Synthesis Development of Evidence Tables and Data Abstraction Process The staff members and clinical experts who conducted this review jointly developed the evidence tables. We designed the tables to provide sufficient information to enable readers to understand the studies and to dete rmine their quality; we gave part icular emphasis to essential information related to our KQs. We based the format of our evidence tables on successful designs used for prior systematic reviews. The team was trained to abstract by abstracting several articles into evidence tables and then reconvening as a group to discuss the utility of the table design. We repeated this process through several iterations until we decided that th e tables included the appropriate categories for gathering the information contained in the articles . A priori, with the tec hnical expert panel, a hierarchy of baseline characteristics and out come measures was developed: UUI episodes, urgency, incontinence, voids, nocturia, QoL, ur odynamic measures, and adverse events. All team members shared the task of initially entering information into the evidence tables. Another member of the team also reviewed the articles and edited all initial table entries for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. The two abstract ors reconciled disagr eements concerning the information reported in the evidence tables. Th e full research team met regularly during the article abstraction period and disc ussed global issues rela ted to the data abstraction process. In addition to outcomes related to treatment effectiveness, we abstracted all data available on harms. Harms encompasses the full range of sp ecific negative effects, including the narrower definition of adverse events. The final evidence tables are presented in their entirety in Appendix C. Studies are presented in the evidence tables alphabetically by the last na me of the first author. When possible, studies resulting from the same study population were grouped into a single evid ence table. A list of abbreviations and acronyms used in the tables appears at the beginning of that appendix. Synthesis of the Evidence A series of spreadsheets was created to suppor t systematic tabulation and assessment of study characteristics including key study population characteristics, numb er of participants by group, treatment received, length of followup, age of participants by group, outcomes measured and outcomes. This allowed us to identify comm on threads in reporting across publications. Within the pharmaceutical treatment studies al l unique trial arms were entered into a spreadsheet with exact values to two-decimal points as available for baseline measures, followup measures, difference from baseline, and for the rela ted statistical indicators of precision (such as 25 standard deviations, standard errors, or confidence bounds). This was done to facilitate calculation of weighted averages and to support meta-analysis. Conduct of meta-analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed and examined for homogeneity among studies. Studies that repor ted weekly rates for UUIs and voids were standardized to daily rates. When only ranges of continuous variables were report ed (instead of standard deviations), we estimated the sta ndard deviations by divi ding the range by four.5 Study results were combined and summarized using two meta-analysis techniques, weighted averages and fixed effects regression models.6 In particular, minimum variance weighted averages of the mean daily decrease in UUI and voids per arm we re computed using weights that were inversely proportional to their standard errors. To borrow strength across arms, we used fixed effect regression models with robust standard erro rs (to account for the clustering by study) and weighted the study arms inversely proportional to their standard errors of the mean. Each arm was treated as a fixed effect and study was not in cluded in the model except in the sense that the clustering was addressed by the robust standard errors. Fixed effects models were also adjusted for mean age and proportion of women in each arm. We used STATA 10.0 and R statistical packages for computations. Summary tables within this report. Each of the pharmacologic agents in this report is available in a least one dose fo rm for clinical use. As part of the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval each has been determined superior to placebo for at least one facet of the syndrome, e.g., urge urinary incontinence, frequency of urination, symptoms of urgency, or nocturia. The experience of having overactive bladder is a constellation of these self- reported events, symptoms, and the impact that th ey have on an individual's life. Thus measures of quality of life, interference with daily activities, degree of distress from symptoms, and satisfaction with the outcomes of treatment are also common and helpful metrics in this literature. Where common measures are availa ble across studies using roughly comparable assessments (i.e., similar index questions, time in tervals, etc), we have compiled tables to summarize outcomes of treatments. Given the content of the literature, this means th at the majority of the information included in tables is for the outcomes of number of urge incontinence episodes per day and number of voids per day. (Studies with weekly or other metrics that could be converted to daily metric are included.) Because momentum in drug developmen t within related classes of drugs has been toward daily dosing, the pharmacologic treatments are arranged from highest dose at lowest frequency of administration (daily) to lower doses and greater administra tion frequency (twice or more daily). Placebo arms from the same trials in which the drugs were evaluated are included within the table, or for areas in which the l iterature is large, in companion placebo outcome tables. The number of weeks of treatment and timing of followup outcome assessment were the same in these trials. The weeks of treatment column is therefore comparable to weeks at evaluation of outcomes. Summary tables include data from distinct clinical trial arms in which the drug and dose or other type of treatment were evaluated for the related outcome. As a result, a single study may contribute more than one treatment arm as we ll as a placebo arm to the summary tables. For pharmacologic treatment we included only study arms in which no dose adjustment was allowed. Because many studies are dose finding with multiple drug arms or are direct comparisons of pharmacologic agents, there are more drug arms th an placebo arms for virtually all drugs and treatment types. 26 Quality Rating of the Individual Studies Rating the quality of individual articles. We developed our approach to assessing the quality of individual articles based on our prio r experience with conducting systematic reviews. Internal validity. The criteria for assessing internal validity were as follows: Randomized allocation to treatment. This assessment combines randomization and method of randomization into a single criteri on with a three- point scale. Rationale: By randomly assigning groups to the in tervention of interest, other factors that may confound the results are equally distri buted between groups (assuming a large enough sample size). This equal distribution minimizes the chances of over- or underestimation of treatment effect based on unequal di stribution of confounding factors. If randomized, we also evaluated the study fo r randomization methods, using the rationale described in Matchar and colleagues, 2001.190 Rationale: \"Pseudo-randomization\" methods may be susceptible to bias, as demonstrated by evidence of unequal distribution of subject characteristics191 and larger effect sizes compared with studies using more rigorous methods.192 In addition, methods of allocation concealment are also important in preventing bias (e.g ., use of prepared sealed envelopes). We combined these elements into a single operational definition, as described below: Operational definition: Criterion met if randomi zation methods were not susceptible to bias, such as computer-generated numbers in sealed sequentially numbered envelopes (+). Criterion not met by studies that either used methods more prone to bias, such as alternate medical record numbers, or did not describe randomization methods or methods of allocation concealment (-). Criterion not applicable if treatmen t was not randomly allocated (NA). Masking. Rationale: Masking, also known as blinding, refers to the concealment of treatment allocation from the care provider, the assessor, and the patient.193 In certain trials, pa rticularly surgical trials, masking the patient or the surgeon from the treatment allocation can be challenging or impossible. Similarly, masking the assessor assigned to record immediate post-procedural outcomes such as wound healing can also be di fficult. Nevertheless, when possible, masking prevents expectations fr om influencing findings. Operational definition: Criterion was met if assessors and participants were masked to treatment or group (+). Criterion was not met if eith er care provider, assess or, or patient were not masked (-). Criterion not applicable if treatment was not randomly allocated. Adequate description of patients and control selection criteria. Rationale: Patient characteristics that might af fect outcomes (such as severity of symptoms, duration of symptoms, failure of prior treatment, or medical comorbidities) are likely to differ between two interventions. If these differences are not characterized, then erroneous conclusions may be drawn. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a) incl usion and exclusion criteria for participation in the study were well described. We expected that the study population should be adequately described to make clear the potential for confounding in the analysis. We expected the study authors to adequately describe the study population such that it co uld theoretically be reproducib le by another investigator. We expected comparable methods to be used to iden tify and screen participants across exposure or treatment groups. 27 Description of loss to followup. Rationale: Failing to account for patients lost to followup may lead to erroneous conclusions, especially if the loss to followup is related to either the underlying disease or the intervention (e.g., patients seeking care elsewhere because of continuing symptoms or unacceptable side effects of treatment). Operational definition: Criterion met for ade quate followup (+) if (a) loss to followup was explicitly reported and (b) no more than 20 percen t of any study arm was lost to followup. Those studies with less than 10 percent lost to followup were given an extra (+). Studies with greater than 20 percent lost to followup were cons idered inadequate for this measure (-). Description of dropout rates. Rationale: Dropout rates may reflect differences in clinically important variables, such as side effects or treatment response. Failure to account for dropouts ma y result in erroneous conclusions similar to those seen with failure to account for loss to followup. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a ) patients dropping out of the study prior to completion were reported and (b) no more than 10 percent in any study arm left the study for reasons related to the study interv ention or withdrawal of consent. Power calculation provided. Rationale: Many studies, especially case series, lack sufficient power to detect clinically important differences in outcome s or patient characteristics. Operational Definition: Criterion met if a pow er calculation (pre or post) was provided. Recognition and description of statistical issues. Rationale: Use of inappropriate tests may l ead to misleading conclusions. For example, variables such as number of voids per day or costs are often not normally distributed; use of means instead of medians when data may be affected by outlying observations can be misleading. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a) appropriate statistical tests were used (e.g., nonparametric methods for variables with nonnor mal distributions, or survival analysis techniques to account for loss to followup and dropouts) and (b) potential study limitations regarding design and analysis were discussed. Criterion not met if (a) inappropriate statistical tests were used or (b) study lim itations were not discussed. An in tention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was required of clinical trials. External validity. The criteria for assessing external validity were as follows: Baseline characteristics: We created a composite score for adequacy of the description of baseline characteristics. At mini mum, we expected age and baseli ne OAB status to be presented. If either of these were omitted, criteria were not met. If the authors provided additional information above and beyond age and OAB status at baseline on any of the following, they were awarded an additional +: race/ethnicity, BMI, pari ty, menopausal status, prior treatment/surgery, duration of symptoms. Required elements: Description of age of study population. Rationale: The outcomes of many interventions are affected by patient age. Age is especially important in studies related to reproductive h ealth in women and associated with rates of overactive bladder. Operational definition: Criterion met if summ ary statistics of subject age were given by comparison group. Criterion not met if su mmary statistics were not given. 28 Baseline OAB status. Rationale: The baseline level of severity of OAB could affect the likelihood of successful treatment. Furthermore, definitions of OAB are not consistent across studies and may include different combinations of urgenc y, frequency, and incontinence that could affect interpretation of the outcomes. Therefore, we sought to determin e whether studies defined OAB status by ICS or other criteria, by UUI alone or by combin ations of UUI, urgency and frequency. Operational definition: Criterion met if sy mptoms of OAB were presented by study group. Length of followup. Rationale: Outcome measures may vary dependi ng on when they are obtained. Description of when outcomes were measured facilitates comp arison between studies. We considered three months to be a minimally acceptable period of followup for observing effectiveness of treatment for OAB. Operational definition: Criterion met if the study followed participants for at least three months, with an extra point provided for greater than or equal to six months. Adequate description of methods used for outcome measurement. Rationale: Comparison between studies requires common methods of measurement, which in turn requires adequate de scription of the methods used to assess comparability. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a ) methods used to measure outcomes were adequately described or referenced (e.g., 2002 ICS; QoL scales), (b) definitions were given (e.g., description of outcomes classifi ed as \"adverse events\"), or (c) outcomes were unambiguous (e.g., reduction in number of voids per day). Criterion not met if (a), (b), or (c) was not present. Adequate description of validity and re liability of outcome measurement. Rationale: Measurements of outcomes are only useful if changes in the outcome being measured are reflected in changes in the meas urement (validity) and if these changes are reasonably consistent between the same observe r measuring at differe nt times or between different observers (reliability). For example, changes in a scale to assess menstrual blood flow should correlate with some other physiological measure of menstrual blood loss, and this correlation should be consistent when di fferent women apply the same scale. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a) a description of the methods used to assess validity and reliability of at least one outcome measure was provided, (b) a reference to another article documenting validity and reliability was provided, or (c) only unambiguous outcomes were included as primary outcomes. Criterion not met if (a), (b), or (c) was not present. Adequate description of the inte rvention provided to subjects. Rationale: The ability to replicate study result s is dependent on adequate description of methods. Additionally, readers should be aware of aspects of clinical care that might influence outcomes. Operational definition: Criterion met if (a) a de tailed description of the therapy (dose, dosing schedule, protocols for behavioral interventions , and route of administration for medications and/or techniques for invasive therapies) was provided; (b) a reference to another publication describing the procedure was provide d; or (c) statistical adjustme nt was made for likely sources of variation in clinical care (e.g., site where care was given, type of specialist providing care, individual provider, dose and timing). Criterion not met if (a), (b ), or (c) was not provided. 29 Table 5.

Two senior investigators assigned grades by consensus. We graded the body of literature for each key ques tion and present those ratings as part of the discussion in Chapter 4. The possible grades were: I. Strong: The evidence is from studies of strong design; results are both clinically important and consistent with minor ex ceptions at most; results are free from serious doubts about generalizability, bias, or flaws in research design. Studies with ne gative results have sufficiently large samples to have adequate statistical power. II. Moderate: The evidence is from studies of str ong design, but some uncertainty remains because of inconsistencies or concern about ge neralizability, bias, rese arch design flaws, or adequate sample size. Alternativ ely, the evidence is consistent but derives from studies of weaker design. III. Weak: The evidence is from a limited number of studies of weaker design. Studies with strong design either have not b een done or are inconclusive. IV. No evidence: No published literature. 30 External Peer Review As is customary for all systematic evidence reviews done for AHRQ, this report was reviewed by a wide array of i ndividual outside experts in the field, including our TEP, and from relevant professional societies and public orga nizations. AHRQ also requested review from its own staff. The Scientific Resource Center sent 11 invitations for peer review. Reviewers included clinicians (e.g., urologi sts, urogynecologists, gynecologi sts, geriatricians, family medicine physicians, and nurse practitioners), representatives of federal agencies, advocacy groups, and potential users of the report. The Scientific Resource Center charged peer reviewers with commenting on the content, structure, and format of the evidence report, providing additional relevant citations, and pointing out issues related to how we had conceptualized and defined the topic and KQs. We also asked reviewers to complete a peer review checklist. The Scientific Resource Center received eight responses in addition to comments from AHRQ staff. The individua ls listed in Appendix E gave us permission to acknowledge their review of the draft. We compiled all comments and addressed each one individually, re vising the text as appropriate. 31 32 Appendixes and Evidence Tables for this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/bladder/bladder.pdfChapter 3. Results KQ1. Prevalence and Incidence of Overactive Bladder To understand the epidemiology of OAB and as sociated symptoms (frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence), we sought publ ications that provided estimates of prevalence, which is the proportion of the population with th e condition, or those that exam ined the proportion with onset of new symptoms over time, which is termed in cidence. The strongest estimates come from a well-specified population-base that allows sampling to genera te a representative group. We applied operational criteria to select those studies best suite d to estimate prevalence and incidence. The key criterion for inclusion was th at the study authors specified a population base a priori from which a sample of individuals was drawn as a representative selection of individuals to estimate the true proportion in the larger popula tion. The population was required to be clearly defined and capable of being e numerated such as the population of a region, the participants in a health plan or individuals on voter registration roles. This \"roster\" defines the sampling frame from which stratifi ed samples are drawn. Often the research team has an explicit statistical goal of random ly selecting participants with aggregate characte ristics (range of age, race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) that appr oximate the entir e population of a city, region, or country. Common approaches include random digit dialing within a specific geographical region, or mailings of questionnaires to a sample of individuals who are in a pool of registered voters, registered residents, or on the patient panels of a national health syst ems or large healthcare organizations. Outside the United States, househ old canvassing and administered interviews were also common. The characteristic of being able to define a sampling frame from which participants were subsequently drawn was a required characteristic for inclusion in the prevalence and incidence summary. Other approaches to the study of large groups, such as enrolling individuals who are presenting for clinical care, or w ho have just had a health event li ke childbirth or surgery, can be informative, however, such studies do not by vi rtue of their design, generate participant pools who are representative of a larger population. They represent those with access to care, who have sought care for a problem visit, chronic condition, or preventive care, or who have a medical condition or experience in common. Such designs may also reflect characteristics of the site of care at which the cohort was recru ited, such as a high proportion of i ndigent patients or specialty referral patients. For this reas on, cohort studies and clinical samples, without a population-based sampling frame were excluded in order to emphasize the broadest pictur e of the epidemiology and natural history of OAB is as possible. Prevalence of Overactive Bladder Using this approach, we identified 75 publications,2-4, 10-81 from 60 distinct study populations. Detailed summaries for all studies are included in Appendix C and a summary is provided in Table 6. 33 34 Table 6.

Thirty-eight of these studies appeared in print after the 2002 International Continence Society revised definiti ons and 37 percent of these reported specifically about incidence or prevalence of OAB. One study pr ior to the consensus definitions used fully comparable definitions and the term \"overactive bladder\". A total of 15 studies provided information about OAB prevalence (Table 7). These studies included a total of 64,528 women in 16 distinct populations. The majority of respondents completed questionnaires returned by mail. The highest estimat es of OAB prevalence was 31.3 percent in a telephone questionn aire study conducted in Korea in which the average age of participants was 59 years; the lowest was 7.7 percent in a maile d questionnaire conducted in the United Kingdom among women of nearly identical average age. Across all studies the weighted average prevalence of OAB was 13.7 percent. Excluding the highest and lowest estimates, an estimated 14.8 percent of wome n meet criteria for OAB, with 8.0 percent of those surveyed having OAB with a component of urge incontin ence. Combined estimates from the two United States populations are similar: 14.7 percent with OAB and 11.3 percent with a component of urge incontinence. No clear pattern of higher or lower estimates for prevalence of OAB was associated with survey response rates. The direction of bias is therefore difficult to es timate: researchers have noted both that those with sympto ms may be more likely to be interested in the topic and to respond and that the social stigma or embarrassm ent associated with bladder control symptoms may prompt under-response. In each case in which the authors addressed non-response, they report the demographic characteri stics of those who did not res pond were similar to those who did with the exception of severa l authors who noted modest under-representation of the very oldest residents. Age and prevalence of OAB. The relationship between OAB and age was fairly uniform across studies with a trend to increase with age.2, 3, 12-14, 38, 42 As discussed below, this increase appears to be more notable for OAB than UUI. Because OAB criteria can be met with urgency combined with incontinence, frequency, or nocturia, the \"amplification\" of age effects for OAB risk may in part be related to well-doc umented increases in stress urinary incontinence and therefore also mixed stress and urge incon tinence with age. Prevalence of OAB for women in their 20s was in the range of 4.6 to 5.9 percent 2, 3, 11, 13 while uniformly double digits, 11.7 to 19 percent 2, 3, 11, 13 for women older than 60. Several research ers noted a threshold effect such that prevalence was not statistically differe nt until an inflection in the 60s or 70s.12, 14, 38, 42 Few data were provided, however discussion materials often noted that all component symptoms: urgency, frequency, nocturia, and urge and mixed incontinence, increased with age therefore contributing to the rise in OAB. 36 Table 7.

Complete information for each study is included in evidence tables; OAB-wet indicates OAB with incontinence. 37 Prevalence of Urge Urinary Incontinence A larger number of studies (n=48) examined urge urinary incontinence as the primary prevalence estimate of interest. Twenty-six di stinct study populations , with 36 publications, appeared after the ICS 2002 consensus definitions.2, 3, 10-14, 17-19, 21, 25, 27, 29, 31-38, 70, 72, 75, 80 These are presented here in greater detail because the definitions used are more similar to those that define \"OAB-wet\" and therefore are more likely to have comparability in the measures. Across all these populations, prevalence of urge incontinence ranged from a low of 1.5 percent in a large European study of all adult women from ages 18 to 70, 18 up to a high estimate of 22.0 percent in a United States mall-based consumer survey36 and 26.4 percent among a household sample of Jordanian women age 50 to 65.35 Each of the latter had somewhat ambiguous survey items. Average urge incontinence prevalence by region was: United States: 9.7 percent among 37,596 respondents from nine populations2-4, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 25, 27, 32, 36, 40, 42, 72 Europe: 10.6 percent among 68,051 respondents fr om seven studies including nine countries18, 37, 43, 45, 48, 75, 81 Asia: 9.6 percent among 14,537 respondents from fi ve populations in three countries14, 21, 29, 31, 33, 34, 41, 47, 80 Other: 12.5 percent among 6,219 responde nts in five populations from five countries12, 35, 38, 49, 70 Though more than half of studies did not report the frequency of urge incontinence episodes required to meet the case defini tion (e.g., weekly, monthly), or us ed nonspecific terms such as \"mostly\" and \"sometimes\" in definition, these es timates are concordant with the range of estimates for the prevalence of OAB with urge incontinence features, suggesting that the measurement instruments captured similar featur es. These estimates are consistent with the AHRQ report on the Prevention of Fecal and Urin ary Incontinence in Adults, which reported prevalence of UUI in community dwelling adul ts as increasing \"fro m 5 percent in younger women to 10 percent in women 45-64 (32 studies), and to 12 percent in women older than 65 years (28 studies)\".196 In the nine studies in which the interval of o ccurrence required to meet the definition of urge incontinence was specified, there was not a clear pattern of relationship between length of the interval and proportion of women cla ssified as having urge incontinence.10, 17, 27, 31, 34, 37, 38, 72, 80 Overall the average prevalence of UUI across these nine studies was 8.9 percent. The two studies that required weekly symptoms reported a pr evalence of 7.0 and 6.5 percent (in populations which had an average age of 61, and an age range from 35 to 75 without a mean reported, respectively).21, 31, 38 The average across six studies that re flect a wide age range and required at least monthly episodes was 9.4 percent, and th e sole study reporting any urge incontinence within the year was 7.9 percent with an averag e respondent age of 51.72 This lack of a pattern associated with the operational de finition of frequency of urge incontinence episodes may result from variation in the methods of measurement or characteristics of the respondents that obscures any trend, or, more likely given large population- based samples, similarity in estimates may reflect that most women who are affected have fairly frequent symptoms and are detected and properly classified regardless of interval definition required. 38 Other Measures Urgency symptoms. Individually, the symptoms of ur gency and frequency are common. The range of prevalence for urgency symptoms (in post ICS studies) was from 8.0 percent in a young population of pre-menopausal Indi an women,50 to the highest es timate of 45.4 percent among an even younger population of European women (mean age 34).48 Despite this wide range, which may reflect varied operational definitions used by researchers, nine of ten estimates for the prevalence of urgency are 10 percent or above.12, 14, 18, 34, 38, 47, 48, 50, 73 Frequency. Thirteen studies with fourteen group s reported on frequency. Most defined frequency as more than eight voids per day (or more). The range of estimates for women with daily frequency was 5.2 percent among Thai women ages 20 to 59,20 to 34 percent among Danish women ages 20 to 45,48 and 49 percent am ong Japanese women with an average age of 61.31 The average proportion of women with frequent voiding across study groups was 16.0 percent, with five estimates between 5 a nd 15 percent,12, 18, 20, 45, 50 and four estimates between 15 and 25 percent.14, 34, 38, 47 Age as a predictor of UUI. The relationship between urge urinary incontinence and increasing age was less consistent across studies th an that for OAB and age, with some authors reporting nearly identical prevalence across a ll age brackets and no st atistical trend15, 53 and others noting increases parallel to OAB,11, 12, 14, 42 more modest increases64 or threshold ages as in OAB which are inflection po ints at which prevalence was m eaningfully increased, typically among the oldest age strata: >60,11 >65,42 >70,55 and >75.38 In aggregate, the trend was less pronounced or not apparent for a strong and cont inuous influence of age on prevalence of UUI. Thresholds in older age seem mo re likely with risk being similar across wide ranges of younger ages. We must also note that such effects may not be results of age per se but of comorbidities and medication use that change with age. Other predictors. Other factors noted across studies were the influence of race and ethnicity in United States populations. Three studies (one of high quality and two of fair quality), several with more than one related pub lication, documented statistical association showing black women were more likely than white to have urge urinar y incontinence (while noting higher risk of mixed and stress among white women compared to black).11, 17, 25, 197 Another high quality United States study found no difference with adjusted estimates of prevalence of 3.5 percent among black women and 3.6 percent among white women.10 Incidence of Overactive Bladder and Urge Urinary Incontinence Ten studies provide inciden ce data. Three investigated the occurrence of new OAB symptoms over varied periods of time.22, 26, 39 Seven investigated the onset of urge urinary incontinence.15, 17, 49, 64, 74, 77, 81 Two provide information about resolution of symptoms among those with symptoms at baseline.64, 77 Estimates for annual incidence of OAB ra nged from 2.6 to 143 cases per thousand. The lowest estimates came from a population-based estimate using the national health services database of the United Kingdom and including all adults; the highest is from the top age bracket ( 80 year) in another UK study.39 In that study, by decade beginning at 40, the annual incidence was 78, 65, 100, 117 and 143 per 1,000; the remaining re port had participants with a mean of 59 years and an estimate of 54 ne w cases per 1,000 women per year.39 The largest study to address urge urinary in continence was conducted in the United States within the Nurses Health Study. They report followup from 64,650 respondents with two-year data. In each five year age bracket from 35 to 55 years of age, the annual incidence among those without symptoms at baseline was 4 per 1,000 with the exception of the 46 to 50 category at 5 39 per 1,000.15 A separate analysis within the Nu rses Health Study, using supplemental data collection to gather additional details, reported two-year incidence of urge incontinence of 14 per 1,000, which annualized to approximately 7 ne w cases per 1,000 women per year.69, 74 A six state urban sample that recruited 16,065 women and followed a subset of 3,032 for five years, reported 5-year incidence of ur ge incontinence of 15.9 percen t or 3 cases per thousand per year.17 Work in Finland in a much smaller population sample of adults who were in their 50s and 60s at baseline and followed into 60s and 70s report the equivalent of 1.1 case per 1,000 per year, and if mortality is take n into account, 1.7 cases per year . A single study in Southern Australia, reports estimates that are meaningfu lly higher than these. De fining urge incontinence as that which occurs at least occasionally, a nd without providing a spec ific definition of how urge was queried, they report annual inciden ce of 226 cases per thousand. Of note the entire study population was 70 or older and no informati on about adjustment for competing morbidity is provided.49 A study of 2,025 women older than 65 who liv ed in rural Iowa provides additional information. This interview-based study was conduc ted prior to ICS consensus definitions, the research team used the index item \"How often do you have difficulty holding your urine until you can get to a toilet?\", classi fying those who answered \"never\" and \"hardly ever\" as free of urge incontinence. Estimated 3-year incidence of urge incontinence, over two rounds of followup was 20.4 and 24 percent, which annualizes to 6.8 to 8.0 per 1,000 among older women. 64 The authors also report on remission: among those with UUI, 31.7 to 34.9 percent had resolution of their symptoms over the 3-year followup windows.64 Other research in a single United States county, among women 60 and older, found annual incidence of 17 per 1000, with 22.7 percent of women with urge incontinence symptoms reporti ng resolution within a year.77 KQ2: Outcomes of Treatment of OAB This section presents results of our literature search and findings about outcomes of pharmacologic treatments for OAB. We review the basic mechanism of action of the family of medications classified as antimuscarinic agents. Si x specific agents are available to United States practitioners: oxybutynin, tolterodine, fesoterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, and trospium. Because a number of the studies are dose ranging and safety studies, we have included doses and preparations that may not be av ailable. We also summarize st udies of estrogen treatment for OAB. Each pharmacologic agent is presented indi vidually with a thoroug h description of the content of the literature followed by the findings from trials and information from cohorts and case series, when those studies provided additional information beyond that provided by trials. Side effect and harms of trea tment are reviewed together at the end of this section. Pharmacologic Treatments Pharmacologic treatments for OAB include an timuscarinic agents which have differing affinities for multiple subtypes of muscarinic re ceptors found both in the bladder as well as throughout the body. These agents generally bind to muscarinic receptors on the bladder muscle blocking the input required for c ontraction of the muscle. In s hort, such drugs prevent or decrease the intensity of invol untary bladder contractions. Because muscarinic receptors are present th roughout the body, nonselective agents affect other processes explaining the occurrence of side effects such as dry mouth (reduced action on salivation), constipation (slowing gut contractions), dry eyes (affecting te ar ducts), and altered cognition (affecting central nervous system). In an attempt to decrease the effect on other organs 40 and improve tolerability, the development of agen ts purported to be more specific in targeting subtypes of muscarinic receptors found in the bladder has been undertaken. Medication is often initiated with the lowest dose of an agent and ad justed to the desired clinical effect while minimizing adverse eff ects. The two most frequently prescribed pharmacologic treatments for OAB in the Un ited States are oxybutynin and tolterodine. Oxybutynin is available in an oral immediate-re lease (IR) and an extende d-release (ER) form, a transdermal patch, and a topical gel, approved by the FDA in January 2009. Tolterodine is also available in both immediate and extended-releas e pills. Fesoterodine was approved by the FDA in October 2008. Fesoterodine is a first order me tabolite of tolterodine with similar selectivity. Newer agents available in the United States incl ude solifenacin, darifenacin, and trospium, which is available in both immediate a nd extended-release formulations. We reviewed 110 studies,82-96, 98-109, 140-172, 174, 198-255 of which four were good quality, 75 fair and 31 poor. This section of the report presents summary data for each pharmacologic treatment, including varied doses, intervals, and delivery mechanism. Direct comparisons across or among types of treatment (including pharmacologic, behavioral and proce dural, and others) are presented in KQ3. Additional information is also provided in that sec tion about comparisons across extended release versus immediate release. Detailed information on all studies relating to pharmacologic treatment of OAB can be f ound in evidence tables in Appendix C. The summary tables included here compile uniqu e arms of randomized trials that did not allow dose adjustment within the arm. Each dr ug and dose combination, as well as the related placebo arms, is presented here if data for the ou tcome in the summary table was provided in the publication. When necessary, weekly or monthly m easures were converted to daily in order to allow ready assessment of the baseline similarity, outcomes, and effect size across studies. Each of these pharmacologic agents has been shown to be statistically superior to placebo for some facet of OAB symptoms. Complete details of measurement appro ach and statistical comparisons are available in Appendix C; comparisons among doses of the same drug are discussed in this section, and direct comparisons between or among drugs are presented with KQ3. Treatment with oxybutynin. Content of the literature. We identified 13 randomized c ontrolled studies of oxybutynin for treatment of OAB. A total of 22 study arms compared oxybutynin at various doses and intervals, and included five placebo arms (Tables 8 and 9). Most participants were recruited from non- primary care populations with seven studi es performed in the United States, 82-88 three in Europe,89-91 and one each in Japan,92 Taiwan,93 and South Korea.94 These studies included a total of 2,575 women in treatment arms, and 383 women in the placebo arms. Participants had an average age of 59.3 and 60.9, in the treat ment and placebo groups, respectively. Outcomes of treatment. Baseline numbers of incontinence episodes per day in the oxybutynin treatment groups ranged from 1.0 to 7.2, and in the placebo arms from 0.0 to 3.0. Because many trials were drug to drug comparisons, this difference in range does not reflect marked differences between placebo and comparison gr oups within studies, rather the higher severity of symptoms in the drug to drug comparison studies which were more likely to include more individuals with multiple urge incontinence episodes per day. St udy participants using oral oxybutynin achieved a reduction in mean episodes of urge urinary in continence of between 0.0 and 4.6 over the course of placebo-controlled studies that ranged in fo llowup from 2 to 52 weeks. Of the formulations studied, 10 mg per day appeared to achieve the greatest reducti on with a range of 2.9 to 7.2 (Tables 8 and 9). However, all es timates in this section of the report should be assessed with reference to the placebo arms, in which particip ants also reported reductions in incontinence 41 episodes. In oxybutynin trials, in the placebo arms, reduction in UUI episodes ranged from 0 to 1.4. Oxybutynin was also associated with a decrease in voids per day in both oral and transdermal formulations. Baseline voids per day in drug and placebo arms were similar (7.2 to 11.7 overall). Voids per day were lowered by 1.8 to 2.3 in the transdermal arms, 0.7 to 4.2 in oral oxybutynin IR, 3.4 to 4.1 in oral oxybutynin ER and 0.8 to 1.7 in the placebo arms. Meta-analysis was possible for immediate re lease but not extended release. Immediate release reduced UUI by 1.49 episodes per day (95 percent CI: 1.18, 1.80); and voids by 2.18 episodes per day (95 percent CI: 1.75, 2.61). Table 8.

In all studies, statisticall y significant improvements were observed relative to baseline, a nd in drug groups compared to placebo. 85, 86, 88, 92, 93 The MATRIX study assessed HRQoL in patient s treated with transdermal oxybutynin.245, 246 This patient population included 2,508 women with an average age of 62.5 years, and followed patients for a minimum of six months. Sand and colleagues used the KHQ and the PPBC to assess general quality of life improvement, and reported improvement in nine of ten domains versus baseline (p<0.001).245 A second paper by Sand and colleagues employed the Beck- Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the KHQ, and demonstrated improvement in embarrassment scores, effect on sex life, and relationships w ith partners, all p <0.001. The BDI-II also showed improvement in interest in sex fr om baseline to study end (p<0.001).246 Treatment with tolterodine. Content of the literature. We included 20 RCTs83, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 94, 96, 97, 99, 140, 141, 154, 162, 168, 209, 223, 233, 240, 241 and 11 prospective cohort studies157, 160, 166, 169, 172, 212, 224, 227, 232, 239, 243 of tolterodine. Among the RCTs were 30 tolterodine arms and 14 placebo arms (Tables 10 and 11). Most were multinational studies conducted at centers in Eu rope, the United States, Australia, and Asia. A total of 6,746 women were in the treatment ar ms, with 3,298 women in the placebo arms. The average ages were 58.1 and 59.9, respectively. Outcomes. At baseline, women reported betwee n 1.6 and 5.0 episodes of urge urinary incontinence per day. Treatment with 4 mg of drug once a day reduced episodes of urge in continence an average of 0.9 to 3.7 episodes each day, compared to a reduction of 1.3 to 2.4 for 2 mg taken twice a day. These doses and intervals ar e common in clinical practice; other doses and intervals also are includ ed in Tables 10 and 11. Overall, redu ctions in urge urinary incontinence episodes on active therapy ranged from 0.9 to 3.7, comp ared to reductions in the placebo arms of 0.6 to 2.1. With respect to frequency of voiding, tolterodine was associated with 0.9 to 3.6 fewer voids per day in study populations that had baseline voiding frequencies of 7.2 to 13.7. The range of response for placebo was 0.4 to 2.2 fewer voids pe r day, in study populations that had baseline voiding frequencies of 10.3 to 12.3 per day. Redu ctions differed by treatment dosage and timing, with a reduction of 1.7 to 3.6 with 4 mg once da ily, 0.9 to 1.1 for 4 mg twice daily, and 1.4 to 3.3 for 2 mg twice daily. Estimates were developed in the meta-analysi s for decreases in UUI episodes and voids per day in tolterodine imme diate release and tolterodine extended release formulations. Tolterodine immediate release reduced UUI by 1.45 episodes per day (95 percent CI: 1.24, 1.66) and voids 44 per day by 2.19 (95 percent CI: 1.76, 2.61). Tolte rodine extended release reduced UUI by 1.75 episodes per day (95 percent CI: 1.65, 1.85) and voids per day by 2.48 (95 percent CI: 1.94, 3.02). The aggregate effect of placebo across all available study arms was a decrease in UUI episodes per day of 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30) and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. Two RCTs included urodynamic parameters to assess intermediate e ffects of tolterodine treatment.221, 238 In a dose-finding study, tolterodine 2 mg twice a day demonstrated statistically significant increase in the volume at first contra ction (p=0.03), and an in increase in maximal cystometric capacity following four weeks of treatment compared to baseline urodynamic parameters.221 In contrast, mean volume at first contra ction was significantly increased after two weeks of treatment compared to baseline (p= 0.046), but no improved outcome effect was seen for maximum cystometric capacity, bladder complia nce, or number of detrusor contractions.238 Table 10.

Twelve such studies demonstrated improvement in urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence with tolterodine treatment.142, 157, 160, 166, 169, 172, 212, 224, 227, 232, 239, 243, 247 Twelve studies including RCTs, prospective cohorts and extension studies evaluated the effect of tolterodine on patient reported outcomes, including quality of lif e in at least one arm.86, 88, 91, 99, 142, 158, 160, 174, 223, 240, 241, 247 Participants in tolterodine ar ms consistently reported greater changes in quality of life, including on various domains of the Kings Health Questionnaire, IIQ, and UDI-6 when compared to placebo that were similar to those experienced by participants of oxybutynin arms in the studies. One study evaluated the impact of treatment with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily on emotional and sexual health. Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire- Female (SQoL-F), Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Qu estionnaire (PISQ), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) were used to asse ss patient reported outcomes. Treatment with tolterodine resulted in improved scores versus placebo in SQoL-F; PISQ - total score, and HAD anxiety (p=0.004, p=0.009, p=0.03 respectively). 241 One study stratified outcomes by treatment in pa tients with prolapse and found no significant difference in changes in quality of life between those with anterior vaginal wall prolapse and those without.243 Another study stratified patients by those with urge incontinence and those with OAB syndrome without incontinence, and found similar bother and se verity scores in each group in an open label study of tolterodine ER.159 Most outcomes were equivalent in studies comparing tolterodin e IR versus ER; however, in two RCTs, extended release tolterodine resulted in a greater reduction in incontinence episodes per day, p=0.036 and p=0.05, respectively.140, 141 Other outcome parameters including voids per 49 day and pads per day showed a similar reduc tion compared to placebo with no statistical difference seen between the two formulations. Treatment with fesoterodine. Content of the literature. Two randomized controlled trials co mpared fesoterodine at 4 and 8 mg to placebo for reducing symptoms of OAB in this literature that met criteria for inclusion in the systematic review (Table 12).95, 96 These studies included a total of 1,017 women with a mean age of 57.7 in the treatment arms, and a to tal of 518 women with a mean age of 57.5 in the placebo arms. Both studies reported outcome data at 12 weeks of treatment. One study included a tolterodine 4 mg arm, discussed in KQ3.96 There is one paper included which is a post hoc analysis of this study population96 assessing treatment effect on health-related quality of life.142 Outcomes. At baseline, women in the treatment arms reported between 2.2 and 3.2 episodes of urge urinary incontinence per day. Treatment with drug resulted in reductions of 1.95 and 3.2 episodes per day. In the placebo arms at baseline, participants had an average of 3.7 episodes of urge incontinence per day. UUI in the placebo group was reduced by 1.14 to 1.48 episodes per day after 12 weeks of treatment.95, 96 At baseline, women in the treatment arms reported between 11.6 and 12.9 voids per day. Treatment with drug resulted in reductions of 1.4 to 1.9 voids per day. Women in the placebo arms reported between 12.0 to 12.2 voids per day at baseline, and reporte d a reduction of voids per day ranging from 0.7 to 0.95. 95, 96 In the meta-analysis, fesoterodine decreas ed UUI per day by 2.03 (95 percent CI: 1.74, 2.31) episodes and voids per day by 1.84 (95 percen t CI: 1.64, 2.03) episodes. placebo reduces UUI episodes by 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30), and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. The aggregate effect of placebo across all available study arms was a decrease in UUI episodes per day of 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30) and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. The post hoc analysis of fesoterodine arms showed significant improvement in HRQoL as assessed by KHQ and ICIQ-SF in both fesoterodine 8 mg arm and the tolterodine ER 4 mg arm versus placebo, but there was no significant di fference between arms. The fesoterodine arm showed significant improvement in eight of nine domains (non significant in General Health domain). A subset of patients who reporte d incontinence at baseline showed similar improvements versus baseline; however, no signifi cant difference was seen between arms as well as between subsets of those reporting incont inence at baseline versus those without.142 50 Table 12.

Content of the literature . Three RCTs investigated solifenacin compared to placebo for reducing symptoms of OAB (Table 13).97-99 These studies included at total of 1,541 women, with a mean age of 58.2 years in the solifenacin trea tment arms, and a total of 638 women with a mean age of 59.3 in the placebo arms. Two were conducted at multiple centers across Europe, and the other in Japan at academic health centers. One of these trials compared solifenacin to tolterodine, without a placebo arm, and is described in KQ3.99, 211 A newly published RCT performed at multiple centers in the United Stat es comparing solifenacin at various doses to placebo over twelve weeks focused on outcome s of urgency and \"warning time\" showing significant decrease in urgency episodes per da y (p<0.001), and an increase of 31.5 seconds in median warning time (p=0.008).222 Voids per day and UUI episode s per day were significantly reduced compared to placebo (both p<0.001).222 Outcomes. The first study compared solifenacin 5 mg and 10 mg daily to placebo and propiverine 10 mg.98 Women in the two solifenacin arms (713 women with a mean age of 60.2) had an average decrease in the number of UUI episodes per of 1.45 and 1.52 at 12 weeks compared to a reduction in the placebo arm of 0.89 (p<0.001 for comparisons of both dosages to placebo). 98 Participants had a signifi cant decrease in the number of voids per day of 1.9 to 2.9 (p<0.001 for both doses) 51 The second study also studied 5 mg and 10 mg doses, compared to placebo. Women in the two solifenacin arms, 5 mg and 10 mg, (531 wo men with a mean age of 57.1) experienced reductions in number of UUI episodes per da y of 1.4 and 0.9, respectively at 12 weeks. The placebo arm (267 women with a mean age of 57.7) demonstrated a reduction in urge urinary incontinence episodes per day of 0.6.97 Solifenacin was associated with a decrease of 1.46 episodes of UUI per day (95 percent CI: 1.32, 1.59) and of 2.19 voids per day (95 percent CI: 1.94, 3.02) in the meta-analysis. Quality of life was assessed in four studies of solifenacin.98, 99, 218, 225 Quality of life measures improved significantly in the solifenacin arms218 including when compared to placebo.98, 225 Significant improvement in quality of life was maintained upon sub- analysis for African Americans and Hispanics.205, 229 Perception of bladder conditi on was better in one solifenacin arm that was compared to tolterodine99 (p=0.006). Two prospective case series with multiple publica tions evaluated solifenacin in the treatment of OAB.205, 218, 220, 229 One study included 1,280 women w ith a mean age of 56.4 years.220 Participants had a 66 percent reduction in incont inence episodes per day (from 2.66 to 0.93), a 23 percent reduction in voids per day (12.16 to 9.18), a 63 percent re duction in urgency episodes per day (5.76 to 2.28), and a 32 percen t reduction in nocturia episode s (1.95 to 1.25) as assessed by urinary diary at one-year followup. A dose ranging study evaluating treatment with solifenacin 5 and 10 mg daily after washout from tolterodine 4 mg ER, darifenacin or tr ospium found significant improvement in UUI episodes per day and voids per day over a 12 we ek treatment period after 14 day washout period (p<0.001). Patient reported outcomes assessed by the PPBC and OAB-q questionnaires indicated significant subjective improvement (p<0.001 in all domains).208 Another prospective randomized trial compar ed Solifenacin 5 and 10 mg daily to placebo. This study used the PPIUS (Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale) to assess treatment effect on urgency, and demonstrated that Solifenacin at the two doses demonstrated significant improvement in severe urgency episodes over placebo (p<0.001). In addition, patient reported outcomes of urgency bother, patient PBC score, and treatment satisfaction were significantly reduced compared to placebo (p<0.001).206 Table 13.

Content of the literature. Five RCTs provided data on the effectiveness of darifenacin.82, 100- 102, 210 Three compared 15 and 30 mg daily re lative to placebo (Tables 14 and 15).82, 100, 101 These three studies included a total of 690 women, with a mean age of 57.6 years in the darifenacin treatment arms and a total of 304 women with a mean age of 57.6 in the placebo arms. Two of the three were conducted in the United States in a non-primary care population.82, 101 The other was performed at multiple centers in Eu rope including community-based ambulatory populations, and also included a 7.5 mg arm.100 The fourth study compared only darifenacin 7.5 mg to placebo and included 269 women with m ean age of 57.5 in the treatment arm, and 129 women with an average of 58.5 in the placebo ar m. This was a dose change study without report of outcomes by dosage.102 A fifth RCT also compared darifenacin 7.5 mg to placebo in a multinational, multicenter trial. This was a dose changing study without reporting of outcome by dosage. The treatment arm included 206 women with an average age of 72 years and a placebo 53 arm including 100 women with an average age of 73 years.210 One of these studies82 also compared darifenacin to oxybutynin; the darifena cin arm is presented in Tables 14 and 15, but the comparison is described in the chapter on KQ3. Outcomes. Baseline urge urinary incontinence ep isodes per day in the darifenacin arms from 2.0 to 2.9. Urge urinary incontinence ep isodes per day on treatment ranged from 0.8 to 1.6, for a decrease in episodes of UUI per day ranging from 1.2 to 1.8. This is compared to an average reduction in the placebo groups of 0.8 to 1.0, with similar baseline measures of 2.3 to 3.0. At baseline, participants repor ted an average of 10.3 to 11.0 voids per day. The treatment groups reported reductions ranging from 1.1 to 2.2 per day, compared to 0.8 to 1.8 in the placebo group. Study followup ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Daily episodes of the symptom of urinary urgency also were reported to be reduced after treatment with darifenacin (range of reduction: 1.4 to 3.0 compared to 0.6 to 1.2 in placebo). The one study that reported reduction in urgency on a weekly basis, however, found no significan t difference between treatment and placebo.101 Because of a lack of uniform information provided in the studies on variance measures, we could not use meta-analysis techniques to estim ate effects of darifenacin on UUI or voids per day. In the first dose-adjustment trial, urge urinar y incontinence episodes were not reported, but voiding frequency was significantly reduced in the treatment arm versus placebo, p=0.001.102 In the second dose changing trial changes in urge urinary incontinence episodes per week were not statistically different between the two arms (p=0.328), but reductions in voids per day were statistically greater in the treatment arm versus placebo (p=0.006). This study also assessed urgency episodes per day, but found no statistica lly significant difference in effect (p=0.174).210 Three studies assessed quality of life (QoL) with validated questionnaires using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), OAB-q, King's Health Ques tionnaire (KHQ), and ICIQ. The arms using 15 and 30 mg showed statistically significan t improvement versus placebo, p=0.045 and p=0.011, respectively.100 Zinner evaluated 15 mg versus placebo and showed significant improvement in quality of life questionnaires, OAB-q (p<0.001), ICIQ (p<0.001) and KHQ (p<0.05).101 Chapple demonstrated improvement all domain s of the OAB-q versus placebo (p<0.001).210 A single prospective cohort study evaluated the e fficacy and tolerability of darifenacin.219 This prospective, non-comparative, open-label extens ion study was conducted in multiple countries in Europe, Australia, and North America.102 The authors stratified re sults by age. All outcome parameters were similar between groups showing similar reductions in voids per day, urgency episodes per day, and severity of urgenc y in those over and under 65 years old. 219 A second paper describing the open labeled extension study of those patients219 demonstrated significant improvement from baseline in eight of nine domai ns (p<0.001) in health related quality of life outcomes as measured by the KHQ at 24 months. Significant reductions were confirmed in the subgroup of subjects 65 years ol d and greater. The only domain th at did not show improvement was the General Health Perceptions.217 54 Table 14.

Content of the literature. Five RCTs evaluated trospium fo r reduction of symptoms of OAB. Four trials compared trospi um to placebo, and one compared trospium to oxybutynin (5 mg twice daily) (Table 16). Four we re conducted in the United States,103, 104 , 105, 106 and the fifth at multiple centers in Europe and Asia (Tables 16 and 17).90 These studies incl uded a total of 1,309 women, with a mean age of 59.8 years in the trospium treatment arms, and a total of 1,130 women with a mean age of 60.1 in the placebo arms.103-106 One trial included a comparison to oxybutynin (5 mg twice a day).90 The trospium arm is included in Tables 16 and 17; and the drug to drug comparison in noted in KQ3. Outcomes. Reductions in numbers of urge urinary incontinence epis odes per day at 12 weeks ranged from 1.8 to 2.5 relative to reductions in the placebo arms of 1.3 to 1.9. Reduction in voids per day on treatment ranged from 2.4 to 3.5 at 12 weeks, compared to placebo at 1.3 to 2.1 Meta-analysis could be used to estimate eff ects of trospium extended release only. This formulation reduced UUI episodes per day by 2. 45 (95 percent CI: 2.19, 2.70) and voids per day by 2.68 (95 percent CI: 2.38, 2.98) episodes. The aggr egate effect of place bo across all available study arms was a decrease in UUI episodes per day of 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 1.30) and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71) per day. Three studies evaluated urgency severity using the Indevus Ur gency Severity Scale (IUSS). All three studies found sta tistically significant improve ments in severity of urgency at trial end in the trospium arms versus placebo: p=0.0004, p 0.001, and Table arms for trospium chloride effect on urge incontinence Author Year N (% Women) Mean age Episodes per day baseline Episodes per day on treatment Decrease in episodes per day Weeks treated Trospium 60 mg once a day Dmochowski et al. 105 2008 267 (82.1) 61.2 4.0 1.6 2.4 12 Trospium 60 mg once a day Staskin et al.103 2007 263 (85.2) 59.6 4.1 1.6 2.5 12 Staskin et al.103 2007 263 (85.2) 59.6 4.1 1.8 2.4 4 Trospium 20 mg twice a day Rudy et al.104, 242 2006 323 (81.8) 61.1 2.9 1.0 1.9 12 Halaska et al.90 2003 200 (85.0) 54.2 1.5 0.5 1.0 52 Zinner et al.106 2004 256 (77.9) 63.0 3.0 1.2 1.8 Placebo Dmochowski et al.105 2008 276 (87.7) 58.4 4.0 2.4 1.6 12 Staskin et al.103 2007 273 (84.5) 59.3 4.1 2.2 1.9 12 Rudy et al.104, 242 2006 325 (81.2) 61.0 2.9 1.6 1.3 12 Zinner et al.106 2004 256 (71.6) 61.5 4.3 2.4 1.9 12 Staskin et al.103 2007 273 (84.5) 59.3 4.1 2.4 1.8 4 Table 17.

Content of the literature. Three studies assessed the role of hormonal therapy in different doses and formulations in the alleviation of OAB symptoms.107-109 All studies were performed in Europe and Scandinavia. They included a tota l of 508 women with a mean age of 62.4 years. Three were RCTs and one was a case series. Outcomes. One RCT compared oral estriol 3 mg pe r day to placebo at academic centers in England. They found that estriol was not signi ficantly superior to placebo at improving symptoms or objective measures for al l patients at one or three months.107 The second RCT compared an estradiol releasing va ginal ring to an estriol vaginal pessary in a community population in Denmark, and found bot h equal in improvement of UUI episodes, urgency, and nocturia. In each arm, 58 percent of participants had decreased UUI at 24 weeks; 51 and 56 percent had decrea sed urgency, respectively.108 This is difficult to interpret in the absence of a placebo comparison. A recently published RCT compared tolterodine 2 mg twice daily with and without CEE (conjugated equine estrogens) vaginal cream 0.625 mg twice we ekly. Voids per day decreased significantly in the CEE arm (p=0.001), but did no t show significant difference in UUI events per day. Subjective assessment with UDI-6 and IIQ-7 showed significant improvement in the tolterodine with CEE arm (p=0.001).247 One case series found oral HRT significantly improved frequency at six-month followup where dosage was not associated with outcome. Hormone replacement therapy in the form of 58 estriol significantly decreased frequency in the OAB arm at six weeks.109 Outcomes were assessed with a five-point unvalidated rati ng system and no helpful comparison group.

The risk of occurrence of harms reported in treatment arms often overlapped those observed with placebo. Dry mouth was the most commonly reported harm , ranging from 5.9 percent to 88 percent in studies of oxybutynin IR, compared to 1.6 to 21 pe rcent in placebo arms. Studies of transdermal oxybutynin had the lowest reported estimates of dry mouth (2.6 to 9.6 percent). Impaired urination, not defined by the authors, was repor ted in studies of oxybutyni n and tolterodine. It 62 was highest in two studies of oxybut ynin IR (14 to 29 percent), comp ared to 3.2 to 4.0 percent in two studies of oxybutynin ER, no events to 9.0 per cent in six studies of tolterodine IR and 1.0 percent in one study of tolterodine ER. Urinary tr act infections were repo rted by up to 11 percent of participants in eight placebo arms. Imme diate release formulations of oxybutynin and tolterodine both had reports of up to about 18 percent of participants experiencing a UTI, compared to up to 12 percent in studies of oxybutynin ER and 4.1 percent in studies of tolterodine ER. Between 0 and 32 pe rcent of participants in treatment arms reported constipation; again, the highest rate was repor ted in an oxybutynin IR arm. Darifenacin had the second highest proportion of participants reporting constipation (18.5 to 27.8 percent). Up to seven percent of participants in placebo arms also reported constipation. Cardiac events, including new abnormalities on EKG, were very rare and reported in only a few studies. The highest reported rate of cardiac events was five percent in tolterodine ER. Generally, however, less than one percent of pa rticipants experienced any cardiac event, mostly tachycardia and arrhythmias in treatment arms, with events also occurring in placebo arms (0 to 0.9 percent). 63 Table 19.

This section presents the results of our literature search and findings abou t outcomes of procedural and surgical treatments for OAB. These treatments include sacral neuromodulation, peripheral neuromodulation, electromagnetic nerve stimulation, injection or in stillation of drugs into the bladder, bladder distention and bladder transecti on. No studies regarding augmenta tion cystoplasty or detrusor myomectomy met our search criter ia. Detailed information on all studies relating to surgical management of OAB can be found in evidence tables in Appendix C. Sacral neuromodulation. Stimulation of the sacral nerve ro ots is a technique in which an electrical stimulus directly stimul ates the S3 sacral nerve root.256 The technique has evolved over time, but typically it is performed as a staged procedure. The first stage involves a \"test\" stimulation using a percutaneous needle to stimulate the S3 nerve root. If there is a favorable response during the trial period, then long-term stimulation can be provided by implanting an implantable pulse generato r surgically. The implantable pulse ge nerator is usually placed in the fatty tissues overlying the buttock s, although abdominal placement was used with some of the earlier studies. Recent evolutions in this technique now permit a pe rmanent lead to be used for the test stimulation. If the test is unsuccessful, the lead can be removed, but if it is successful, this lead is attached to the permanent implanta ble pulse generator. This has the advantage of ensuring that stimulation is provided in the exact location as during the te st period. (Previously, a new lead was placed at the time of the implanta ble pulse generator placement.) The mechanism by which neuromodulation acts to improve sy mptoms is not completely understood. The technique is used for urinary urgency, frequency, and urge in continence refractory to other treatment modalities.256 It is also used for ur inary retention. Given thes e seemingly contradictory applications, it is thought that th e electrical stimulation affect s the afferent nerves (which perceive bladder sensation), thus allowing them to appropriately transmit bladder sensations. Peripheral neuromodulation. Other techniques for neuromodul ation involve stimulating the S3 nerve fibers more peripherally, at the posteri or tibial nerve or cutane ous stimulation of the pudendal nerve via an anal or vaginal probe.257 For the posterior tibial nerve stimulation, a needle is placed percutaneously near the ankle and is attached to an external electrical device. Instead of implanting an implantable pulse genera tor, the patient return s for periodic sessions, often weekly for a series of treatments. Small case series suggest that posterior tibial nerve stimulation may improve OAB symptoms. 258-260 There were no studies involving this technique which met our search criteria. One study evalua ting neuromodulation of the pudendal nerve with anal and/or vaginal probes met our search criteria. Similarly, th is is performed on an outpatient basis with weekly treatment sessions. For the purposes of this report, sacral neurom odulation will refer to techniques that directly stimulate the S3 nerve root. Peripheral neur omodulation will refer to nerve stimulation peripherally, such as the use of an anal or vaginal probe to stimulate the pudendal nerve. These approaches are reviewed in th e same section of this text. Electromagnetic sacral nerve stimulation. Electromagnetic stimulation is yet another modality to modulate the neurolog ic control of the bladder. Mo st treatments involve large, powerful magnets which require a dedicated facility as the magnets are not portable. 261 The study included in this review evaluated the use of a smaller, portable electromagnetic system. Bladder instillation/injection of a drug. Another approach to tr eating urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence is to instill or inject a drug in to the bladder. Numerous drugs 65 have been administered using th is approach. Two categories of in travesical drugs are included in this review, antimuscarinic agents and neurotoxins. By instilling or injecting the drug directly into the bladder, systemic adverse effects are theoretically avoided. Two neurotoxins discussed in this review are resiniferatoxin and botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin is a neuromuscular blocking agent which prevents nerve conduction. Typically botulinum toxin-A is used and can be injected directly into the wall of the bl adder under cystoscopic guidance as a treatment for refractory OAB.262-264 It is not FDA approved for this indication at the time of the writing of this document. Concerns with this approach are th e risk of urinary tract infections and urinary retent ion and that the ideal dosing has not yet been determined. Additionally, the effects of botulinum toxin ar e temporary and multiple courses of treatment would be anticipated. An RCT comparing bo tulinum toxin A to placebo for women with refractory urge incontinence found that incon tinence episodes decreased from over 20 episodes per three day diary to less than 5 episodes per three day diary among those receiving botulinum toxin A, while those taking placebo had no differen ce in the number of incontinence episodes. Using a Patient Global Impression of Improvement score, approximately 60% of the women who received botulinum toxin A had a clinical response, and this res ponse lasted six times longer than that achieved with placebo. The study was stopped early due to increased postvoid residuals in 43% of women receiving botulinum toxin A and a high rate of urinary tract infections among those with elevated postvoid residuals.265 Resiniferatoxin is a neurotox in in the same category as capsaicin; these do not have FDA approval for the treatment of OAB. These agents block transmission along the C-fibers, nerve fibers involved in transmitting noxious stimuli.127 It has been hypothesized that inhibition of these fibers may be a treat ment for overactive bladder. A review of RCTs evaluating the use of intravesical botulinum toxi n for OAB was published by the Cochrane Coll aboration in 2007.128 Eight studies met their se arch criteria: five were published abstracts and three were full papers. Only one of the eight studies exclusively dealt with idiopathic OAB, the definition we used fo r our literature search. The remaining seven studies in the Cochrane review incl uded subjects with neurogenic OAB. The findings from the Cochrane review were that botulinum toxin injections were more effective than placebo, with fewer incontinence (u nspecified type) episodes per day at 2 to 24 weeks and fewer incontinence episodes compared to baseline. Improvements following treatment were also seen in incontinence specific a nd overall quality of life. Urodynamic changes were also seen, including decreased pr essure during a detrusor cont raction and increased bladder capacity following treatment with botulinum toxi n. The postvoid residual, the amount of urine left in the bladder after voidi ng, was also elevated. The numerical data were not provided by the author. Adverse events included cases of ur inary retention requiring intermittent self catheterization following treatmen t. Of the patients requiring catheterization, 25 percent had a lower urinary tract infection. In the Cochrane Collaboration, the limited number of studies, their small size and heterogeneous population highlight the need fo r more research regarding treatment with botulinum toxin.128 One study compared botulinum toxi n to bladder instillations with resiniferatoxin and found lower rates of incon tinence, increased bladder capacity and lower detrusor pressure during uninhibite d bladder contractions at 6 to 18 months with the botulinum toxin treatment. The optimal dose or long term effects of elevated pos tvoid residuals has not been determined. Bladder distention and bladder transection. Two treatments that are no longer in common practice, prolonged bladder distenti on and bladder transection, are also included in this review. The bladder distention study descri bes distending the bladder to ma ximum capacity at a pressure equal to systolic blood pressure for four hours.118 Bladder transection involves cutting the 66 bladder wall and detrusor muscle. Both have significant morbidity and have been abandoned by most practitioners. Outcomes of procedural and surgical treatments. Content of the literature. We identified 18 studies reporting on surgical treatments and procedures for OAB (clinical trials reported in Table 20).110-127 Eleven were of sacral neuromodulation, one of peripheral neuromodulation and one of electromagnetic sacral nerve stimulation. Three st udied bladder instillation or injection of drugs, one was of bladder distention and one was of bladder transection. Six of the 11 studies on sacral neuromodulation come from a fa mily of papers financially supported by one company.110, 111, 114, 115, 123, 124 The patient population for this family of studies included an RCT to evaluate sa cral neuromodulation versus me dical therapy for six months.124 The other studies involved simila r inclusion and exclusi on criteria, but varied in regards to the number of centers involved in recruitment (between 12 and 17 centers) and timing for enrollment. Given this, it is not possible to determine the degree of subject duplication. Table 20.

Three of these studies are retrospective case series of a particular surgical treatment: tw o report on sacral neuromodulation119, 120 and one on bladder transection.121 Nine studies are prospective case series: six report on sacral neuromodulation,110- 115 one on peripheral nerve stimulation with anal and/or vaginal probes,116 one on botulinum-A toxin injections117 and one on prolonged bladder distention.118 One case series had both a retrospective arm as well as a prospective arm; this study looked at sacral neuromodulation.122 67 One study is a prospective cohor t that compared outcomes among subjects receiving sacral neuromodulation and subjects receiving a cont rol surgery for sacral neuromodulation, but without active elec trical stimulation.123 one looked versus evaluated stimulation versus sham,125 and two evaluated instillation of a drug into the blad der versus placebo - one using oxybutynin126 and one using resiniferatoxin.127 The majority of the studies we re conducted in Europe, six of which included involvement from Canada and the United States (there is subject duplication among these six studies). One study was conducted in the United States only. Two studies were performed in Australia and one in Brazil. Two of the studies involved nationa l registries, one from Switzerland and one from Italy. Five studies specified that they occurred in an academic sett ing, three in a specialty setting and the remainder did not specify th e clinical setting for the study. The quality of the studies varied widely. Of th e four randomized contro lled trials, three had an appropriate control group, the fourth compared sacral neuromodulation to continued medical treatment among subjects who had already fail ed medical management for refractory OAB.124 This does not adequately contro l for the placebo effect, which is quite prominent among these treatments. It is challenging to create an a ppropriate control group when evaluating sacral neuromodulation. This is illustrated by a cohort study in which surgical controls received sacral neuromodulation, but no electrical stimulation was applied. Given that subjects feel the electrical stimulation, they would be aware that this has been de-activated following the test stimulation.123 Of the 11 studies on sacral neur omodulation, seven did not restrict the study population to OAB. Although sacral neuromodulation may be used to treat urinary retention, grouping these studies in such a fashion severely limited our ability to analyze the results. We restricted our discussion to the OAB findings in these papers. Case series studies are limited by the lack of a control group. Outcomes assessed . Half of the studies reported on urge urinary incontinence outcomes (usually incontinence episodes per day as measur ed by a bladder diary, but also pad counts, pad weight, severity of incontinence or other measur es). Nearly two-thirds of the studies reported some measure of urinary frequency, such as voids per day. Nearly all of the studies reported on a subjective measure of symptoms (such as percent cured, perceived severity, QoL). A third of the studies reported on urodynamic outcomes, such as the bladder volume at which there was a normal desire to void, and bladder capacity. The majority (78 percent) of the studies, reported data on adverse effects or harms. Six studies reported on problems with cons tipation or gastrointestinal symptoms, 111, 114, 116, 119, 120, 126 eight reported the presen ce of pain, six reported on infecti on and nearly half of the sacral neuromodulation studies reported th e presence of lead migration. Other adverse effects were reported in 72 percent of studies. Outcomes of sacral neuromodulation and peripheral neuromodulation. The one RCT comparing sacral neuromodulation to medical therapy found a reduction in daily incontinence episodes from 9.7 to 2.6 in th e intervention group, compared to an increase of 9.3 to 11.3 in the medical management group at six months (p<0.01).124 Of note, all subjects receiving medical therapy had already failed me dical management; no benefit from continued medical therapy would be expected. The remaini ng six case series that reported on change in UUI had decreases in mean incontinence epis odes per day of 51 pe rcent to 80 percent111, 114, 115, 119, 122 and from a median of five down to zero incontinence episodes a day.112 Length of followup in these studies ranged for six months to five years. 68 Pad use per day also decreased with sacral neuromodulation. Most studies started with a baseline of five or more pads used daily. One RCT reported an 82 percent decrease in pad use from 6.2 to 1.1 pads daily, six months follo wing initiation of sacral neuromodulation.124 Three case series evaluating sacral neuromodulation al so found significant decreases in pad use ranging from 49 to 84 percent fewer mean pads111, 114, 115 and a 75 percent decrease in median pad use.112 Length of followup on these studies range d from six months to five years. Some of the studies tried to characterize the severity of incontinence episodes. One RCT and two case series found a 64 percent to 92 percent d ecrease in the number of moderate to heavy urge urinary incontinence episodes at six months to five years of followup.111, 115, 124 The RCT reported the highest rate of decr eased heavy incontinence episodes with a mean baseline in the neuromodulation group of 3.4 per day, reduced to 0.3 per day six months after treatment. In comparison, those with refractory OAB receiving us ual therapy experienced an increase in mean heavy episodes per day from 2.6 to 3.9.124 Improvement in episodes of urinary urgency with out incontinence is difficult to measure as it is a more elusive symptom. Nonetheless, on a 3 point scale, (1=mild, 2=m oderate, 3=severe), 69 percent of participants in one study reported improvement,114 with a second study showing no change in experience of urgency.115 Reduction in urinary frequency of between 31 a nd 45 percent is seen consistently across studies of sacral neuromodulation, regardless of study design. The majority of studies of sacral neuromodulation reported urinary frequency as the mean number of voids in 24 hours as recorded by a bladder diary. Six studies reported mean voids per day, one of which was a prospective cohort study comparing subjects with sacral neuromodulation and controls who had sacral neuromodulation placed, but did not receive active electr ical stimulation. 123 At six months, those receiving sacral neuromodulation had a 45 pe rcent decrease in the number of voids per day; no change was seen in the controls. Similar results were seen in th e other studies, which found 31 to 40 percent fewer voids per day with sacral neuromodulation, regardless of whether they were prospective or retrospective case series studies.114, 115, 119 One study reported its results as a 40 percent decrease in the median number of voids per day.112 Another study reported the results from an Italian national registry; they did not have baseline information regarding the number of voids in the registry prior to treatment, but 42 percent of subjects had fewer than 8 voids daily after treatment.122 The 31 to 45 percent decrease in mean (and median) voids per day seen across the studies was present at six months and up to two years following initiation of the sacral neuromodulation. 112, 114, 115, 119, 123 The longest followup data was available from a prospective case series which f ound a 33 percent decreas e in mean voids per day at one year which was reduced to a 23 percent decrease in mean voids per day at five years.115 Some studies also looked at the mean voided volume as a measure of treating urinary frequency. One cohort study and two case series f ound that sacral neuromodulation increased the mean voided volume between 1.7 to 1.9 fold, an increase of 78 mL to 108 mL per void.114, 115, 123 Peripheral neuromodulation and electromagnetic s timulation were clinically ineffective in changing voiding frequency. One prospective case series found a 12 percent decrease in the mean voids per 24 hours was seen six weeks following 12 sessions of peripheral neuromodulation with an anal and/or vaginal probe. 116 No decrease in mean voids per day was seen with electromagnetic stimulation of the sacral nerves.125 Neither sacral neuromodulation nor peripheral ne uromodulation with an anal and/or vaginal probe had a clinically relevant impact on nocturia rates, which were very low in these studies at baseline. Both treatment approaches reduced already low rates by approximately 30 percent.116, 119 69 Several of the studies comment on clinical \"cures\" or \"improvements\", but lack definitions for these criteria. Moreover, seve ral of the case series on sacral neuromodulation include diverse patient populations which may include urinary rete ntion or pelvic pain in addition to patients with symptoms of overactive bladder. The cl inical endpoints for improvement in urinary retention are very different from thos e for urinary urgency and frequency. Studies evaluating improvements following sacral neuromodulation describe cure rates of 26 to 65 percent (cure was defined as \"compl etely dry\" at six to twelve months).111, 122, 124 One study looked at improvements following the initial test stimulation and found 39 percent had greater than a 90 percent improvement in urinary frequency and/or urgency.113 As would be expected, higher rates are seen for classifi cations of \"success\" or \"improvement\" as compared to \"cure.\" Compared to these rates, peripheral neuromodula tion only had an 8.1 per cent cure rate, with 31 percent reporting no change.116 Several studies evaluated QoL, either w ith the KHQ, a VAS or other validated QoL questionnaire (Table 21). Two studies evaluate d the impact of sacral neuromodulation on QoL and found the treatment beneficial.122, 123 There was no improvement in QoL with electromagnetic stimulation. Table 21. Effect on quality of life and satisfaction of procedural treatments Author, Year Study Type Comparison Groups, N Outcomes Hassouna et al.123 2000 Cohort G1: Neuromodulation (25) G2: Control (25) At six months, the neuromodulation group reported greater improvement in quality of life compared to controls (p<0.0001) SF-36 scores 266 were significantly higher (p<0.01) for sacral neuromodulation participants relative to controls on physical function, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social function and mental health domains O'Reilly et al.125 2008 RCT G1: Electromagnetic sacral nerve stimulation (33) G2: Sham (30) No significant differences were observed by group for the KHQ domain(s) or the Australian Quality of Life Questionnaire domain(s) after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing Rios et al.127 2007 RCT G1: Single dose 100 ml 50 nM resiniferatoxin (34) G2: Placebo (24) No differences were reported from baseline to post-treatment QoL scores by the KHQ for general health perception, social limitations or personal relationships. Incontinence impact decreased a similar amount in both groups following intervention (p<0.05 pre-post). Emotions, sleep/energy and symptom severity scores decreased more for G1 following the intervention (no between group testing) Role limitations decreased for G2 (p<0.05) but not G1 following the intervention Schmid et al.117 2006 Prospective case series Botulinum Toxin (100) 90% of patients experienced improvement in at least one category of the KHQ at three months, with a waning of benefit by nine months. Spinelli et al.122 2001 Case series G1: Sacral neuromodulation retrospective cases (93) G2: SNM prospective cases (103) In a validated QoL questionnaire 267 completed by 54% of prospective participants, all reported significant increases in life quality at all time points. 70 The evaluation of overactive bladder with urodynamics provi des objective data, but the clinical relevance of this information is not always clear. Urodynamic parameters may indicate changes in bladder function, but unless symptoms were also evaluated, they do not necessarily carry over into improvements in clinical outcomes. During bladder filling, known as cystometry, th e first sensation of bladder filling can be measured. This is known to be one of th e more variable urodynamic measurements.268 The bladder volume at first sensation increased by 80 mL after sacral neuromodulation in one case series 110 and by 36 mL after peripheral neuromo dulation with an anal/vaginal probe.116 Both of these studies also looked for ch anges in bladder capacity and found this increased 1.4 fold for sacral neuromodulation a nd found no difference for peripheral neuromodulation.110, 116 By their very nature, surgical and procedural tr eatments are likely to have a higher incidence of adverse events than conservative and medical treatments for OAB. In the early studies of sacral neuromodulation, there wa s an average of 1.1 to 1.7 adve rse events per participant.115, 124 Advances in technology, such as the use of tined leads, have d ecrease this rate and the more recent studies report 0.1 to 0.5 events per participant.112, 119 None of the studies exclusively used the newer technology. Of the advers e events, pain, lead migration or problems with the lead, infection and explantation of th e device were the most common a dverse events. From the test stimulation phase, pain at the needle site was 0.5 percent in a study employing newer technology112 and 7 percent in a st udy with older technology.113 When the implantation phase is included, pain rates and uncomfort able stimulation responses were seen in 3.9 to 43 percent of subjects, with studies empl oying new techniques at the lower end of this spectrum.112, 114, 115, 120, 122, 124 The one RCT found a pain rate of 19.1 per cent, but this was compared to medical management, not a sham procedure.124 Pain at the implantable pulse generator implantation site was typically reported separately and o ccurred 15.4 to 27 percent of the time.114, 115, 120, 124 Problems with the lead or lead migration o ccurred between 3.3 and 11 percent of the time.114, 115, 120, 122, 124 This may be less common with the new tined leads, as one study had lead migration only with the older non-tined leads112 and another found a lower loss of efficacy, 12.3 percent, with the tined leads compared to the non-tined leads, 31.7 percent.119 Infection occurred in 1.9 to 6.1 percent of participan ts, sometimes requiring hospitalizatio n for intravenous antibiotics or removal of the device.114, 119, 120, 122, 124 Two papers noted a 0.5 to 1.7 percent risk of neuropraxia or nerve injury.114, 120 There was a high rate of needing su rgical revision, with most studies showing 33 to 48.3 percent of subjects re quired a return to the operating room.114, 120, 124 Lower rates were documented in a study using newer technology, 7 percent,112 and in a national registry, 9.7 percent.122 One study looked at return to the ope rating room rates at five years and found that that there was a 67 percent risk of return (numbers based on the population enrolled).115 However, at five years, many of the s ubjects were returning for new implantable pulse generator batteries, an exp ected development over time, thus this is not truly an adverse event. Unfortunately, the number of surgeries wh ich were to replace implantable pulse generator batteries was not reported. Of the surgical adverse events, a significant proportion included explantations of the device. This occurred in 3.9 percent of subjects in the national registry;122 higher rates were seen in the re maining studies, 9.8 to 14 percent.111, 115, 120 Adverse events following peripheral neuromodula tion with an anal and/or vaginal probe led to a 19 percent dropout rate, with 29 percent of the dropouts attri buted to pain. The other most common complaint was bowel irritation.116 Currently, techniques of peripheral neuromodulation with an anal/vaginal probe are not routinely used. Outcomes of bladder instillation/injection of drugs. An RCT of resiniferatoxin bladder instillations versus placebo found no improvement in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per day with either arm.127 However, bladder instillati ons with oxybutynin did decrease 71 mean voids per day. In an RCT evaluating bladde r instillations with oxyb utynin versus a placebo with sterile water, those r eceiving oxybutynin had a 47 percen t decrease compared to a 16 percent decrease in mean voids per day with the placebo at two weeks following completion of treatment.126 This decrease is similar to that seen with sacral neuromodulation. In a prospective case series evaluating the use of botulinum-A toxi n injected into the detrusor muscle of the bladder wall, 74 percent of the subjects had 8 or fewer voids per day four weeks following treatment. All subjects had greater than 8 voids per da y at the start of the study.117 In an RCT of bladder instillations with resi niferatoxin versus placebo, there was no difference in the mean voids per day four weeks following treatment.127 Bladder instillations with oxybutynin decreased nocturia 65 percent from 5 to 1.8 episodes per night.126 Following injection of botulinum-A toxin into the bladder, 66 percent had no urgency at 12 weeks and 80 percent reported no urge incontinence. 117 No difference was seen compared to baseline or placebo in an RCT evaluating resiniferatoxin bladder instillations.127 Two studies looked at what volume the normal de sire to void occurred, finding this increased 1.6 fold (55 mL increase) for instil lation of oxybutynin into the bladder126 and 1.7 fold (83 mL) for botulinum-A toxin bladder injections.117 Theoretically these increases would result in less urinary frequency, and possibly less urgency. Similar changes were also seen in terms of bladder capacity after treatment, with bladder instilla tions of oxybutynin increasin g capacity 1.5 fold (105 mL)126 and 1.6 fold (135 mL) with botulinum-A toxin injections.117 A potential adverse effect of in travesical oxybutynin or botulinum -A toxin is impairment of the bladder's ability to empty.265 The goal of treatment with these agents is to provide a dose large enough to decrease the symp toms of OAB, without impairi ng the ability to void when physiologically necessary. An objective measurement that can serve as a proxy for this parameter is a postvoid residual, the volume of urine that remains in the bladder af ter voiding; however the clinical importance of an increased postvoid residual in the absence of symptomatic urinary retention is not clear. The mean postvoid re sidual following treatment with intravesical oxybutynin increased twofold to a mean of 40 mL (range 10 to 50 mL) and for botulinum-A toxin, increased fourfold to a mean of 75 \u00b1 10 mL.117, 126 Both treatments seem to have similar effects on bladder capacity, but the risk of urinary retenti on may be higher with use of botulinum-A toxin.117, 126 Currently, oxybutynin and re siniferatoxin instillati ons are not routinely used for the treatment of OAB. For instilled/injected bladde r drugs, there were small benefits seen in the emotions, sleep/energy and symptoms severity subscales of the KHQ for subjects receiving the treatment compared to placebo. Incontinence impact sc ores improved a similar amount for both resiniferatoxin and placebo (p<0.05). Emotions, sleep/energy and symp tom severity scores decreased more for resiniferatoxi n following the intervention (p<0.05).127 Ninety percent of subjects receiving botulinum A toxin had an improve ment in QoL scores at 3 months; this effect was waning at 9 months.117 72 Outcomes of bladder distention and transection. Bladder distention and transection are treatment methods no longer in routine use. Fo llowing bladder disten tion, 18 percent were symptom free at 18 months with 52 percent unchanged.118 The study on bladder transection reports 65 percent were cured at two to five years and 16 percent were unchanged, but provides no information about the criteria for these categories.121 Prolonged bladder distention had a 4 percent rate of bladder rupture.118 Bladder transection was associated with a 14 percent rate of vesicoureteral reflux on urodynamics , the clinical significance of which was not determined, and 1 percent rate of a persistent urine leak re quiring reoperation. The aut hors also noted \"minor chest and urinary tract infections\" but the rate s of these adverse events were not reported.121 Behavioral Treatments This section presents the resu lts of our literature search and findings about outcomes of behavioral techniques to reduce overactive bladder in women. Be havioral treatment options for OAB have been used for managing urinary incon tinence for more than 50 years, although large- scale and well-designed studies on them are fairly uncommon. We reviewed 27 studies, of which 14 were fair quality and 13 poor. Behavioral techniques include the use of bladder training, pe lvic floor muscle exercises (PME), biofeedback, dietary changes, and mu lticomponent approaches that combine bladder training with PME and/or biofeedba ck. Detailed information on all studies related to behavioral techniques for OAB can be found in evidence tables in Appendix C. Bladder training. Bladder training was introduced in th e 1960s (Jeffcoate and Francis), and modified by Frewen in the 1970s. It involves education, a strict schedule of daytime voiding with progressive increases in time between voids, urgency suppression techniques, and positive reinforcement. Frewen recommended that women be treated initially on an inpatient basis, and the training was often combined with antimuscarin ic medication or sedatives to manage extreme urgency. Inpatient bladder training is no longer st andard practice, and the technique has been modified to be administered on an outpatient basis, with the use of patient education and bladder diaries. Although the underlying me chanism for bladder training in OAB is not well understood, it is thought to reverse dysfunctional habits, incr ease bladder capacity and provide techniques for handling feelings of urgency. Pelvic muscle exercises. Training the pelvic floor muscle s were originally suggested for patients with stress incontinence, the idea being that patients could learn to contract the periurethral muscles to occlude the urethra dur ing activities that caused leakage. However, it may also be useful in inhibiting detrusor cont ractions. PME can be implemented alone or with additional techniques such as biof eedback to help patients identif y and contract the appropriate muscles. Multicomponent approaches. Although both bladder training and PME can and are administered alone, they may also be comb ined with or without biofeedback for a multicomponent approach to reducing incontinence. Tools for behavioral training. Behavioral training can be administered with written materials, verbal feedback, coaching in pers on or on the phone, in groups, or using other strategies, such as cognitive approaches or biof eedback for increasing the potential for success. Behavioral approaches can also be combined with medications su ch as antimuscarinics. Various combinations of approaches are examined in the literature and are described in this review. For the purposes of this report, we will use th e term \"bladder training\" to refer to bladder training alone (i.e., without PME without biofeed back). \"Behavioral training\" will refer to a multicomponent approach that includes bladder tr aining. We indicate when biofeedback is used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. 73 Behavioral treatments. Content of the literature. We identified 29 papers from 27 studies that included arms with outcomes of behavioral interventions. We have divided the studies into three primary categories: those that compare only behavior al approaches, those that compare behavioral approaches to pharmaceutical ones directly and those that measure the effect of adding a behavioral approach to a pharmaceutical one (combination approaches). The first category is presented here and the second two are covered in KQ3. Nine studies met criteria a nd included only behavioral arms. Among these, two studies focused on comparing delivery mechanisms or a pproaches and provide in sight into techniques for teaching and encouraging particip ants in behavioral management. 132, 135 Four additional studies (r epresented in six papers) with multiple arms, including pharmacologic ones, provided data that allowed the comparison of behavioral management to placebo93, 143-145 or to another beha vioral intervention.148, 201 These are counted in the direct comparisons section, and therefore are not repr esented in the counts below, but relevant outcomes are described here as we ll as the direct comparisons sect ion, and they appear in tables in both sections. All th ree of these are RCTs. The literature base of studies that had only be havioral arms included three retrospective case series, which we have operationa lly defined as a sequence of participants having the same intervention without a comparison to another type of intervention. One examined bladder training alone,129 one examined pelvic muscle exercises130 and the third reported on a series of participants who were provided ei ther bladder training or biofeedback, but presented results only for the two groups combined.131 All three were conducted in comm unity-based clinical settings. One was a prospective cohort study comparing three bladder training approaches: self- administered, coaching a nd cognitive strategies.132 Five studies were randomized controlled trials. One compared bladder training to a \"control\" condition.133 One compared bladder training to pelvic muscle exercises.134 One included the following three arms: pelvic floor muscle training, pelvic floor muscle training assisted with biofeedback, and electrical stimulation. 93 One compared three different approaches to multicomponent behavioral training: biofeedback, verbal feedback and self-administered using an instruction booklet.135 One compared bladder training to bladder training with an additional caffeine reduction component.136 Three of the studies were conducted in the United States, four in Europe, one in Australia and one in Taiwan. Four were conducted at academic medical centers; five were in community settings, of which two included an inpatient component. Outcomes measured. For each type of intervention, we combed the publications for the outcomes and complications summarized in the analytic framework presented in Chapter 1. Five studies reported a change in nu mbers of episodes of incontinence,93, 134-136, 143 although the time period varied, and three of these ca lculated a percent reduction in incontinence episodes.135, 136, 143 Three of the studies measured incont inence episodes over the course of a week,134, 135, 143 two did so over 24 hours.93, 136 One study reported that a significant decrease in frequency of voiding was observed, but did not provide data that could be included in this table.132 Five studies presented the outcome of cure or improvement in incontinence (using various definitions)129-131, 133, 269 with three defining cure as comp lete resolution of incontinence.129, 131, 133 One study presented data on episodes of urgency separate from incontinence.136 Changes in frequency were reported in three studies.131, 136, 145 Two specified voids per day as an outcome.136, 145 In addition, Jarvis and colleagues133 reported on the numbers of women indicating that they had nocturn al and diurnal frequency before and after treatment. One study 74 recorded frequency over a three-day period132 and reported a statistically significant effect, but did not report numbers of episodes, and one reported time between voids.131 One reported that cure included achieving a minimum of three to four hours between voids129 and was therefore related to frequency but not summ arized as effect on frequency. Other patient-reported outcomes in this li terature included reports of resolution or improvement and changes in severity , quality of life, and satisfaction. Five of the studies provided some patient-re ported outcome, with four reporting on perceived improvement.130, 131, 134, 135 Three provided some report on severity;130, 135, 143 four measured bother;132, 134, 135, 143 two measured impact or interference with daily activity;134, 135 one assessed changes in quality of life overall;134 and three reported on patient satisfaction.134, 135, 143 Outcomes of behavioral treatment. UUI episodes. Lack of consistency in study design, interventions or comparison groups makes it impossible to provide consistent su mmary results across st udies. Although each intervention was associated with reductions in incontinence episodes, no behavioral approach performed better than any other in any study in this category on incontinence outcomes over any time period greater than 12 weeks.

The intervention included multicomponent behavioral training with either biofeedback or verbal feedback, compared to a self -help booklet. Multicomponent be havioral training combined bladder training techniques (e.g., relaxation approaches in the pr esence of urge, extending time between voids) with pelvic muscle exercises. The interventions took place over an eight-week period with four visits, followed by a two-w eek bladder diary. Reductions (mean: 58.6 to 69.4 percent) in episodes of incontinence were seen in a ll groups, with median percentage reductions ranging from 70.4 (IQR: -29.4, 100) to 82.8 (IQR: 0, 100). The wide IQR makes this finding somewhat difficult to interpret, and overal l there were no by-group differences (p=0.23), Nonetheless, patients' perceptions of treatment benefit differed (see section below on patient- reported outcomes) with patients in the self-adm inistered training significantly less satisfied (p=0.001). 76 Burgio et al 135 also compared their multicomponent behavioral approach to oxybutynin and placebo (study described in KQ3) and observed reductions in incontinence episodes of 81 percent among those in the be havioral group relative to 39 pe rcent in the placebo arm. Wyman and colleagues attempted to separate th e role of pelvic muscle strengthening from bladder drill, and assess the potential for a combined impact. Combining the approaches provided the greatest reduction in incontinence episodes immediately after the 12 week intervention (p=0.050), but the difference di d not persist at three months (p=0.587).134 Only one study in this body of literature included vaginal electrical stimulation.269 In this study of pelvic floor muscle tr aining with or without biofeed back compared to electrical stimulation, about half of women reported subjective improvement or cure in OAB when treated with electrical stimulation or biofeedback assisted pelvic floor muscle exercises, compared to 38 percent of women instructed in pelvic floor mu scle exercises and told to perform them at home. 269 Frequency outcomes. Number of voids per day was a common, objective measure of treatment effectiveness for behavioral interven tions - particularly as a key element of the training is generally encouraging patients to extend time between voiding progressively, with a goal of reaching three to four hours between voids. Bryant found greater reduction in frequency when a caffeine reduction component was added to bladder training (reduc tion of 4.3 versus 3.3; p=0.037).136 Women who simultaneously reduced caffein e intake had a 35 percent decrease in number of voids per day compared to 25 percent for those using bladder training alone. In the study described above of multicomponent behavi oral intervention compared to placebo (and oxybutynin), frequency of micturitio n was reduced significantly in the behavioral arm, but not the placebo arm with a reduction of 1.8 micturitions per day. Urodynamic outcomes. Three studies examined urodynamic measures pre- and post- treatment. 131, 133, 135 In all of the studies, increased bla dder capacity was seen along with changes in incontinence and frequency measures. Pelvic muscle strength. Wang and colleagues269 found that biofeedback associated pelvic floor muscle exercises resulted in greater change in muscle strength than electrical stimulation, but the clinical significance of the change was not examined. Patient reported outcomes. The nature of OAB is such that while specific morbidities and mortality are not primary outcomes, the interfer ence that OAB creates in patients' lives, along with embarrassment and stigma, is often the concern that results in treatment seeking. Therefore, characteristics that make up and affect quality of life are of concern for studies of women with OAB, and are the focus of the results presented below. Four studies presented data on patient- reported outcomes other than urgency and frequency or cure/improvement. 130, 132, 134, 135 Wyman134 examined the potential impact of combin ing pelvic muscle exercises with bladder training in an RCT of 204 wome n, of whom 59 had detrusor instability (results for the 145 women with SUI are not reported he re as they are not relevant to this report). Although both impact (measured by the IIQ-R) and quality of life (measured by the UDI) were most improved in the combination group, relative to pelvic musc le exercises alone immediately after treatment, those effects were not sustaine d three months later. The comb ination group also had greater perceived improvement immediately after treat ment, but again, no differences by group were sustained. In the Burgio study135 comparing biofeedback to verbal feedback and a pamphlet to teach multicomponent behavioral training, both biofee dback and verbal feedback performed equally well on all measures of patient perceptions of imp rovement, with verbal f eedback better than the self-help booklet on five measur es (accidents are smaller, p<0 .006; comfortable with treatment, p=0.01; description of progress, p<0.001; satisfaction with progre ss, p<0.001; and restriction of 77 activities, p=0.002). The biofeedback group perfor med better on three measures (description of progress, p<0.001; satisfaction with progress, p=0.03 and restricti on of activities, p=0.002). The biofeedback and verbal feedback groups saw no significant differences. All three groups had significantly improved quality of life scores (per Hopkins Symp tom Checklist and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire), with no by-group di fferences. Similarly, Wang and colleagues269 found that biofeedback produced greater change in th e overall Kings Health Questionnaire score among the group with biofeedback assisted pelvic floor muscle training relative to those who received PFMT without biofeedback or those who received electrical stimulation. Quality of life and satisfaction outcomes are summarized in Table 23. Table 23.

Acupun cture is an ancient Chinese medical system based on the balance of subtle energy flows (chi ) in which imbalance of energy flows can result in disease. Acupuncture therapy aims to manipula te these energies through the insertion of fine needles at key, highly specific point s related to chi flow to specifi c organs for varying periods of time. Foot reflexology is a variation of acupressure that postulates all body organs have corresponding external \"reflex points on the foot\" and the mani pulation of these points can enhance the flow of energy to th e reference organ. Specific areas of the sole of the foot are treated for specific medical conditions or symptoms. Hypnotherapy involves direct suggestion of symptom removal through therapeutic relaxation. Treatment of OAB is aimed at reduction of the component symptoms of urgency, frequency, and UUI. We identified three publications that used comp lementary and alternative medicine therapies to treat OAB: a fair qua lity trial of acupuncture, 137 a fair quality trial of foot reflexology,138 and a poor quality prospective case series of hypnotherapy.139 See complete evidence tables in Appendix C. Acupuncture. The acupuncture trial was conducted in Oregon at an academic teaching center and was notable for incorporating sh am acupuncture treatment as the comparison group.137 Among 85 women randomized, 74 (87 percent) completed al l four weekly treatment sessions and had complete outcome data at two to four weeks after treatment. Outcomes included comparison of baseline and post-treatment three-day voiding diaries as well as cystometrics, measurements of post-void residuals, the Urin ary Distress Inventory, and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire. Episodes of urge urinary incontinence were statistically equiva lent across groups at completion of four weeks of treatment. Number of voids per day were reduced 14 percent in the acupuncture group compared to 4 percent in the sham treatment group (p=0.03). This equated to a reduction of 1.4 voids per day among those receiving acupuncture. The experience of symptoms of urgency was reduced 30 versus 3 percent, with those treated having 1.6 fewer distinct episodes of awareness of urgency per day (p<0.02). Some measures, including functional bladder capacity and cystometric maximum capacity, were modestly improved in the treatment group (p<0.05); others, including volume at urge to void and detrusor contractions during cystometry, were comparable across groups with no apparent trends. Scores improved meaningfully on both validated instruments that evaluate distress and impact on quality of lif e, with statistical significance. 137 No subjects withdrew for adverse events and treatment was well tolerated. Reflexology. The study of foot reflexology was c onducted in an academic center in Hong Kong. They incorporated sham reflexology in the form of a nonspecific foot massage without deep pressure. Among 120 women randomized, 97 (81 percent) completed all treatments and the assessment at three weeks. The reflexology grou p had three of 60 drop out; the sham group had six of 60 drop out. Losses were related to various competing demands, including four individuals who reported fear of SARS which was a threat during the study period in Hong Kong, with five losses to followup for other personal or medical reasons. There were no withdrawals because of discomfort or complications of treatment. Outcomes included comparisons of baseline and followup 24-hour voiding diaries and the King's Health Questionnaire. 79 At completion, number of urge incontinence ep isodes, urgency episodes, and nocturnal voids were equivalent across groups. Daytime voids were reduced by 1.9 voids in the reflexology treatment group compared to 0.55 in the sham massa ge group (p=0.03). Quality of life measures did not differ. The authors not e that their participants ma y have been unmasked by their familiarity with what to expect from refle xology treatments: as 88.9 percent of those in the reflexology group and 67.4 percent of those in the sham massage group believed that they had received \"true\" reflexology. This differen ce in unblinding could bias the findings. Hypnotherapy. The hypnotherapy study was conducted in a UK academic setting and followed 63 women who were prospectively enro lled, had urodynamics, received 12 weeks of weekly hypnotherapy, and had followup urodynamic evaluation. Descriptive information is provided with little statistical analysis.139 Ten of 63 participants discontinued hypnotherapy before completing all sessions. Of those completing all sessions, 29 were reported to be entirely free of OAB symptoms with 14 \"considerably improved\". Of 44 women who had repe ated urodynamics, 22 initially classified as having unstable bladder \"converted to stability\", other improvements in cystometrics were also reported. This case series lacks masking of asse ssors and does not provide key patient reported outcomes. In summary, a well-conducted small trial of acupuncture has intrigui ng results related to decreased frequency of voiding and reduced symptoms of urgency which are associated with changes in cystometrics related to improved bladder capacity that are logical intermediates of the improvement in symptoms. Women in the study felt they were improved as measured by scales that capture bother and quality of life. This eviden ce is insufficient to support definitive choice of acupuncture but offers preliminary information that promises modest improvements that are similar to those reported in many pharmacologic trials. Reflexology is represented by a small trial with unmasking of participants that could have biased the results. There is not evidence to support choice of this modality. Likewise, hypnotherapy is not supported by the scant inform ation provided by one case series with little detail, patient reported outcomes, or statistica l assessment. Given the scope of placebo effects demonstrated in other well-conducted studies of OAB treatment, it is difficult to know whether to attribute any effect to hypnotherapy. KQ 3: Comparisons of Treatments Direct comparisons of treatments are made between entire ap proaches to management of OAB (e.g., pharmacologic to behavioral) or within approaches (e.g., drug to drug). In this section we present the results of any direct comparisons of either type, beginning with comparisons within the pharmacologic approach, followed by procedures compared to medical therapy or one another, and finally any comp arison involving behavioral ap proaches. This third group comprises three distinct subgroups: behavioral compared directly to pharmacologic; combination pharmacologic plus behavioral compared to ph armacologic alone, and co mbination behavioral plus pharmacologic compared to behavioral alone. Comparisons between pharmacologic treatments All trial arms for RCTs of pharmacologic treatmen t for OAB are presented in evidence tables in Appendix C. Specific comparisons have been ma de in the literature for the following pairs of drugs that describe differences in reduction in urge urinary in continence or voids per day: 142 Tolterodine IR to Solifenacin97 These studies are generally powered simplistic ally only to assess non- inferiority; studies would need to be much larger for full assessm ent of comparability at robust power for small differences between pharmacologic agents. Nonethel ess, in the majority of comparisons, neither drug was reported more effective at reducing either urge urinary incontinence episodes or voids per day with a few exceptions (Tables 24 and 25). Both oxybutynin and tolterodine in their extended release forms demonstrated superiority in reducing incontinence episodes over tolterodine immediate release.83, 140 In the OBJECT trial, oxybutynin 10 mg ER was compared to tolterodine 2 mg IR twice a day.83 At the end of 12 weeks, women taking oxybutynin reduced their epis odes per week of urge urinary incontinence from 25.2 to 6.2, compared to a change from 25.1 to 8.5 in the tolterodine arm. The difference of 2.4 episodes per week between groups was statistically significant. However, upon stratifying by age group, the difference was maintained only among those age 64 and younger. Two studies compared the effectiveness of tolterodine 4 mg once per day to tolterodine 2 mg, taken twice per day, and found that the extended release formulation resulted in significan tly greater reductions in incontinence episodes. 140, 141 Sand and colleagues found that voids per w eek diminished from 91.7 to 68.0 in the oxybutynin 10 mg extended release arm, compared to 91.6 to 71.2 in the tolterodine 2 mg immediate release twice a day arm (p=0.024).83 However, as with the difference observed for incontinence episodes, upon st ratifying by age, the difference was maintained only among those 64 years and younger. Diokno and colleagues (2003)84 observed greater reduc tions in voids per week (p=0.05) in women taking oxybutynin 10 mg ER compared to those taking tolterodine 4 mg ER in the OPERA trial. Both studies provided treatment for 12 weeks, and data were obtained via bladder diaries. Harms were ra re in both studies, although Diokno and colleagues report significantly high er rates of dry mouth with oxybutynin (p=0.02). No other comparisons yielded st atistically significant differenc es in terms of our primary outcomes. 81 Table 24.

In this study, 98 participants refractory to medical therapy were randomized to immediate sacral nerve stimulation or delayed sacral nerve stimulati on. The delay group continued unspecified medical management for a six month period before having the procedure. The study found a reduction in daily urge urinary incontinence episodes from 9.7 to 2.6 in the sacr al neuromodulation group, compared to an increase from 9.3 to 11.3 in the medical management group at six months (p<0.01).124 At 18 months, 76 percent of patients reported that they we re completely dry or had experienced a reduction in symptoms of 50 percent or greater. It is important to note that those receiving medical therapy knew they were awaiting treatment with a modality that they were invested in believing was supe rior to their current level of symptom management. The differences in risk between sacral neuromodula tion and medical management are important. Six patients had permanent explantation: three for pa in, two for infection, a nd three for change in bowel function. Comparisons between behavioral and pharmacologic treatments Nine studies, with 11 publications, included behavioral and pharmaceutical arms in direct comparison to one another.93, 143-150, 201, 254 The literature base included one prospective cohort study,147 and eight RCTs.93, 133, 143-146, 148, 150 Three of the studies were conducted in Europe, two were in the United States, two were in Asia (Taiwan and Korea), one in Brazil, and one in New Zealand. Seven were conducted at academic medical centers; two were in community settings. The behavioral approaches examined included bladder training,146-150, 254 multicomponent behavioral approaches,143-145 pelvic floor training,201, and electrical stimulation (Table 26).93 Table 26.

Two RCTs considered urge urinar y incontinence episodes as a primary outcome.93, 143 One compared multicomponent behavioral interventions to pharmacologic interventions143 and reported on changes in inc ontinence episodes. This study was a three-arm study in which multicomponent be havioral treatment was compared to pharmacologic treatment and to placebo. The behavioral arm had a significantly higher percent reduction in episodes of incontinence at th e ten-week followup (p<0.001) (80.7 percent compared to 68.5 percent for pharmacologic a nd 39.4 percent for placebo). In a pilot study comparing oxybutynin to bladder retraining, no difference was observed in effectiveness by group.254The authors calculated that to observe a di fference between these arms in a full-scale study would require 165 women in each arm, rather than the approximately 20 in the pilot. This study also had a combination therapy arm. Two studies examined the effects of electrical stimulation with different comparison groups. 93, 201 One93 found no difference in reduction of incontinence comparing electrical stimulation to oxybutynin or to placebo either within or by groups. The other201 showed no difference in effectiven ess between three groups: electrical stimulation, oxybutynin (5 mg b.i.d.) or pelvic floor exercises. Cure. Three studies reported on numbers of patien ts who achieved \"cure\" or resolution of UUI, without further definition.146, 147, 149 The results were inconsistent, the studies were of poor quality, and all were conducted prior to the ICS definition of OAB. The behavioral intervention in Jarvis, 1981149, was inpatient bla dder drill, which is not a current treatment approach.149 Diokno (1995) is a report on a series of patients who chose their own treatment modality.147 Only Colombo (1995) in this se ries was an RCT.146 Bladder training was provided over a six-week period on an outpatient basis; altho ugh cure rates at the end of treatment were essentially the same, after six months, those who had received bladder training maintained a higher cure rate (96 percent of t hose initially cure d in the bladder training group versus 57 percent in the oxybutynin group). However, the numbers reported in this study were quite small (only 53 in all groups at six months followup). Frequency. Of the six studies that provided data on voids per day, all found that both pharmacologic and behavioral approaches co uld reduce frequency, but that there was no difference between the two approaches.93, 145, 148, 150, 201, 254 Goode and colleagues conducted a secondary analysis of the original Burgio and colleagues 1998 study. They used structural equation modeling to determine that ch anges in voiding frequency were not mediating factors associated with decreases in incontinence.145 Similarly, both bladder training approaches (either multicomponent or bladder drill) and pharmacologic treatment were associated wi th urodynamic changes, including increased maximum cystometric capacity overall and at first and strong desire to void. These changes were statistically significant, and larg e enough to be clinical ly relevant as well. However, Goode and colleagues 145 examined the potential role of urodynami c changes to mediate the perceived effects of behavioral and pharmacologic treatment on in continence and found, once again, that they did not seem to be associated with observed reductions in incontinence.145 Patient reported outcomes. Burgio and colleagues used the Hopkins Symptom checklist to consider psychological changes potentially asso ciated with improvement in continence.144 Behavioral management and individually titrated oxybutynin were both associated with improvement in psychological st atus overall (including the place bo condition) and on a range of subscales, but psychological changes measur ed on the Hopkins Symptom checklist did not correlate with changes in rates of incontinence episodes. Satisfaction was highest among patients who received behavioral management (77.6 vers us 54.7 percent with oxybutynin); interestingly, satisfaction on placebo was not subs tantially different than that on drug (43.1 percent). A very high proportion of the women receiving multicomponent behavioral training felt that they were 85 \"comfortable enough\" to continue with the appr oach (96.5 percent) relative to those on drug (54.7 percent) or placebo (43.1 percent). Comparisons of combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatment to pharmacologic treatment alone Seven studies examined the effect of adding a behavioral intervention to drug compared to drug alone, one of which was a feasibility study.150-155, 254 In all but two studies, the drug was tolterodine. The literature included six RCTs 143, 150, 151, 154, 155 and two randomized open-label trial (Table 27).153, 254 Two of the studies were conducted in the Un ited States, one was in Canada, one was in multiple Scandinavian countries, one in Korea, one in New Zealand, and one did not specify, but indicated that it took place intern ationally in multiple sites. The two United States studies, the Korean one, and the one in New Zealand were conducted at academic medical centers. Burgio and colleagues (2008) provided multicomponent behavioral treatment as an adjunct to pharmacologic treatment compared to pharmacologic treatment alone152 to examine the potential for behavioral management to aid patients in ceasing medication use and staying off. The primary endpoint of interest was a combined effect of a 70 percent reduction in incontinence plus no medication use or other therapy for incontinen ce. This study examined outcomes at 10 weeks, immediately after treatment, and at 8 months after a period of no treatment to examine persistent effects. During the post-treatment period, particip ants could request a return to medication. The participants in the behavioral group reported a greater reduction in episodes of incontinence than those in the oxybutynin group at 10 weeks; however the difference did not persist to 8 months (ability to discontinue drugs was 41 percent in both groups at 8 months). The two groups also experienced similar percentage reductions in epis odes of urge incontinence (20.4 percent in the behavioral group versus 18.5 percent in tolterodine alone). The behavioral group did report statistically significantly greater satisfaction or quality of life. Table 27.

Three additional studies compared the effectiven ess of combinations of drug and behavioral approaches to drug alone in changing episodes of incontinence as well as episodes of urgency per day.151, 153, 154 Differences between the groups were small and non-significant, although there were significant decreases within all groups. Episode s of urgency decreased in all groups as well, with decreases ranging from approximately 1.9 to 2.7 episodes per day, but again there were no differences between the study groups. Two studies found that adding beha vioral training to tolterodin e was associated with further reductions in frequency comp ared to tolterodine alone;151, 152 two found no significant effect of 87 adding behavioral training.150, 155 However, the type of th e training provided differed dramatically - for example, the intervention provided by Herschorn155 was purely informational, while Burgio152 provided a multicomponent system that included biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercises. Per one study,154 addition of pelvic floor ex ercises alone in addition to tolterodine immediate release (2 mg b.i.d.) di d not confer added re ductions in frequency. In those studies that measured quality of life and participant satisfaction, improvements were significantly greater among those patients receiving combinati on therapy compared to those receiving pharmacologic therapy alone (Table 28). Table 28.

The difference between drug and combination was not statistically significant, but differences between bladder training and combination and between bladder training and drug were at p<0.05 Comparisons of combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatment to behavioral treatment alone Three studies measured the effect of adding a pharmaceutical approach to a behavioral one. All three of these studies used bladder training as the beha vioral technique. Ghei and colleagues253 describe a series of cases in which patients chose management approaches that could include e ither bladder training al one, or bladder training in addition to an antimuscarinic agent. Only 52 of 708 patients ch ose the bladder training alone, and although they experienced greater reduction in frequency (p<0.0001), those in the combination group had greater reductions in incon tinence episodes (p=0.024). A retrospective chart review of 92 patients treated with bladder retraining drill, among whom 36 also received antimuscarinics, was reported by Fantl et al.252 The outcome of cure, in this 88 clinical populations with 6 months to 6 years of followup, was defined as no further episodes of incontinence and voiding every 3 to 5 hours with no associated symptoms. Cure was achieved in 83.3 percent of patients using bladder training with antimuscarinic s and 78.6 percent of patients using bladder training alone; this di fference was not significant (p>0.6). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, patie nts were randomized to receive placebo or oxybutynin 2.5 mg twice a day in ad dition to bladder training.255 The patients taking oxybutynin had a greater reduction in daytime frequency wh en compared to the patients taking placebo (p<0.05). There were no differences between groups in the change in incontinence episodes. Finally, Burgio and colleagues251 provided the opportunity to patients in their trial of biofeedback-assisted th erapy versus oxybutynin143 whose treatment was not completely successful from the patient perspective to recei ve combined pharmacologic and behavioral management. Of the 35 individuals who met criteria and agreed to move onto combined treatment, eight crossed from behavioral alone to combination, and 27 went from pharmacologic alone to combined. Both groups experienced significant reductions in incontinence over the effect of the initial treatment. The behavioral to combined group went from 58 percent reduction at the end of single therapy to 89 percent reduction after combined therapy for an additional eight weeks. The pharmacologic to combined group also improved from 73 percent reduction to 84 percent reduction in in continence episodes. KQ 4. Modifiers of Treatment Outcomes This section includes information related to how individual characte ristics may influence likelihood of responding to treatment and outcomes of treatment. We included publications that explicitly presented stratification by a baseline characteristic that can be determined in a clinical setting and that presented stat istical analysis related to interpreting the influence of the characteristic on treatment effects as they relate to outcomes. Detailed analyses of personality characteristics or psychometrics that require spec ialized expertise or surv ey instruments unlikely to be used by those providing care fo r women with OAB are not reviewed here. Identified Modifiers Age. Eight publications examined the relations hip of age to response to pharmacologic treatment.83, 102, 156-161 Tolterodine was the focus of four of these studies;156-158, 160 and one compared oxybutynin to tolterodine.83 The largest study of symptom-related outco mes was an open label clinical cohort with 2,250 patients from 462 urology practices in Germany. The mean dose received was 3.8 \u00b1 1.2 mg, with a median of 2 mg. Average age of those treated was 61 \u00b1 14 years with range not provided. Increasing age was associated with being more likely to have incontinence episodes which were not strictly required to be urge incontinence. In multivariable regression models, with age as a continuous variable, each year of increasing age was associated with small absolute reductions in global efficacy (OR for global e fficacy 0.986; 95 percent CI: 0.98, 0.99 per year of age). Global efficacy was defined as eight or fewer voids a day, fewer than two urge episodes, and no incontinence episodes per day. 157 The largest RCT evaluated age effects among 1,0 15 participants and found that tolterodine drug was superior to placebo among patients aged younger than 65 compared to those 65 and older. They reported that treatment effects on in continence episodes per week, voids per day, and subjective reports of expe rience of urgency and the ability to hold urine, were comparable across age groups at 12 weeks. A side-li ght of interest was that place bo effect was more pronounced for 89 reduction of voids per day in the younger group (p <0.045); however change from baseline in the treatment arm was comparable regardless of age.158 The IMPACT trial enrolled 896 individuals with urge incontinence from primary care settings and conducted an open-label evaluati on of tolterodine extended release 4 mg once daily.160, 239 All parameters, including UUI, urgency, frequency, and nocturnal frequency, were improved at 12 weeks for both those younger than 65 and those older. However, decreases in frequency were less pronounced among the older group who experi enced on average a 22.2 percent reduction in daytime frequency (95 percen t CI: -26.7, -15.2) and 2 8.6 percent decrease in nighttime frequency (95 percent CI: -35.7, -20.0); while younger pa rticipants had a 33 percent decrease in daytime frequency (95 percent CI: -36.0,-30.3) and a 50 percent decrease in nighttime frequency (95 per cent CI: -53.8, 40.0). The most co mmon treatment-related adverse events among those younger than 65 were dry mo uth (11.4 percent), cons tipation (2.7 percent), and dry eyes (1.0 percent); among those who were older dry mouth (6.6 percent), constipation (4.4 percent) and headache (2.2 percent) were most common. Retention (<1 percent) occurred only among those older than 75 and none of four individuals with this complication required catheterization. Statistical comparisons for harms by age were not provided.160 A prescription-event monitoring study, c onducted in the United Kingdom to assess population impact of tolterodine (range 1 to 4 mg) entering the pres cription drug market, monitored more than 14,500 patients who filled prescriptions over a minimum of six months.156 Average age was 63 \u00b1 16. Analysis of risks of rare adverse events (fewer than 40 events in the full population) found the upper quartil e of age, those over 74, had gr eater risk of rare events including hallucination, heart palp itations, and tachycardia. Those under 50 had the lowest risk of cardiac events. No note was made of whether more common side effects varied with age. A small comparative study of oxybutynin (10 mg once daily) and tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) (n=315) found an advantage for oxybutynin ex tended release over to lterodine twice daily for decreasing urge incontinence, urgency, and frequency, among those 64 and younger. This effect was not apparent in older age groups in which both were comparably effective.83 Other pharmacologic treatments. A single placebo controlled RCT of trospium (20 mg twice a day) evaluated whether CNS adverse effects, specifically daytime drowsiness, varied with age. Using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, they found fewer than 1.5 percent of those on trospium (and 2.5 percent of those on placebo) experienced a clini cally relevant three or more point increase. Using continuous scores, neither age grouping as <65 and older or <75 and older revealed meaningful differences. Average changes in scores across groups were most often improvements of less than half a point, genera lly less than a quarter point. 161 Darifenacin has been studied among those age 65 and older in a two-year, open -label extension of 716 participants, that documented comparable effectiveness among olde r and younger participan ts with respect to sustained or improved treatment response over tim e as defined by a global response score, and individual measures that included incontinen ce episodes, voiding fre quency, urgency, and OAB- related nocturnal waking.159 All statistical testin g for these outcomes across time points through 24 months had p<0.088 for the comparisons with baseline status.159 A trial that allowed dose adjustment of darifenacin over the course of the study found the mean age of those requiring dose adjustments \"for additional efficacy\" wa s equal to those who did not change dose.102 Though some studies reported reduced e fficacy for specific endpoints among older participants in their study popul ations, none reported complete lack of benefit among older populations. Prior treatment. Seven publications investigated whether prior treatment with antimuscarinics predicte d treatment response.85, 86, 102, 162-165 trials of oxybutynin patch,85, and tolterodine IR,162 participants who had previously been on 90 antimuscarinics had comparable outcomes to those who were treatment na\u00efve. The tolterodine study specifically commented on prior treatment failures, noting improvements in those who had failed prior treatments that were above placebo but not statistically significant; few participants were in this category.162 In two drug-to-drug comparison trials, outcomes, including UUI, total incontinence episodes, and \"perceived improvement of bladder condition,\" were likewise reported to be comparable for treatment na\u00efve and previously treated participants. These stud ies investigated oxybutynin ER (5 mg and 10 mg) and tolterodine ER (2 mg and 4 mg);86 and oxybutynin ER (10 mg) and tolterodine ER (4 mg).164 A nine-month open label study of tolterodine 2 mg twice daily found that 89 percent of individuals previously unable to tolerate oxybutynin, tolerated tolterodine well.163 One study included participants who had not been on medications as well as those switching from oxybutynin immediate re lease to extended release. In a subanalysis of those switching from immediate to extended release, th e total proportions cont inent at 12 weeks is similar to that presented for the whole study popu lation; no statistical te st related to this comparison is provided. Some who had been on IR dosing regimens had worsening of symptoms on comparable total doses of ER.165 This study was small (n=256 spread across 16 centers without placebo comparisons) which hinders in terpretation. In a tria l that allowed dose adjustments, prior treatment was associ ated with higher ra tes of dose increase.102 Baseline severity. Presence, type, and severity of incontinence. Two studies contrasted those with UUI at baseline to participants without UUI. In an open-label study of toltero dine 3,824 participants with nine months of treatment, urge, frequency, nocturia, and OAB scales were similarly improved regardless of UUI baseline status.166 The VOLT study of solifenacin was an open label study of flexible dosing.167 Participants who had UUI at baseli ne and reported it was their most bothersome symptom, reported improvements in urgency, UUI, frequency, and nocturia, from \"moderate to severe\" to \"very minor to some minor.\" With the exception of nocturia, the point estimates for improvement in individual measures we re better in the group with UUI at baseline, although not always statistic ally significantly better. 167 Severity of UUI was not significantly associated with improvement in UUI. Subjects with severe UUI (defined as >20 episodes per week) had 67.6 percent decrease in UUI episodes, compared with 71.4 percent in subjects with less severe UUI. 168 The response of those with UUI (n=552) was compared to those with urge-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (n=171) in a 16-week single blind trial of to lterodine that allowed dose adjustments from 1 mg twice daily to 2 mg twice daily. The author s reported cure rates were comparable: 44 percent of those with UUI achieved \"dryness\" and 39 percent of those with mixed urinary incontinence; 24.0 and 23.5 perc ent respectively had normalized voiding frequency (<8 voids per 24 hours). 169 Other studies included partic ipants with urge-dominant mixed urinary incontinence, or failed to specifica lly address inclusion or exclusion of those with mixed urinary incontinence, and did not report assessing trial data for differential treatment effects. Specific symptoms and outcomes. A single study of transderma l oxybutynin and tolterodine ER 4 mg reported on ability to improve frequency in the lowest quartile of frequency, which was those with <10 voids a day at baseline, and found th at neither drug had a signi ficant effect in that subgroup compared to placebo.88 The IMPACT trial, an open la bel trial of tolterodine ER in primary care practices, documented improvements among all groups of participants whether the most bothersome symptom was daytime frequency, nocturnal frequency, urge urinary incontinence, or urgency. Sta tistical testing was not provided to determine if specific groups were more likely to benefit; the data presented suggests similar improvements in self-reported 91 improvement, symptom bother, coping, health-rela ted quality of life, and AUA symptom index scores across all groups.239 Other authors used severity scales or single questionnaire items to group participants and to conduct sub-analyses by severity. In the German open-label, observational study of tolterodine 2 mg twice daily, patients with greater baseline symptom severity experienced greater magnitude of improvements. This trend was for global efficacy; individual component symptoms varied across groups and were not statistic ally significant. Overall, those with severe baseline symptoms were less likely than others be symptom free at 12 weeks.157 In the ACET study among those whose self-reported symptom scores were graded as moderate to severe, those on tolterodine ER achieved greater magnitude of improvements on a global improvement scale than those on oxybutynin ER; comparison across moderate-to-severe to less affected pa rticipants was not provided. 86 Urodynamic findings. Four publications related baseline urodynamic findings to outcomes of treatment.89, 170, 171, 173 Three of these studies did not identify urodynamic findings that predicted poor response or non-re sponse to treatment. The finding of detrusor overactivity compared to its absence was not associated with outcomes in a case series of 365 women treated with bladder retraining and oxybutynin 2.5 mg tw ice a day. Both women with and without detrusor instability had comparable benefits from treatment, as measured by voids per day and incontinence episodes.171 Likewise in an RCT of duloxeti ne (an SSRI) versus placebo which showed treatment benefits for OAB with and wit hout UUI, the classification of participants as having detrusor overactivity or sensory ur gency based on urodynamic findings was not statistically significant as an effect modi fier or predictor of treatment outcomes.170 The third study to group participants by urodynamic findi ng had group sizes (n = 6, 25, 36, 40) too small to make definitive assessments but suggested in the two larger groups that those with low volume and high pressure profiles had comparable results to those with low volume and low pressure profiles. The last case series, re porting on 111 women with OAB based on symptoms and urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor overactiv ity, found that those women who had involuntary detrusor contractions with provocative maneuvers like coughing, washing hands in cold water, and the sound of running water, were less like ly to respond to treatment, which was not operationally defined by the authors, with tolter odine 4 mg a day than those who did not respond to provocation (p=0.0008). 172 A last study conducted urodynamics among 1,133 wo men of whom 132 met the criteria for detrusor overactivity \"conforming\" to the definiti ons of the ICS; the researchers then compared treatment outcomes among women with and without coital incontinence. Among women with DO treated with tolterodine ER 4 mg daily for 12 weeks, those women with coital incontinence at orgasm were more likely to be non-responde rs to treatment (\"unimproved by self-report\") for their OAB (41.2 percent) than those without coital incontinence (17.0 percent), (p=0.23). 173 Other candidate modifiers. Race and ethnicity. The VOLT study, an open label trial of solifenacin has resulted in two publications addressing race and ethnicity. The au thors report these analyses were motivated by lack of literature that explic itly addresses whether minority groups achieve comparable outcomes to the overall study group; the publications focuse d on Hispanic and black participants in VOLT. They provide detailed symptom and outcome profile s and report that outcomes were similar to the larger cohort. However direct statistical comparison is not provided by race/ethnicity.205, 229 A single three-arm trial of tolterodine ER 4 m g, tolterodine IR 2 mg twice daily, and placebo (n=1,235) reported that women who were above the mean for BMI (> 27kg/m2) were more likely to have UUI at baseline but achieve comparable reductions in number of incontinence episodes, to those with lower BMI after 12 weeks of treatment.140 92 Anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse was the sole pelvic organ prolapse measure that we identified in the lite rature about treatment out comes. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse was defined as descent to at least 1 cm proximal to the hymen (POP-Q measurement stage IIa). Women with such prolapse in this clinical case series of women treated with 4 mg of tolterodine extended release formula once da ily were more likely to show no improvement at 12 weeks (39.2 percent) compared to those without prol apse (14.1 percent) using a three-point scale of no ch ange, improved, and cured (p=0.0002).243 Gender. Authors frequently reported that men, es pecially older men, fared less well in resolution of symptoms of OAB.85, 106, 156, 157, 174 This evidence review was focused on outcomes of treatment among women. However, in order to retain landmark studies we included a number of studies that enrolled men as long as the pr oportion of women in the study was 75 percent or more. This means that treatment effects may be attenuated when men are included. KQ5. Costs of Overactive Bladder Treatment This section presents the results of our literature search and findings about financial costs associated with treatment for overactive bladder. Direct medical costs, indirect medical costs, and lost productivity for indivi duals with OAB are significant issues, in part because these women may be at greater risk for comorbiditie s such as falls and fractures, urinary tract infections, depression, and skin conditions.188, 189 OAB symptoms can interfere substantially with work and other activities,250 affecting productivity. Nonethele ss, the proportion of individuals with OAB who seek medical treatment for OAB ha s been estimated to be extremely low with possibly as few as 4 percent of indivi duals with symptoms seeking treatment.24 Therefore, estimates of costs of care for OAB are likely a reflection of care provided to only a small proportion of a group that may be able to benefit from effective treatment. Although several studies have estimated the co st of illness of urinary incontinence, few studies in the United States have estimated the cost of illness of OAB, and even fewer have focused on treatment costs, as specified for this re view. In particular it is difficult to estimate costs related to OAB because it is a symptom- based syndrome with sign ificant inte r- and intra- individual variation in etiology and in symptoms. To answer the question of costs related to the treatments reviewed in this systematic review, we restricted our analysis to studies that included direct costs of treatment for OAB in the United States. Detailed information on all studies related to financial costs associated with management of OAB can be found in Appendix C. Studies analyzed costs for at least one of the following cost categories: Direct costs. Depending on the bundle of treatmen t for OAB, costs may include PCP services, specialist care, skilled nursing fac ilities, home health care, and/or surgery. Direct costs include diagnostic costs, radiology costs, laborato ry costs, treatment costs, and costs related to the consequences of OAB. Indirect Costs. Indirect medical costs include lost productivity and an informal caregiver's time. Financial Costs Content of the literature. We identified five studies on fi nancial costs related to OAB that met criteria for inclusion.175-179 All studies included assessment of direct medical costs related to OAB, and two included costs due to lost product ivity. One study additionally assessed financial implications for pain and suffering. Two additional studies do not meet criteria for measuring direct costs of treatment, but provide context related to health care utilization. 24, 250 93 The literature base included three analyses of administrative-claims databases: one using Medicare data; one using a large, private health plan affiliated with Ingenix; one using seven plans administered by UnitedHealth Group. These st udies analyzed claims for ICD-9 codes they selected as indicative of OAB ; some ICD-9 codes were uni que to specific studies. One study was a national telephone survey of community-dwelling adults179 that was designed to measure prevalence in the community. A followup survey was sent to a selected set of age and sex-matched cases (with OAB) and c ontrols to estimate treatment use, medication, routine care, OAB related conse quences and work productivity. One focused on community-dwelling adults, on e on persons younger than 65 years of age who filled prescriptions for drug treatment of OAB, one on persons of any age with prescription-drug benefit who filled prescriptions for drug treatment of OAB, and one on persons who had failed tolterodine ER and sought alternative drug therapy. Each of the studies used a different definition of OAB (Table 29). Because Jensen's study 177 represents the Me dicare population in 1994 to 1995 and is therefore likely substantially out of date, we do not summarize the data here. Data are available in the evidence table (Appendix C). Table 29. Study definitions used for cost determination Author Year Population Definition of Costs Definition of OAB (ICD-9 Codes) Hu et al.179 2003 National telephone survey of community- dwelling adults Direct: Routine care Diagnostic costs Treatment costs Consequences of OAB Indirect: Lost productivity Informal caregiver's time Self report in the NOBLE study Hall et al.176 2001 Claims database of seven plans affiliated with UnitedHealth Group Physician office visits Pharmacy claims Laboratory claims Radiology claims Outpatient hospitalizations Inpatient database associated with Ingenix Hospital ER Physician outpatient visits 2003 Medicare-claims database Hospital inpatient care Outpatient care Physician services Laboratory and x-ray services Skilled nursing facility care Home health care services claims Outpatient medical care Laboratory/diagnostic costs Inpatient costs and 788.41, 788.43) 94 Costs of treatment. Only Varadharajan and colleagues provided expenditures on medications for OAB, comparing sets of matched patients who used either tolterodine or oxybutynin in their extended release form, or who used tolterodine ER compared to oxybutynin in its immediate release formulation. They did not provide estimates by gender. Costs of drug ranged from an average low of $56 over 12 m onths for oxybutynin immediate release to a high of $360 for extended release to lterodine. The extended release formulation of oxybutynin had intermediate costs at $317. Tolterodine extende d release was significantly more expensive over the course of treatment than both ox ybutynin ER and oxybutynin IR (p<0.001). These differences in part reflect higher number of pres criptions filled in the extended release groups over the study period compared to the immediate release group (p<0.0001). Nonetheless, total healthcare costs, including those specifically related to OAB, were highest for users of oxybutynin immediate release compared to the extended release formulations (p<0.0001). Three studies examined total medical costs (not just treatment costs) for persons who filled prescriptions for OAB drug treatment (Table 30) . These studies calculated the total healthcare costs for persons with OAB, per person per year by drug (PPPY). No studies did so by surgical or behavioral approach and only Vara dharajan presented data for women only.175 Table 30. Total cost differences in annual medical care among persons filling prescriptions for OAB drug treatment Author Year Groups Cost Outcomes Type of prescription filled Average PPPY Total Costs before treatment ($), Unadjusted, Mean $ cost \u00b1 SDAverage PPPY Total Costs after treatment initiation ($), Unadjusted, Mean $ \u00b1 SD Statistical significance Reference standard Nitz or person per year; *Separate groups matched according to G2 and G4 In their followup survey of indivi duals with OAB, Hu and colleagues179 collected data on a range of health care utilization measures, in cluding pharmacologic and surgical treatment for OAB. They used several sources of cost data, including the Red Book, to assign the annual costs of treatment for OAB in the United States in 2000. Pharmacologic treatment costs for women in 2000 were estimated at approximately $1.2 billion for women overall, with approximately equal 95 costs across age groups. OAB surgical cost s among women in 2000 were estimated at approximately $550 million.179 Overall health care costs, including lost productivity for the nation were $7.4 billion for women (approxi mately $3.1 billion for those under 65). This body of literature is partic ularly challenged by the vary ing methodology for identifying and defining patients with OAB. In part, this vari ability is a reflection of the overall literature on OAB, which also uses varying defi nitions. Most problematic for de finitional purposes is whether and when authors included incontinence in any of its forms. None of the cost papers qualifying for in clusion used data beyond 2002, when the ICS definition of OAB was put into place. 96 Chapter 4. Discussion This chapter summarizes the strength of the ev idence to address our key questions and then presents methodologic considerations and a discu ssion of the findings for each of our five key questions. We conclude with a discussion of the status of research, limitations of the current literature, and our recommendations for future research priorities. Strength of Evidence We have summarized the quality of individual studies in categories of good, fair, or poor (with grading explained in Chapter 2) for each key question or sub-question within the summaries below and the information is in cluded on the evidence table for each study in Appendix C. The strength of the evidence fo r each question or sub-question is a broad assessment of the totality of the literature availabl e to provide evidence on a specific question or sub-question. To reiterate the strength grades, the levels of strength of evidence are as follows: I. Strong: The evidence is from studies of str ong design; results are both clinically important and consistent with minor exceptio ns at most; results are free from serious doubts about generalizability, bi as, or flaws in research design. Studies with negative results have sufficiently large samples to have adequate statistical power. II. Moderate: The evidence is from studies of strong design, but some uncertainty remains because of inconsistencies or concern about generalizability, bias, research design flaws, or adequate sample size. Alte rnatively, the evidence is consistent but derives from studies of weaker design. III. Weak: The evidence is from a limited number of studies of weaker design. Studies with strong design either have not been done or are inconclusive. IV. No evidence: No published literature. As a global assessment of this literature, no tr eatments reach the level of strong evidence. For the majority of interventions, strength hovers between moderate and weak because of crucial study design and reporting flaw s. When there is no evidence we have noted that. Principal Findings and Considerations KQ1: Prevalence and Incidence of OAB Methodologic issues. Data related to prevalence and in cidence of OAB an d urge urinary incontinence is notably coherent given the immense technical challenges to comparability. Response rates vary widely across studies with no clear patterns relating type of questionnaire (phone, mailed, administered) or population to co mpleteness of response. Most research teams documented exhausting conventional options for improving response rates and many presented thoughtful analyses of non-respons e. While estimates, especia lly of self-reported symptom complexes, are very sensitive to the operational defi nitions used, these measures were able to be compared when the authors provided information about details like wording of survey items and the required frequency of an event to meet cr iterion definitions. With some exceptions, such information provided sufficient context to provid e a global and United Stat es picture of OAB and urge incontinence. Appendixes and Evidence Tables for this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/bladder/bladder.pdf 97 Publications that appeared after the ICS consen sus definitions had more similar results, even when they used operational definitions that diffe red from ICS. In general, greater detail was provided in the publications afte r the ICS standardization to support comparisons across studies. We found no evidence that studies supported by pharmaceutical companies returned higher estimates for similar measures, with the exceptio n of a single United States publication reporting on a cluster of consumer survey s done in malls. The estimates from those surveys were high enough to be considered outliers and the operational definitions used to deri ve the estimates were not provided in order to determine how their results compared to others.36 There was no readily apparent relationship between method of administration (e.g., mailed survey, administered, or other methods) and findings which is reassuring. Summary of prevalence and incidence findings. Overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence occur in women of all ages around the world. Th e type of healthcare system appears not to clearly relate to the proportion of women affected at any point in time, suggesting that universal access to care such as in the United Kingdo m and Canada versus more socioeconomically correlated access in the United States, is not the driv er of whether or not women currently report symptoms. Several factor s work in synergy to determine whether a woman with OAB symptoms is counted among prevalent OAB cases: degree of bother of symptoms, which varies widely; individual decision to seek care , which is shown to be a low proportion of those affected (13 percent of nurses in the Nurses Health Study); availability of care; and the degree to which an individual woman is distressed by the symptoms or interprets them as a normal part of aging. Conservatively estimated more than 10 to 15 percent of adult, community-dwelling women in the United States meet criteria for OAB and as many as 5 to 10 percent have urinary incontinence associated with urgency. OAB and continence status are not static; both OAB and urge incontinence can resolve, though the data suggest most women are affected for multiple years at minimum if they develop symptoms. 64, 77 How often resolution is related to treatment, individual behavioral change , or the natural history of the condition is completely undocumented. Evidence to describe the relationsh ip of UUI or OAB with age is varied. The preponderance of the literature suggests that OAB risk is more directly associated with increasing age than urge incontinence. For bot h conditions the relationship may be complex, such that rates of increase in the proporti on of women who are symptomatic are relatively consistent until a threshold age. The most probable threshold ages at which rates plateau are well past the average age of menopause and reported to fall between 60 and 75 years of age. Because of the population-based design of these re ports, often details like recent urinary tract infections or childbirth were not able to be taken into account, though future researchers could incorporate self-report ed status in inclusion a nd exclusion for the studies as some of the strongest publications in this literature did. Likewise, fu ture research on inci dence and regression of symptoms would do well to attempt to account for intercurrent diagnosis and whether or not an individual has received treatment. The epidemiology of OAB and urge incontinence lead us to conclude, as have others, that the conditions are common, occur across the lifespan, a nd that providers of all types - primary care, specialists, and advanced practice nurses and health educators - will be called on to advise patients and provide care. 196 Opportunities for detec tion and treatment in c linical settings should be frequent and attention should be addressed to the degree to wh ich patients find the symptoms distressing including impact of self-image , quality of life, and sexual function. 98 KQ2: Outcomes of Treatments for OAB Pharmacologic treatments. Methodologic consideration for pharmacologic treatment studies. The content of this literature is predominantly of fair to poor quality and st rength of the evidence is at best moderate, and improved only by the consistency with whic h medications for OAB are shown to have modest advantage over placebo. The duration of followup during the masked portion of trials is short, rarely longer than 12 week s. Given the longevity of treatm ent likely to be used by patients this is concerning and limits the generalizability to clinical practi ce. No investigators were able to determine whether or not there is a time pe riod after which individuals can discontinue treatment and still retain some or all of the benefits of treatment reduction. Statistical and methodologic concerns are addressed in detail in th e Future Research Section of this chapter. After review and analysis of 110 studies, of which four were good quality, 75 fair and 31 poor, with 68 RCTs, the strength of the evidence fo r managing OAB with pharmacologic treatment is weak to moderate for short term outcomes and weak for long term outcomes and harms. Findings from pharmacologic treatment studies. All pharmacologic treatments were effective at improving one or more OAB symptoms when compared to placebo. Reductions ranged from 0.9 to 4.6 in urge urinary incontinence episodes per day across all drug treatments and from 0.7 to 4.2 in voids per day. Study by study, extended release formulations achieved better effects than immediate release, although statistical si gnificance varied. No one drug was definitively superior to others by preponderance of evidence, including comparison of newer selective agents to older antimuscarinics. As es timated by meta-analy sis extended release forms (taken once a day) reduce UUI by 1.78 (95 percent CI: 1.61, 1.94) episodes per day, and voids by 2.24 (95 percent CI: 2.03, 2.46) per day. Immedi ate release forms (taken twi ce or more a day) reduce UUI by 1.46 (95 percent CI: 1.28, 1.64), and voids by 2.17 (95 percent CI: 1.81, 2.54). Of note, placebo reduces UUI by 1.08 (95 percent CI: 0.8 6, 1.30), and voids by 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.19, 1.71). Even in the context of small to moderate affect on symptoms, pharmacologic treatments were generally associated with increased quality of life and reductions in measures of impact or distress, compared to baseline and to placebo. Findings reported in this review are consistent with three prior reviews.196, 270, 271 The most recent found: (1) antimuscarinics are efficacious compared to placebo, (2) mean decrease in UUI episodes per day ranged from 0.4 to 1.1, (3) mean decrease in the number of voids per day ranged from 0.5 to 1.3, (4) every treatment, with tw o exceptions, was associat ed with greater risk of adverse events compared to placebo, and (5 ) improvements were seen in quality of life. 271 This review added an additional 28 studies and incorporated evidence from study designs other than randomized clinical trials. Table 31 below provides estimates of treatment effects for pharmacologic treatments represented by more than one trial arm. Some dr ugs and doses of drugs are not reported because the publications with trial arms for that treat ment did not provide sufficient information to estimate variance in meta-analysis models. The mode ls required that we have some estimate of the variance of the effect size such as standard deviation, standard error, or confidence bound, in order to achieve appropriate estimates. 99 Table 31.

Data was not consistently provided across studi es to estimate the proportion of women who became symptom free. Procedural and surgical treatments. Methodologic consideration for proce dural and surgical treatment studies. Studies in this treatment domain are of limited quality and predom inantly case series in specialized treatment settings. Sacral neuromodulati on has not had properly masked randomized clinical trials,193 and botulinum toxin injections are promising but based on a small number of studies that identified urinary retention as a distin ct risk factor that is self-resolving but troublesome.193 Other procedures found no benefits or are no longer used in practice. Given cons ideration of 18 studies, of which 11 were fair quality and seven poor, wi th five RCTs, the strength of the evidence for managing OAB with procedural and surgical trea tment is weak for all aspects of understanding outcomes of care. Findings from procedural and surgical treatment studies. Among the trials of procedures and surgery, one demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of sacral neuromodulation over usual care for the reduction of episodes of urge urinary incontinence pe r day (average reduction of 7.1 compared to 2.1 increase with usual care) among subjects with OAB known to be refractory to medical therapy. 124 Enthusiasm is tempered primarily by reports from multiple case series that harms are not rare with thes e treatment approaches. Data that reflects newer sacral neuromodulation techniques in this refractory population are lacking. Surgical and procedural treatments for OAB are not first line management due to the cost and risks of these types of procedures. Sacral neuromodulation decreases the number of urge incontinence episodes by at leas t 50 percent among patients refracto ry to conservative therapies. Moreover, the number of moderate-heavy incontinence episodes also decreases. These results persist even at five years. Sacral neuromodula tion seems to have less of a benefit for urinary urgency (mixed results found in our review) and frequency (31 to 45 percent decrease), with benefits in frequency tapering off over time (23 percent reduction in da ily voids at 5 years). These benefits come with a relatively high rate of adverse events. Early studies using older 100 technology had more than one advers e event per subject, on average;115, 124 studies employing newer technology report lower rate, with events in 11 to 53 percent of subjects.112, 119 Nearly 40 percent describe pain or an unpl easant stimulation, 7 to 48 percent returned to the operating room (this increased to 67 percent at fi ve years, but includes the need to change the implantable pulse generator battery) and betw een 2 to 6 percent have an infect ion (often requiring hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics or explantation). The overall explantation rate hovers around 10 percent. Our review included only one study on periphera l neuromodulation, using an anal and/or vaginal probe. Benefits in frequency were unlikel y to be clinically significant (decrease from 9 to 8 voids daily) and there was a high dropout rate due to pain and effects on the bowels. Other forms of peripheral neuromodulation such as pos terior tibial stimulati on were not reviewed. Electromagnetic stimulation with a portable unit was not found to be beneficial for OAB. Of the drugs injected or instilled into the bladder, botulinum toxin and oxybutynin had the greatest benefit. One trial demons trated benefit of instillation of oxybutynin compared to sterile water in the reduction of voids per day (average reduction of 6.8 compared to 2.4).126 A trial we identified and the recent review by the Cochrane Collaboration f ound that small trials suggest benefit though researchers continue to evaluate means to decrease the risk of undesired side effects like urinary retention with botulinum toxin. Both botulinum toxin and instilled oxybutynin increase the postvoid residua ls and the long term effects of higher residuals in terms of bladder infection and othe r risks is not known. Although evid ence for these approaches is promising, the strength of the literature is inadequate to recomme nd any of these approaches for broader use in general practice. As of the date of the report, neither treatment is FDA approved for OAB. Resiniferatoxin injection was not beneficial in the study reviewed. Older treatment modalities such as prolonged bladder distention or bladde r transection are no longer commonly used due to the morbidity of these procedures. The review ed studies also lacked rigorous methods for evaluating treatment benefit. Behavioral treatments. Methodologic considerations in behavioral trea tment studies. Most of the literature addressing behavioral interventions (with or w ithout comparison to pharmacologic intervention) was of fair or poor quality. In general, studies of behavioral approaches rarely included a true and comparable placebo arm. Although it is well rec ognized that there are inherent challenges to developing placebos for behavior al techniques, a reasonably st rong evidence base on means of doing so suggests that it is possible. Burgio and colleagues143 worked to mitigate this issue by maintaining similar visit schedul es and through the use of bladder diaries in all groups, which was considered adequate masking for quality gr ading purposes. Particularly in older studies (prior to 2002), the behavioral approach often is not fully described; and inconsistency in the language used to identify different approaches requires the reader to examine the manuscripts very carefully - multiple studies may have called their approach by the same name, but in fact be studying quite different interventions. To mitigate against such confusion, we have atte mpted in this report to always describe the intervention along with the first description of results from a given study. Studies conducted prior to the ICS definition of OAB in 2002 tende d to examine more limited approaches to bladder training, while later studies focused mo re on multicomponent approaches and delivery of the training in different ways. Prior treatment attempts are ra rely documented in this work, which may make it difficult to compare treatment groups across studies. Finally, this body of literature includes very few studies that included simila r combinations of intervention and comparator making it almost impossible to summarize across th em. After review and analysis of 29 studies, of which 14 were fair quality and 15 poor, incl uding 17 RCTs, the strength of the evidence for 101 managing OAB with behavioral approaches trea tment is moderate to weak for short term outcomes and weak for long term outcomes and harms. Findings from behavioral treatment studies. Conclusions about th e effectiveness of behavioral techniques for addressi ng the symptoms of overactive bl adder are based on a total of 29 papers (27 studies) that encomp ass behavioral to behavioral co mparisons as well as studies of combining behavioral approaches with pharmaco logic treatment, and the reverse, combining pharmacologic approaches with behavioral ones. No two studies could be combined to produce summary data. Overall, behavioral approaches can be effective in reducing episodes of incontinence and daily voids. Multicomponent appr oaches are most effective, and they perform relatively equivalent to pharmacologic treatmen t. Generally speaking, re ductions in symptoms were modest, with potential decreases in in continence episodes of up to 1.9 per day, and reductions of up to about four voids per day. Th e addition of caffeine re duction to behavioral modification reduced frequency, but made no diffe rence in reduction of in continence episodes. There is no evidence the behavioral approaches enhance the effectiv eness of pharmacologic therapy to reduce episodes of incontinence; and like pharmacologic ap proaches, there is no evidence for long term effectiveness beyond the period during which the intervention is being provided in the health care setting. Complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Findings from complementary and alternative therapy studies. We identified three studies that used complementary and alternative medicine therapies to treat OAB: a fair quality trial of acupuncture,137 a fair quality tria l of foot reflexology,138 and a poor quality prospective case series of hypnotherapy. There is weak to no evidence for complementary and alternative approaches to managing OAB. Outcomes of treatment. The small trial of acupuncture has intriguing results related to decreased frequency of voiding and reduced symptoms of urgency which are associated with changes in cystometrics related to improved bladder capacity that are logical intermediates of the improvement in symptoms. Women felt they were improved as measured by scales that capture bother and quality of life. Evidence is insufficien t to support definitive choice of acupuncture but offers preliminary information that promises modest improvements similar to those reported in many pharmacologic trials. Reflexology is represented by a small trial with unmasking of participants that could have biased the results. No evidence supports choice of this modality. Likewise, hypnotherapy is not supported by the scant information provided by one cas e series with little detail, patient reported outcomes, or statistical assessment. Given the scope of placebo effects demonstrated in other well-conducted studies of OAB treatment, it is difficu lt to know whether to attribute any effect to hypnotherapy. KQ3: Comparisons of Treatments Methodologic issues in studies that compare treatments. Evidence for direct comparisons of treatments was based on 19 studies: 12 were fair and 7 poor. Of these, 14 were RCTS. Evidence is currently weak to absent for choosing one therapy over another. Pharmacologic. A number of pharmaceutical agents have been studied in direct comparison. Nine of these comparisons explicitly examined outcomes for urge urinary incontinence episodes and voids per day. Fewer report on the symptom of urgency. Five of these studies are comparability studies in which a new drug aimed to establish equivalence to oxybutynin, the first drug FDA approved for OAB. One study tested the hypothesis of whether the ER formulation of tolterodine was superior to the IR formulation and the remaining studies were \"challenges\" of newer drugs to tolterodine, which was the second drug to receive FDA approval. In this context 102 lack of statistical differences between active drugs is somewhat uninformative as trials were often powered for the comparison of the drugs individually to placebo and in many cases statistical testing of the outco mes of drug-to-drug comparison are not provided. Where studies reported being powered to detect differences between drugs, the postulated differences were unlikely and/or the withdrawals from protocol prevented meani ngful effectiveness analysis beyond ITT. In a health services context, ideal comparisons would be of extended durations, since OAB is a chronic conditi on, and would report on all pr imary outcomes of relevance including differences in medication adherence, satisfaction with treatme nt, and quality of life. Procedures. Participants in these studies were ofte n not exclusively those with OAB. Strict application of inclusion criteria for this review would have eliminated virtually all studies of procedures for this reason. Studies of OAB incl uded those with urinary retention and at times neurologic conditions as th e indication. Masking, though ch allenging, was approximated by insertion of leads for sacral neuromodulation without act ivation; however give n that a test period is done to establish efficacy before implantation of the permanent device, individuals may have been aware of their status and assessment of unmasking is not pr ovided. Developing sham procedure methods may be of speci al importance in this area. Behavioral . Variations in the behavioral approaches used and methods for teaching them, as well as differences in the duration and intensity of treatment make comparisons challenging. As a category the methods were generally strong with the continued ch allenge of developing attention control comparison methods and doc umenting testing of the degree to which individuals believed they kne w their treatment status. Findings of direct comparisons of treatments. Pharmacologic. Among 14 pharmacologic RCTs that made ten unique comparisons among pharmacologic agents, the majority did not report statistical tests that showed one drug to be superior to another. The excep tions were from three RCTs. Bo th oxybutynin and tolterodine in extended release form were superior to tolterodine in immediate release forms.83, 140 One trial reported oxybutynin ER superior to tolte rodine ER for reducing voids per day.84 Given heterogeneity of participant populations and stud y designs, this limited number of studies is insufficient for any drug to be cons idered definitively superior. Procedures. For procedures, sacral ne uromodulation was compared to wait list participants on medications. It is important to note that failure of prior medica l management was a criteria for entry into the study; those waiting had worsening of many symptoms. This is in contradistinction to improvements noted in virtually all other comp arison groups and likely reflects bias from the knowledge that they were awaiting what they cons idered more definitive treatment for severe OAB. No conclusions can be reached with this data and future research should address the differences in risk profile of sacr al neuromodulation versus medications.124 Behavioral. Seven studies compared behavioral to pharmacologic treatments. One study in this group reported significant re ductions in incontinence episodes with a multi-component intervention;143 no study found differences in reductions in voids per day. Participants in one study who were queried reported a preference for behavioral treatment over pharmacologic.143 Adding behavioral treatments to pharmacologi c treatments did not improve outcomes for incontinence episodes or voids per day above pharmacologic treatment alone. KQ4: Modifiers of Treatment Outcomes Methodologic issues for study of modifiers. Individual characteristics of participants in OAB studies were highly varied on characteristics that are plausibly related to treatment outcomes such as: age, menopausal status, prio r treatment, prior refr actory symptoms during treatment, prior incontinence or gynecologic surgeries, severity of OAB at baseline, and presence 103 and type of incontinence. Higher quality studies reported on these characteristics and either found them comparable across trial arms or adjust ed for baseline differences in their analyses. However, few studies indicated a priori goals of conducting sub-analyses in order to better understand treatment response. Among publications that did report on predictors of treatment response, the majority were under-powered to de tect differences so the resulting claims of comparability are of limited value from an individual study. We found cross-cutting similarities for several of these characteristics such as age, severity, and prior treatment and have compiled those to present the limited picture that is coming into view. Overall this tr eatment literature is at an early stage of development in which the pr imary objective has been documenting superiority of the treatment to placebo. Population-based coho rts, such as the few provided by national and payor databases and larger clinic al trials designed explicitly to more closely examine treatment response patterns and long-term effectiveness and to lerability will be required to have definitive information that can be used clinically with confidence. Findings about modifiers of treatment outcomes. Advancing age was associated with more severe symptoms at baseline and with potentially observed attenua ted treatment effects. Nonetheless, the majority of studi es that reported on the effect of age in relationship to treatment outcomes found significant improvements in the older groups when active treatment was compared to placebo. No studies reported lack of efficacy among older participants. Older individuals do benefit from treatme nt. Race and ethnicity were not associated with outcomes in two analyses addressing this topic. Presence of UUI, or urge-dominant mixed urin ary incontinence, was not associated with treatment failure. Neither was severity of sympto ms; in some cases those with the most severe symptoms, including more severe UUI, achieved the greatest treatment gains but were less likely to be symptom free. Urodynamic findings do not provide consistent information a bout likelihood of treatment benefit or failure. A single study noted, among women who all had documented detrusor overactivity at enrollment, that those who had detrusor response to provocative maneuvers such as running water and washing hands were more likel y to fail treatment. Fu rther investigation of this finding from a small study would be intri guing as would examining the overall self-reported relationship between cues, urge ncy, UUI and treatment response. Another small study reported that anterior vaginal wall prol apse was a strong predictor of non -response to treatment. It is important to note that while these factors were associated with lowe r likelihood of treatment response, the majority of those treated with these characteristics did see improvement in symptoms. Gender, while not a focus of this report, is important in interpreting findings with caution. Multiple research teams noted outcomes were not as favorable in men as in women. This likely reflects different pathophysiol ogy behind the symptoms. Because some studies in this report included men (up to 25 percent of pa rticipants), results should be viewed in light of this potential bias. KQ5: Costs of OAB Treatment Methodologic considerations about cost studies. Studies that use administrative data are limited in their ability to adjust by clinical comorbiditie s and concomitant conditions, although they benefit from large enough numbers to pr ovide a reasonable global estimate. Conversely studies that survey patients on their own health and health care may obtain more detailed information, but suffer from recall bias on the part of the respondents. None of the studies reports on their funding source; nor do they provide any information on investig ator conflict of interest. 104 Findings about costs of treatment. Total direct health care co sts for women with OAB in 2000 were estimated at $6.9 billion, of which $1.1 billion was for pharmacologic treatment and $550 million for surgical treatment. The rest was estimated for \"consequences\" costs, which would include things like falls, longer hospital LOS and skin conditions. Medication costs for OAB with the two most commonly used drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine) range from $56 to $360 over a twelve month period fo r newly diagnosed patients. However, overall health care costs were highest for patients who take oxybutyni n, relative to tolterodine in any formulation, with costs lowest for patients on tolterodine ER. No study ad equately determines why the observed differences exist, in particular whether they are actually a reflection of the differences in the populations who are prescribed the vari ous medications. The one study that measures baseline costs found that patients whose incident OAB prescription was fo r tolterodine ER had lower costs in the six months prior to prescripti on than did patients w hose incident prescription was either oxybutynin ER or oxybutynin IR. None of the studies conducted a cost effectiveness analysis, although cost-utility analyses have been conducted in Europe (whi ch would be difficult given the low effectiveness of any of the drugs , and short followup of almost all efficacy studies). Nor does any study specifically assess th e effect of medication on peripheral outcomes of OAB such as falls. In studies of adherence and persistence, most of which are conducted in managed care populations, fewer than half of patients ever refill their pres criptions for OAB medications. Average quit time is about a month; among those who persist, adherence is best among patients taking extended release versus im mediate release formulations. Even in this group, adherence is low; the highest medication possession ratio noted in the studies we identified was about 36 percent. 272-275 Future Research State of the Literature The study of OAB as a syndrome is entering its second decade. As is typical of advancing areas of research, publications based on case se ries are giving way to observational cohorts. Trials, beyond those required for FDA approval of indication for OAB, are appearing in the literature and health services researchers are inves tigating population-level f actors such as cost of care and risk of rare but serious side effects of treatments. The 2002 ICS standardization of terminology180 was associated with a productive trend toward greater attention to and clarity of operational definitions in research. Documentation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline characte ristics, and change in symptom profiles have become more detailed and nuanced in the last five to seven years. Improved clarity about research definitions for conducti ng the study and analyzing data wa s the case even when authors departed from ICS definitions. Simultaneously im portant research gains have been made in crafting, refining, and validating questionnaire and interview instruments for classifying symptoms, assessing severity of symptoms, desc ribing impact of OAB on quality of life, and measuring satisfaction with outcomes. Concerning deficits. As a body of literature, a number of concerning deficits were common. Fewer than seven percent of included studies me t criteria for good quali ty. For example, for clinical trials, this meant that publications lacked one or more of the following: Any description of randomization method Masking of participants and assessors to treatment assignment Description of participant a nd selection process sufficient to understand generalizability 105 Details of intervention provided to subjects sufficient to replicate Followup of treatment effects for 12 weeks or longer Loss to followup less than 10 percent Drop out less than 10 percent Power calculations (prefera bly for two-sided tests) Use of appropriate statistical comparisons and tests Clear description of methods used to measure outcomes Description of validity or reliability of outcome measures for primary outcomes Each of these criteria is fundamental to the condu ct and reporting of research of sufficient quality to build knowledge and inform care. The treatmen t literature is curren tly hindered by critical flaws that must be eliminated. These include use of data from only those who completed the whole treatment course and not intention-to-treat analyses. Likewise authors frequently noted covariates that were associated with either baseline severity or outcomes and did not adjust for these factors in analysis or conduct stratified an alyses. This was often the case because the size of the study would not support modeling or su b-analyses. Conclusions often over-reached findings in ways that in some instances were blatantly biased in favor of a newer treatment. The large magnitude of placebo effect in OAB studies deserves special note. The fact of robust placebo response implies that uncontrolled studies will be notab ly biased. Indeed in this literature observational studies, with rare exceptions, overestimat ed treatment benefits when compared to trials. High quality trials and innovations in masking treatment group (especially for procedural and behavioral studies) will be essential to firmly establishing treatment effects. Conflict of Interest. Trends in increasing transparen cy about sources of funding and potential conflicts of interest have been steadily positive over the past two decades (Table 32). However, a fundamental mismatch exists between the initial research needed to obtain regulatory approval and broader, longer term research needs to assess a wider range of questions about outcomes of care in typical pr actice settings. For a condition as common as OAB, the funding and conflict of interest picture th at emerges suggests a research area that is urgently in need of additional sources of independent funding for the ne xt wave of clinical effectiveness research. 106 Table 32.

Future Research Directions Momentum in the direction of higher quality a nd more informative research will follow from attention to: Reporting greater information about key characte ristics of populations studied in order to allow assessment of comparability of st udy populations and appli cability of findings. This also facilitates understanding of candi date confounders and variations in findings across studies and study types. Conducting studies of sufficien t size to conduct hypothesis testing or assess treatment effects. Small studies preclude meaningful descriptive analysis of modifiers and appropriate adjustment of c onfounders. Inclusion of sma ll numbers of men in much larger studies was a recurrent example of a modifier of treatment outcomes that was noted or ignored without sufficient study size to meaningfully interpret. Continuing the expansion of standardized nom enclature and use of validated measures. The current literature is challenging to s ynthesize and interpret because outcomes measured are varied, not cross-cutting, a nd measured on different time scales (e.g., episodes per day, per week or per other unit of time). Use of validated measures is improving but measures are perhaps too numerous to help bring results into focus. 107 108 Networks of researchers or those worki ng in common areas would benefit from a rigorous, evidence-based consensus process to prioritize tools to us e across studies to improve comparability of measures of outco mes like severity and quality of life. Content priorities . Well-conducted larger studies with study populations that reflect the severity of conditions seen in bot h primary care and specialty practi ce settings are critical. It is imperative that the time window of followup be extended. The litera ture suggests that treatment effects can be achieved in the early weeks of treatment with pharmacologic, procedural, behavioral, and complementary and alternative ther apies. However this does not mean that the duration of study should be truncated. To the degr ee that long-term efficacy and effectiveness is poorly documented, the resolution or worsening of side effects is poo rly characterized, and satisfaction and continuation of treatment is not assessed over extended periods of time, the literature is not relevant for inform ing care for this chronic condition. Each area that was a focus of this repor t would benefit from continued study of: Etiology and natural history of disease, risk factors and potential preventive measures Novel treatments Properly powered investigations of dire ct comparisons of existing treatments Longer term investigatio n of benefits and side effects of treatment Continued study of combinations of treatments Further investigation of compleme ntary and alternative treatments Investigation of predicto rs of both good and poor tr eatment responses across treatment modalities. Selection of treatment options after prior treatment failure Conclusions We find a concerning lack of high-quality evid ence to inform clinical decision-making for millions of women in the United States. Both me dical and behavioral interventions can provide symptom relief which is often not complete , but valued by women who struggle with OAB. Well-conducted trials of greater duration and sophistication, sepa rate from drug development and marketing efforts, are crucial. Because benefits of current treatments are modest, because drug side effects can be bothersome, opportunities exist to study how to gain synergy from combinations of types of treatments. We must note that lack of evidence of benefit is not equivalent to evidence of no benefit. A number of treatments that are potentially promising warrant continued investigation. Cr oss-cutting concerns about the quality of research must be addressed to achieve literature that can be m eaningfully synthesized. Current literature does not permit definitive conclusions about relative benef it, harm, or costs to achieve similar results. Given how common and con cerning OAB is, a priority on promoti ng high-quality research in the United States is imperative. Women and their care providers deserve better information to guide their choices. References and Included Studies 1. U. S. Census Bureau. Ta ble 2.

Design: Prospective case series Intervention: SNM testing and IPG implantation Groups: A portion of this series is composed of patients with urge incontinence (not further defined). N at enrollment: 209 evaluated: 181 female, 28 male. N at follow-up: 209: all evaluated were considered for adverse events of SNM testing 102 successful tests 91 had implantation of implantable pulse generator (IPG). 71 of these had urge incontinence. Age, median: 58 yrs Race/ethnicity: NR Follow-up, mean: urge incontinence, nonobstructive chronic urinary retrention and chronic pain syndrome Refractory to conventional therapies Underwent urologic evaluation with medical history, physical exam, bladder and/or pain diary, urine analysis, urine culture and urodynamic studies before SNM. Exclusion Leakages per 24 hrs, median: 5 Pads used per 24 hrs, median: 4 Voids per 24 hrs, median: 10 Of 91 who underwent IPG implantation (11 of the 102 with successful testing refused implantation): 71 urge incontinence; 13 nonobstructive chronic urinary retention and 7 chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Median follow-up was 24 months . Primary outcome: subjective symptom improvement, changes in bladder/pain diary variables. SNM was considered successful in 64 of 91 implanted patients, including 50 with urge incontinence. This group at last follow- up had a median of 0 leakages per 24 hours, 1 pad use per 24 hours, 6 voids per 24 hours, and 80% subjective symptom improvement. Secondary outcome: Incidence and treatment of adverse events due to SNM: Adverse events were reported in 12 of 209 patients who were initially tested, including lead migration in 9, wound infection in 2, and refractory pain at tined lead site in 1.
