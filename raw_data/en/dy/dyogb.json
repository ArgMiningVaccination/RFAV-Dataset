Conversely, the upper back, offering essential support to your ribs, vertebrae, crucial organs, and sternum, can also experience discomfort. Although upper back pain may not be as prevalent as lower back pain, it can significantly hamper your wellbeing due to poor posture or muscle and joint irritation. In your lower back, the sciatic nerve extends down the back of your leg. Irritation of this nerve can lead to a painful condition known as sciatica. This can cause nerve discomfort that spans from your lower back to your leg, and you may also experience other symptoms such as weakness, and numbness or a tingling sensation in the leg or foot. For such conditions, immediate sciatica treatment is strongly recommended. Managing upper and lower back pain relief, including sciatica pain relief, often involves regular chiropractic adjustments. These are safe and non-invasive alternatives beneficial for such conditions. With our back pain treatment in Chagrin Falls, you are assured of high-quality care.
