The scene may be drawn from the Old or New Testaments, the details of the life of Christ, the terrors of hell, or a more present situation. . . . . After imagining a scene, or seeing the subject of meditation before one in the fields, the meditator draws arguments from it regarding eternal truths or his own relation to God. The last step is a colloquy with God or with the creature, theoretically involving the will, in which the meditator determines to have more faith, to cease from sin, to abide by God's law, or comes to some moral discernment\" (\"Anne Bradstreet\" 50). |Method||In his | First stage: The subject matter--the doctrine or incident--was called up by memory. The meditator and tried to get vivid, detailed apprehension of it using only memory and imagination. Second stage: The image or proposition supplied by memory is analyzed and comprehended by reason until the work of understanding was complete. Third stage: The subject then was submitted to the will and affections, which were moved to great joy or sorrow. According to Donald E. Stanford, \"Once understood, the affections of the will (the emotions) are aroused in this order: love, desire, hope, courage, and joy\" (\"Edward Taylor\" 70). Baxter's ideas: a. positive approach to sensible world b.recognition that though the senses were potentially dangerous they had their part in worship c. rational use of sensuous imagery drawn from creatures to describe the invisible things of God d. complex but consistent statement of the uses and limits of language in meditation. A sense impression would be carried to 1. Common Sense, which identified it; 2. Imagination, which gave it imagery; 3. Memory, which stored it; 4. Understanding, which judged it; 5. Will (in heart), which embraced or rejected it. 6. The Will directed the Affections accordingly. Because of Adam's misuse of his faculties, God had withdrawn his blessing from this process, causing a paralysis of the faculties and a disruption of the flow of information; thus man could no longer automatically understand God's will. Both meditation and the conversion process were attempts to \"rewire\" or \"reconnect\" this arc. "}
