Recognizing CAD Finally getting a chance to sit down after another long work day, the electrical contractor, sinks into his easy chair. \"This business is killing me,\" he says to his wife as she rocks their newborn baby. \"My accounts payable can't collect.\" He rubs his left shoulder and complains \"My neck and back are so sore. \" Assuming the pain is muscular from working on the construction site, he ignores it for da ys. The next week is similar but a new pain extends to the front of his chest. \"Kyle, you keep rubbing your shoulder. You should get that checked out,\" says his wife.After a week of chest and back discomfort unrelieved by Tylenol, 43-year-old, 6 foot, 260 pound Kyle Hansen goes to a walk-in clinic, where his blood pressure measures 210/98 and his chief complaint is persistent chest and left-shoulder discomfort for 1 week. The workup in the clinic is for acute chest pain but there's much more needed for Mr. Hansen. As the healthcare professional, what would you do first? Is this a medical emergency? What diagnostic tests should be completed? How could this be a heart problem when he' s so young? What were the patient's risk factors? How common is this? This scenario is all too common for coronary artery disease. The heart supplies the whole body with life-giving oxygen, but how does the heart receive that oxygen? The blood supply to the heart muscles comes via the coronary arteries located on the outer surface (epicardium) of the heart. Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients, and blockage of the coronary arteries can lead to serious and even critical heart problems. Atherosclerosis, the Underlying Problem When atherosclerosis, a disease that narrows the arteries, begins to limit blood flow through the coronary arteries, the condition is called coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary heart disease (CHD) or atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD) . The result of limiting the heart's blood supply is ischemia , and CAD is sometimes called ischemic heart disease (IHD). Technically, ischemic heart disease is a broader category than coronary artery disease because there are a variety of ways that the blood supply to the heart can be limited, but atherosclerosis is by far the most common cause of ischemic heart disease (Antman et al., 2008). The term arteriosclerosis , is often mistakenly used for atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is the stiffening or hardening of the arterial walls and atherosclerosis is the narrowing of the arterial lumen due to plaque buildup. Atherosclerosis, then, is a specific kind of arteriosclerosis (Nordvist, 2015).Video (3:01) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ14XjOQoFY Atherosclerosis leads to the buildup of fatt y deposits called plaque in the w alls of large arteries. All the major arteries are susceptible to atherosclerosis, including the aorta, coronary , carotid, v ertebr al, iliac, and femor al arteries. When atherosclerosis blocks arteries in the limbs, the condition is called peripheral artery disease (PAD) ; when it blocks the centr al arteries, the condition is called cardiovascular disease . Atherosclerotic symptoms that appear from blockages in an y artery w arn the lik elihood of atherosclerosis in other arteries; therefore, the appear ance of peripher al artery disease makes the presence of CAD more lik ely, even in patients without symptoms of CAD . A person with CAD has a 1 in 3 chance of ha ving block ed leg arteries (Mitchell & Schoen, 2009). Once they are present, atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries gr adually thick en. The bulging plaques narrow the arterial lumens and reduce the amount of blood that is delivered to the heart muscles. In addition, clots form on the surface of some of the plaques. Occasionally , the clots, along with pieces of plaque, are dislodged and tr avel downstream, obstructing smaller arteries, which can cause an embolism (an obstruction in a blood v essel). Overview of Cor onar y Artery Disease Overview of Cor onar y Artery DiseaseWhether b y the gr adual thick ening of plaque or the sudden formation of a thromboembolus (obstruction of a blood v essel b y an embolus), atherosclerosis reduces the perfusion of the heart. Heart muscle that does not get sufficient o xygen and nutrients becomes ischemic , and ischemic heart muscle contr acts weakly or irregularly . Ischemic heart muscle can also stop contr acting, and if depriv ed of o xygen and nutrients for an extended time, heart muscle will die, causing a heart attack or ev en sudden cardiac death. The iron y is that sudden cardiac death isn' t sudden, as it has been dev eloping for y ears. Heart Ischemia, the Cause of Angina Ischemic heart disease causes more deaths and disabilit y and incurs greater economic costs than an y other illness in the dev eloped world and is lik ely to become the most common cause of death worldwide b y 2020 (Antman et al. , 2008). If the heart becomes ischemic, an uncomfortable feeling called angina pectoris is likely. Angina pectoris (or, simply , angina) is a deep chest discomfort that is usually described as squeezing, hea viness, aching, or pressure underneath the sternum. This discomfort can sometimes also be felt along the shoulder , arm, neck, ja w, or upper back. The name angina pectoris was coined in 1768 in one of the first written descriptions of the symptoms of CAD . This description w as in a medical paper discussing \"a disorder of the breast [chest] mark ed with strong and peculiar symptoms, consider able for the kind of danger belonging to it, and not extremely r are. The seat of it, and sense of str angling and anxiet y with which it is attended, ma y mak e it not improperly be called angina pectoris\" [Latin, anguish and choking of the chest] (Silv erman & W ooley, 2008). That this condition was specifically a disease of the heart, howev er, was not agreed upon until the late 1800s, over a century later . Typical angina is a chronic condition; it occurs with ex ercise and it is reliev ed by rest. A t first, ph ysicians did not connect angina with clogged coronary arteries because it w as thought that blockages of a coronary artery were alw ays fatal. The assumption of lethalit y came from the observ ation that autopsies of patients who died of heart attacks frequently found that the patient had block ed coronary arteries, and in the nineteenth century the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery w as ev en called \"the artery of sudden death\" (Silverman & W ooley, 2008).By 1920, howev er, it had become clear that obstructions of the coronary arteries could produce a r ange of effects, not all of which were fatal, and b y 1930 \"nonfatal m yocardial infarction, \" or heart attack, w as becoming a common diagnosis. T oday, angina is recogniz ed as a symptom of CAD that can cause ischemic heart problems along a spectrum from reduced coronary blood flow to total coronary artery blockage and from a tempor ary self-limiting chest ache to sudden cardiac death. Major Forms of CAD If a coronary artery has gr adually become narrowed, it can usually still deliv er sufficient blood to the heart to support normal pumping when the person is at rest. When the heart beats more r apidly and forcefully , such as during stress or ex ercise, it requires more oxygen. A time will come when the heart needs more o xygen than a narrowed artery can deliver, and at this point the heart muscle becomes ischemic and cardiac tissue ma y die. Stable An gina An individual who has narrowed coronary arteries ma y be asymptomatic at rest but with exercise can experience angina, or chest pain. When the person stops ex ercising and returns to a resting state, the angina will subside after a few minutes. This condition of predictable, ex ercise-dependent angina that is reliev ed by rest is the form of CAD called stable angina. Acute Coronary Syndromes More serious forms of CAD are called acute coronary syndromes . Acute coronary syndromes occur when a coronary artery suddenly becomes obstructed b y clots or pieces of atherosclerotic plaque, causing the heart muscle to receiv e insufficient o xygen ev en at rest. Acute coronary syndromes occur unpredictably: the person might be ex ercising, but could also be relaxing, w atching TV , or ev en sleeping. Angina from an acute coronary syndrome tends to feel more sev ere than stable angina, and it usually does not ease with a few minutes of rest or ev en with sublingual nitrogly cerin tablets. Acute coronary syndromes cause ischemia to threaten the viabilit y and function of heart muscle. When the obstruction causes an acute coronary syndrome but lasts for only a brief time and no significant heart necrosis occurs, it is called an episode of unstable angina. In other cases, the ischemia is substantial and persistent, causing heart muscle death, and the acute coronary syndrome is called a myocardial infarction (MI).Myocardial infarction is one of a number of serious consequences of CAD , which also causes heart failure, arrh ythmias, and sudden cardiac death. In the United States, CAD is the leading cause of death for both men and women (CDC, 2016a). F ortunately , early treatment can significantly reduce the lik elihood that a patient will dev elop life-threatening complications. Overview of Treatment for CAD Lifest yle changes are the first -line treatment for CAD . People with coronary atherosclerosis should stop smoking, eat reduced-calorie, low -fat/high-fiber diets, and ex ercise regularly . Diabetes, h ypertension, high lev els of blood cholesterol, and ex cess body fat are all CAD risk factors and, if present, should be aggressiv ely controlled. This plan is used both to prevent and to treat CAD . Medications are usually part of the management of CAD . Medications are also giv en to reduce the heart 's workload and prev ent blood clots. Beta-block ers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-con verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin ma y be used. When a patient 's coronary arteries ha ve already become significantly narrowed or obstructed, treatment ma y extend bey ond medicines and require surgical reopening of the artery (angioplast y) or b ypassing the blockage with NHLBI, 2016a). In our earlier scenario , Mr. Hansen w as diagnosed with CAD and angina. What symptoms did he present with, and what were his risk factors? His symptoms of h ypertension and chest pain are classic for CAD and angina, but because the chest pain w asn't reliev ed by rest it w as unstable. A quick 12-lead ECG demonstr ated a non- cerine, o xygen, and morphine for chest pain. He w as sent b y ambulance to the hospital for a full workup , angiogr am, and treatment. His risk factors included BMI >30, hypertension, high-fat diet, male gender , age >40 and stress. So is Mr . Hansen the r are case? What additional tests and procedures will be done at the hospital? What are the statistics for CAD in men and women lik e Mr. Hansen? Statistics Ab out CAD Coronary artery disease is a significant public health problem. One American dies from CAD every minute, and, of ev ery 5 people who experience an acute coronary syndrome, 2 will die from related heart problems within the y ear. The problem of atherosclerosis begins in youth, and CAD dev elops gr adually o ver the decades; therefore, health professionals in every field face some aspect of CAD and ha ve a role in helping patients prev ent or control the disease and its deadly consequences.Prevalence Prevalence indicates how many people currently have the disease, and approximately 1 of every 13 Americans aged 18 years and older has CAD. It is the leading cause of death for people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States (Mozaffarian, 2015; CDC, 2016a). In the United States, CAD is most common among Hispanic Americans and least common among Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Coronary artery disease develops gradually, and the strongest risk factor for CAD is age, so it is typically a disease of older adults. Although the disease may become clinically apparent by age 40 and the trend is increasing, people 65 years of age and older account for approximately 85% of deaths from CAD (Boudi, 2013). Incidence Incidence tells how many new cases are diagnosed each year, and about 935,000 Americans have a heart attack. Often CAD is not diagnosed until a cardiac event, such as a heart attack, occurs. Of the almost 1 million MIs annually, 610,000 are a first heart attack and 325,000 are a repeat heart attack (CDC, 2016a). Mortality Mortality is the statistic for actual deaths caused by a disease. Heart disease is the number one cause of death for both American men and women, accounting for 1 out of every 4 deaths each year. Decades ago CAD was more common in men, but in the past several decades women have approached the same levels of CAD-related deaths. Every 34 seconds someone has a heart attack and each minute someone dies from a heart disease -related event. CDC reports that 600,000 deaths each year are due to heart disease in the United States (CDC, 2016a). Patterns for age, gender, race and even geographic location have identified those at greater risk to develop CAD. Although the frequency of CAD is similar in both black and white populations, the death rate from CAD is greater for blacks than for whites. In 2009 African Americans were 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic white men (OMH, 2013).Death rates vary throughout the United States. The highest death rates (darkest colors) are in the South and around the regions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia. Source: CDC, n.d. There is one hopeful statistic. Despite the fact that CAD is the leading cause of death in the United States, there has been a 30% reduction in the mortality rate since the latter part of the twentieth century. Factors such as increased awareness and patient education, early identification and treatment, availability of coronary artery bypass surgery and stent placement, thrombolytic therapy, and an emphasis on lifestyle modification are some of the reasons for this reduction (Boudi, 2013). Deaths from CAD often happen to people with no previous heart symptoms. Although some people may feel a rapid heartbeat or dizziness that alerts to a dangerous heart rhythm, over half of the people who have sudden cardiac deaths were previously asymptomatic (WebMD, 2012). Morbidity Morbidity is the term for the cost and consequences of a disease. Illness from CAD str ains the American health system. Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke, costs the United States $312.6 billion each year. This total includes the cost of healthcare services, medications, and lost productivity. Cardiovascular diseases are also a leading cause of disability, preventing affected persons from working and enjoying family activities (CDC, 2016a).Although Mr. Hansen is younger than the expected age, due to his risk factors of obesity, stress, and high-fat diet, his CAD was manifested in chest pain. Because CAD silently progresses, restricting the lumen of arteries, people often are not a ware it is developing until they notice symptoms. A common response, however, is denial, as people think the chest discomfort, heaviness, neck and back ache are related to stress, poor sleep, and just life.

Typically, we think of those older than 60 years of age. We are more likely to identify the symptoms of an MI in an older adult, but what about the variations in symptoms for those in their forties, such as Mr. Hansen, or people with diabetes and cardiac neuropathy? Be aware that CAD is developing in a younger population and that diabetic neuropathy blocks the usual symptom of chest pain that we rely on. Anatomy of the Coronary Arteries The coronary arteries are also called the epicardial arteries because they run along the outer surface of the heart on the epicardium; the main ones are the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery.

Source: NHLBI, 2016b. Normally , there is little o verlap between the areas to which the coronary arteries and their branches pro vide blood. A secondary circulation does exist, but it is made of small arteries. With enough time, these collater al arteries can widen and offer some circulation to the heart muscle with a partly block ed coronary artery . Howev er, a sudden blockage in a coronary artery will cut off most of the o xygen and nutrients to the corresponding region of heart muscle with no time for secondary circulation to compensate. Mr. Hansen receiv ed an emergency angiogr am in the hospital to which he w as transferred. It showed a 99% blockage in the LAD (left anterior descending coronary artery), also known as the \"widow mak er.\" His wife w as very gr ateful they were able to identif y the blockage before she became a y oung widow!

When atherosclerotic processes tak e hold in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, the condition becomes coronary artery disease (CAD). Atherosclerosis is a degener ative disorder that injures the inner w alls of large arteries. In atherosclerosis, thick abnormal patches called plaques accumulate at scattered locations along the artery' s innermost endothelial la yer. The plaques are disorganiz ed masses filled with cholesterol, lipids, and other cells, all co vered b y a white fibrous coating (Mitchell & Schoen, 2009).

Are called the left anterior descending and the right posterior descending coronary artery .D.Atherosclerotic plaques narrow an artery and hinder blood flow . The result is that the surface of a bulging plaque sometimes tears, exposing material that stimulates clot formation. Clots and ruptured plaque material can then break a way from the w all, be carried b y the blood, and clog arteries downstream. Atherosclerosis damages tissues throughout the body: Blockages in the carotid arteries can reduce or block blood flow to the br ain, causing a stroke . Obstructions in the peripher al arteries in the legs can cause claudication (pain when walking), gangrene, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Resultant DVT s can tr avel to the causing a pulmonary embolism and respir atory arrest. Atherosclerotic obstructions in the intestines cause ischemic bowel . In the coronary arteries, atherosclerotic obstructions cause heart attack (NHLBI, 2016c). Causes of Atherosclerosis Causes of atherosclerosis include fatt y streaks, foam cells, atherosclerotic risk factors, and plaque destabiliz ers. Fatty Streaks Beginning in childhood, a cascade of ev ents slowly and quietly leads to the dev elopment of atherosclerosis. Children dev elop fatt y streaks along the w alls of their large arteries largely from diets high in fat. These streaks are sites where lipoprotein particles are protected from direct contact with the blood. The lipoproteins become o xidized into destructiv e molecules and the resulting o xidants injure nearb y cells. Foam Cells: Overwhelmed Macrophages In the arterial w alls, leuk ocytes (white blood cells) are attr acted to the areas of cell injury , and the incoming leuk ocytes initiate a local inflammatory reaction. Some of the attr acted leukocytes are macrophages. Macrophages are clean-up cells, and they begin to engulf the local lipids. When macrophages are o verwhelmed b y the lipids in their vicinit y, they become bloated with fatt y debris. The accumulation of fat -filled macrophages, which are called foam cells, is a char acteristic of atherosclerotic plaque.In a person with a health y balance of blood fats such as low blood lev els of LDL cholesterol and high blood lev els of HDL cholesterol, there is only a modest accumulation of lipids in arterial w alls. The a vailable macrophages can sw allow and cart off sufficient lipids from the fatty streaks to a void a lipid buildup , and few foam cells accumulate. When this and the other lipid-remo val mechanisms are working smoothly , the amount of sequestered lipid can be controlled and atherosclerosis is minimal. Unfortunately the American diet is high in fat and gener ally o verwhelms the macrophages' abilit y to clean up damaged arteries. A total lipid profile for Mr . Hansen rev ealed total cholesterol >200 mg/dL and low HDLs <25 mg/dL. A therosclerotic plaques had built up o ver time and left only a 1% space for blood flow at the junction of the LAD .

Atherosclerotic risk factors include smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesit y, physical inactivit y, diet high in satur ated fats, stress, and the accumulated wear of old age. When these conditions interfere with lipid remo val, atherosclerosis can slowly clog arteries (Libb y, 2008).

Foam cells die before they can remove lipids, and a core of necrotic cells forms inside the expanding yellow streak. The body attempts to repair the damage through collage, which enter the mass and begins to create a meshwork with other extracellular matrix materials. By this point, the yellow streak has become an atherosclerotic plaque. Normal and Atherosclerotic Arteries (A) N ormal artery with normal blood flow; (B) artery with plaque buildup and diminished blood flow. Source: NHLBI, 2016b. Plaque Destabilizers Gradually, atherosclerotic plaques thicken. Internally, the plaques are disorganized and weak. As part of the local repair efforts, a network of small blood v essels grows into the enlarging plaque. The new vessels tend to be leaky due to the inflammatory process, which dilates blood vessels to more easily allow passage of white blood cells, macrophages, and signaling chemicals. The result is that hematomas and clots form inside the plaque. Some regions in the plaque end up with little oxygen and few nutrients. In these poorly oxygenated areas, the local cells\u2014mainly leukocytes and smooth muscle cells\u2014die and create additional necrotic pockets. As in many tissues with chronic inflammation, calcium salts are slowly deposited, making parts of the plaque brittle, causing arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.Along with hematomas, these necrotic pockets make the entire plaque susceptible to erosion, crumbling, and rupture. Tears in the fibrous coat of a plaque allow the extracellular matrix inside to come in contact with blood. This stimulates blood-clotting mechanisms and clots form along the edges of the eroded plaque. Many people go through their entire lives unaware that they have atherosclerosis; however, even asymptomatic atherosclerosis is a constant threat because plaques continue to enlarge. One consequence of this continued growth is that the pressure of an enlarging plaque weakens the muscular layer of the arterial wall and makes the region susceptible to ballooning into an aneurysm (rupture of the wall). Another consequence is that atherosclerotic plaques become less stable. A t some point, the pressure of local blood flow can push the clots and plaque debris downstream to become artery-clogging emboli. The obstructed arteries leave their surrounding tissues ischemic, and the ischemic tissue eventually dies (Libby, 2008). Answer: DTest Your Learning As they age and thicken, some atherosclerotic plaques accumulate deposits of: Atherosclerotic Plaque Atherosclerotic plaques are white or yellowish bulges filled with cells, cholesterol, and cellular debris. When the surface of a plaque becomes abraded or torn, clots form, and these areas appear red-brown. Individual atherosclerotic plaques are 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter, but adjacent plaques can merge into larger lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques develop in patches, and they are more likely to develop in places where epithelial cells have been injured. Regions of blood turbulence, such as arterial branch points, have chronically injured epithelial cells, and, in atherosclerosis, plaque tends to develop near branch points inside large arteries. Certain arteries are more likely to have atherosclerotic plaques than others. Here, in order, are the arteries most likely to have significant atherosclerosis:Copper.A. Potassium.B. Sodium.C. Calcium.D.Abdominal aorta Coronary arteries Popliteal arteries (behind the knees) Internal carotid arteries Arteries in the circle of Willis, which supply blood to the cerebr al hemispheres of the brain (Mitchell & Schoen, 2009) Atherosclerosis of the Coronary Arteries The two main areas most commonly thickened by atherosclerosis are the lower abdominal aorta and the coronary arteries. Within the coronary arteries, the br anch points, shaped like forks in the road, tend to accumulate the thickest buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque forms as a mass inside the arterial wall. Initially, this mass causes a bulge on the outside of a coronary artery, increasing the artery's overall diameter. Later, as the disease progresses, the plaque begins to bulge into the lumen (inner passagew ay) of the artery, and at this stage, the plaque reduces the effective inner diameter of the artery and the stenosis can be detected by angiography. Atherosclerotic Artery with Narrowed Lumen Micrograph of the distal right coronary artery with complex atherosclerosis and luminal narrowing. Source: Wikimedia Commons.Coronary arteries that ha ve lost 50% to 75% of their inner diameter can no longer deliv er sufficient blood flow to meet the increased needs of heart muscle during ex ercise. That level of stenosis will lead to ischemic symptoms, t ypically angina, when the patient exercises. If atherosclerotic plaque thick ens sufficiently to fill 80% to 90% of the diameter of a coronary artery , ischemic heart symptoms appear ev en when the person is resting (Antman et al. , 2008). Over time, the section of blood v essel that lies bey ond a narrowed segment will dilate, an y small collater al arteries will widen, and new collater als will grow in efforts to deliv er life- giving o xygen. In these w ays, the arteries of the heart can partly compensate for a narrowed coronary artery when the stenosis has dev eloped gr adually . As brilliant as the body is in adapting for surviv al, there is no natur al protection against sudden arterial narrowing, such as the obstruction produced b y clots or debris from a ruptured plaque. Sudden narrowing can lead to ischemia and heart muscle death. This is the most common cause of the death of heart muscle: greater than 95% of all MIs are caused b y blood clots and debris from atherosclerotic plaque. Answers: A, D, CTest Your Learning Atherosclerotic plaques are likely to accumulate: The arteries that supply blood to the heart can partly compensate for a narrowed artery when the stenosis: Heart muscle cells that become ischemic will: Effects of Atherosclerosis on the Heart Normally, when heart muscle works harder, the blood vessels inside the heart\u2014those arteries downstream from the main coronary arteries\u2014dilate to increase blood flow to the muscle cells. However, if atherosclerosis has narrowed the coronary arteries, dilation of the downstream arteries is not enough to prevent ischemia (Antman et al., 2008). The region of heart muscle that becomes ischemic depends on which artery has been blocked. Approximately half of all MIs are caused by blockages of the left anterior descending artery, 30% to 45% are caused by blockages of the right coronary artery, and 15% to 20% are caused by blockages of the left circumflex artery (Burke & Virman, 2008). After a sudden blockage, the heart muscle cells fed by these arteries become ischemic and, unless they are quickly reperfused, ischemic heart muscle cells will die in 20 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the existing collateral circulation.At branch points and forks inside large arteries.A.

Symptoms of CAD Coronary artery disease can become a chronic disease called stable angina . It can also giv e rise to sudden cardiac emergencies called acute coronary syndromes . Acute coronary syndromes r ange from tempor ary episodes of significant ischemia (unstable angina) to permanent heart muscle damage (m yocardial infarction) to sudden cardiac death. Stable An gina In stable angina, coronary arteries are partly occluded. A t rest, dilation of the downstream arteries allows sufficient blood flow to meet the demands of the heart muscle cells. Howev er, during ex ercise, the increased o xygen and nutrients needed b y the heart exceed the capacit y of the already -dilated arteries. Therefore, when the person ex ercises, the heart muscles become ischemic, and t ypically the person feels angina. In most cases, the ischemia of stable angina does not cause significant muscle cell death.Symptoms in stable angina occur when the demands on the heart ex ceed the blood flow through pre-existing stenosis. These symptoms occur predictably , whenev er the patient 's heart acceler ates to a certain lev el of activit y. In stable angina, the ev ent that initiates symptoms is gener ally external such as ex ercise, stress, or cold weather . Internally stressors such as psy chological stress can also create h ypertension and resultant demands on ischemic heart v essels. Acute Coronary Syndromes In acute coronary syndromes , the ev ent that initiates symptoms is an internal change in the atherosclerotic plaque in the patient 's coronary arteries. When a patient suffers an acute coronary syndrome: Plaque has expanded, eroded, or ruptured, or A thrombus has mo ved or brok en loose, or A coronary artery has suddenly tightened in a v asospasm. When arterial obstruction persists, causing sufficient ischemia to kill muscle cells, this is called a myocardial infarction (MI, or heart attack). After an MI, intr acellular proteins leak from the damaged cells and circulate in the bloodstream. An MI can be diagnosed b y finding cardiac -specific intr acellular proteins (cardiac biomark ers) in the blood of a person who has the signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome. Myocardial infarctions can be definitiv ely diagnosed in symptomatic patients from blood tests. When heart muscle cells die, heart -specific intr acellular molecules (cardiac biomark ers such as troponin) leak into the bloodstream. Sudden Cardiac Dea th The abrupt release of atherosclerotic thrombi that causes m yocardial ischemia can also trigger fatal v entricular arrh ythmias. This appears to be the critical ev ent behind most cases of sudden cardiac death, a condition in which patients die unexpectedly and within minutes of the onset of symptoms (Schoen & Mitchell, 2009). This fatal symptom is the end stage of CAD and can only be altered with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Mr. Hansen had dev eloped stable angina o ver years of sedentary lifest yle, high-fat diet, and work stress. Unstable angina had dev eloped quickly as new stress worsened at work and a new bab y was born to the busy family . Even happ y events such as marriage or a baby can result in stress on the body . Answers: C, ATest Your Knowledge The chest discomfort of stable angina is often described as: Cardiac biomark ers are intr acellular heart muscle molecules that: Diagnosis and Evaluation of CAD Chest discomfort is the most telling symptom of CAD . It can tak e the form of angina or manifest as acute angina in an MI. Chest Discomfort Frequently the chief complaint of a person with CAD is chest discomfort. When a patient presents with a nonacute history of chest discomfort, the workup for possible CAD should include blood work for cholesterol, baseline ECG, stress treadmill, statin or aspirin ther apy, and lifest yle modification education. When a patient comes to a medical facilit y with v ery recent or ongoing chest discomfort, a rapid triage and assessment should occur . In the emergency department, clinic, or office, the clinician must quickly distinguish those patients who ha ve potentially life-threatening conditions\u2014MIs, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolus, tension pneumothor ax\u2014from nonlife-threatening causes of chest pain or discomfort (Lee, 2008). Conditions such as heartburn, sw allowing disorders, pancreatic and gallbladder problems, muscle and bone problems, and lung disorders can all cause symptoms similar to those caused b y the heart (Mayo Clinic, 2016). F or more details, see Medical Management of CAD below . Classic AnginaSharp pain.A. Fleeting pain.B. Squeezing or tightness.C. Made worse b y the mo vements of coughing or breathing. D. Are released into the blood when heart muscle cells die.A. Are released into the blood all the time.B. Become dense and visible in CT scans when heart muscle cells first becomes ischemic.C. Become dense and visible in CT scans when heart muscle cells die.D.The classic symptom of CAD is a form of chest discomfort called angina. The following symptoms are some of the w ays that patients describe angina (Schoen & Mitchell, 2009). Quality: Squeezing Pressure The nouns commonly used to describe the feeling of angina include constriction, heaviness, pressure , and tightness . The adjectiv es commonly used include aching, choking, crushing , smothering , and squeezing . Patients t ypically hold a clenched fist o ver their chest when describing the feeling of angina. Location: Substernal Most commonly , patients sa y angina is located substernally , ie, inside the center or lower center of the chest. P atients ma y also locate the feeling in the epigastric region. Some patients describe angina as a deep ache in their teeth, ja w, neck, shoulder , or arm, on either side of the body . Duration: A Few Minutes The angina of stable angina is tempor ary, lasting 2 to 5 minutes and coming in a w ave that worsens, reaching a peak and then subsiding. Unstable angina lasts longer , typically 10 to 20 minutes. The angina of MI has a v ariable dur ation, often lasting longer than 30 minutes. Triggers: Exercise Angina can be triggered b y exercise, sexual activit y, exposure to cold weather , emotional stress (anger , fright, frustr ation), or a large meal. An y physical or emotional stress that causes tach ycardia can induce angina. The angina of acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or an MI) can be precipitated b y exercise, but it can also occur at rest or it can w ake a person from sleep . (Occasionally , the angina of stable angina will also occur at night, especially if the patient has sleep apnea.) Occurrence: Predictable or Unpredictable The angina of stable angina comes predictably when the patient engages in a certain lev el of exercise. The angina of unstable angina arises unpredictably , sometimes at increasing or even decreasing lev els of ex ercise. The angina of an MI happens unpredictably . Reliev Nitroglycerin Tablets The angina of stable angina resolv es in about 5 minutes with rest and sublingual nitrogly cerin tablets. The angina of unstable angina is usually not reliev ed by a brief rest, and if it is lessened b y nitrogly cerin, the pain t ypically recurs. The angina of an MI usually does not respond to rest or to nitrogly cerin.Accompanying Symptoms: Variable The angina of an acute coronary syndrome and angina can be accompanied b y a variety of other symptoms, including shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea, or sweating (Lee, 2008). Descriptors Not Often Used: Sharp and Brief Chest discomfort can be caused by many thoracic disorders so it essential to rule out cardiac issues first as they potentially can be the most lethal. F or example, chest pain can manifest with gastrointestinal nausea and gastric ulcers can present as a burning sensation in the chest. Here are some comments not typically offered by patients when describing classic angina: Sharp Brief Worsened by chest movements of breathing Changes with the patient's position Reproduced by an examiner tapping or pressing on the chest Below the umbilicus or above the jaw Prolonged ache deep to the left breast Anginal Equivalents Angina is the complaint that usually triggers a workup for CAD. However, not all people with CAD get angina. Even during an MI, some people do not experience significant chest discomfort, which is why some people may be surprised to hear their ECG shows that a previous MI had occurred. A few complaints other than chest discomfort can also be caused b y heart ischemia. Clinicians suspect heart ischemia when patients complain of the following. When they are caused b y heart ischemia, these symptoms beha ve like angina and are called anginal equivalents . Among patients with CAD , angina is more often reported b y men than b y women: instead of classic angina, women often report anginal equiv Anginal equiv alents are also more common for CAD in older adults and in people with diabetes. One of the arts of clinical pr actice is distinguishing angina\u2014chest discomfort caused b y heart ischemia\u2014from other t ypes of chest discomfort. Answers: B, ATest Your Learning The symptom equiv alent Chest discomfort called angina.B. Gradually increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, and lower limb edema. C. Sudden inabilit y to get enough air . D. A symptom, such as shortness of breath other than chest pain that is caused by heart ischemia, brought on b y stress, and reliev ed by rest or nitrogly cerin.A. The dose of nitrogly cerin that can reliev e typical angina in a giv en patient. B. Sharp chest pain worsened b y coughing. C. Angina brought on b y emotion not b y exercise. D.A number of medical conditions other than heart ischemia present with acute chest discomfort. These conditions include aortic dissection, aortic stenosis, esophageal reflux, esophageal spasm, gallbladder disorder), spontaneous pneumothor ax, pulmonary embolus, and pulmonary hypertension. Labor atory tests, ECG recordings, and imaging studies ma y be needed to distinguish these health problems definitiv ely from heart ischemia. Howev er, the patient 's description of chest discomfort can point the clinician tow ard or a way from a diagnosis of heart ischemia. A differential diagnosis for chest discomfort can be determined b y evaluating the v ariations of the following char acteristics of pain: Qualit y Aortic dissection is a tear in the inner w all of the aorta. The pain is sev ere and sudden. Pneumonia, pleuritis, and spontaneous pneumothor ax pains are often described as \"sharp .\" Location Aortic dissection pain t ypically r adiates to the back between the shoulder blades. Herpes z oster (shingles) pain follows the pattern of the chest dermatomes. Gallbladder and peptic ulcer disease usually produce abdominal as well as epigastric pain. Pericarditis pain can r adiate to the tr apezius muscles. Duration Aortic dissection and spontaneous pneumothor ax ha ve a sudden onset of pain that does not stop . Gallbladder and peptic ulcer pains can continue for hours. Pericarditis pain lasts for hours and sometimes da ys. Triggers Aortic dissection occurs in a weak ened area of the aorta. Chronic h ypertension, some inherited conditions such as Marfan syndrome, and tr auma to the chest w all are risk factors (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.). Musculosk eletal pains are usually caused b y injury or tr auma.Esophageal reflux pain can be brought on b y alcohol, aspirin, or lying down after meals. Gallbladder and peptic ulcer pains t ypically appear 1 to 2 hours after a meal. Musculosk eletal pain is worsened b y movement and can be reproduced b y local pressure b y the examiner . Pericarditis pain is usually aggr avated b y coughing or b y certain postur al changes. Pneumonia, pleuritis, and spontaneous pneumothor ax pains are worsened b y the chest mo vements of breathing and coughing. Relievers Esophageal reflux and peptic ulcer pains can be reliev ed by antacids. Pericarditis pain is sometimes reliev ed by sitting up . Accompan ying S ymptoms Aortic dissection can cause loss of peripher al pulses. Herpes z oster pain can be accompanied b y a vesicular r ash in the region. Pericarditis pain can be accompanied b y a pericardial friction rub . Pneumonia, spontaneous pneumothor ax, pulmonary embolus, and pulmonary hypertension are t ypically accompanied b y significant dyspnea. Pneumonia usually causes cough and fev er. Pulmonary h ypertension can cause edema and jugular v enous distension. Spontaneous pneumothor ax causes decreased breath sounds and respir atory distress. (Lee, 2008) Medical History Although the pace and the focus of a workup differ for acute and nonacute angina, much of the collected cardio vascular information is the same. In all cases, the history , physical examination, lab work, imaging, and stress tests will look for evidence of coronary atherosclerosis and of heart ischemia. Age of Patient The typical CAD patient is middle- aged or older . Men tend to ha ve their first symptoms when they are older than 50 y ears. W omen tend to ha ve their first symptoms when they are older than 60 y ears. S ymptomatic CAD is much less common in premenopausal women, unless they are smok ers or ha ve metabolic syndrome. Differences in CAD Between Men and Women Source: Douglas et al., 2008. The solid and dashed lines in both of the above graphs represent the percent of people with stable angina who actually have significant CAD. The solid line is for people who have angina but who do not have diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or a history of smoking. The dashed line is for people who have angina and diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking, showing the strong correlation between those conditions and CAD. Family Medical History Coronary artery disease is most likely to be found in people with first-degree relatives who have had ischemic heart problems. Patient's Lifestyle Atherosclerosis is associated with smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and diets that are high in fats and calories. Physical Findings Atherosclerosis is a whole-body disease because it affects the circulatory system throughout the body. People with atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries usually have similar problems in other arteries, so they may have such complaints as intermittent claudication, foot pain, cold feet, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or stroke. Additionally, they may have other health problems that foster atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity. A patient with asymptomatic CAD or with stable angina may have an unremarkable physical examination. Sometimes, however, the patient will have signs of atherosclerosis, such as carotid, femoral, or renal artery bruits, diminished pulses in the legs, ankles, or feet, or visible venous occlusions in the retina. A patient with CAD may also have hypertension and funduscopic signs of hypertensive retinopathy (Antman et al., 2008).The heart examination, too , may be normal. On the other hand, CAD can produce unrecogniz ed (silent) m yocardial infarctions, and the heart examination of a patient with CAD will sometimes unco ver signs of previous ischemic damage. F or example, there can be murmurs (from weak ened papillary muscles), widened split sounds (from damage to the heart 's conduction system), or a diminished first sound (from weak ened v entricular contractions). Long-standing CAD can cause heart failure. A patient with heart failure ma y have an enlarged heart, lower -extremit y edema (swollen legs, ankles, or feet), and distension of the jugular v eins. Heart failure can also lead to cy anosis, pulmonary edema, heart murmurs, or heart gallops. Laboratory Tests: Cardiac Biomarkers There are no labor atory tests specifically CAD . The labor atory workup for CAD , instead, is an assessment of risk factors, using blood tests for diabetes, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation (C -reactiv e protein lev els and homocysteine) (Antman et al. , 2008). When heart muscle cells die, intr acellular proteins leak into the circulation, and some of these proteins can be identified using blood tests. In in vestigating a potential m yocardial infarction, blood is tested for these intr acellular heart molecules\u2014 cardiac biomarkers \u2014 which would be released only b y dying heart muscle cells. The appear ance of cardiac biomark ers in the bloodstream is a reliable sign of heart muscle death (m yocardial necrosis). The tests are repeated 6 to 9 hours later , because the damage caused b y heart ischemia can continue for a number of hours. After an MI, blood lev els of cardiac biomark ers can remain high for 1 to 2 weeks. Currently , cardiac troponin T and cardiac troponin I are considered more sensitiv e indicators than other commonly used biomark ers such as creatinine kinase-MB (CK -MB). Normally , lev els of cardiac troponins are pr actically undetectable; therefore, detectable blood lev els indicate heart muscle damage. Higher lev els of cardiac troponins indicate damage that is more extensiv e. While an elev ated lev el of cardiac biomark ers is a trustworth y measure of heart muscle injury , detectable biomark ers do not rev eal the cause of the injury . Heart muscle damage is often caused b y ischemia, but it can also be caused b y infection, inflammation, heart failure, or metabolic disorders. Elev ated cardiac biomark ers will accompan y (including surgery), m yocarditis, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, congestiv e heart failure, arrh ythmias, renal failure, poisoning, and ev en extreme diagnosing m yocardial infarctions, elev ated cardiac biomark ers are best used as confirmation of heart muscle damage when there are other indications that heart ischemia may have occurred. Imaging Studies A full r ange of imaging techniques is emplo yed in diagnosis of cardiac disease. Algorithm for the initial evaluation of patients with clinical symptoms of angina. Source: The CLARIFY Registry: Management of Stable Coronary Artery Disease in Clinical Practice. Chest X-Ray In diagnosing CAD , a chest x -ray, which shows heart siz e, is a priorit y when considering the possibilit y of accompan ying heart failure. Echocardiography Echocardiogr aphy, or \"echo ,\" is a painless test that uses sound w aves to create pictures of the heart in motion. The pictures show the siz e and shape of the heart and how well the heart 's chambers and v alves are working. Echo also can pinpoint areas of heart muscle that aren' t contr acting well because of poor blood flow or injury from a previous heart attack. A type of echo called Doppler ultrasound shows how well blood flows through the heart 's chambers and v alves. Echo can detect blood clots inside the heart, fluid buildup in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), and problems to produce a series of images of each part of the heart, then assembles them to mak e a three-dimensional picture. Sometimes an iodine-based dy e is injected into an IV during the scan to further highlight the coronary arteries. This is called coronary CT angiography . Coronary calcium scans are used to scan the coronary arteries for calcium deposits, which are usually a sign of longstanding atherosclerotic plaque (Llo yd-Jones et al. , 2009). Two imaging techniques can show calcium in the Calcium Scan Image (A) The position of the heart in the body and the location and angle of the coronary calcium scan image; (B) scan image showing calcification in a coronary artery. (In the CT scan, the patient's back is at the bottom of the image, and the patient's sternum is at the top.) Source: NHLBI, is a high-resolution technique that pro vides good visualization of the structure of the coronary arteries. In man y cases, multi-slice CT can allow an accur ate diagnosis of CAD , although this is at the expense of subjecting patients to higher than usual doses of r adiation (Lee, 2008). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives high-resolution images of the coronary arteries without subjecting patients to r adiation. When contr ast agents are used, MRI images can also show the relativ e perfusion of v arious regions of the heart (Antman et al., 2008). Cardiac MRI creates both still and mo ving pictures of the heart and major blood vessels.Angiograph of a Stenotic Segment in a Coronary Artery The finger is pointing to the narrowed region of a dye-filled coronary artery. Source: Gebel, 2008.Cardiac (cardiac arteriogr aphy) rev eals the outlines of the flow space inside the coronary arteries. During this procedure, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin or arm and dye is injected into a coronary artery to search for stenotic segments. Guided b y x-rays, the catheter can be moved up into the heart; there, in ideal conditions, narrowed (stenotic) arterial segments or blockages can be seen clearly . Angiogr aphy cannot detect early atherosclerotic plaque, which builds up inside the arterial wall but does not y et protrude into the arterial lumen. Cardiac angiogr aphy is also used to assess the performance of the cardiac v alves and the left v entricle. Cardiac catheterization is an in vasive procedure and it brings risks, so it is not done on all patients with diagnosed or suspected CAD. Individuals who qualif y for coronary angiogr aphy include who STEMI elev ation MI (NSTEMI) Chronic stable angina and who are being considered for reperfusion surgery , a percutaneous coronary interv ention (PCI), or b ypass gr aft (CABG) Anginal equiv alent Patients with a moder ate to large area of intact heart and no signs or symptoms or mild symptoms of ischemia Patients with moder ate to sev ere ischemia (Antman al. , 2008; Stouffer , 2012) Answer: C, ATest Your Learning When examining patients with suspected CAD , chest x -rays: Cardiac catheter angiogr aphy: Online Resource (7:20) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUIbLRO2pnU Electrocardiography All patients with possible heart problems should ha ve a 12-lead electrocardiogr am (ECG). In a patient with stable angina, the heart muscles ma y not be ischemic at rest and a resting ECG can be normal. Howev er, if areas of heart muscle are ischemic, or if past episodes of ischemia ha ve left damaged muscle, there will be char acteristic signs on the ECG.

Has risks and cannot be used if a person has ev er had an MI. D.ECG Waveforms Top: Normal ECG waveform. Bottom: ECG waveform in which the ST segment is raised significantly, indicating an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ie, a ST EMI).On ECG recordings, ischemia is t ypically diagnosed from changes in the shape and position of the ST segment of the w aveform: The v ector of the most significant ST changes indicates the region of heart muscle that is suffering ischemia. The elev ation or depression of the ST segment indicates the portion of the heart w all (subendocardium, epicardium, or the entire thickness, ie, tr ansmur al) that is suffering ischemia. A myocardial infarction with elev ated ST segments (a STEMI) suggests epicardial or tr ansmur al damage. This t ype of damage is the most lik ely to be rescued or reduced b y immediate reperfusion ther apy (Goldberger , 2008). The most common location of cardiac tissue damage is in the anterior lower leads. The formal definition of a STEMI is at least 2 contiguous leads of >2 mm elev ation. R egardless of the t ype of STEMI, all will be treated the same\u2014b y quick coronary revascularization. During an acute coronary syndrome, the patient 's ECG can change repeatedly; therefore, ph ysicians will tak e successiv e ECG recordings to monitor ev olving ev ents during the first 48 hours. Stress Testing Stress tests increase the o xygen demands of the heart in a controlled setting to search for evidence of activit y-dependent ischemia. ECGs and Echocardiograms with Increased Activity Sometimes patients who report episodes of chest discomfort during ex ercise ha ve no evidence of heart ischemia on ECGs tak en in the office while the patient is resting. T o check whether the patient 's exercise-dependent chest discomfort is angina, ECG recordings can be tak en while the patient ex ercises (usually on a treadmill) in a medically monitored environment. Patient Undergoing Stress Test An exercise stress test with the patient closely monitored. Source: NHLBI, 2016f. Echocardiogr ams, which show heart mo vements and v entricular w all thicknesses, can also be used in stress tests. Stress echocardiogr aphy is a more sensitiv e test for heart ischemia than is stress ECG testing. If a patient cannot ex ercise sufficiently to complete the test, the heart can instead be stressed pharmacologically using drugs such as adenosine, dip yridamole, or dobutamine. Stress testing should not be done during a potential acute coronary syndrome. Answer: BTest Your Learning To document episodes of heart ischemia, stress tests ha ve: Actors ber ate the patient. A. AThe patient ex ercise, gener ally on a treadmill. B. The patient attempt to do two tasks at once.C. The patient eats a large meal followed b y coffee and dessert. D.Confirming Diagnoses/Identifying Patients at Risk Stress tests are most helpful when they confirm an uncertain diagnosis of CAD . Negativ e stress tests are not as helpful, because about 1 out of 4 patients with CAD will show no diagnostic changes during a stress test. Certain findings in stress tests can identif y patients who ha ve a high risk of dev eloping an acute coronary syndrome. W orrisome findings include signs or symptoms of heart ischemia: At low lev els of ex ercise But no increase in blood pressure with continuing increases in ex ercise That persist >5 minutes after the end of the ex ercise (Douglas et al. , 2008) Prognosis From a patient 's medical profile and test results, clinicians can estimate the patient 's risk of suffering an acute coronary syndrome. T ables are a vailable for quantif ying this risk, but the first step is to distinguish low and high-risk patients. Low-Risk Patients In patients with CAD , the chances of dev eloping an acute coronary syndrome are lowest when: A stress test finds no problems, and The left v entricle appears to be functioning normally , and The coronary arteries look normal in angiogr ams High-Risk Patients Patients with CAD ha ve higher chances of dev eloping an acute coronary syndrome in an y of the following situations: The patient has significant risk factors for atherosclerotic CAD , including: Age >75 y Peripher al or cerebro vascular artery disease Dyslipidemia History of smokingHypertension Elevated C -reactiv e protein The patient has a history of heart problems, including: Episodes of unstable angina Past m yocardial infarctions Heart failure or heart failure signs, such as pulmonary edema, a heart gallop , an enlarged heart, mitr al regurgitation, or a reduced ejection fr action (<40%) The patient has worrisome stress test results, including: Inabilit y to ex ercise >6 minutes Ischemic signs or symptoms at low stress lev els Severe ischemia during testing The patient has worrisome cardiac catheterization results, including: Increased left v entricular end-diastolic pressure or v olume Reduced ejection fr action Stenosis >50% in the left main or the left anterior descending coronary artery The patient has extensiv e coronary artery calcification (Antman et al. , 2008) Management of CAD The foundation for treating all forms of CAD is the basic treatment plan for stable angina. This plan begins with ther apeutic lifest yle changes, adds medications when necessary , and considers using reperfusion ther apy for more serious lev els of disease. Initial Management of Acute Angina Patients with acute chest discomfort that does not respond to rest or to nitrogly cerin or that lasts more than 20 minutes should immediately be tak en to an emergency department, prefer ably b y ambulance (Antman et al. , 2007). In choosing among these treatment paths, clinicians rely on the history , physical examination, ECG, and blood tests for cardiac biomark ers. If the discomfort appears to be acute angina, ph ysicians will stabiliz e the patient and send them along 1 of 4 treatment paths. These paths lead to: Immediate treatment: those with ST elev ation on (percutaneous coronary interv ention or IV thrombolytic drugs)Admission to a coronary intensiv e care unit, a telemetry unit, or an observ ation unit: those without ST elev ation but at high risk Collection of further data for those who ha ve symptoms that w arrant ev aluation (stress testing or r adionuclide imaging) in the ED Discharge home with followup b y primary care ph ysician for those who ha ve an obvious non-cardiac cause for their symptoms (K ontos et al. , 2010) Patients most lik ely to benefit from immediate treatment are those with a major acute myocardial infarction, which can usually be identified b y biochemical evidence of heart muscle necrosis (increased blood lev els of cardiac biomark ers) and elev ations of the ST segments of the ECG w aveform. Patients who should be admitted to coronary units are those most lik ely to continue developing acute problems o ver the next 72 hours. These are patients with an y of these conditions: Recently changing or acceler ating angina History of myocardial infarction Evidence of heart failure ECG signs of ischemic changes Elevated cardiac biomark ers Over 70 years of age In addition, patients are admitted if there are serious contributing conditions, such as uncontrolled h ypertension, h ypotension, new cardiodynamic problems, mitr al regurgitation, or lung disease (Lee, 2008). Patients being work ed up for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must first be stabiliz ed. Antithrombotic ther apy should then be started and ischemic pain eliminated. Aspirin at 162 to 325 mg should be giv en (300 -600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel for those allergic to aspirin), and chest pain should be treated with sublingual nitrogly cerin. F or continued chest pain, morphine or fentan yl can be Intr avenous nitrogly cerin can be used when other medications ha ve failed to alleviate chest pain (Coven, 2013).Medical personnel have traditionally been taught the mnemonic MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin) to remind them of the initial treatment of any suspected ACS patient. However, according to current American Heart Association guidelines, \"there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oxygen in uncomplicated ACS.\" If the patient is short of breath, hypoxemic, or has obvious signs of heart failure, oxygen should be titrated to saturation levels 94% (AHA, 2015). The concern is oxygen toxicity and vasoconstriction. Oxygen causes constriction of the coronary, cerebral, renal, and other key vasculatures. If perfusion decreases with blood hyperoxygenation, the administration of oxygen may place tissues at increased risk of hypoxia. Hyperoxia reduces coronary blood flow by 8% to 29% in normal individuals and in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure. The reduction in coronary artery flow is associated with a reduction in myocardial-tissue oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption (Iscoe et al., 2011).Answers: A, D, C, CTest Your Learning When people call to ask advice about the sudden occurrence of chest discomfort: For patients who are having a suspected myocardial infarction, chewing 2 to 4 tablets of 81 mg aspirin is: The use of supplemental oxygen: Patients with stable angina who get chest discomfort with exercise: Therapeutic Lifestyle ChangesAdvise them to be taken immediately to the hospital, preferably by ambulance.A.

Should be put on bed rest to avoid sudden cardiac death.D.With commitment and persev erance, a person can significantly reduce the threats posed by CAD . Following a peak incidence around 1968, death from CAD declined significantly in the United States. It is estimated that 47% of the decrease in mortalit y from coronary heart disease in the United States between 1980 and 2000 w as attributed to adv ances in medical therapies, including treatment of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Appro ximately 44% of the reduction w as secondary to a decline in cardio vascular risk factors, including h ypercholesterolemia, h ypertension, smoking, and ph ysical inactivit y (Chiha et al. , 2012). Unfortunately , this reduction in the death r ate from CAD w as partly offset b y increases in diabetes and body mass index (BMI). Unfortunately , the cardio vascular disease epidemic continues to ev olve rapidly on a global lev el and is currently responsible for twice as man y deaths in dev eloping countries as in dev eloped countries. In low - and middle-income countries, cardio vascular risk factors, especially smoking and obesit y, continue to increase in incidence and affect a larger proportion of y ounger patients. Cardio vascular mortalit y has been reported 1.5 to 2 times higher among the working population in India, South Africa, and Br azil compared to the United States (Chiha et al. , 2012). Therapeutic lifest yle changes ha ve been scientifically demonstr ated to be good treatments for heart disease\u2014namely , stop smoking, eat a diet low in satur ated fat and higher in fruits and v egetables, ex ercise daily , and lose weight. It is the job of the healthcare team to work with the patient to personaliz e these familiar recommendations. Healthcare pro viders must offer pr actical advice that the patient can reasonably follow and that the patient believ es is worth following. In as man y as three-quarters of all CAD patients, supervised lifest yle change progr ams can reduce the amount and sev erity of angina within three months. During that time, patients can increase their ex ercise capacit y and impro ve their qualit y of life. Comprehensiv e lifestyle change progr ams can also reduce the chance that patients will require a coronary reperfusion procedure (Fr attaroli et al. , 2008). Therapeutic lifest yle changes can prev ent coronary artery disease and reduce its sev erity. Young people, who are increasingly at risk for dev eloping CAD , should be encour aged to follow the same principles of no smoking, low -fat/high-fiber meals, and plent y of ph ysical activit y (Libb y, 2008). Smoking CessationTherapeutic lifest yle changes begin with smoking cessation. Carbon mono xide and other poisons in cigarette smok e damage man y types of cells in the body . Carbon mono xide also reduces blood o xygenation, stressing the o xygen-hungry heart. This stress is compounded by the nicotine in cigarette smok e. Nicotine constricts blood v essels and causes the heart to work harder , raising heart r ate and blood pressure, two effects that increase the heart 's workload (Mitchell & Schoen, 2009). Cigarette smoking acceler ates coronary atherosclerosis in both sex es and at all ages and increases the risk of thrombosis, plaque instabilit y, MI, and death. In addition, b y increasing m yocardial o xygen needs and reducing o xygen aggr avates angina (Antman et al. , 2008). People who stop smoking reduce their risk of death from CAD; howev er, man y people find it difficult to stop smoking. Clinicians can begin b y telling patients that continued smoking increases their risk of serious heart problems and death, while quitting reduces this risk. They should then ask patients who smok e if they ha ve thought about quitting. Whatev er the answer , clinicians should follow with the offer \"When y ou would lik e to stop smoking, I'll be happ y to help set up an effectiv e progr am for y ou.\" For more information, see Cardiac R ehabilitation below . Low-Fat/High-Fiber Diet The American Dietetic Association has collected evidence demonstr ating that a low -fat diet with 12 to 33 g per da y of fiber from whole foods or up to 42.5 g per da y from supplements can help to reduce blood pressure, correct dyslipidemia, reduce indicators of chronic inflammation, and reduce weight (Am. Diet. Assoc. , 2008). A low -fat/high-fiber diet has also been shown to reduce the risk of dev eloping CAD . In one large study of older adults, eating whole-gr ain fiber in the equiv alent of an extr a 2 slices of whole-gr ain bread per da y reduced the number of: Deaths from CAD b Ischemic 24% Compared with medical or surgical interv entions, nutritional changes are relativ ely low - risk, low -cost, and widely a vailable. Therefore, the pr actical importance of ev en a small change in risk ma y be significant on a population or public health lev el (Mozaffarian et al. , 2003). Recommended Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Less than 7 percent of daily calories should come from satur ated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, bak ed goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. No more than 25 to 35 percent of daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, tr ans, monounsatur ated, and polyunsatur ated fats. Cholesterol intak e should be less than 200 mg a da y. Foods high in soluble fiber help prev ent the digestiv e tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include: Whole-gr ain cereals such as oatmeal and oat br an Fruits such as apples, bananas, or anges, pears, and prunes Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black -eyed peas, and lima beans Choose a diet rich in fruits and v egetables to decrease cholesterol. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work lik e soluble fiber . Fish such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mack erel are a good source of omega-3 fatt y acids and should be eaten twice a week. Limit sodium intak e.

Increased Physical Activity Regular ex ercise helps to correct dyslipidemia. It also reduces insulin resistance, decreases platelet aggregation, aids weight loss, impro ves sleep , and giv es people a sense of well- being. F or low -risk patients who get no cardiac symptoms with ex ercise, the minimum amount of recommended activit y is 30 minutes of moder ate-intensit y activit y such as brisk walking, on at least three different da ys each week. A recommended goal is for ev eryone to include 30 to 60 minutes of moder ate-intensit y aerobic activit y in their schedule ev ery da y in addition to their daily activities such as gardening or housework (Fr aker et al. , 2007).BMI Chart Source: Co urtesy of webmd.com.To have a significant effect, regular activit y must become a continuing part of a patient 's life. P atients stick to ex ercise goals more consistently when the activities are undertak en in a structured, supervised progr am\u2014for example, when the patients attend regular classes or when they k eep a record and report regularly to someone. Exercise progr ams ma y have to be introduced gr adually . At first, patients with stable angina ma y be limited b y the occurrence of angina and will probably need to adapt ev en their normal activities. The appear ance of angina or anginal equiv alents indicates that an activit y is too strenuous, so patients should revise their normal activities to a void the angina. In man y cases, patients can reduce the heart 's workload and prev ent angina simply b y doing stressful activities at a slower pace. P atients should be w arned that their ex ercise tolerance should be customiz ed to their comfort and daily activities. Angina occurs more frequently in the morning, after meals, and in cold weather . After finding an angina-free daily routine, most patients should then aim to increase their exercise toler ance. R egular ex ercise, bey ond their daily activities, is beneficial for almost all patients with CAD . For symptomatic and high-risk patients, a medically supervised cardiac rehabilitation progr am is recommended. The goal for most patients is to progress to a minimum of 30 minutes of moder ate-intensit y aerobic activit y on at least fiv e different days each week (Antman et al. , 2007). See Cardiac R ehabilitation below for more details. Weight Loss During the past twent y years there has been a dr amatic increase in obesit y in the United States, and r ates remain high. Thirt y-five percent of U .S. adults and appro ximately seventeen percent (12.5 million) of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 y ears are obese. Obesit y-related conditions include heart disease, strok e, type 2 diabetes, and certain t ypes of cancer \u2014some of the leading causes of prev entable death (CDC, 2012c). Excess body weight mak es the heart work harder , and excess fat fosters atherosclerosis. A person is considered o verweight if their body mass index (BMI, see chart below) is 25 to 29.9 kg/m , while obesit y is defined to be BMI >30 kg/m .2 2Calculating BMI is one of the best methods for population assessment of o verweight and obesit y. Because calculation requires only height and weight, it is inexpensiv e and easy to use for clinicians and for the gener al public. The use of BMI allows people to compare their own weight status to that of the gener al population. The standard weight status categories associated with BMI r anges for adults are shown in the following table (CDC, 2011). Body Mass Index (BMI): Weight in Pounds (lbs) and Kilograms (kg) BMI values for selected heights between 4'10\" and 6'3\" and for selected weights between 100 lbs and 248 lbs. BMI values are kilograms of body weight per square meter of body surface area (kg/m) (NHLBI, n.d.). Excess body weight is a CAD risk factor . A person need not be obese to suffer a higher risk of CAD: o verweight people with a BMI >26.5 ha ve an increased lik elihood of dev eloping atherosclerosis, and o verweight people with a BMI >27.5 ha ve an increased r ate of death from CAD (Lewis et al. , 2009). When a person' s excess fat is viscer al (ie, inside the abdomen as opposed to directly under the skin), the effect on atherosclerosis is worse. A quick and effectiv e measure of intr a- abdominal fat is a person' s waist circumference. W aist circumferences >102 cm (40 in) in men and >89 cm (35 in) in women represent increased coronary artery risks. Weight management is a k ey part of the ther apeutic lifest yle changes recommended for people with CAD . Patients should be encour aged to maintain a BMI <25 kg/m . Men should aim for a w aist circumference <102 cm (40 in), while women should aim for a w aist circumference <89 cm (35 in) (Antman et al. , 2007; Fr aker et al. , 2007). T o measure w aist size correctly , one should stand and place a tape measure around the middle, just abo ve the hipbones and measure the w aist just after seem to be equally effectiv e. The most effectiv e way to lose weight and to maintain the lower weight is participation in a comprehensiv e weight -loss progr am that combines low -calorie diets, behavior modification, and regular ex ercise. Health y weight loss must include a lifest yle of long-term changes in daily eating and ex ercise habits. Evidence shows that people who lose weight gr adually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at k eeping weight off . In order to lose weight, a person must reduce the daily caloric intak e and use up more calories than are tak en in. Since 1 pound equals 3,500 calories, caloric intak e must be reduced b y 500 to 1000 calories per day to lose about 1 to 2 pounds per week (CDC, 2016b). Even a modest weight loss, sa y, 5% to 10% of total body weight, is lik ely to produce health benefits, such as impro vements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars. Long-term success is achiev ed through health y eating, and ph ysical activit y most days of the week (about 60-90 minutes, moder ate intensit y) (CDC, 2016b). Stress M anagement It is gener believ ed that psy chological stress worsens CAD . In one small study , an intensiv e stress management progr am w as shown to actually reduce the amount of stenosis in coronary arteries (Pischk e et al. , 2008). Anger , frustr ation, fear , anxiet y, depression, and insomnia are thought to foster an internal biochemistry conduciv e to atherosclerosis and perhaps to acute coronary syndromes. Ph ysicians therefore advise CAD patients to lessen as possible the stressors in their liv es and to learn and use simple relaxation techniques (Da vis, 2008). A CAD patient struggling with an y form of psychological stress should be offered a referr al to a mental health professional. Medications Medications are used to manage all forms of CAD: Stable angina . Drugs that dilate arteries, slow heart r ate, and lower blood pressure can temper the cardio vascular effects of stressful activities. Drugs in this category include nitr ates, beta-block ers, and calcium channel block ers. Acute coronary syndromes . Antiplatelet drugs can be tak en daily to reduce the siz e and prev alence of thrombotic clots. Drugs in this category include aspirin and clopidogrel. NitratesNitrates are drugs that release nitric o xide (NO) when metaboliz ed. Nitric o xide relax es arterial w alls, causing the blood v essels to dilate, and the dilation of coronary arteries will ease ischemic heart pain. Sublingual nitrogly cerin tablets are the most effectiv e of the nitr ates. These tablets will reliev e angina within 5 minutes. Nitrogly cerin tablets can also be tak en 5 minutes before exercise or other stresses to prev ent angina. The most common side effects of nitrogly cerin are headache, dizziness, and a pulsing feeling in the head. Longer -acting nitrates can also be effectiv e; howev er, responses v ary, and the appropriate drug and dosage must be disco vered empirically for each patient. Patients with stable angina often get relief from an episode of angina b y resting. If a few minutes of rest are not sufficient, sublingual nitrogly cerin tablets will usually reliev e the angina. As man y as three tablets can be tak en at 3- to 5-minute interv als. When rest and nitrogly cerin do not work within a few minutes, the individual ma y be having an acute coronary syndrome. In these circumstances, the person should be tak en immediately b y ambulance to an emergency department (Antman et al. , 2008). Patients should k eep a diary , recording episodes of angina and the responses to rest and to nitrogly cerin. This diary can help ph ysicians to recogniz e when stable angina is becoming unstable. Nitrogly cerin tablets deterior ate. They last for 3 to 5 months when tightly capped and stored in a refriger ator. When k ept in a pill container and carried b y a patient, the tablets deterior ate more r apidly . Nitrates Prescribed for Angina (lasting (lasting >2 hours) (ointment, transdermal patch, oral sustained release, IV) isosorbide dinitrate (oral pills, chewable tablets, oral slow release, IV) isosorbide mononitrate (oral pills) Beta-Adrenergic Blockers Exercise and other stressors raise both heart rate and blood pressure via the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic neurotransmitters are adrenergic chemicals such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Adrenergic blocking drugs will reduce the abilit y of the sympathetic nervous system to stimulate end organs, such as the heart and the smooth muscles in arteries. Sympathetic stimulation has different effects on different tissues, and it has been possible to find drugs that selectively block specific sympathetic effects. Beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers ) are especially effective at limiting the cardiovascular effects of sympathetic stimulation. Beta blockers inhibit the increases in heart rate and blood pressure that are normally caused by exercise and stress, while having little effect on the heart at rest (Antman et al., 2007). To reduce angina and to lower the risk of an MI, many CAD patients take long-acting or sustained-release beta blockers once daily. Beta blockers are also prescribed as protection after an acute coronary syndrome (Alaeddini, 2012).Beta Blockers Prescribed can require a beta block er to be tak en at a lower dose or to be discontinued entirely . When being discontinued, beta block ers should be tapered and not stopped suddenly . The possible side effects of beta block ers include fatigue, reduced exercise toler ance, nightmares, impotence, cold hands and feet, intermittent claudication, br adycardia, impaired atrio ventricular conduction, left v entricular failure, bronchial asthma, and, in diabetics, an intensification of the h ypogly cemia produced b y oral hypogly cemic agents or insulin. Beta block ers are usually not giv en to patients with asthma or other t ypes of rev ersible airway obstruction, sev ere br adycardia, atrio ventricular conduction disturbances, R aynaud' s phenomenon, or a history of clinical depression (Antman et al. , 2008). Calcium Channel Block ers Calcium channel block ers dilate coronary arteries, lower blood pressure, and reduce the heart 's oxygen requirements. Howev er, calcium channel block ers can produce h ypotension, edema, and br adycardia and can worsen Dihydropyridines Diltiaz em, slow release Verapamil, slow releaseOverall, the effects of calcium channel block ers are similar to the effects of beta block ers, and calcium channel block ers are often prescribed when beta block ers cannot be used, such as with asthma or chronic obstructiv e pulmonary disease, or when the side effects of beta block ers such as depression, sexual disturbances, or fatigue pose too much of a problem. Diltiaz em and the dih ydropyridine calcium channel block ers can be combined with beta block ers and nitr ates, although the specific doses must be customiz ed for each patient. In 2006 the FDA appro ved the use of a metabolic modulator , ranolazine actory angina. R anolazine is a sodium current inhibitor that, unlik e other anti- anginal drugs, has no effect on heart r ate or blood pressure. It is giv en in twice- daily or al doses of 500 to 1000 mg, and is usually prescribed in combination with another anti- anginal drug such as a nitrate, a beta block er, or amlodipine (Antman et al. , 2008). Ranolazine is used to reliev e or prev ent chronic angina in patients with moder ately sev ere symptoms (O'R ourke et al. , 2008). Ranolazine has recently \"to reduce angina frequency and sublingual nitrogly cerin use in patients with t ype 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic angina, \" according to results of a study presented at the American College of Cardiology' s 62nd Annual Scientific Session (Hughs, 2013). Antiplatelet Drugs Blood clots and an activ ated clotting path way are major causes of acute coronary syndromes. Aspirin and clopidogrel (Pla vix), two drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation, have been shown to reduce a person' s risk of ha ving an acute coronary syndrome. Aspirin Aspirin is the most widely used and tested antiplatelet drug in CAD , and it is the cornerstone of antiplatelet ther apy in treatment and prev ention of CAD . In acute coronary syndrome and thrombotic strok e, acute use of aspirin can decrease mortalit y and recurrence of cardio vascular ev ents. As secondary prev ention, aspirin is believ ed to be effectiv e in acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, rev ascularization, strok e, and atrial fibrillation (Dai & Ge, 2012).For ACS patients, the current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines recommend that aspirin should be administered as soon as possible, with an initial loading dose of 162 to 325 mg and continued indefinitely with a dose of 75 to 162 mg daily . The use of aspirin (162 mg chewed, to ensure r apid ther apeutic blood levels) w as associated with a 23% reduction of v ascular mortalit y rate in MI patients and close to a 50% reduction of nonfatal re-infarction or strok e, with benefits seen in both men and women. In unstable angina and NSTEMI patients, aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI b y 50% to 70% during the acute phase and b y 50% to 60% at 3 months to 3 y ears (Dai & Ge, 2012). The highest benefit of aspirin w as seen in those undergoing coronary angioplast y, with a 53% reduction in MI, strok e, or v ascular deaths. In percutaneous coronary interv ention (PCI), the use of aspirin significantly reduces abrupt closure after balloon angioplast y and significantly reduces stent thrombosis r ates (Dai & Ge, 2012). Long-term aspirin ther apy reduces the y early risk of ev corresponds to an absolute reduction of nonfatal ev ents and to a smaller reduction in v ascular death. Although the long-term use of aspirin has been associated with gastrointestinal and other bleeds, the benefits outweigh the risks. F or secondary prev ention, aspirin is recommended in conjunction with lifest yle changes and smoking cessation to reduce an individual' s overall risk of further cardio vascular ev ents (Dai & Ge, 2012). Clopidogrel (Plavix) Clopidogrel, also known as Pla vix, is an antiplatelet drug used for peripher al vascular disease, ACS , recent MI, or strok e. Clopidogrel is giv en as an initial 300-mg loading dose followed b y 75 mg daily (Mechcatie, 2012). Aspirin and clopidogrel can be combined, howev er caution should be tak en regarding an increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Influenza Vaccination Patients who ha ve CAD should get a seasonal flu shot ev ery year. Those o ver age 65 should also consider a pneumonia v accine. Treating Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic risk factors defined b y the International Diabetes F ederation as centr al obesit y (measured b y waist circumference) plus an y two of the following four risk factors (Edw ardson et al. , 2012): Elevated blood pressure (systolic 130 or abo ve or diastolic 85 or abo ve) Triglycerides abo ve 150 mg/dlReduced high-densit y lipoprotein (HDL) Elevated fasting blood sugar (greater than 100 mg/dl) Research has shown that individuals with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of diabetes, cardio vascular ev of European, American, and Canadian adults ha ve metabolic syndrome. The high prev alence of the syndrome and the associated health consequences demonstr ate the importance of understanding the causes of metabolic syndrome in order to implement prev ention strategies (Edw ardson et al. , 2012). Having just one of the metabolic risk factors does not meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Howev er, any of these conditions increases the risk of serious disease. If more than one of these conditions occur in combination, the risk of serious disease is ev en greater (Ma yo Clinic, 2016). Each of these cardiometabolic disorders promotes the development of the others. F or example: Insulin resistance can lead to dyslipidemia and h ypertension. Hypertension increases the lik elihood of dev eloping diabetes. Centr al obesit y can lead to insulin resistance. People tend to ha ve more than one of these disorders at a time (Buse et al. , 2008). Aggressiv e lifest yle changes can dela y or ev en prev ent the dev elopment of serious health problems. T reatment of metabolic syndrome in volves the separ ate treatment of each of its components. In addition to metabolic syndrome, certain other medical conditions are especially problematic for people with CAD . These conditions y Hyperth yroidism Pulmonary disease Anemia Controlling these problems can sometimes reduce or eliminate the angina of concurrent CAD (Antman et al. , 2008). DiabetesDiabetes and CAD are a deadly combination. Diabetes acceler ates coronary atherosclerosis and increases the risk of angina, m yocardial infarction, and sudden coronary death. Y et, according to Libb y (2008), \"most patients with diabetes mellitus die of atherosclerosis and its complications. \" Diabetics are at least 4 to 6 times as lik ely as nondiabetics to ha ve heart disease and tend to dev elop heart disease at an earlier age than nondiabetics. W omen who ha ve not gone through menopause usually ha ve less risk of heart disease than men of the same age. But women of all ages who ha ve diabetes ha ve an increased risk of heart disease because diabetes cancels out the protectiv e effects of being a woman in her childbearing y ears (NDIC, 2012). People with diabetes who ha ve already had one heart attack run an ev en greater risk of having a second one. In addition, heart attacks in diabetics are more serious and more likely to result in death (NDIC, 2012). It has been shown that maintaining strict control of blood glucose lev els reduces the coronary artery risk posed b y diabetes and taking metformin, controlling blood lipid lev els (with statins), reducing h ypertension, and instituting ther apeutic lifest yle changes all lessen the serious complications of CAD in diabetics (Amer . 2008). Dyslipidemia Lipid disorders underlie atherosclerosis, and treating lipid abnormalities is critical to slowing the progression of CAD . The ther apeutic lifest yle changes described abo ve such as stop smoking, eat a low -fat, high-fiber diet, ex ercise more, and lose weight are the first steps in a voiding or rev ersing lipid abnormalities. When target blood lipid lev els cannot be achiev ed via lifest yle changes, the next step is the addition of medications, namely statins (Libby, 2008). Low -fat diet means satur ated fats are <7% of daily calories, minimal tr ans fats, and dietary cholesterol <200 mg/da y. Target Blood Lipid Levels for Patients with CAD LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl or <70 for those with syndrome HDL cholesterol >40 mg/dl Source: NDIC, 2016. Normal, At-Risk, and High Blood Pressure Levels Normal Systolic: less than 120 mmHg Diastolic: less higher Source: CD C, 2016c.To manage CAD , the primary lipid goal is a reduction of LDL cholesterol lev els. In the gener al adult population, the target LDL lev el is <100 mg/dl. Howev er, for people with CAD, the target LDL lev el is <70 mg/dl. The recommended t ype of medication for lowering LDL cholesterol is a statin. Statins can reduce LDL cholesterol b y 25% to 50%; they can also r aise HDL cholesterol b y 5% to 9% and lower trigly cerides b y 5% to 30% (Brunz ell et al., 2008). Hypertension High blood pressure (h ypertension) worsens atherosclerosis and increases the risks of acute coronary syndrome. High blood pressure w as a primary or contributing cause of death for 348,000 Americans in 2008, or nearly 1,000 deaths per da y. Of the 68 million American adults who ha ve high blood pressure, 36 million do not ha ve it under control (CDC, 2016c). About 30% of American adults ha ve preh ypertension\u2014 blood pressure measurements that are higher than normal, but not y et in the high blood pressure r ange. Better h ypertension management leads to impro ved health outcomes. A large systematic review of 147 trial reports on the management of h ypertension has shown that a reduction of 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 5 mm Hg in diastolic w as associated with a 20% reduction of coronary heart disease and 32% reduction in stroke in one y ear (Al- Ansary et al. , 2013). As with all health problems related to CAD , treatment of h ypertension begins with therapeutic lifest yle changes. If lifest yle changes are not sufficient, medications should be added (R osendorff et al. , 2007). Drugs prescribed for h ypertension in patients with CAD include:Beta blockers . Beta block ers are the first antih ypertensiv e drugs for patients with CAD . If necessary , certain calcium channel block ers can be added to or substituted for beta block ers. ACE inhibitors . Angiotensin-con verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are antih ypertensiv e drugs and are part of the standard drug ther apy for CAD patients who ha ve diabetes or left v entricular dysfunction, ev en when the patients do not ha ve hypertension. Angiotensin receptor block ers can often be substituted for ACE inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics . Thiazide diuretics can be effectiv ely added to other antihypertensiv e medicines when needed but caution must be tak en to maintain serum potassium lev els within the normal r ange. Reperfusion Therapies After ther apeutic lifest yle interv entions are in place, drugs are added to the treatment regimen to control both angina and h ypertension. When these medicines still do not reduce the anginal episodes, the next lev el of treatment is reperfusion ther apy (also called revascularization or recanalization therapy reperfusion procedures: percutaneous interv entions to open block ed coronary arteries via a catheter , and surgical artery or v ein gr afts to b ypass obstructed segments of coronary arteries. In some situations, ph ysicians recommend reperfusion ther apy even before learning how well the prescribed drugs will succeed in controlling a patient 's angina. F or example, in addition to lifest yle changes and medications, reperfusion is often recommended for patients with an y of these conditions: >50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery Significant stenosis of three major coronary artery br anches Stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and one additional major coronary artery br anch Percutaneous Interventions Percutaneous interventions (PCIs) are accomplished b y threading a balloon-tipped catheter into the stenotic segment of an artery . The balloon is inflated until it flattens the offending plaque against the arterial w all and reopens the arterial lumen. In the larger branches of the coronary arteries, the cleared lumen is held open b y a metal stent that is left in place permanently .Obstructed arteries that ha ve been dilated b y percutaneous interv ention are susceptible to restenosis, so patients are giv en antiplatelet ther apy after the procedure. Currently , by using stents coated with antithrombotic chemicals (drug-eluting stents), the restenosis rates ha ve been reduced to about 10% o ver six months. When the reopened arteries eventually become block ed again, percutaneous interv ention is repeated. Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) uses a gr afted blood v essel to deliv er blood around the obstructed segment of a coronary artery . Often, the new blood conduit is a length of saphenous v ein that has been remo ved from the patient 's leg. Arteries mak e better conduits than v eins, and an arterial gr aft can be made b y detaching the distal end of the internal thor acic artery (also called the internal mammary artery ) and re- attaching it to the stenotic coronary artery bey ond the obstructed region; this reroutes blood from the subcla vian artery into the coronary circulation. Bypass gr afts are preferred o ver percutaneous interv entions for the simultaneous revascularization of three or more obstructed coronary arteries. Bypass gr afts are also preferred when other heart repairs, such as a v alve replacement, are needed b y the patient. Answer: CTest Your Learning Coronary artery b ypass gr The long-term surviv al adv antage after CABG, cited abo ve, was consistent across multiple subgroups based on gender , age, r ace, diabetes, body mass index, prior heart attack history , number of block ed coronary v essels, and other char acteristics. F or example, the insulin-dependent diabetes subgroup that receiv ed CABG had a 28% increased chance of surviv al after four y ears compared with the PCI group (NIH, 2016a).Are alw ays the ther apy of choice in a hospital with capacit y to perform them. A. Typically use nonhuman materials, such as T eflon tubes or porcine arteries. B. Are the ther apy of choice when multiple v essels are block ed and additional heart repairs need to be made.C. Are no longer recommended because studies show that other interv entions lead to better surviv al rates.D.According to an international study supported b y the NHLBI, adults with diabetes and multi- vessel coronary heart disease who underwent cardiac b ypass surgery had better overall heart -related outcomes than those who underwent PCI. The study compared the effectiv eness of CABG and PCI that included insertion of drug-eluting stents. After fiv e years, the CABG group had fewer adv erse events and better surviv al rates than the PCI group . The surviv al adv antage of CABG o ver PCI w as consistent regardless of r ace, gender , number of block ed vessels, or disease sev erity (NHLBI, 2016g). Answer: ATest Your Learning New studies that compare CABG and PCI in diabetics with multi- vessel CAD: Laser Transmyocardial Revascularization Another technique is a vailable for reducing the ex ercise-limiting angina suffered b y some patients with sev ere chronic stable angina. Laser transmyocardial revascularization uses a laser to cut thin channels through the heart 's walls. It is thought that the laser treatment stimulates the formation of new blood v essels that can increase local blood flow to heart muscle. It is also thought that the laser ma y destro y some of the nerv es that are causing the angina (T exas Heart Institute, 2012). Silent Ischemia Patients often know when they are ha ving an episode of heart ischemia because it causes angina or an anginal equiv alent. Howev er, heart ischemia can also be silent. When coronary artery patients are continually monitored b y ECG during their daily liv es, ischemic episodes can be detected electrically at times when the patients do not feel an y symptoms. This is true both for patients who occasionally experience angina in normal life and for CAD patients who ha ve nev er experienced angina. P eople can also ha ve silent heart attacks, especially diabetics who ha ve dev eloped autonomic neuropath y. When patients are discovered to ha ve had a silent MI, it is treated in the same w ay as a symptomatic one. Found fewer adv erse ev ents and better surviv al rates after 5 y ears for those who underwent CABG.A. Found fewer adv erse ev ents for those who underwent PCI. B. Found no difference in surviv al rates and adv erse ev ents after 5 y ears. C. Found neither procedure to be effectiv e for diabetic patients. D.Answer: ATest Your Learning When patients with stable CAD ha ve an episode of heart ischemia, they: Major Complications of CAD The ischemia of CAD can lead to serious heart damage. Acute ischemia can cause heart muscle to die, thereb y weak ening the heart and reducing its efficiency . Acute ischemia can also initiate a fatal arrh ythmia and sudden cardiac death. Chronic ischemia , with accumulating damage from ev en small ischemic episodes, can lead to heart failure. Acute Coronary Syndromes Acute coronary syndromes are ischemic episodes caused b y a sudden worsening of the atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. All acute coronary syndromes should be ev aluated in an emergency department. The acute coronary syndromes fill a spectrum from self -limiting ischemic episodes that cause little muscle death to m yocardial infarctions, which cause areas of heart muscle necrosis. Some m yocardial infarctions threaten so much heart damage that the patient ma y need immediate reperfusion ther apy. The need for immediate reperfusion is best diagnosed in a prepared emergency department that is attached to a cardiac reperfusion facilit y. Always send patients with acute chest discomfort to an ED! Health pr actitioners frequently receiv e telephone calls from patients or family members, friends, or caregiv ers who are concerned that their symptoms could be due to a heart attack.Almost alw ays ha ve angina or an anginal equiv alent at the same time. A. May have no symptoms. B. Must alw ays be tak en immediately to an emergency department. C. Should expand their coronary arteries b y performing w arm-up ex ercises for 5 to 10 minutes.D.Rather than dismiss such symptoms o ver the telephone, healthcare pro viders, EMS dispatchers, and staff positioned to receiv e these calls should advise patients to come in for an ev aluation and testing. Only through a full ph ysical examination, ECG, and appropriate blood tests to measure cardiac biomark ers can the correct diagnosis be made and appropriate interv entions be giv en (Andersen et al. , 2007). During the last 25 y ears, the management of patients with acute MI has undergone man y transformations. Until 1984, treatment w as limited to pro viding symptomatic relief plus management of complications such as arrh ythmias, acute heart failure, or post infarction angina. In the 1980s, the introduction of antithrombotic treatment with aspirin and intravenous (or intr acoronary) fibrinolysis resulted in significant mortalit y reductions in patients with STEMI. In the 1990s, clinicians in some settings introduced immediate (pre- hospital) initiation of thrombolytic treatment following pre-hospital triage of patients with an acute MI and an indication for reperfusion ther apy (Nauta et al. , 2011). Although more effectiv e thrombolytic agents became a vailable, reperfusion of the infarcted vessel often failed and bleeding complications were a limiting factor . Gradually , mechanical percutaneous techniques impro ved, and in the last two decades PCI became the treatment of choice in patients presenting with a STEMI (Nauta et al. , 2011). In the same time period, patients with NSTEMI benefitted from impro ved antithrombotic and anticoagulant ther apy, better risk str atification, and tailored treatment with selectiv e coronary rev ascularization in high-risk patients. In addition, effectiv e secondary prev ention was introduced with aspirin, beta block ers, statins, and ACE inhibitors in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction and, subsequently , in high-risk MI surviv ors. In combination, all these dev elopments reshaped the treatment map of the patient with an MI (Nauta et al. , 2011). While they are being ev aluated, patients who ma y have unstable angina or NSTEMI must have their ECGs monitored continuously . They also need to be near emergency resuscitation equipment including a defibrillator , because sudden cardiac death is possible (Andersen et al. , 2007). These patients are usually giv en antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel or pr asugrel with or without heparin), o xygen when needed, nitrogly cerin, additional pain relief (eg, morphine), beta block ers, and bed rest (Beck er et al., 2008; Hirsh et al. , 2008; Smith, 2012). Coronary angiogr aphy within 24 hours is recommended for some unstable angina or NSTEMI patients.The 2012 NSTEMI guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology F oundation recommend the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor as e to pr asugrel and clopidogrel. Ticagrelor \"significantly reduced the r ate of death from v ascular causes, m yocardial infarction, or strok e compared with clopidogrel, although ticagrelor w as associated with a higher risk of bleeding\" (Smith, 2012). STEMIs When an acute coronary syndrome is accompanied b y elev ated cardiac biomark ers and elevations in the ST -segment of the ECG w aveform, the ev ent is STEMIs are m yocardial infarctions that affect large areas of heart muscle and that cause transmural ischemia resulting in decreased oxygenation through the entire thickness of the heart w all. Patients with STEMIs should be identified early in the chest pain triage, because they are candidates for immediate reperfusion ther apy. The two t ypes of acute reperfusion apy are percutaneous more effectiv e than fibrinolytic therapy. Howev er, if there is no catheter labor atory capable of performing percutaneous coronary interv ention, \"the appropriate and timely use of some form of reperfusion ther apy is likely more important than the choice of ther apy\" (Levine, 2012). Speed is important. F or percutaneous coronary interv entions, the time goal is to ha ve the obstructed artery recanaliz ed in less than 90 minutes after the patient has come into the ED. For thrombolysis, the time goal is to ha ve injected fibrinolytic agents no later than 30 minutes after the patient has come into the ED . The most commonly used fibrinolytic agents are reteplase, alteplase, and tenecteplase. Giving these drugs quickly is critical because they are most effectiv e when used on new clots. Intr avenous injections of a fibrinolytic agent achiev e the best results when administered within 1 to 2 hours of the onset of symptoms. The benefit of this ther apy decreases mark edly 6 hours after symptom onset and there is hardly an y benefit from thrombolytics after 12 hours (AHRQ , 2012). Fibrinolytic ther apy has the risk of inducing bleeding. Intr acranial bleeding is a serious complication that occurs in about 1% to 2% of cases (AHRQ , ention, emergently in patients ha ving a STEMI. Thrombolytics are also used for STEMIs when PCI is not a vailable.According to the 2013 American Heart Association STEMI guidelines, PCI is the best treatment for patients ha ving a STEMI if it can be performed in a timely manner and b y experienced clinicians. Previous guidelines recommended \"door -to-balloon time\" or \"door - to-needle time\" of 90 minutes or less. This means that a patient who qualifies for PCI should ha ve a cardiac catheterization within 90 minutes of arriv al to the ED (Husten, 2012). The 2013 guidelines now recommend \"first medical contact (FMC) to device time\" of 120 minutes or less (Levine, 2012). Man y EMS pro viders ha ve the abilit y to pre-notif y a hospital with a cardiac catheter labor atory b y sending the ECG electronically to the ED . If the ECG is identified as a STEMI or new left bundle br anch block (LBBB) b y the ED diagnostician, the catheter labor atory is then notified to be ready for a procedure. Upon arrival, the patient is quickly prepped in the ED and sent for PCI. The goal is to get the patient to angiogr aphy as soon as possible because, with ev ery moment without o xygen, more heart muscle dies. Research suggests that most patients with LBBB do not ha ve an occluded artery at cardiac catheterization and are therefore needlessly exposed to the risks of fibrinolytic ther apy (NIH, 2016a). Therapeutic Hy pothermia The 2013 American Heart Association STEMI guidelines stress the importance of therapeutic h ypothermia for unconscious cardiac -arrest surviv ors. During cardiac arrest, the br ain is depriv ed of o xygen with resulting irrev ersible br ain damage. If blood flow is restored, cerebr al edema caused b y tissue injury or blood-br ain barrier disruption can cause ev en more br ain damage. It has been found that these patients are lik ely to ha ve a better neurologic outcome if mild h ypothermia is induced. For out -of-hospital cardiac arrest caused b y ventricular fibrillation, the American Heart Association class I recommendation is induction of h ypothermia to temper atures of 32\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C for a period of 12 to 24 hours in an unconscious patient who has had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hypothermia induction is a class IIB recommendation for other cases of cardiac arrest, with ROSC in an unconscious patient occurring both in and out of the hospital (Erb & Hr avnak, 2012). Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) In a recent study sponsored b y the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, PCI outcomes were compared to cardiac b ypass in diabetic patients. There w as a substantial adv antage of coronary artery b ypass gr afting (CABG) o ver PCI in diabetics with coronary artery disease (JournalW atch, 2012).A new study supported b y the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found older adults with stable coronary heart disease who underwent b ypass surgery had better long-term surviv al rates than those who underwent PCI to impro ve blood flow to the heart muscle. While there were no surviv al differences between the two groups after one y ear, after four y ears the CABG group had a 21% lower mortalit Answer: CTest Your Learning Fibrinolytic ther apy, used to reopen arteries after certain m yocardial infarctions: Online Resource (9:25) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM_tcf5Ogy0 Sudden Cardiac Arrest Coronar y Artery Bypass (CABG) Sur gery Coronar y Artery Bypass (CABG) Sur amuscular injections of tissue activ A.

Uses a percutaneous, balloon-tipped catheter to redilate clogged coronary arteries.D.Each y ear as man y as 400,000 Americans die unexpectedly from an acute cardiac ev ent. Typically , these sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) are due to a lethal arrh ythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation. The risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) increases with age or a history of underlying heart disease. Men are 2 to 3 times more lik ely to ha ve SCA than women (NHLBI, 2016c). Scar tissue replaces dead heart muscle cells after a heart attack. The scar tissue can disrupt and damage the heart 's electrical system and cause the electrical signals to spread abnormally throughout the heart. These changes to the heart increase the risk of dangerous arrh ythmias and SCA (NHLBI, 2016c). An acute coronary syndrome seems to cause most cases of SCA in adults. Man y of these adults, howev er, have no signs or symptoms of CAD before ha ving SCA. The highest risk for SCA is during the first 6 months after a heart attack (NHLBI, 2016c). Appro ximately 65% of deaths caused b y MI occur in the first hour . Sudden cardiac death can strik e a person without previous heart symptoms, but 80% to 90% of the victims of sudden cardiac death are found to ha ve significant stenosis of at least one major br anch of the coronary arteries (Schoen & Mitchell, 2009; Z afari, 2013). Ischemic Heart Failure A heart is in failure when it cannot pump sufficient blood to o xygenate the body . Coronary artery disease causes heart failure through m yocardial infarctions. A patient can ha ve a single infarction that injures a large region of heart muscle, or there can be a series of small infarctions that cumulativ ely injure a significant amount of heart muscle. The ischemic heart failure produced b y CAD is char acteriz ed by a dilated, h ypertrophic left ventricle and b y scars and fibrosis in the heart muscle. Ischemic heart failure is the most common form of congestiv e heart failure, and it accounts for about half of all the hearts that are replaced b y transplants (Schoen & Mitchell, 2009). Heart failure increases the o xygen requirements of the heart. Medicines are prescribed based on how sev ere the heart failure is, the t ype of heart failure, and the patient response to medications (NHLBI, 2016h). P atients with both CAD and heart failure giv an enzyme Together , these drugs reduce the siz e, the w all tension, and the o xygen demands of the heart. If the ACE inhibitor does not reduce ongoing h ypertension, a diuretic is added (Rosendorff et al. , 2007). Occasionally , beta block ers can be giv en, but calcium channel blockers are contr aindicated. The following medications are commonly used to treat heart failure:Diuretics (w ater or fluid pills) help reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and swelling in feet and ankles. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce str ain on the heart. They ma y also reduce the risk of a future heart attack. Aldosterone antagonists trigger the body to get rid of salt and w ater through urine. This lowers the v olume of blood that the heart must pump , decreasing the work load of the heart. Angiotensin-receptor block ers relax blood v essels and lower blood pressure to decrease the heart 's workload. Beta block ers slow the heart r ate and lower blood pressure to decrease the heart 's workload. Isosorbide dinitr ate/h ydralazine h ydrochloride helps relax blood v essels so the heart does not work as hard to pump blood. Digoxin mak es the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. (NHLBI, 2016h) Patients with both CAD and heart failure ha ve a relativ ely poor prognosis. Ev en when the CAD tak es the form of stable angina, reperfusion ther apies are considered in an attempt to impro ve the o xygenation of a failing heart (Antman et al. , 2008). Cardiac Rehabilitation (Seco ndary Prevention) For CAD the techniques of prev ention, treatment, and rehabilitation o verlap consider ably. Cardiac rehabilitation, which is the long-term treatment of patients who ha ve suffered an episode of sev ere heart ischemia, is a v ariant of the same medical care that patients receiv e in all phases of their CAD . In some medical centers the cardiac rehabilitation progr am that is prescribed for patients reco vering from MIs is also offered as prev entive therapy for patients at high risk for acute coronary syndromes. Whereas primary prev ention str ategies an acute phase of CAD , cardiac rehabilitation is referred to as secondary prev ention. F or CAD a k ey part of both rehabilitation and prev ention progr ams is the reduction of the patient 's atherosclerotic risk factors. Both progr ams strongly urge smoking cessation, supervised weight loss, ph ysical exercise, and help in planning nutritionally balanced, low -fat/high-fiber/low -calorie meals. In addition, both progr ams stress aggressiv e management of h ypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Team CareAs with the management of all chronic illnesses, the most effectiv e cardiac rehabilitation progr ams are organiz ed utilizing a team of ph ysicians, nurses, ph ysical ther apists, dieticians, social work ers, occupational ther apists, and clinical psy chologists. Within their own area of expertise, healthcare professionals focus on helping to restore a cardiac patient 's comfort, sense of well-being, and normal daily activities. A t the same time, each worker aims to reduce specific risk factors to prev ent future episodes of ischemia (Gr aham et al., 2008). Individual Medical and Social Profiles Cardiac rehabilitation progr ams are individualiz ed. When a rehabilitation team tak es over the care of a cardiac patient, they begin b y compiling a medical and social history . Besides the standard health history , the team needs to know the details of the patient 's normal daily home, work, and recreational activities. The ph ysical examination information in the profile should include ECG recordings at rest and during ex ercise. Stress test results are added to the profile and can be used to set ex ercise guidelines. Supportive and Protective Medications After a serious episode of heart ischemia, patients will be taking a number of medications. A typical drug regimen includes a statin (with the goal of lowering LDL cholesterol blood levels to 70 mg/dl), a beta block er (to ease the work of the left v entricle), and aspirin and clopidogrel (to reduce the risk of clots). If patients ha ve a poorly functioning left v entricle, they ma y also be taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor block er. When a patient continues to ha ve hypertension on the existing drug and lifest yle regimens, a thiazide diuretic is added (Bashore et al. , 2009). Smoking Cessation Smoking is dangerous for patients who ha ve had an MI. Health professionals need to tell patients who smok e that stopping will cut in half their risk of dying from another ischemic episode. Clinicians are encour aged to tak e five steps\u2014the Five A's \u2014with their patients who smok e: Ask. Ask the patient if they smok e. Advise . Strongly advise quitting. Assess . Ask the patient whether they are ready to quit. Assist . Help to formulate a workable smoking cessation plan, including medications and regular inter actions with a counselor .Arrange . Take steps to put the plan into action: organiz e the necessary medications, counseling, and follow -up visits. Healthy Diet Eating that fulfills psy chological or emotional needs is not alw ays heart -health y eating. Many cardiac patients eat out of habit and in response to psy chological or emotional stress. These patients need guidance and support when trying to impro ve their diet. A cardiac diet should be prescribed, which includes low fat, high fiber and fresh fruits and v egetables. Dieticians Ideally , a dietician will be part of the cardiac rehabilitation team. Dieticians can help plan meals that: Meet the rehabilitation goals Patients can afford Patients will prepare and eat Is customiz ed to their culture and needs Rehabilitation Goals A major rehabilitation goal is to k eep blood lev els of LDL cholesterol and trigly cerides low and lev els of HDL cholesterol high. Diets that help to meet these goals are low in satur ated fats (<7% of daily calories), ha ve minimal tr ans fats, and ha ve about 25 g of dietary fiber daily for women and 38 g for men (Am. Diet. Assoc. , 2008). Other dietary advice includes: Drinking ex cess alcohol can r aise blood pressure, an atherosclerotic risk factor . Salt and certain salt substitutes can contribute to h ypertension, especially in those patients with a sensitivit y to ex cess sodium. Excess body weight is an atherosclerotic risk factor , so diets should be calorie- controlled. Satur ated fats be replaced b ated fats, polyunsatur ated fats, and omega-3 fatt y acids (found in oily fish). Fruits, v egetables, and gr ains are recommended. Dietary Counselin g ProgramsA dietary counseling progr am begins with the dietician seeing each patient individually . The dietician tak es a dietary history and measures the patient 's height, weight, and w aist circumference. P atients are then giv en diaries in which to record all their food and drink intake for fiv e days. Patients mail or email their diaries to the dietician, and at the next visit the dietician suggests specific w ays that the patient can impro ve what and how they eat. R egular followup visits continue. A t each visit, the patient 's height, weight, and w aist circumference are measured, the patient 's progress is charted, and specific dietary recommendations are suggested. This dietary rehabilitation progr am should continue until the patient has found a stable, health y eating routine. Weight Management Excess weight is a heart stressor and an atherosclerotic risk factor , so weight reduction is an important component of cardiac rehabilitation for o verweight patients. Heart -health y weight goals are: BMI <25 kg/m and Waist circumference <102 cm (40 in) in men and <90 cm (35 in) in women To lose weight, a person must eat fewer calories. P eople should maintain a nutritional balance while they reduce their caloric intak e, and cr ash diets should be discour aged. By itself, exercise r arely leads to a significant weight loss, but ex ercise can be an important weight loss aid. For weight reduction and weight maintenance, regular one-on-one sessions with a dietician are usually the most successful tools. Experienced dieticians can help patients to devise a health y reduced-calorie eating plan that the patient can stick with for the long term. Exercise Well-planned ex ercise tr aining can restore man y patients to a normal or near -normal lifestyle and weight. Modifications should be made for those with retinopath y or neuropath y, and for those on beta block ers. Ineligible Patients Some cardiac patients will not y et be sufficiently stable, mobile, or resilient to begin the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation. Ineligible patients include those with: Worrisome ischemic symptoms (eg, unstable angina, significant resting ST -segment displacements, BP drop >20 mm Hg during episodes failure Recent thrombi (eg, from thrombophlebitis) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (systolic >200 mm Hg or diastolic >110 mm Hg) Uncontrolled diabetes Recent heart infections or inflammation (endocarditis, m yocarditis, or pericarditis) Acute systemic illness or fev er Acute metabolic problems Physical problems that prohibit ex ercise Medically supervised ex ercise can be started for most other cardiac patients, including those who are stable following an MI, a coronary reperfusion procedure, or a heart transplant. Structured Exercise R ehabilitation To man y people, cardiac rehabilitation is synon ymous with post heart attack ex ercise progr ams. The ex ercise component of cardiac rehabilitation reconditions a patient 's musculosk eletal and cardio vascular systems as well as strengthening the heart. Reconditioning begins in the hospital. Supervised progr ams then continue for man y months. The final goal is for the patient to dev elop an independent ex ercise plan that will last for y ears and become a part of his lifest yle. Phase I: In the Hospital Exercise rehabilitation can begin as soon as patients are medically stable. Breathing exercises and leg ex ercises get patients to use their muscles, and these ex ercises help to re-establish the patient 's confidence that it will be safe to become activ e again. As the patient heals, assisted w alking and light ph ysical ther apy can be added. By da y four , patients are usually able to w alk for 5 to 10 minutes in the corridors 3 to 4 times/da y. Phase II: After Discharge Following discharge from the coronary care unit, a reconditioning progr am is begun. This usually includes ha ving the patient w alk indoors on a lev el floor at a speed that does not raise the patient 's pulse >20 beats/minute abo ve its resting r ate. P atients should be reassured that they ma y fatigue easily , which is normal after a cardiac ev ent.Over 4 to 6 weeks, patients who are reco vering well should be encour aged to increase gradually the total distance they w alk until they are w alking a total of 1 to 3 miles/da y. Patients are ask ed to k eep a diary of their daily ex ercise and the occurrences of an y problems, and the ph ysical ther apist checks the diary regularly . Phase III: Supervised Exercise P rogram When they ha ve been medically cleared b y their ph ysician, patients can begin a 6- to 12- month progr am of regular ex ercise. Often, the ph ysician will perform a symptom-limited stress test to establish the patient 's initial ex ercise capacit y for the ex ercise progr am. One commonly followed rehabilitation plan offers supervised ex ercise progr ams in 8- week sessions of 2 to 5 classes per week. The intensit y of ex ercise is increased slowly o ver the sessions. The main cardiac rehabilitation ex ercises are aerobic (w alking on treadmills, stationary bicycling) and the intensit y of ex ercise is limited b y the patient 's heart r ate or feeling of fatigue (perceiv ed ex ertion). Ex ercising to 60% to 75% of their maximum heart r ate is a typical goal for cardiac patients. A rough calculation of maximum heart r ate is 220 minus the patient 's age. Those on beta block ers ma y not be able to reach the maximum heart rate. Each session begins with 5 to 15 minutes of gentle ex ercise to decrease peripher al vascular resistance. P atients then undertak e 5 to 30 minutes of aerobic ex ercise. On their physician' s advice, some patients should ha ve ECG monitoring during the ex ercises. Classes end with a 10-minute cool down period. Phase IV: Continued Independent Exercisin g The effects of ex ercise progr ams will fade unless patients continue to ex ercise regularly . Some patients ha ve the self -discipline to stick to a lifelong independent ex ercise regimen. Many patients are more successful when they enroll in structured ex ercise progr ams, which can be found at communit y or health centers in most cities. After the formal cardiac rehabilitation progr am ends and the patient is ex ercising under self -direction, ph ysicians should check on the patient 's lifest yle at each medical visit and encour age remaining active and continuing a health y diet plan. Resuming Normal Daily ActivitiesThe goal of cardiac rehabilitation is to enable patients to resume a normal life. P atients can be fearful after a heart attack, and they will need specific advice as to how much daily exercise they should attempt and when to return to sexual activities, although they ma y hesitate to ask. Ph ysicians should introduce the subject and offer a simple guide: one common rule is that people can resume sexual activities when they can w alk up and down two flights of stairs without an y cardiac symptoms. Patients should w ait to resume driving a car for 4 weeks after an MI and 6 weeks after heart surgery . As they ease into driving independence, patients should begin b y driving with a companion and a void long trips or hea vy traffic (Da vis, 2008). Psychological and Emotional Help Patients who worry about suffering another serious cardiac ischemic ev ent can feel overwhelmed, and they often need help making realistic decisions about their lifest yles. Many patients become o verly timid, anxious, or depressed. Some patients den y the seriousness of their heart disease. Other patients become angry . Few patients are able to manage these emotions without help . Physicians should be proactiv e by probing for clues that their patient might be suffering emotional or psychological distress. Because unapparent emotional and psy chological problems can become disabling, all patients should be offered the opportunit y to talk with a mental health professional (Antman et al. , 2008). So what happened to Mr . Hansen? After stabilization from his angina and double stent placement, he took cardiac rehabilitation seriously to prev ent an acute coronary episode and full m yocardial infarction. The angiogr am showed he had no permanent m yocardial tissue damage and w as very lucky. He began to lose weight with the help of his wife, who w anted to lose her pregnancy weight. He joined a gym and lost 40 pounds. His blood pressure lowered to normal lev els, his cholesterol lev els decreased, and his HDL w as 60 mg/dL. He ultimately r an a sprint triathlon! Mr. Hansen continued to follow up with his cardiologist annually for lab tests to measure liver function and gener al health. He w as fully adherent to medication management of statins, antih ypertensiv es and antiplatelets. He dev eloped a chronic cough from an ACE inhibitor and his medications were readjusted to reduce the side effect. He learned meditation and stress management str ategies.Every sev eral years Mr . Hansen repeat a treadmill stress test and he has an angiogr am every fiv e years, which has resulted in no manifestations of progressiv e CAD . He and his wife went on to ha ve another bab y and both learned that the price for good health must be paid in health y living choices da y by day.

After a few sessions of counseling for patients and their partners.B. When they can w alk up and down two flights of stairs without cardiac symptoms.C. In 4 to 8 da ys for men and 6 to 10 da ys for women. D.When a person' s epicardial heart arteries contain significant atherosclerosis, the condition is called coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is the number one killer of Americans, accounting for 1 of ev ery 4 deaths. Patients with CAD can be asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, howev er, it often produces angina pectoris. Angina pectoris, or simply angina, is the chest discomfort caused by ischemic heart muscle. The feeling of angina is t ypically described as a substernal pressure, tightness, hea viness, or suffocation r ather than as pain; sometimes, the discomfort of angina is felt in an arm, a shoulder , the neck, or the ja w. Instead of angina, patients ma y experience anginal equiv alents, such as shortness of breath or fatigue that follow a pattern t ypical of angina. Angina that appears at a predictable lev el of ex ercise and that is reliev ed by rest or nitrogly cerin is a char acteristic of the form of CAD called stable angina. When the angina becomes unpredictable, the disease has mo ved to a form called unstable angina. Brief (<10 minutes) angina that is reliev ed by rest usually indicates an ischemic episode without significant heart damage. Extended angina (>20 minutes) usually indicates an MI, which means that some heart muscle has died (m yocardial necrosis). Acute Complications of CAD Unstable angina can present as an acute coronary syndrome. An acute coronary syndrome is an episode of angina that is unusually sev ere, that is not reliev ed by rest or nitrogly cerin, or that lasts >20 minutes. An acute coronary syndrome signals heart ischemia that ma y be sev ere enough to cause an MI, and a patient with an acute coronary syndrome should immediately be tak en to an emergency department. The damage done b y major heart ischemia can be reduced significantly if the blood supply to the heart is restored b y cardiac reperfusion ther apy within about an hour . A more modest reco very of ischemic muscle can be achiev ed by reperfusion ther apies done between 2 and 12 hours after the beginning of an MI. The two forms of immediate reperfusion ther apy are percutaneous coronary interv entions (angioplast y with or without stenting) and IV injections of fibrinolytic agents. The acute coronary syndrome patients who are most lik ely to benefit from an aggressiv e reopening of the obstructed coronary arteries are those in whom the ischemia affects a large region of muscle or in whom an entire cross section of heart w all has become ischemic (tr ansmur al ischemia).Blood tests and ECGs are used to identif y candidates for reperfusion. The appear ance of cardiac biomark ers (eg, cardiac troponins) in the bloodstream is a reliable sign of an MI. The appear ance of elev ations in the ST -segment of the patient 's ECG w aveform suggests that the area of the infarction is large or tr ansmur al. Together , these results indicate that immediate reperfusion ther apy would be appropriate. A systematic checklist for managing an acute coronary syndrome includes: Patients with worrisome chest discomfort should be tak en to an emergency department immediately . After being stabiliz ed, patients should chew 162 to 325 mg aspirin, blood tests for cardiac biomark ers should be analyz ed, and ECGs ev aluated. P atients with ECG indicating an acute ST -elevation m yocardial infarction (STEMI) are candidates for immediate reperfusion ther apy. All patients with a possible acute coronary syndrome should ha ve pain relief (usually , nitrogly cerine, with or without morphine). P atients with acute coronary syndromes are given a beta block er, and patients with heart failure ma y receiv e an ACE inhibitor . A combination of antiplatelet/anticoagulant ther apy and cardiac monitoring is the next step for those acute coronary syndrome patients who will not ha ve reperfusion therapy. Patients with no elev ation of their cardiac biomark ers and with a normal or nearly normal ECG should be treated with sublingual nitrogly cerin. Depending on the circumstances, morphine and or al beta block ers might also be administered. If the heart symptoms resolv e and the patient impro ves, continued treatment with antiplatelet medications is considered. Begin (or continue) patients on a cardiac rehabilitation progr am. (Br ady et al. , 2009) Management of CAD Coronary artery disease will alw ays benefit from ther apeutic lifest yle changes that can slow, stop , or occasionally rev erse atherosclerosis. These lifest yle changes include a low - fat/high-fiber diet, weight loss, increased ph ysical activit y, and smoking cessation. Management of CAD also includes controlling problematic co-existing disorders. Blood lipids should be k ept in safe r anges: LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl (<70 mg/dl in patients with artery disease) Triglycerides <150 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol >40 mg/dl in men and >50 mg/dl in womenBlood pressure lower than systolic 140 mm Hg and diastolic 90 mm Hg Lower pressures are better , and a reduction to a systolic pressure <130 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure <80 mm Hg is often advised. Angina indicates heart ischemia. T ypical angina can be reliev ed by rest and b y sublingual nitrogly cerin tablets. P atients with stable angina can often a void heart symptoms b y slowing the r ate at which they do their normal daily activities. When certain una voidable activities cause angina, the angina can be reduced b y taking a sublingual nitrogly cerin tablet 5 minutes before the stressful activit y. A systematic checklist for managing CAD includes: Institute a proph ylactic drug regimen of nitrogly cerin, beta block ers, aspirin and, when needed, ACE inhibitors. Ask the patient to k eep a record of symptom triggers, symptom details, and the success or failure of symptom reliev ers. Consider coronary angiogr aphy if symptoms interfere with the patient 's daily activities. Cardiac Rehabilitation Long-term treatment for patients who ha ve had an acute coronary syndrome is called secondary prev ention, or cardiac rehabilitation. The goal of cardiac rehabilitation is to reduce the patient 's chances of another acute coronary syndrome and to strengthen the cardio vascular system so the patient can resume normal daily activities. Cardiac rehabilitation attempts to reduce the same atherosclerotic risks that are the subjects of primary treatment. Similar lifest yle changes and medications are recommended for rehabilitation and for primary treatment, although cardiac rehabilitation usually includes a more aggressiv e antithrombotic drug regimen. The restrengthening component of cardiac rehabilitation consists of a gr adually increasing exercise progr am that is initially supervised. By 6 months to 1 y ear, the supervised progr am should ev olve into a lifetime of patient -directed regular ex ercise, along with weight w atching and health y eating.
