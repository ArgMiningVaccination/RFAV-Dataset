If you read the headline for this blog post and got really excited, you're not alone. Chiropractic care can definitely help with the flu, and as a result, more and more of our patients are turning to Brain-Body Connection Chiropractic for relief. Chiropractic is a natural immune booster. With each adjustment, we are not only supporting the central nervous system through proper spinal function and alignment, but we are stimulating and strengthening the immune system. Your immune system is your body's ultimate defense mechanism, and the goal is to keep it working at its absolute best. By removing nerve interferences and stressors that can drag it down while also eating healthy, boosting vitamin intake, and drinking lots of fluids, your body is more equipped to fend off a slew of nasty viruses \u2014 including the cold and flu. Being that flu season is in full swing until at least February, a trip to the chiropractor is a great place to start. In fact, recent studies are showing it to be more effective than turning to over-the-counter medications and even the flu shot. According to WebMD, a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the overall effectiveness of last season's flu vaccine was only 29% because it didn't protect against a flu virus that appeared later in the season. Chiropractic care helps with the flu When a patient comes in to see us for an adjustment when they are sick, our process is first to do cranial flicks to relieve tension followed by lymphatic massages all around your face, neck, upper chest, and under your arms. After that, we adjust your neck. Once we do that, most patients find that their bodies begin to clear whatever sickness they are facing. Other natural options to stimulate your immune system beyond chiropractic is upping your Vitamin C intake, using Zinc tables, and taking Oil of Oreganol. Oil of Oreganol can help with killing viruses. Call Brain-Body Connection Chiropractic today We urge you and your family to start seeing a chiropractor regularly.
