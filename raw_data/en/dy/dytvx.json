Acosta, MD Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, AAMC The AAMC sent a call to action to academic medicine in June 2020 to make a stand against racism in medicine and hate in all its forms as a result of the George Floyd murder, the BLM protests, and the damaging impact that the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare in our most vulnerable communities. We stated that no longer could we afford to be bystanders, and silence was no longer an option. In academic medicine we have a voice and leadership matters. Using the power and privilege we have as medical educators and health professionals it's time to make the necessary system-based changes needed to address the subtle and not -so-subtle manifestations of racism in medical education. In this session we'll identify how structural racism manifests and discuss a framework to address structural racism and other work that the AAMC is preparing to assist medical educators in this difficult but necessary work. David A. Acosta, MD, provides strategic vision and leadership for the AAMC's diversity and inclusion activities across the medical education community, and leads the association's Diversity Policy and Programs unit. Dr. Acosta, a family medicine physician, joined the AAMC from the University of California (UC), Davis School of Medicine where he served as senior associate dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion and associate vice chancellor for diversity and inclusion and chief diversity officer for UC Davis Health System. He previously served as the first chief diversity officer at the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine (SoM), where he established the Center for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, and was the founder of the UW SoM Center for Cultural Proficiency in Medical Education. Dr. Acosta earned his bachelor's degree in biology from Loyola University and his medical degree from the UC, Irvine, School of Medicine. He completed his residency training at Community Hospital of Sonoma County in Santa Rosa, Calif., an affiliate of UC San Francisco School of Medicine, and a faculty development fellowship at the UW Department of Family Medicine. 6 Medical Education Conference Certificate Program (MedEd Certificate Program within the IME Conference) Conference participants are being given the opportunity to earn a Certificate of Achievement through participation in a set of specially-designed workshops. The Department of Medical Education at the Keck School of Medicine of USC offers six interactive workshops each year at IME. The workshop activities are designed to maximize the transfer of knowledge and skills from the workshop setting directly to each participant's work setting. All registered conference participants can attend any of these workshops. The workshops are aimed at providing participants with the principles and essential skills needed by educators within key roles in undergraduate and graduate medical education settings: teacher, leader, scholar, and mentor. Below is the three-step process to earn your IME Conference Certificate of Achievement. Step 1: Register online at the link below so that we can track your participat ion.

More than just another quality improvement strategy, DBR uses the design process to help researchers dig deeply into theory, practice, and implementation to uncover new insights into the social psychology of learning. In this workshop, learners will learn about the methodology as well as its immediate relevance to medical education, health justice education, and online learning. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Design -based Research (DBR) is a research approach that co mbines qualitative, quantitative, and design methods to support recursive and iterative cycles of investigation in any learning environment. In contrast to action research, DBR's systematic cycles of design produce both innovative learning experiences and generalizable, scholarly research on education products, practices, socio- cultural dimensions of learning, and the design process itself. DBR also builds on the work of educational design research (EDR) by centering community and learner stakeholders in th e design of their own learning. The Design -based Research in Medical Education (DBR -ME) model is based on a review of research studies[3] , and highlights features that are most r elevant to medical educators. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : Describe the key features and purpose of Design -based Research Articulate the differences between action research, PDSA, and DBR Simulate using the DBR -ME process to plan and develop a research project INTENDED PARTICIPANTS : This workshop is geared towards medical educato rs and instructional designers who are interested in developing research- based curricula at their home institutions. A familiarity with social science research traditions (qualitive or quantitative) would be beneficial, but no advanced knowledge is needed. METHODS : The interactive portions of the session will take the form of a 'worked example' discussion, where the audience will be presented with a real project that we are developing, and must make choices about how to use the DBR -ME process to develop th e project. After small- group discussions, groups will report their solution back to the large group, and the instructor will show them his solution. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 5 minutes - Ice-breaker and orientation to the session 20 minutes - What is DBR, and Ho w Can it Serve MedEd?. 35 minutes - Activity: Worked Example of DBR in MedEd 15 minutes - Discussion, Additional Questions, and Resources TAKE HOME TOOLS Learners will receive a 'take- home assignment' that will help them to develop their own Conjecture Maps, a key tool for developing DBR- ME projects. 22Thursday, 2/18/2021, 7:30 - 8:45 am Conference Workshop A Spoonful of Kindness: Leading and Coaching Others Through Self -Compassion (3); Julie G. Nyquist, PhD (3) (1) University of Florida College of Medicine, Family Medicine Residency Program; (2) USC Keck Family Medicine; (3) Keck School of Medicine of USC Workshop Description: Has making a mistake or failing to achieve a goal ever gotten you down? Why do some people seem to bounce back better than others? One answer is self -compassion; using self- kindness, common humanity and mindfulness to free oneself to take resilient action. Through real -life examples, participants will practice how they would coach a learner (or themselves) to be more self - compassionate when struggling or facing a challenge. Participa nts should complete an online survey prior to the session. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Coaching in medical education is a learner -driven relationship where faculty foster the development of life-long learning skills with their learners(1). The research on self- compassion was begun by Kristen Neff and has now evolved to include its usage with in medical education. Utilizin g the skills of self -compassion in coaching helps learners trust themselves to be self -understanding and self -kind as they work on achieving improvement goals. Self -compassion has three elements; self -kindness to versus self - judgment, feeling part of common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over -identification with the error/disappointment/failure(2). Learners with lower levels of self -compassion tend to avoid situations where they might make a mistake or fail. Those with higher levels embra ce challenges to learn new skills to improve performance and are better able to cope with times of academic failure (3,4,5). Faculty can increase academic engagement and lower risk of burnout by teaching learners how to manage their feelings around failure(6). This is accomplished by coaching learners to reframe difficulties and challenges as opportunities for learning while supporting their effort on the journey of development (2). LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : 1: Describe the positive and negative facets of self-compassion 2: Use self -compassion as motivation for personal learning and growth 3: Use the coaching relationship to develop self -compassion skills in learners and colleagues INTENDEDN PARTICIPANTS: This workshop is designed to improve skills of s elf-compassion in those at all career levels. It is applicable to students, residents, faculty and administrators. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 1. (20 minutes): Discuss self -compassion concepts (PowerPoint), review their survey results (link provided). Guide participants through an example of how to use self -compassion in a challenging situation through a 3 -step process to reframe without blame. 2. (15 minutes): Interactive sharing in dyads/triads of personal moments of self -judgement, isolation or over-identification with mistakes and failures, discuss how to guide each other to reframe without blame, and video testimonial of a medical student's experience with self -compassion. 3. (15 minutes): Review the key elements of coachin g, practice in dyads how each pair might they coach learners (two scenarios - one failure, one medical error) to reframe 4. ( 20 minutes): Open discussion about the skills needed to coach learners in self -compassion. REFERENCES: 1) Deiorio NM, Camey PA et al. C oaching: a new model for academic and career achievement.

Participants will learn how to conduct small group flipped classroom sessions that compare pre -entrustable (robotic thinking) associated behaviors with entrustable associated behaviors (integrative thinking). A summary discussion will examine how this can improve academic performance ea rly while providing faster learning during clinical training. Detailed Plan : RATIONALE: In order for instruction to be effective, educators rely on the thinking skills of each learner. Underperforming learners often lack the integrative thinking skills that produce higher order learning leaving them unprepared for complex licen sure-level questions. Fear of adopting new ways of thinking also creates a motivation problem these students to learn more effective skills. However, a new assessment concept, the Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) serves the dual purpose of motiva tion and instruction for developing learning skills. Since thinking always precedes action, the thinking that precedes clinical behavior determines entrustability. EPA Thinking de picts the thinking that determines entrustable behavior and, importantly, it also describes preclinical learning skills. A close inspection of the behavioral description and the vignette that accompany each EPA in the AAMC CEPA Faculty and Learner's Guide reveals a consistency in the underlying thinking. The pre -entrustable student consistently resorts to robotic, memorized thinking. Thus, pre -entrustable thinking will always produce pre- entrustable behaviors. Likewise, entrustable thinking which is anticipatory and integrative will always precede each EPA behavior. Integrative EPA thinking skills can be identified and taught in the first year of medical school prior to the training in clinical application by helping the students identify and compare their o wn thinking with pre -entrustable thinking and EPA thinking. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: In this workshop, either basic science or clinical educators will: 1. Learn to use the guiding questions that are supplied in the online, freely accessible modules to take a MS1 small groups deeper into understanding how their own learning impact s their future thinking in the clinic. 2. Learn to integrate suggestions for using the online Expert Skills Program for developing EPA thinking into the group session. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Basic science or clinical educators ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 15 minutes - Introduce the general concept and online syllabus (non -credit elective, 1 hour per month) and display the materials. 30 minutes - Complete discussion of an EPA module in flipped classroom mode. Breakout groups will summarize their experience, questions and concerns. 15 minutes - Summarize findings of each breakout group for reconvened whole group. 30 minutes - Wrap up, planning for interaction and use of online course materials, proposal for collaborative implementation.

Kim, MD, MACM; Joan Noelker, MD, MACM; Collyn T. Murray, MD, MACM Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine Workshop Description : Anxious about presentations? Searching for ways to improve your lecture? The formal lecture is a teachable skill. This workshop will cover mistakes and pitfalls commonly found in didactic presentations while providing strategies to avoid them. Learn how to effectively present your message and actively engage your learner through preparation, storytelling, and slide design. Finally, this workshop will address special considerations in presenting in a virtual environment (i.e. how to use Zoom). Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The formal lecture is equipped to provide a substantial amount of information to a passive learner. This time-honored technique has withstood much ridicule, famously in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" or in the notorious phrase, \"Death -by-Powerpoint.\" Despite its di sadvantages, it is still utilized heavily in many teaching environments and conference settings. This workshop will provide learners with the tools to leverage the advantages of this teaching method , actively engage lecture participants, and utilize techno logy in content delivery. The workshop will focus primarily on PowerPoint and keynote presentation formats, but the teaching points could be comparable with other presentation formats/tools as well. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: By the end of this worksho p participants will be able to: 1. Describe how to plan a didactic lecture through storytelling and proper planning 2. Recognize common pitfalls in slide design and devise solutions to avoid them 3. Describe common pitfalls in lecture delivery and devise solutio ns to excel as a speaker. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: IME participants of any training level. Appropriate for novice speakers or those with some speaking/lecturing experience who would like to improve their skills. Participants should bring their own laptops along with one of their personal presentations (maybe one they have already delivered, or one that they are currently developing.) ACTIVITY TIMELINE: Time in minutes 0-10: Intro/Examples - Two exemplar presentations on design and storytelling 10-30: Story Arcs - How to plan a lecture, create a story arc, and develop a unifying theme 30-50: Slide Design - Common mistakes made in slide design and how to avoid them. How to leverage technology and multimedia to your advantage 50-60: Delivery - Common mi stakes in lecture delivery and how to avoid them. 60-75: Small Group 1 - Divide into small pairs, learners will present 5 minutes of their own lecture, 5 -10 minutes to receive feedback from their partner utilizing tools just pro vided. 75-90: Small Group 2 - Same session as above after trading pairs, using a different presentation from another group member. TAKE HOME TOOLS: No specific tools. Group will be given presenters' contact information if specific questions arise after the workshop. 27Thursday, 2/18/2021, 9:00 - 10:15 am MedEd Certificate Workshop Designing a Virtual OSCE Alan Liu, MD; Kathryn Schaivone, MPA; Win May, MD, PhD, FRCP Keck School of Medicine of USC Workshop Description : During the COVID- 19 pandemic, most medical school programs have either reduced or ceased all in -person activities. It can be challenging to convert in -person Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs) \u2014 used to assess history taking, data gathering, and physical examination of the patient, as well as medical knowl edge, communication and patient interaction skills \u2014 to an online format. Learners must learn not only to interact with standardized patients virtually but also become conversant with the technology. Tra nsitioning from in- person to virtual OSCEs using an online platform like Zoom requires extensive collaboration. In our workshop, we will discuss design strategies, preparation, implementation, and evaluation that will allow learners to achieve the identified goals and objectives with this new modality. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Medical education continues to move towards a holistic assessment approach with emphasis on competency standards as described by the Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are an effective asses sment tool of learners in terms of history taking, data gathering, and physical examination of the patient. In addition to medical knowledge, communication and patient interaction skills are also assessed. With the COVID -19 pandemic, most medical school p rograms have either reduced or ceased all in -person activities. It can be challenging to convert in -person OSCEs to an online format since learners must learn not only to interact with standardized patients virtually but also become conversant with the technology. In addition, standardized patients will also need to be trained virtually. Transitioning from in -person to virtual OSCEs using Zoom (or a different platform) is feasible and requires extensive collaboration. In our workshop, we will discuss design strategies, preparation, implementation, and evaluation that will allow learners to achieve the identified goals and objectives with this new modality. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: At the end of the workshop, you will be able to: 1. Discuss some principles in designing a virtual OSCE. 2. Identify barriers to a successful virtual OSCE. 3. Appraise logistics needed to implement virtual OSCE. 4. Obtain feedback from all stakeholders. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Clinical educators from all healthcare professions in undergraduate and post graduate medical education with current or future roles in clinical assessment. METHODS: We will be using short didactics, large and small group discussions ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 5 minutes: Introduction, Disclosures, R eview of Learning Objectives 15 minutes: Short presentation highlighting key steps in designing a virtual OSCE with facilitators 30 minutes: Use two OSCE cases in breakout rooms to draft a plan 20 minutes: Report out and discussion in larg e group 5 minutes: Wrap -up TOTAL: 75 minutes 28TAKE HOME TOOLS: 1.

When creating an engaging educational session, it is helpful to utilize the ASCI model. However, many of these techniques are more difficult to use in a virtual environment. In this workshop, the participants will determine which ASCI techniques can be adapted in the virtual learning environment (VLE) and learn how to use the use the techniques in the VLE (i.e. Zoom). Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The medical education community has needed to rapidly adapt from in -person education to virtual education due to COVID- 19. Many educators have tried to adapt their previous in -person teaching sessions to the virtual format with multiple barriers encounte red. When creating an engaging educational session, it is helpful to utilize the ASCI engagement model (attention grabbers, skill builders, catalysts and intensifiers) to teach in the cognitive or affective domain. However, not all techniques in the ASCI model can be easily adapted for the virtual learning environment. For instance, the commonly used Think -Pair-Share technique is much more difficult to implement virtually. In this worksh op, the participants will determine which ASCI techniques can be adapted in the virtual learning environment, learn how to use the ASCI techniques in Zoom, and begin to re -build a lecture they have previously given in-person to be delivered virtually. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: At the end of this workshop, participants wil l better be able to: a. Review how ASCI techniques can be used to improve learner engagement in an educational session b. Determine which ASCI techniques can best be adapted for the virtual learning environment c. Facilitate a technique in each of the ASCI catego ries in the virtual learning environment d. Adapt an in -person session to become an engaging session delivered virtuall y INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Educators for all levels of learners who have had to create or adapt sessions to be given through a virtual learning platform. METHODS: We have created an engaging, interactive workshop made for a virtual platform (such as Zo om). We will start the workshop by utilizing an attention -grabber technique that has been adapted for the virtual learning environment (VLE ). We will then have a short didactic to review the ASCI domains and techniques commonly used for in -person teaching environments. Next we will utilize breakout rooms (each room will be assigned to one of the ASCI domains) to determine which ASCI technique s can and should be adapted for the VLE. This will also highlight how \"Think -Pair-Share\" can be adopted in the virtua l learning environment. After 20 minutes in the breakout rooms, we will reconvene as a large group, and a member of the each breakout room will share their groups thoughts. In real -time, using the \"whiteboard\" function of the VLE (or a shared google docume nt), we will re- create the table of ASCI techniques adapted for the VLE. The large group will then be brought back into their breakout room s, and tasked with creating a short example of an ASCI technique adapted for the VLE. The breakout rooms will be moderated by one of the workshop leaders. We will then reconvene as a large group, and each breakout room will share their examples. As a conclusion, we will ask each participant to write a \"takeaway\" into a shared google document, which will be followed up on by the moderators 1 month after the workshop. 30 TAKE HOME TOOLS: Finally, as homework, we will ask the participants to re -outline a teaching session they previously facilitated in- person and adapt it for the virtual learning environment using the newly re created ASCI techniques. 31Thursday, 2/18/2021, 9:00 - 10:15 am Conference Workshop The Educator's Guide to Emotional Intelligence Velyn Julie G. PhD (3) (1) Keck School of Medicine of USC; (2) University of Florida College of Medicine; (3) Keck School of Medicine of USC Workshop Description: Emotional intelligence matters j ust as much as intellectual intelligence, maybe even more. This session will be an introduction to the key elements and conceptual frameworks of emotional intelligence (EI). Participants will review the spectrum of emotions before delving into how EI can b e utilized to enhance learning environments, teaching and leadership skills and be catalysts for personal and professional development. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The role of emotional intelligence in higher leadership a nd management has been well supported in industries such as business and tech but is still evolving in education and academic medicine. As medicine becomes more complex and medical training more demanding, the need for emotional intelligence training on all levels becomes more apparent(1) . Goleman, a leading emotional intelligence expert, breaks down emotional intelligence into four domains: self- awareness, self -management, social awareness and relationship management(2). These four domains separately show up in both undergraduate and graduate medical education milestones and competencies in varying ways and like other professionalism and communication skills, the expectation is that educators will model and teach learners what they need to know(1). However, one area often missing in faculty development but crucial in building effective educators is the skill set of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence development efforts have been showed to increase personal and professional effectiveness, organizational productivity and even effe ctive teaching(1,3). Thankfully, studies have also shown that emotional intelligence can be developed at any age(3,4). LEARNING OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : On completion of this session, the participants should be able to: 1. Describe Goleman's four domains of Emoti onal Intelligence 2. Summarize the impact that emotional intelligence has on learning environments and leadership 3. Generate the first steps of a personal action plan to improve their own emotional intelligence INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: This workshop is designed for students, faculty and administrators at all levels of medical education. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: Segment 1 ( 15 minutes): Attention grabber exercise: Emotional identification game. Participants will play a game in small groups where they label the emotion s that they see displayed in pictures. They will be introduced to a framework for understanding an d expanding their emotional vocabulary. Segment 2(15 minutes): PowerPoint presentation on the four domains of emotional intelligence and benefits of emotiona l intelligence in education and leadership. Segment 3 (20 minutes): Self -assessment of emotional intelligence. Participants will use a free online tool to assess their current level of emotional intelligence and share with one participant their reaction t o their results. Segment 4 (20 minutes): Activity: \"Autopsy of a scenario\" - participants will analyze a scenario between a faculty member and a learner. In small groups they will identify issues of emotional intelligence and formulate coaching tips for b oth the faculty member and learner in the situation. Segment 5 (20 minutes) : Wrap up, questions and take- home challenge. Participants will be challenged with to identify one SMART goal regarding their own emotional intelligence development and create a first step toward achieving that goal. They will then share with one person their goal and receive encouraging feedback. 32REFERENCES: 1) Cherry, M Gemma, et al. \"Emotional Intelligence in Medical Education: a Critical Review.\" Medical Education, vol. 48, no. 5 , Sept. 2014, pp. 468 -478. 2) Goleman, Daniel, et al.

This workshop will discuss need and introduce coaching concepts and provide an outline to practice during the workshop and later at your home institution if suitable. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Atul Gawande has made peer coaching popular with his own example to improve efficiency and better his patient outcomes by using a coach(1). Currently in academic medicine, peer coaching represents a shift from traditional advising and me ntoring. It has been utilized to improve physician efficiency as well as reduce physician burnout(2). Data from academic institutions show that dedicated workshops and repeated peer coaching interventions may be needed to derive maximal benefit from this f orm of coaching(3). LEARNING OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : 1. Discuss various reasons for burnout and stress in academic medicine 2. Describe the application of peer coaching to improve efficiency and reduce physician burnout 3. Practice skills of listening and providing peer feedback on simulated scen arios of academic physicians doing clinical rounds INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Educators, cl inicians and administrators involved in faculty and curriculum development with an interest in wellbeing and professional development of junior faculty. METHODS: This workshop will use a variety of methods including brief formal presentations, large and small group activities with debriefing utilizing a worksheet. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 1-10 minutes: introductions 10-30 minutes: Presentation on reasons for stress and burnout, peer coaching concepts 30-50 minutes: Large group review of a scenario of rounds by a clinician to identify exemplary practices and challenges that can be improved 50-70 minutes: Small groups review of two scenarios of bedside rounds by a clinician to practice peer coaching 70-85 minutes: Debriefing together from two groups 85-90 minutes: Take away messages REFERENCES: 1) Atul Gwande.

Drawing on our previous Health Systems Science curr iculum, a long -standing thread in Humanities, Ethics/Economics, Arts and the Law (HEAL) and our course in Professionalism and the Practice of Medicine, we are integrating and expanding topics covered in these areas to foreground Health Justice and Systems of Care, as a key component in learning how to become a physician -citizen- scholar. We will w alk participants through the process of conceptualizing a curriculum to gathering institutional and instructional resources needed to carry out the curriculum to more granular approaches to designing individual sessions. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE : The pe rsistence of health inequities in the United States leads to poor outcomes for millions of patients in marginalized groups. Systemic racism, poverty and other forms of marginalization that exist in U.S. society are also embedded in the health care system a nd in medical education. Over the past several years medical schools, the AAMC and the AMA have acknowledged the need for medical education to take seriously the social determinants of health that lead to inequities and to become champions of health justic e.

Nyquist, PhD (4) (1) University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; (2) University of Colorado School of Medicine; (3) University of Florida College of Medicine; (4) Keck School of Medicine of USC Workshop Description : Coaching in medical education is a learner driven process that leads to increased utilization of a learners' skills and resources. Coaching is used to facilitate feedback and to enhance performance and learner outcomes. Helping learners develop and foster a growth mindset can encourage curiosity and be an important aspect of well- being. Utilizing gri t helps learners move forward beyond barriers. Faculty can encourage these skills to help set the path for lifelong learning and development. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: A high percentage of learners struggle with burnout and/or lower well -being at some point in residency. [1,2] Research has shown that a growth mindset allows people to navigate stress and challenges better and may lead to higher levels of well -being.[3] In addition, grit can encourage self- regulation to help push past barriers or challenges when they occur.[4] Fostering a growth mindset and grit can help encourage curiosity and self -directed learning and can set the framework for life -long leaning and devel opment.[3,4] This faculty development session will provide faculty with coaching skil ls to encourage growth mindset and grit in learners. Participants will walk away with the skills to coach learners. In addition, participants will be able to guide learner s to get gritty (persevere beyond barriers) to accomplish learning plans. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : 1. Utilize growth mindset coaching techniques to help foster growth and development of learners. 2. Utilize \"yet\" and \"not yet\" to motivate learners and buil d confidence to create a plan to meet their goals. 3. Help learners get gritty and pers evere beyond barriers to better accomplish their goals. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS : All participants interested in learning growth mindset and \"grit\" coaching techniques to to support medical learners' individual self knowledge, goal setting, and work -life balance. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: The 60 minute faculty development session will consist of: Section 1: Introduction to mindset (paired activity to share a fixed mindset trigger and practice yet and not yet to move toward a growth mindset) Section 2: Introduc tion to grit- example stories of struggling learners and how they were guided to push past barriers (followed by interactive dyad/triad on sharing their stories of learners overcoming barriers) Section 3: Key hints to coach in the moment and across time Section 4: Open discussion, conclusion and wrap up Timeline: 01-05: Review of objectives and introduction of presenters. 06-15: Introduction to mindset.

Participants will become familiar with equity, disparities, structural determinants of health and cultural humility principles. They will participate in self -reflective exercises and self -assessments. The session will include inspirational video clips and interactive group activity. Detailed Plan: RATIONAL E: Health inequities are rooted in social injustices and social determinants of health that make some populations more vulnerable to poor health. Allostatic load because of health inequities leads to health risky behaviors, with immune, metabolic and card iovascular disorders leading to disease. Taking care of and communicating effectively with patients and families across socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds requires cultural humility. Cultural humility is a lifelong commitment to self -evaluation and sel f-critique, to redress the power imbalances in the patient -physician dynamic, and to develop mutually beneficial partnerships based on trust. This mini course using interactive and reflective activities will teach core principles of health inequities, and cultural humility. The participant will practice the adoption of another - person- orientation regarding cultural identity and cross- cultural care to provide quality healthcare and effectively communicate with diverse patients. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : At the end of this session, learners will be able to: 1. Explore oneself as a cultural human being 2. Discuss equity, equality and disparities including role of structural social determinates of health and allostatic load 3. Identify ways to address power imbalance and take a culturally humble stand in relationship with others INTENDED PARTICIPANTS : Faculty, residents, medical students, nurses, social workers, and community outreach workers . METHODS: Learners will be engaged directly to become familiar with several core equity and cultural humility principles and will incorporate self -reflective exercises an d self- assessments into teaching in real time. The session will split participants into groups and provide time for group work and demonstration. ACTIVITY TIMEL INE: 1. Pre-survey: Participants complete a short survey awareness and knowledge regarding Cultural Humility. This will provide baseline for the participants. 2. Interactive presentations on: a. Culture; Health Equities; Health Disparities; Social Determinants of Health; Allostatic load b. Competence vs. Humility, Cultural Humility Principles; Compassionate self -reflection; c.

Developing new educational content or repurposing pre -existing educational materials into Tweetorials empowers reade rs to engage in self -directed learning, while expanding and diversifying the author's learner communities. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: A tweetorial is a novel educational tool that leverages Twitter 's networking power to educate learners outside traditional outlets. Tweetorials are threads of tweets designed to teach a specific topic or a unique skill. Through interactive polls, images, and links to primary literature, tweetorials offer a self - directed approach to learning. This method disseminates up to date information free from constrictive review structures while enjoying the benefits of on -going peer -review. Through conversion and dissemination of educational content on social media, learners and educators can continue the conversation outside of the classroom or patient care settings. Pre-existing educational material such as lectures, handouts, or other didactic material may be repurposed into a tweetorial format covering basic science principles, clinical knowledge, or interpersonal skills. Educators can foster innovative connections and enjoy enhanced reach of teaching material. Although Twitter posts are limited by a character count, tweetorials may be used as pre or post reading activities to support learning. This asynchronous form of remote learning can transcend the medical education hierarchy. Learners can be involved in the process by helping to craft tweetorials. The process of curating learner- driven educational content empowers self -directed learning while sharing knowledge with the medical community. This further connects learner communities on Twitter that may otherwise remain isolat ed. Through an expanded reach of educational material, lifelong learners from all training levels can connect virtually to educate themselves, solve problems, or promote a shared mental model. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : - Review Tweetorial Definition - Discuss benefits of Tweetorials for Educating Learners - Create a Tweetorial INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Clinician Educators, Basic Science Educators, Students ACTIVITY TIMELINE (for 90 minutes) : 1.

Acosta, MD Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Association of American Medical Colleges The AAMC sent a call to action to academic medicine in June 2020 to make a stand against racism in medicine and hate in all its forms as a result of the George Floyd murder, the BLM protests, and the damaging impact that the COVID- 19 pandemic laid bare in our most vulnerable communities. We stated that no longer could we afford to be bystanders, and silence was no longer an option. In academic medicine we have a voice and leadership matters. Using the power and privilege we have a s medical educators and health professionals it's time to make the necessary system -based changes needed to address the subtle and not- so-subtle manifestations of racism in medical education. In this session we'll identify how structural racism manifests a nd discuss a framework to address structural racism and other work that the AAMC is preparing to assist medical educators in this difficult but necessary work. 43Thursday, 2/18/2021, 1:45 - 3:00 pm Presentations of Innovations 1: Undergraduate Health Professions Ed ucation Online Visual Learning Guide to Reduce Fear of Pelvic Examinations in Pre -Clerkship Medical Students Wo od, Elena (6). (1) Medical College of Georgia at A ugusta University; (2) University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine Problem Statement : The pelvic exam is well known to elicit fear and anxiety in the novice learner (1, 2). These emotions can be detrimental to learning for students (3). Rational e: Excessive fear and anxiety are shown to be detrimental to learning and performing for a first - time pelvic examination (2). Many studies have been conducted to reduce this fear and anxiety; however, no interventions have been unanimously acknowledged as the most optimal method to achieve these results (3). An innovative approach to the effective teaching of these procedural skills should be considered. Traditional resources for students learning the physical exam consist of either lengthy videos or textbook chapters. An interventional resource that is concise and allows students to interact more deeply with the course material was needed. Cognitive load theory suggests that good instructional design minimi zes extraneous sources of load which can minimize s tudents' stress in medical school. This study was designed to see if an innovative online visual learning guide on performing the female pelvic exam would reduce first -year medical student fear and anxiety of performing the exam. Methods: The multimedia o nline visual learning guide (eGuide) was created by a team of medical educators, OBGYN clerkship director and medical illustrator. The eGuide comprises references to anatomy and guides learners through correct techniques for performing the pelvic and breast physical exams (positioning, draping, equipment, step -by-step procedure technique). Students were given access to the eGuide as a resource to use or not use as they prepared for their scheduled in class female pelvic exam. Survey data was collected from first- year medical students (N=372) during the physical diagnosis course. Immediately after the in -class pre -briefing for the pelvic exam, students completed surveys about their use of the eGuide as well a s the Fear of Pelvic Examination Scale (F -PEXS), a demographics questionnaire, previous clinical experience (yes/no), and previously performed a pelvic exam (yes/no). The survey was optional; however, adequate time was given to all students to complete the survey before relocating to the simulation rooms to begin the pelvic exam. Results: Due to the ordinal and non -normal nature of the data, non -parametric tests were calculated. Mann -Whitney U tests (Wilcoxon two -sample tests) were calculated to examine di fferences in the Fear of Pelvic Examination Scale ( F-PEXS) for those who used e -guide vs. those who did not, those who had previous clinical experience vs. those who did not, and those who had done a pelvic exam vs. those who had not. Those who used the e -guide scored statistically significantly lower than those who did not (p=0.0312). Similarly, those who had done a pelvic exam scored statistically significantly lower than those who had not (p&lt;.0001). To account for potential confounding in those who ha d done a pelvic exam, Mann- Whitney U tests assessin g differences in F -PEXS total score among those who used e - guide vs. those who did not, in subjects that had not done a pelvic exam were calculated. In this cohort, those who used the e -guide scored statistically significantly lower on the total F -PEXS score (p=0.0062). Potential Impact : In this study we found that medical students appreciate compact and structural presentation of material. The multimedia eGuide can reduce students fear and anxiety of performing pelvic examinations in a similar way as prev ious pelvic exam experience.

Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA Problem Statement : Clinician beliefs about psychosocial aspects of medici ne correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely addressed in health professional education. Rationale: Research shows psychosocial factors, including patient attitudes, behaviors, and social factors, impact patient care outcomes and illness experience f or many medical conditions [1]. For clinicians to evaluate the impact psychosocial contexts have on patient health, clinicians must recognize the importance of these topics and be comfortable discussing them. Previous work explored how allied health professionals, including physicians, nurses, physician assistants (PAs), and trainees view the psychosocial aspects of medicine, but no study has compared psychosocial orientation among health professional students throughout their first year of training. Comfor t with incorporating psychosocial factors into medical encounters appears to be teachable, therefore, identifying early health professional students' comfort with addressing psychosocial factors during clinical encounters could guide training needs and future directions for enhancing patient- centered communication skills. Methods: This study examined first -year medical (MD), advanced practicing nursing (APRN), and physician associate (PA) students' perceptions toward the psychosocial aspects of healthcare before and after a required seven -month interprofessional longitudinal clinical experience course. These students completed a demographic survey at the study onset and the shortened Physicians Belief Scale (PBS)[2, 3], a measure of psychosocial orientation , at both timepoints. The PBS contains two subscales: Belief and Feeling (belief in importance of addressing psychosocial factors, e.g., \"I focus on organic disease because I cannot treat psychosocial problems\") and Burden (belief that addressing psychosoc ial factors is burdensome, e.g., \"Patients will become more dependent on me if I raise psychosocial concerns\"). Analysis of variance and multiv ariate regression were performed using SPSS. Results: Of 266 total students in the first year class, 260 complet ed the survey in September 2018 (T1); 140 in March 2019 (T2), 123 of whom were matched (47.3% of T1 sample). At baseline, 70% of participants were female, 60.4% were under 25 years old, and 14.6% identified as a race/ethnicity underrepresented in medicine. By program, 39.4% of MD students, 56.1% of PA students, and 50.8% of APRN students from the T1 sample completed the T2 survey. Across the thre e programs at T1, PA students (p&lt;0.05), male students (p&lt;0.001), and students younger than 25 years (p&lt;0 .05) believed it was less important to discuss psychosocial issues compared with their MD student, female, and older counterparts. In addition, compared with MD students and male students, respectively, APRN students (p&lt;0.001) and female students (p&lt; 0.01) felt that discussing psychosocial factors was less burdensome at T1. Male gender (p&lt;0.05) and being a PA student (p&lt;0.01) were asso ciated with negative changes in both subscales (e.g., viewing psychosocial issues as both less important than more burdensome) from T1 to T2 in multivariate analyses. Potential Impact : First- year MD, APRN, PA students who were female and older than 25 yea rs were more psychosocially oriented than their male and younger peers. PA students became less psychosocially or iented over time, warranting further investigation. Our findings could be useful to those teaching clinical and communication skills in health professional schools. References: 1) Schneiderman, N., R.C. McIntosh, and M.H.

Rationale: Research mentorship is critical towards supporting the development of scientific inquiry skills in medical students and ultimately propels innovation in a field (1). Further, the early presence of a research mentor is an important determinant in student specialty selection (2). While ear ly summer research programs have been shown to be particularly effective as educational experiences and recruitment tools (3), these potential benefits may be attenuated by the lack of on -site research opportunities during COVID- 19. Therefore, to preserve the benefits of early medical student summer research, faculty must develop innovative supplementary progr amming to increase engagement for remote learners. We sought to address this need through student -driven synchronous sessions and asynchronous tools to promote research productivity. Methods: We created a complementary support program for medical students completing a remote 10 - week research program during the summer between their first and second years of medical school. This included 1) a series of biweekly mentoring sessions, 2) a centralized repository of resources to encourage submission of research for presentation, and 3) a final research presentation via department - wide webcast. In the faculty -facilitated biweekly mentoring sessions, 2 -3 students would present on a rotating basis a synopsis of their research project, including any current ch allenges, followed by a group discussion to identify and share solutions and resources. Informal discussion is also allowed for discussion of radiology as a career and relationship- building with faculty and peers while working remotely. Asynchronous content, including instructions on applying for membership in radiology societies and a calendar of scientific meeting opportunities, was centralized through a learning management system (Canvas). At the end of the summer program, students delivered visual abstr act presentations of their research to the Department of Radiology via videoconferencing. Using a 7 -point Likert scale, we surveyed students before and after the summer program about their understanding of the training pathway and profession of radiology, self -assessed research skills, and interest in pursuing future research and radiology training. Pre and post -scores were analyzed using paired t -tests. Results : From pre to post- program, students rated themselves as more familiar with the specialty of radiology as a whole (+1.38, p=0.020) and with the training pathway to become a radiologist (+1.25, p=0.032). They also rated themselves as having greater expert ise in the field related to their research project (+1.88, p=0.004), searching for and reviewing l iterature (+1.00, p=0.007), specific research tools (+0.75, p=0.020), scientific writing (+1.13, p=0.015), and oral communication of research (+1.13, p=0.026). Students did not report increased interest in pursuing radiology as a career (+0.00, p=1.000) nor in carrying out research in their future careers (+0.25, p=0.516). Of the program components, 87.5% of participants found the facilitated mentoring sessions to be helpful, and 100% of participants found the final v isual abstract presentations to be helpful. However, no students (0%) indicated that resources dedicated to helping them present their research at national conferences were helpful. In free -text comments, students indicated that they appreciated the amount of individual attention they received, and for future iterations of the program, they would like to have sessions dedicated to learning about subspecialties within the field of radiology. Potential Impact : Providing additional mentoring to medical students completing remote summer research is perceived as helpful towards development. However, it does not necessarily increase student interest in pursuing that specialty. Future programs should provide additional exposure to the field of research through rem ote clinical shadowing. 48References: 1) Whitworth PW, Agarwal A, Colucci A, Sherry SJ, Subramaniam RM. A.

Impact of Early Radiology Research Experiences on Medical Student Perceptions of pm Presentations of Innovations 1: Undergraduate Health Professions Education Developing a Tutor Curr iculum for the Clinical Skills Tutoring Program (CSTP) at UCSF Chang, Chih -Chiun (1); Phillips, Abigail (1, 2); Rumrill, Sara -Megumi (1, 2). (1) UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA; (2) Division of VA GIM, Department of Medicine, San Francisco, CA Problem Statement : Peer tutoring programs do not consistently provide formal education and support to tutors to ensure they are effective teachers for other students. Rationale: Peer tutor programs for clinical skills improve student performance (1,2) and learning experience (3,4), especially in the setting of remediation (2,5). However, these programs rarely provide formal education for tutors on how to be effective teachers to struggling students. We designed a tutor curriculum with six- core learning ob jectives that incorporates the Master Adaptive Learner (6) and Self- Regulated Learner (7) models to guide tutors to help students create learning goals, organize a strategic plan, and adapt their improvement strategy based on feedback. Our goal was to desi gn and implement a tutor curriculum that improved the knowledge, skills, and confidence for tutors to be successful peer tutors. We hypothesized that peer tutors would be satisfied with the overall goals and specific objectives of the curriculum and that s tudents would be satisfied with their tutors who had participated in the formal training. Methods: We reviewed the literature for existing peer tutoring programs and clinical skills learning models. We conducted a needs assessment invo lving semi -structure d interviews with key stakeholders to determine core learning objectives. IRB -exempt status was obtained. The delivery of curriculum content was through 1) an in -person tutor training session, 2) formal tutor curriculum written content, 3) online resources (including clinical skills educational material), 4) longitudinal support from faculty directors, and 5) monthly tutor skill- building and reflection sessions. To evaluate our curriculum, tutors received two surveys. The surveys assesse d their overall sati sfaction of the program, the specific learning objectives, and the delivery methods of curricular content. Items were graded on a 5 -item Likert rating scale with an option for free responses as well. Additional qualitative data was obta ined through a semi -structured tutor focus group session. We are in the process of organizing semi -structured, one -on- one interviews of students who participated in the program with dedicated questions regarding the perceived training and effectiveness of their peer tutor. Results: For our pilot, we trained 10 tutors in January 2020, all 4th -year medical students who formally applied and were accepted to be tutors in the program. The in -person training session was found to be overall extremely useful (mean rating 4.8, with 1 = not at all useful and 5 = extremely useful, n= 5 responses). The lowest score was given to feedback skills practice (4.40) and higher marks given to the overview of the program (5.00), tutor curriculum materials (4.80), training session materials (4.80), and organization of session (4.80). At the end of the program, the mean rating of tutor experience in the CSTP was 4.71 (with 1 = not at all satisfied and 5 = very satisfied, n = 7 responses). The in -person tutor training session, onli ne curriculum resources, support from directors, development of learning goals with the student, and clinical skills practice with the student received mean scores greater than 4.0 (range 4.00 - 4.43) representing satisfied responses. The qualitative received noted \"curriculum structure\", \"director support\", and \"learning resources\" as positive elements of the tutor curriculum. The need for additional \"tutor check -ins\" and opportunities for \"community -building\", \"collaboration\", and \"information sh aring\" among peer tu tors were identified as key areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, we have incorporated monthly tutor community -building sessions for the second tutor cohort to provide additional faculty and peer support. Potential Impact : This curriculum fills a gap by training and supporting tutors before and during their work with students. This has an impact on tutor satisfaction and effectiveness. We are expanding this program and training twice as many tutors this year. This innovation can be implemented and further adapted by other tutoring programs, locally and nationally. 50References: 1) Khalid, H., Shahid, S., Punjabi, N., & Sahdev, N. (2018).

Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Colton, California Problem Statement: The prevalence of impostor syndrome in academic medicine with the implications on team wellness and performance highlights the need for effective intervention. Rationale: Impostor syndrome is a psychological term characterized by chronic feeli ngs of self -doubt and internalized fear of being exposed as an intellectual fraud. Implications of imposter syndrome in academic medicine include correlations with burnout, decreased performance, health and psychological defects. The purpose of this progra m was to determine if a reflective and interactive educational workshop can improve awareness, perceptions and knowledge regarding imposter syndrome. Methods: At educational workshops; participants: 1) completed Young Imposter Syndrome (YIS) & Competence Quiz surveys; 2) watched an animated video presentation on the psychological basis and prevention strategies for the impostor syndrome; 3) participated in an interactive presentation; 4) self-identified and discussed impostor subtypes; 5) participated in s mall group discussions using case -based scenarios and thought questions to deliberate on corrective intervention strategies for impostor syndrome and 6) completed a post -intervention perception, knowledge and behavior -based survey using Kirkpatrick levels (1,2,3). Results: This is an ongoing approximately 90 -minute workshop series. Of the 54 participants to date, there were 65% females, 35% males, 53% residents, 33 % medical students, 10% faculty and 4% staff. Overall, 50% were positive for Imposter syndrom e (IS) on YIS. The 3 commonest determinants were: \"hate making a mistake, or not doing things perfectly\" in 89%, \"believe that competitors are smarter and more cap able\" in 79% and \"secretly worry that others will find out that you're not bright and capable \" in 70%. For the imposter subtypes, participants classified as: Superwoman/man = Expert =33%; Soloist = 24%; Natural Genius = 13%, and Perfectionist = 12%. L ife events that participants perceived as a cause of IS included: parent expectations = 56%, academic rat race = 33%; female gender = 35%, first-generation to college = 30% and academic transitions, career change or minority status = 19%. Post-intervention awareness of the negative impact of IS on stress, personal goals and teamwork was a mean of 3.9 (Liekart scale of 1 -5). Participants also scored their ability to change behavior regarding personal IS and in the workplace as 3.2 (Liekart scale of 1 -5). In group discussions, participants deliberated on processes to decrease imposter syndrome. Pre and post- intervention Imposter syndrome knowledge survey scores were 4.55(SEM=0.53) versus 5.59 (0.37), p=0.04. Potential Impact : In this cohort, commonest IS subt ypes were superwoman/man and expert. Contributors to IS were parents expectations, academic c ompetition/promotion and female gender. Post- workshop, there was a significant increase in knowledge of IS. Participants demonstrated awareness of negative effects of IS; and the willingness to change behavior .

(1) Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA; (2) Samitivej Children's Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand Problem Statement: In Thailand, children account for 18% of emergency department visits, yet there are few providers with specialty training in pediatric emergency care. Rationale: Thailand's emergency departments are staffed by pediatricians and emergency physicians, but there are few providers with expertise in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM). Understanding this need, we collaborated with Bangkok Dusit Medical Systems, Thailand's largest private hospital system, to develop a PEM training progr am designed specifically to improve care for children. While physician training is essential to optimizing outcomes for children, patient care in emergen cy settings is fundamentally multidisciplinary and the most effective training programs are those that incorporate nursing practice and address the entire medical team. By combining simulation and team -based education with web -based didactic materials, we hypothesized that we could develop, implement, and analyze a curriculum addressing elements of PEM care in Thailand, with resultant demonstrable increases in knowledge and teamwork among both physicians and nurses. Methods: We conducted a prospective coho rt study with five physician -nurse dyads from January 2018 to July 2019. Through review of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Content Specifications for PEM and the results of needs assessments with each of 3 participating study sites, we developed a cour se curriculum with 22 distinct modules, which were divided into basic and advanced courses, each admini stered over 6 months. Each course began with baseline testing, consisting of a written test and observation of several simulated PEM cases led by each physician- nurse team. Critical action checklists and validated teamwork assessment tools evaluated the si mulations. Each term was administered remotely through electronic modules over the next 6 months, culminating in a final summative exam and repeat simulation testing. Paired t -tests were used to analyze performance on written exams and simulated emergencies before and after the courses. Additionally, participants submitted post -course feedback in order with the goal of improving and modifying the course for future cohorts. Results: The primary outcomes for this study were improvement in measures of knowled ge around pediatric emergency care and enhanced performance in simulated pediatric emergencies. The former was defined as statistically significant impro vements in multiple choice written exams, while the latter was defined as statistically significant imp rovement in percentage achieved on critical action checklists and teamwork assessment tools. When evaluating written exam scores before and after the bas ic course, physicians improved from 59.4% (95%CI 51.4 -67.4) to 97.0% (95%CI testing among physician -nurse dyads, performance improved before and after the course, from 76% (67 -85) to 96% (93 -99) for critical action items (p=0.004) and from 10.2 (9 -11.4) to 13.2 (12 - 14.4) on measures of teamwork. For the advanced course, physicians improved on the written exam from 57.0% (95%CI 48. 0-66.0) to 94.0% (95%CI from 76% (67 -85) to 96% (93 -99) for critical action items (p<0.001) and f rom 13.1 (12.3 -13.9) to 14.4 (13.9 -14.9) on measures of teamwork (p=0.004). As such, all physician and nurse participants successfully met the agreed -upon criteria for completion of both the Basic and Advanced Course. Potential Impact : To our knowledge, t his is the first international project to successfully create, administer, and evaluate a longitudinal interdisciplinary PEM curriculum. Our curriculum is unique in its breadth and format, combining elements of traditional didactic teaching with simulation while honing both behavioral and medical skills in an iterative fashion. 53 References: 1) Pandee U; Vallipakorn SA; Plitpholkanpim A.

Rationale: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic altered medical education formats and practices. Starting in March 2020, social distancing recommendations and policies led to limitations on gatherings, and led training programs away from traditional in -person lectures. Reports of electronic learning (\"e -learning\"), especially in asynchronous form, have increased over the last decade and vary in effectiveness.[1 -3] During the pandemic, programs made various urgent changes to embrace technology and distance learning in order to limit disruptions in education. We present the pediatric resident and faculty perspectives on the distance learning models utilized an d determined their recommendations for ideal learni ng formats post- pandemic. Methods: The traditional in -person pediatric resident noon conference lectures, grand rounds and other educational sessions were held remotely using ZOOM technology. An anonymous survey was e -mailed to 35 faculty members and 24 pediatric residents at Staten Island University Hospital, Northwell Health. The faculty were surveyed as to the teaching modalities used prior to COVID -19 and those used during the pandemic. They were asked how they rated several questions on a 5 -point Likert scale: the level of resident engagement (1=never, 5 = always), ease of teaching (1=very difficult, 5= very easy) and satisfaction with resident education (1=very dissatisfied, 5= very satisfied) during the pandemic. The residents were asked to rate the ir level of engagement (1=never, 5=always) during educational sessions through the pandemic and effectiveness of resident education compared to prior to the pandemic (1=much worse, 5= much better). Both fac ulty and residents were asked their preference for future educational models. The results are reported as percentages, mean scores and standard deviations (SD). The scores from the faculty and residents were compared using an independent 2 -tailed t- test. Statistical significance was documented with a p -value of <0.05. The project did not meet criteria for human subjects' research; review by the Institutional Review Board was not required. Results: 17 out of 24 (71%) pediatric residents and 17 out of 35 (49 %) faculty members completed the survey. Only 1 faculty member (6%) reported teaching remotely prior to COVID -19, but this increased to over 94% of faculty during the pandemic. Similarly, 100% of faculty taught using in -person lectures prior to the pandemi c, and that decreased to 24% during the pandemic. The use of online resources provided to the residents did not significantly change due to COVID -19. Small group in- person teaching did decrease with the pandemic. The residents rated the effectiveness of the remote lectures as compared to in-person lectures with a mean score of 3.12 out of 5, with approximately 65% of residents indicating that the remote lectures were approximately the same as in -person lectures in terms of the effectiveness of teaching and learning. The faculty rated the ease of teaching remotely and satisfaction of resident education during the pandemic with mean scores of 3.7 and 3.53 out of 5, respectively. The residents and faculty rated the level of resident engagement with education du ring the pandemic with mean scores of 3.65 (SD 0.6) and 3.06 (SD 0.96), respectively. However, the residents rated their own level of engagement higher than that perceived by faculty (p=0.04). The majority of both pediatric residents and faculty both recom mended a hybrid model for future post -pandemic resident education, with 82.4% of residents and 94.1% of faculty recommending a hybrid model. Potential Impact : Residents and faculty reported that residents were engaged in distance learning, and faculty rep orted ease of teaching and satisfaction with resident education. The majority of both residents and faculty recommended a future combination \"hybrid\" model, suggesting that the benefits of both can be combined to optimize resident learning. 55References: 1) Lew EK and Nordquist EK.

Rational e: The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic altered medical education formats and practices. Starting in March 2020, social distancing recommendations and policies led to limitations on gatherings and training programs away from traditional in -person lectures. During this time of the COVID - 19 pandemic, programs made various changes to embrace technology and distance learning in order to limit disruptions in education. Reports of electronic learning (\"e -learning\"), especially in asynchronous form, have increased over the last decade and vary in effectiveness [1 -3]. However, the data regarding synchronous remote medical conferences is limited. We present our experience with the implementation of a distance learning Pediatric Academic Day; we are not aware of any other similar distance learning academic day conferences described in the literature. Methods: Each pediatric resident in our program presents scholarly activity at the annual Pediatric Academic Day (PAD) held in June each year. Due to COVID 19, the large in -person session for PAD was unable to be scheduled. The abstract submission process remained the same, however, the format was changed to a create a remote PAD. The event was broken up into 3 remote sessions utilizing ZOOM technology. The f irst session was held for 1 hour, encompassing the four oral presentations, each 10 minutes in duration with 5 minutes for questions. Two concurrent poster sessions were then scheduled, and participants could choose from either session or view segments of both. Each resident showed their poster electronically as a whole and then presented the aspects of their work and poster over a 5 -minute interval, leaving 2 minutes for questions from the audience. The residents who were unable to attend the session provided thei r posters electronically, and the posters were shown to the audience to allow for review. Each group had a host to assist with muting the audience, facilitating the questions from the audience, and troubleshooting any technical difficulties. In addition, e ach group also had a timekeeper and member of the pediatric scholarship and research committee to ensure smooth transitions and to ensure adherence to the schedule. An anonymous survey was e -mailed for completion by participating faculty and reside nts and responses were provided on a 5 -point Likert scale. Results: Seventeen pediatric residents and 17 faculty members completed the survey. Overall, residents found it easy to present in this method (mean score of 4.2 out of 5). The scores from both gr oups for satisfaction, level of engagement, and effectiveness in promoting learning were all more positive than neutral (mean score range 3.35 -4.71 out of 5). Faculty, however, gave higher scores in these categories compared with residents (p<0.05). In add ition, faculty were more likely to recommend this forum for future sessions as compared with the traditional format, but this was not a statistically significant difference (mean scores 3.06 for residents and 3.88 for faculty, p=0.065). Comments provided focused on the poster sessions; both faculty and residents wanted the opportunity to view all posters, rather than only those from one poster session group. Potential Impact : We created a remote Pediatric Academic Day to replace our annual in -person session due to the COVID -19 pandemic. This event showcased resident scholarly activity and was well -received by participants. Based on feedback received, we would ideally implement a hybrid model in the future to maximize the benefits of both remote and traditio nal formats. 57References: 1) Lew EK and Nordquist EK.

Department of Medicine, Warren Alpe rt Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Problem Statement : Research in residency is vital for training and career development. However, improving this research while maintaining clinical training is a challenge. Rationale: Limited quantitat ive data exists on barriers and facilitators to resident research. Additionally, improving research output is challenging considering the already condensed clinical curricula. The internal medicine program at Br own University aimed to evaluate contributors to research productivity as well as the impact of an intern research conference. The goal was to identify further areas of need, as well as quantify any improvements that were made after implementing the resear ch conference. Methods: The authors reviewed research outcomes, perceived barriers, and facilitators to research for all senior internal medicine residents from 2015- 2020 at Brown University. Senior residents were asked to fill out a research evaluation form prior to graduation. The evaluation consisted of questions that pertained to: type of research performed, overall level of research interest, magnitude of selected barriers to research in residency, prior publication and conference presenta tions, and residency -acquired publications and conference presentations. Starting in 2015, a new research director was recruited and implemented several institutional changes in an attempt to improve research productivity. In 2015, intern orientation included a one- hour training on research basics and expectations. Beginning in 2016, this was expanded into an intern conference where every intern was covered for half a day in order to receive training on research methodology, IRB introduction, and research a pproaches by expert biostatisticians and researchers. Interns also received guidance on how to utilize REDCap and statistical support for their projects. Interns were made aware of newly added research resources as well, including improved linkage to facul ty mentors and a chief resident to help with research. Th e research day served as an opportunity to familiarize interns with the steps research requires, in addition to disseminating all of the available resources and spur interest in research. Results: T wo-hundred and sixty residents completed training during this time. Baseline research interest and publication counts were similar among residents from 2015 -2020. Lack of time was the most significant barrier to research among residents (83%), followed by statistical support (53%), mentorship (50%), IRB process (50%), experience (41%), and interest (21%). After implementation of an intern research day as well as focused research support for residents in 2016, residency -produced manuscripts and national presentations increased from 8 to 65 and 9 to 65, respectivel y. Prior original clinical research had the strongest relationship with producing at least one publication (OR 5.3, CI 2.9 -9.5) or national presentation (OR 4.6, CI 2.5 -8.4). Total prior publication count had a small correlation with residency publications (OR 1.1, CI 1.0- 1.2). Research interest was a stronger predictor of publications (OR 3.2, CI 2.2- 4.5) and national presentations (OR 2.2, CI 1.6 -3.0). The research barriers had a significant negativ e effect on the odds of publication, but not on national presentations. Potential Impact : This is among the first studies to calibrate the impact of individual research barriers and facilitators on research output during internal medicine residency, and our results may guide future resident recruitment. Additio nally, we found that the early implementation of a research day has the potential to enhance research productivity in residency. References: 1) Education ACFGM.

Keck School of Medicine of USC, School of Pharmacy Problem Statement : Interprofessional education (IPE) is required in health profess ions' curricula, but how well these recommendations are met is not well -established. Rationale: Graduates of healthcare programs must be prepared to collaborate in clinical environments upon graduation (1). Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) is a group of professional educational organizations that identified four competencies that should be taught across all health professions curricula: Values/Ethics, Roles/Responsibilities, Interprofessional Communication, and Teams/Teamwork (2). The expec tation is that there are components of IPE in both didactic and experiential portions of the curriculum. While there have been studies on the types o f IPE programs implemented and student satisfaction, there is limited data on whether or not programs are s uccessfully achieving the IPEC competencies. The objective of this study was to assess how well student reflections from interprofessional experience s during the experiential component of a PharmD curriculum met the IPEC competencies. Methods: A survey wa s developed by the health professions programs at the University of Southern California to assess interprofessional experiences. At the School of Pha rmacy, the survey was sent to first through third -year students after each of 5 total introductory experien tial rotations and to fourth -year students after each of their 6 advanced rotations. Surveys were collected from June 2017 to August 2019. Information collected included student demographics, type of practice setting, type of healthcare professionals invol ved, and context of collaborations. This was used to assess which settings had greater interprofessional collaboration, the healthcare members involved, and the context of the collaborations. Three reflections were qualitatively evaluated to assess alignme nt to the four Values/Ethics, and Teams/Teamwork. Reflections \"met\" a com petency if they addressed key elements of the competency in the experience. In other words, experiences met elements of the competency, but student success was not evaluated. Keywords were identified that mapped to each competency and were used as a codebook to categorize reflections. The number and types of competencies met, and the level of involvement was recorded. Chi- square tests were used to compare responses between groups, including inpatient vs outpatient experiences and first vs fourth -year studen t reflections. Results: The PharmD student response rate on the IPE survey was 30%. Responses were spread out across all professional years with 29% of total responses from first -year students (P1), 37% from second and third- year students (P2/P3), and 34% from fourth -year students (P4) (n=1360). The majority (86.1%) of student reflections met one or more compe tencies with 35.6% meeting one, 33.4% meeting two, 14.5% meeting three, and 2.6% meeting all four in a single rotation. The IPEC competencies of Roles/Responsibilities and Teams/Teamwork were most prevalent in student reflections with 48% of all reflections aligning with each of these competencies. Interprofessional communication was found in 35.9% of reflections while Values/Ethics was least prevalent at 24.5%. Student reflections were also assessed for reports of active engagement in interprofessional interactions. Active engagement was compared between P1 and P4 student experiences. As expected, active participation increased across all competencies as students advanced in the curriculum at the following rates comparing first vs. fourth - year rotations: Va lues/Ethics (11.1% vs 14.8%), 23.6%), and Teams/Teamw ork (14.9% vs 34.8%, p < 0.05). Potential Impact : PharmD students have opportunities to engage in IPE across experiential rotations from P1 through P4 years. Most students meet at least one competency during each experiential rotation and active engagement in IPE increases as students progress in the curriculum. Values/Ethics is the least met competency and may r equire more intentional teaching. 61References: 1) Thistlethwaite JE, et. al. Competencies and frameworks in interprofessional education.

Rationale: In recent years, some Canadian medical st udents have reported that Canadian residency programs have begun requiring proxies for academic ability from residency applicants. To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of this practice among all residency programs in Canada has not been investigate d. This requirement may be in response to a shift in Canadian medical education toward pass/fail grading systems and away from letter grades, making differentiation between applicants on the basis of academic performance more difficult. Without differentia ted grades, medical school transcripts contain little objective information (1). Pass/fail grading was introduced to improve student well -being, and the outcomes are well documented (2). However, residency program directors prefer differentiated grades among applicants (3). With no Canadian equivalent to USMLE exam scores, It is important to understand the prevalence of the use of proxies for academic ability in lieu of medical school grades. Methods: We built a database of residency program application requirements using data retrieved from the CaRMS website (Data was retrieved between May 1st and July 15, 2017). Requirements for residency programs with multiple sites were recorded separately. Residency programs were organized by specialty. We recorded the specific requirements of each residency program using Microsoft Excel. We then analyzed the proport ion of residency programs requesting each application item, in each specialty. We also considered the differences in program size by using the total quota o f positions available to compare institutions and specialties with differently -sized residency progr ams by weighting item requirements by the number of positions available in each residency program and institution. From this, we calculated both the proport ion of residency programs and the proportion of residency positions that require submission of a pro xy item in order to apply. Results: There was wide variability in requirements across Canadian residency programs. 13 of 15 ophthalmology programs required results of a comprehensive eye exam conducted by an ophthalmologist. Among otolaryngology programs, 2 required or strongly recommended the inclusion of an ophthalmological report with the application. After weighting by the number of available positions in each residency program, we found that 31% of Canadian residency positions required submission of p re- medical records in order to apply. Of the 514 CaRMS -rankable residency programs we identified in Canada in 2017, 28% of programs required pre -medical rec ords from applicants. This requirement varied widely by specialty and institution. A majority of pos itions in public health, radiology, nuclear medicine and dermatology required these, while they were not required anywhere for applications in neurosurgery, pathology, and medical microbiology. 9% of programs did not require them. One residency program required applicants' MCAT score. Potential Impact : Requirements to include a premedical record may be an unintended consequence of the widespread shift in Can adian medical education away from numerical and letter grades. 9% of residency programs do not require medical school transcripts at all. This may provide a preview of the United States residency match if USMLE exams become pass/fail. References: 1) Robins JA, McInnes MDF, Esmail K.

(2,3); Cheung, Andrew (1) (1) McMaster University; (2) Harvard Medical School; (3) Massachusetts General Hospital Problem Statement : There is a lack of literature investigating how C OVID- 19 has impacted consumption of medical literature and news. Rationale: Compared to the past, there are many alternatives to direct journal access, such as podcasts, blogs, and news sites for physicians and the general public to stay up to date with medical literature. Prior studies have report ed news consumption to increase as a result of COVID -19. Currently however, there is a scarcity of literature that investigates these readership characteristics of open access medical news sites and how they may have shifted with COVID- 19. Methods: All data for the study was gathered from 2MinuteMedicine.com, an open -access medical news organization that publishes 10 physician -written text and visual abstracts weekly summarizing and reviewing new medical research. In this retrospective observational study, the average views, actions (defined as the sum of views, shares and outbound link clicks), read times, and bounce rate (probability to leave a page in <30s) were compared between COVID -19 articles (N = 40) to other articles (N = 145) published between January 1 to May 31, 2020, via Mann -Whitney test. An online survey was also sent to readers to further characterize readership demographics and preferences scored by Likert Scale. Results: Mann -Whitney test reveale d that COVID -19 articles had significantly more views (Median = 296) than other abstracts (Median = 110), U = 748.5, p < 0.001. There were no differences in average view times or bounce rate. Non -COVID- 19 articles did however have more actions (Median = 2.9) than COVID- 19 articles (Mdn = 2.5) U = 2070.5, p < 0.05. On a Likert scale of 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree), survey data from 130 responses revealed that readers preferred staying up to date with emerging literature surrounding COVID -19 using open -access medical sites such as 2MM than direct journal access (M = 3.89, SD = 1.05). A greater proportion of survey takers also indicated open access news sources to be one of their primary means of staying informed (75.4%) than direct journal artic le access (54.0%). A lesser proportion of readers indicated to be reading less than one full- length medical study following introduction to 2MM (31.8%) compared to prior (16.9%). Potential Impact : Results demonstrate that there is a significantly increase d viewership in open access medical news during the pandemic and that these sources represent an important source to inform and introduce readers of emerging medical literature.

Rationale: Microaggressions are statements or acti ons causing indirect, subtle, or unintentional discrimination against members of a marginalized group. In the clinical environment, microaggressions arise from a variety of sources and negatively affect the clinical learning environment and the clinical care for patients (1 -4). Many faculty describe uncertainty or fear about responding to microaggressions due to concern that they may do or say the wrong thing and be labeled as racist or sexist (5). Unfortunately, this discomfort can result in faculty inacti on during times in which trainees most need faculty support to combat the impact of microaggressions. Acknowledging that it is impossible to prevent all microaggressions, faculty must be equipped with evidence -based skills to identify and intervene when they occur. Our work aims to explore student perspectives on effective faculty interventions against microaggressions. Methods: This is a qualitative study to analyze data from focus groups of medical students using a social constructionist lens. All third - and fourth -year medical students at the University of California, San Francisco received an email invitation to participate in a focus group, with a reward o f a $20 gift card offered for participants. Over Zoom, participants discussed four provided scenar ios, each focusing on a microaggression category (microassault, microinsult, microinvalidation, environmental microaggression) where the (6 -7). Microaggressions targeted hypothetical students' race/ethnicity , gender, appearance, and ability. Focus groups explored learners' perspectives on how faculty should ideally respond to each microaggression by probing possible responses, perceived facilitators and barriers to responding, and personal experiences with effective and ineffective faculty intervention. After professional transcription of focus group audio, we applied the framework method to code and analyze data. The research team, which included two white faculty members, one Latina faculty member, one black resident and one South Asian medical student, considered reflexivity through frequent group discussions. Results: We conducted seven focus groups (5- 7 students each) with 39 students, lasting an average of 86 minutes. Participants included 15 (38%) Asian, 12 (31%) Black, 5 (13%) Latinx, 17 (44%) White, 1 (3%) Native American and 1 (3%) Middle Eastern students. Thirteen (33%) identified as men, 25 (64%) women, 1 (3%) non -binary and 15 (38%) lesbian, gay, bisexual or queer. Students recommended that faculty anticipate that microaggressions would occur on clerkships and ask students when they began working together for their preferences on how students would feel best supported after a microaggression. Students largely desired some form of faculty response or acknowledgement of microaggressions. In -the-moment, participants wanted faculty to consider the context, the student, patient, faculty, and the microaggression itself. Students identified different severity in the microaggression scenarios and felt that m icroassaults demanded an immediate response, whereas other microaggressions promoted more debate among participants. An ideal faculty response was timely, proportional to the microaggression intensity, emphasized the clinical value of the student, and mitigated microaggression reoccurrence. After the microaggression, students highlighted the value of additional discussion with the faculty either individually, in a team debrief, or through follow up discussion with the patient. Potential Impact : Study results will be used to design student -informed, evidence -based guidelines for faculty development in microaggression response. By developing a toolbox of anticipatory discussions, timely interventions, check -ins and debriefing, faculty will be equipped to fost er safer learning environments for trainees. 66References: 1) Wheeler M, de Bourmont S, Paul -Emile K, et al.

Rationale: African Americans face higher morbidity and mortality in many skin pathologies due to misdiagno sis or late diagnosis. Darker skin tones may have different presentations of diseases that future physicians may not be ab le to recognize. This module was created for Wayne State University School of Medicine in the city of Detroit, in which African Americ ans make up 78.6% of the population. Medical school education may benefit from a skin of color module, educating future ph ysicians on how to diagnose skin diseases in darker skin tones. Moreover, dermatology is the second least diverse specialty. This lack of diversity may lead to disparity in care amongst minority groups. Increased diversity and innovation at the medical school level are imperative to addressing these disparities. Methods: An optional, online module, titled \"Skin of Color\" was made availa ble to the 295 second year medical students enrolled in the Musculoskeletal/Dermatology/Peripheral Nervous System Course a t Wayne State University SOM in Detroit, MI. Consent was obtained via an information sheet at the beginning of the pre -and post -test surveys. The surveys were completed anonymously and voluntarily. 145 students began the pre -test, 118 completed the pretest, and 77 students completed the pretest, module, and the post -test. The module comprised 13 vignettes with images of various rashes, i nfections, and cancers in darker skin tones. Confidence in diagnosing skin infections and skin cancer in African Americans, recognizing morbidity and mortality disparities in African Americans, and confidence in approaching skin diseases in skin of color was assessed on the pretest and posttest to assess confidence in approaching the diverse patient before and and after the m odule. Data was collected using an anonymous login ID that was unique to each student. Confidence was measured using a 1- 5 Likert scale, with 1 being least confident and 5 being most confident. A paired t -test was used to determine if a significant increas e in confidence occurred after completion of the module. Results: We observed a statistically significant increase in confidence in d iagnosing skin infections and skin cancer in African Americans, recognizing morbidity and mortality in African Americans, and confidence in approaching skin diseases in skin of co lor. Potential Impact : Students found the module to be useful and would like to see inclusivity integrated into the curriculum. Students declared that they would like to see manifestation s of skin disorders in other minority skin tones and compare them to Caucasian skin types. References: 1) Gupta AK, Bharadwaj N, Mehrota R.

Rationale: Given the public concern regarding the skills and efficacy of healthcare professionals, along with the increased demands f or accountability of health profession schools (1,2), it is critical for healthcare educators to have a better understanding of their didactic and experiential curriculum. This issue is particularly challenging for experiential learning because of the dive rsity in rotation sites and the backgrounds of preceptors. To improve understanding of the experiential curriculum, coverage of program outcomes, learning objectives, entrustable professional activities (EPAs) (3), disease states, teaching and assessment m ethods, and activities need to be determined for each rotation. To address this issue, we developed AARDVARC -POWER (Automated Approach to Reviewing Developing Valuable Assessment Resources for your Curriculum - Preceptors Offering Wisdom through Experienti al Rotations) to facilitate the collection of information through completio n of rotation syllabi. Methods: AARDVARC was originally developed at the USC School of Pharmacy in 2017 with the core function of creating a web -based portal for faculty to produce their didactic course syllabi in a standardized format online. By developi ng this web- based syllabus portal with query fields, multiple points of data were able to be collected automatically from faculty as they were developing their syllabus for students each semester. This included program outcomes, learning objectives, teaching and assessment methods, course readings, coverage of topics in the curriculum, and faculty teaching hours. With the success of using the platform for the didactic curriculum, AAR DVARC was expanded to the experiential curriculum in 2019 and became known as AARDVARC -POWER. This new software is currently used for assembly of syllabi in rotations offered in the final year of the PharmD program. They are completed by preceptors with direct knowledge of the specific rotation. AARDVARC -POWER is also able to automatically collect information on site- specific learning objectives, EPAs, disease states encountered, and the daily activities at each rotation site, in addition to collecting the standard AARDVARC data from syllabi. Results: AARDVARC- POWER is now used by more than 50 preceptors with 123 syllabi completed or in - progress since 2019. Preliminary data from AARDVARC -POWER have shown that the three program outcomes that are covered most often across APPE rotations include: 1) leadership, 2) professionali sm in interactions with other healthcare providers, and 3) self- awareness. EPAs that student pharmacists are most engaged in while on their rotations include: 1) use of evidence -based information to advance patient care, 2) collection of information to identify a patient's medication- related problems and health - related needs, and 3) analysis of information to determine the effects of medication therapy, identify medication -related problems, and prioritize health -related needs. AARDVARC- POWER data have shown that the disease states most encountered during students' rotations are: 1) hypertension, 2) type 2 diabetes, and 3) dyslipidemia. Teaching and assessment methods most utilized by preceptors include: 1) observation, 2) readings (journal or papers), and 3) oral presentations. Potential Impact : Data analytics from AARDVARC- POWER have allowed us to improve our assessment of experiential rotations. The results have provided us with the means to discuss important programmatic and curricular changes. We believe this approach could be applicable to experiential education in all healthcare programs. 69References: 1) Hill LH, Delafuente JC, Sicat BL, Kirkwood CK.

(1) (1) Office of Faculty Development, Paul L. Foster School School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, El Paso, Texas; (2) Office of the Provost, Texas Te ch University Health Sciences Center El Paso, El Paso, Texas; (3) Office Problem Statement : Medical educators desire access to faculty development programs which can provide them with the tools that are critical to advance in academic rank. Rationale: Our Institutional Faculty Development Course (IFDC) is targeted at junior and mid -level faculty and focuses on enhancing their teaching and assessment skills, development as scholars, while establishing a network of colleagues. IFDC participants are nominated by their department chairs. The 8 - month IFDC is offered once a year, and presents 80 hours of material (40 hours needed to graduate). The curriculum consists of four domains: teaching, scholarship/research, clinical skills/simulation (for practicing clin icians), and leadership development. The objective of our study w as to quantify the association between graduation from our annual comprehensive IFDC and promotion from assistant professor to associate professor. Methods: A retrospective cohort study (Oct ober 2008- October 2019) was conducted using publicly - available fa culty data. Our institution's IRB reviewed our protocol and deemed it exempt from formal review (IRB # E20124). A total of 148 IFDC graduates were compared to 87 non -graduates. Subjects were full-time assistant professors at Texas Tech University Health Sc iences Center El Paso at the start of follow -up. The binary outcome was promotion to associate professor. The outcome was measured annually. Follow- up ended when the faculty member left our institution, was promoted to associate professor, or the study ended, whichever came first. A longitudinal (repeated measures) logistic regression analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE), an independent working correlation struct ure, and robust (empirical) standard errors. Adjusted odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P -values were reported from the GEE logistic regression model. Results: The 235 faculty members contributed a total of 1015 records. The average age s (standard deviation) of IFDC graduates and non- graduates were 40.7 (8.6) and 40.3 (7.4) years, respectively. More than half of the IFDC graduates were female (54.1%) and 44.8% of the non -graduates were female. The prevalence of a primary care specialty was 40.5% in IFDC graduates and 39.1% in non -graduates. A positive association was detected between IFDC status (graduates vs. non- graduates) and being promoted to associate professor after controlling for time, age, sex, ethnicity (Hispanic), and specialty/discipline in a GEE logistic regression model: adjusted OR=12.88, 95% CI: 3.07 - 54.05, P=0.0005. Faculty members who were 40 years of age or older had three times the odds of being promoted during the study period than faculty who were younger than 40 years: adjusted OR=3.06, 95% CI: 1.17 - 7.98, P=0.02. Potential Impact: Completion of our IFDC was strongly correlated with promotion to associate professor at our health sciences center. Institutions that rely primarily on grand rounds and brief workshops to deliver professional development opportunities should consider creating a comprehensive, longitudinal faculty development course.

Rationale: Student -run free clinics (SRFCs) have become an essential part of medical education and their daily operations rely on medical students to volunteer their time despite having a strenuous workload. A 2015 study showed that students valued the early training opportunity in SRCs, but little was known about the effect of participation on student's skills and knowledge (1). Three studies tried to gauge how service -learning or volunteering at SRFCs affected educational performance, but all three came to a different conclusion (2,3,4). This observational study aims to determine how the amoun t of time spent at JayDoc Free C linic affects educational performance. If volunteering at JayDoc does not negatively impact educational performance, volunteer rates should improve, which then improves the care we can provide the patients and the number of patients we can see on any given day. Additionally, a positive correlation could further support the importance of SRFCs in medical education. Methods: Volunteer rates were collected retrospectively from JayDoc's volunteer portal for the University of Kansas Medical School graduating classes of 2021 and 2022. The total number of volunteer shifts for each student during their first two years of medical school was collected. Two separate analyses were performed on the data. The first was to compare those tha t volunteered more than once to those who have never volunteered at JayDoc. The second was comparing those that volunteered more than seven times to those that volunteered one time or less at JayDoc. Unpaired t -tests and ANOVA were used to compare academic performance among groups. ANCOVA was used to compare Step 1 performance by group, controlling for multiple -choice exam performance. Results: Within the class of 2021, there were 139 students who volunteered more than once and 35 students who did not volu nteer at JayDoc. Compared to those who did not volunteer, students who volunteered scored 1 -2 percentage points higher on phase I multiple -choice exams and 5 points higher on Step 1. However, group differences were not statistically significant based on unpaired t- tests at t he 95 % level of confidence (p = 0.11 and 0.09, respectively). For the second analysis, 57 students volunteered one time or less and 48 students volunteered more than 7 times at JayDoc. The low and high volunteer groups were significantl y different on both exam performance and STEP 1 performance with the high volunteer group earning higher scores on each measure. The ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant effect of the exam performance covariant and no STEP 1 score difference. All analyses used alpha = 0.05 associated with a 95% confidence level. We are currently evaluating the class of 2022 data. The data analysis should be completed well before February 2021. We also plan to further analyze the class of 2021 and 2022's exam performance, looking specificall y at questions on the exam that target the application of learned material known as Bloom level 2 questions. Potential Impact : If volunteering at JayDoc Free Clinic does not negatively impact educational performance, volunteer rates should improve, which then improves the care we are able to provide the patients and the number of patients we can see on any given day. It will also emphasize that SRFCs are not just helpful to the patients, but for students education as well. References: 1) Schutte T, Tichelaar J, Dekker RS, van Agtmael MA, de Vries TP, Richir MC.

Rationale: TEL has shown positive effects on learner memory retrieval in health professional education programs. Learners also receive some form of feedback on responses, however, the effect of feedback on learning and retention in TEL has not been well evaluated. Feedback activities also support or inhibit learning based on how they are perceived by the individual l earner and it is important to explore the effectiveness of different TEL feedback approaches. According to the co -constructive framework, feedback should be reserved for a dynamic and co -constructive process in a shared social or cultural space to challeng e a learner's way of thinking, acting, or being to support growth. Therefore we sought to answer the following research question: Does a collaborative feedback process with faculty-facilitated small group discussions improve clerkship students' medical kno wledge acquisition a nd perceptions of feedback effectiveness compared to a non -collaborative feedback process? Methods: In a randomized controlled trial in September 2018 to May 2019, 55 medical student volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two small groups for eight 6 0-minute sub -topic based learning sessions during their 4 -week neurology clerkship at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. The majority of students participated at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, while other students vi deo linked for each session at two remote sites. The two sessions took place concurrently and began with a TEL component where students individually took the same 10 - item multiple -choice test over 15 minutes on the CANVAS learning m anagement platform. The students were informed that test results would not affect their final clerkship grade. Each session was facilitated by one of seven core neurology clerkship didactic teaching faculty. The control group (N=27) received their scores w ith correct and incorrec t answers immediately after the test, and written explanations for all the answers were available to them after each session. The collaborative feedback group (N=28) discussed their responses with their facilitator's guidance during each session based on their anonymous answers, and the written explanations were also available to the students after the session. Outcomes were compared using student responses to an end of clerkship 5 -point survey on the TEL feedback effectiveness and the neurology National Board of Medical Examiners shelf exam scores. Results: Fifty -seven percent of the collaborative feedback participants rated their TEL feedback as very effective or better (4 or 5), while none of the non -collaborative group members ra ted their TEL feedback effectiveness as very effective (p<0.001). Only 36% of participants found the TEL feedback 'very effective' at reinforcing their strengths, however, the proportion was higher in the collaborative feedback group (29%) compared to the answer sheet group (7% ;p<0.042.) A higher proportion of students found the collaborative feedback was very effective at identifying areas to improve (39%), compared to 11% of the answer sheet group (p<0.017). Thirty -six percent of participants found gener ating action plans to improve was 'very effective' and the proportions were not statistically different by group. The exam scores for the two groups were not significantly different. Potential Impact : Collaborative Feedback in TEL can be used to improve s tudent perceptions of feedback effectiveness and engagement after individually completed tests. A non- collaborative feedback method was not perceived as effective by students. There was no difference in medical knowledge acquisition between collaborative and non- collaborative fee dback groups. 75References: 1) Butler AC and Roediger HL III (2008).

Rationale: To address the issue of students not being, or not feeling, prepared for practical anatomy examinations, this study created practice anato my practicals. The purpose of this study was to assess whether partic ipation in a student -led practice anatomy practical examination will improve their grades in the official practical exam, compared to students who did not. The secondary goal of this stud y was to assess whether students' participation in the practice practical improved their comfort and confidence levels in their anatomy knowledge. Methods: For each of USF Health Morsani College of Medicine's (USF MCOM) four first -year courses, student pr eceptors planned to create (with faculty advisement) and proctor a practice practical anatomy examination mirroring the format of the official exam. This included questions on skeletal and cadaveric anatomy as well as radiological structure identification. 90 of the 180 USF MCOM first- year medical students (MS1s) participat ed in a practice practical before an official anatomy practical examination. Each of these practice practicals was followed by a second -year medical student (MS2) -led review session expl aining important points related to each structure. The participating students' grades were compared to the grades of the students who did not participate. In addition, participating MS1s also completed pre -and post -surveys assessing their comfort and confi dence levels in their anatomy knowledge. Results: For course 1, the first practice practical, the control group that did not participate in the practice practical had an average official anatomy practical raw grade of 48.4 (n = 90, standard deviation = 7.6). The intervention group (who participated in the practice practica l examination) had an average official anatomy practical raw grade of 51.7 (n = 90, standard deviation = 4.1). The difference of means is 3.389 (standard deviation = 0.907, p<.001) under a two -sample T -test. When converted to exam scoring, the students who did not participate in a practice anatomy practical had an average official anatomy exam score of 81% while the students that did participate had an average official score of 86%. For the practice practical for course 1, the overall mean score improvement between post - and pre- intervention survey questions regarding comfort level in anatomy (measured on a scale of 1 -10) was 1.55 \u00b1 1.20 (IQR: 1.00 - 2.25), which was significantly different from zero, p<0.0001 (paired t -test). This indicated that the interve ntion significantly affected comfort level with the anatomy course, knowledge level among peers, and preparedness for the official anatomy exam. There was no significant association between past anatomy exposure and comfort levels. The student -led practice anatomy practical was repeated for course 2 with a similar significant difference in grades and pre and post comfort levels. Potential Impact : A practice practical was pla nned to be run each of the four first -year courses but, with the proven exam grade difference, we had difficulty with high demand for the participant spots. This research project was discontinued in exchange for collaborating with USF MCOM faculty in creat ing practice practicals integrated into the official curriculum. References: 1) Drake, R.

Rationale: We saw a lack of opportunities for students to process their experiences in medicine and their transformation into doctors. At our i nstitution, COVID -19 restrictions translated into a need to rapidly develop high -quality, meaningful virtual learning. Campus- wide, several electives were created to continue building skills relevant to clinical education. With COVID -19, the need for space to safely self - reflect became more urgent. We saw the humanities as an indispensable and refreshing element in achieving these goals. We developed a novel format for a Narrative Medicine elective in order to: augment students' awareness of humanistic elements of patient encounters; language their growth as learners; and teach the value of narrative in clinical writing, social media and public health. Communication skills are an essential but often under -emphasized element of medical education. We structure d our course to include active discussion, historical writing, and self -analysis of writing. Methods: The design of the co urse began as a 4 -part series held over two weeks, which was ultimately expanded to a 5- part series. Each 2 -hour session was held live over web- based meeting software by core faculty and trainee facilitators, engaging small groups of students with a maximu m of 6 students per session. The facilitators were a cross -disciplinary group of leaders from family medicine, pediatrics and internal medicine, as well as faculty in behavioral health and library science. Each session was designed as comprehensive topic coverage with key themes threading through all sessions for reinforcement. Each session was taught independently by 1 -2 designated facilitators, allowing for schedule flexibility and modularity as needed for facilitator and student schedules. Prior to the s tart of each course, students were administered a survey assessing their interest and familiarity with narrative medicine. The sessio ns were as follows: \"Introduction to Narrative Medicine and Framework\", \"Bias in Record\", Narratives, and Therapeutic Narratives\". Each session was preceded by a pre -reading and writing assignment and followed by a pertinent post -session assignment. Assignments ranged from essay -based to non- traditional formats like recording their own podcast episode, developing a concept map, and verbal story - telling to peers. Results : A total of 21 students were enrolled in the course over a 5 month period. Pre - and post -course surveys were administered to assess skill -building and pre- course knowledge and attitudes. A total of 9 pre-session and 4 post -session surveys were returned. Questions included a combination of narrative and Likert scale questions. Students were asked to rate their level of agreement with a series of questions on a 1- 5 scale, with 5 correlating with strong agreement. Questions such as \"I often reflect on my day -to-day experiences\" were met with neutral (62.5%) to agree (37.5%). 75% of students agreed with the statement that \"I beli eve my medical school courses so far have prepared me to be an empathetic medical professional\" while 25% of students were neutral or disagreed. All students agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"I believe that compassion fatigue is a major concern for many physicians.\" In the post- course survey data, students uniformly reported strong agreement that narrative medicine was a use ful way to develop communication skills (100%). There was also 100% agreement with, \"I believe after taking this course I w ill have a better understanding of the patient perspective or experience\". A 3- month follow -up survey was sent to the first class of students. Two responses were received and revealed students had incorporated self -reflection into their day and reported fe eling more equipped to elicit narratives from and communicate clearly with patients. 79Potential Impact : This novel narrative medicine elective was well -received by students with demonstrable gains in their self -rated communication skills and engagement with patient narratives. One major limitation was the lack of response to surveys. Allowing time for surv ey completion in the first session and final session may reduce the loss of follow up. References: 1) Zaharias G.

Rationale: In response to COVID -19, medical school curricula were moved to distance- learning or hybrid modalities, limiting communication between faculty and students. Gross Anatomy (GA ) was arguably the foundational science discipline most impacted by emergency rem ote learning decisions. In- person GA dissection labs especially emphasize engaging learning strategies; disturbing in -person interaction between new medical students and facul ty may impair understanding of material in all disciplines. This was noted during emergency remote -GA taught to end -of-year MS1s during the first months of the pandemic; after this experience, rising MS2s voiced their opinions and collaborated with faculty to create a distance learning GA curriculum for entering medical students. By offering faculty a way to assess student understanding in real -time, professors can alter the subsequent sessions appropriately. Practical assessments were changed as well, so this offers students practice with the new format. Methods: The quiz was given to 210 MS1s at the beginning of each 3- hour lab session. There were a total of 9 lab sessions during a 5 -week period, each held over Zoom. Each quiz contained 3 -5 questions with 1 minute allotted per question, created and administered using Google Quizzes (G Q). The process was as follows: 1) Creation: Questions were based on the previous lab session's material and representative of the new question format in remote summative practical. 2) Distribution/administration: Quiz links were distributed to GA faculty at least two days in advance by MS2 students in the Medical Educator Pathway. Faculty members posted the link into the Zoom chat at the start of the session for student access . This was the first activity in each lab. 3) Monitoring results: Professors were easily able to access the Google spreadsheet that updated with students' answers in real -time; these spreadsheets are created automatically when answers are submitted through a GQ. Although quizzes were not graded, the answers allowed professors to check: attendance, students' comprehension of questions, as well as short- term retention and understanding. 4) Review: Questions were promptly reviewed on a shared PowerPoint via Zo om. The results helped professors tailor their explanations of answers and subsequent lab-talk. Quiz questions were not made available to students by faculty afterwards, although some students took screenshots during the review. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We have spreadsheet data to confirm the time the quiz was taken, number of students that took the quiz, student answers, and professors' viewing history to see when professors accessed the data. Faculty were also able to access data from other fa culty classrooms to compare results. 2) Reaction: Two qualitative surveys (one fo r MS1 students and the other for participating faculty) will be distributed after completion of unit lab sessions and exam week. They are designed to evaluate utilization of these quizzes from the faculty and student perspectives. Ongoing anecdotal evidence is extremely favorable for faculty and students. 3) Learning: We will look at students' answers to see if the quizzes encouraged independent preparation and learning. We wil l analyze final examination results to see if there is any correlation between the two forms of assessment. Furthermore, the survey will also seek to understand students' attitudes towards the quizzes, whether they took snapshots of them to use for study, and if students perceived them as helpful for their summative exam performance. 4 ) Behavior: Quiz results will be reviewed longitudinally to determine students' progress and improvement throughout the unit. Potential Impact : The GQ is one of the most successful tools discovered during emergency remote learning. As medical education co ntinues to adapt to the pandemic, real -time student performance results can guide faculty as they adjust remote or in -person sessions to align with students' needs and level of understanding. 81References: 1) Franchi T.

UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Problem Statement : There is a paucity of evidence -based guidance on Step 2 CK exam study strategies relative to Step 1. Rationale: The USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams, typically taken at the end of the second year and in the fourth year of medical school, respectively, are central to medical licensure and the residency match process. Traditionally, Step 1 has played a mor e significant role than the Step 2 CK exam in the residency match process, particularly as it relates to a student's prospects of securing an interview (1). As Step 1 transitions to pass/fail in 2022, the Step 2 CK exam score will become a more valuable to ol for residency programs in evaluating applicants (2). It is anticipated that these programs will put increased weight on the Step 2 CK e xam score. Students vary widely in their approach to studying for the Step 2 CK exam and there has been little data de monstrating approaches or tools that are effective for students preparing for the exam. With the elimination of a score for Step 1, there is now a need to identify evidence- based study strategies to help students prepare for the Step 2 CK exam. Methods: W e distributed post- exam surveys to all second year and fourth -year students at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA within 1 month of receiving their exam score on the USMLE Step 1 or Step 2 CK exam, respectively (as applicable). Survey participation was optional. Data described in this study reflects the cohort of students who completed the Step 1 exam in 2019 and the Step 2 CK exam in 2020/2021. Students were asked a mix of multiple -choice and open -ended questions related to specialty interests, study schedules, and resources used. In addition, students were asked to subjectively report their feelings of \"exam preparedness\" and \"scor e satisfaction\" for both the Step 1 and Step 2 CK exam, and to compare their feelings of exam preparedness and score satisfaction between both exams using a 5-point scale, where 5 indicated feeling significantly more prepared or satisfied with Step 2 CK compared to Step 1, and 1 indicated feeling significantly more prepared or satisfied with Step 1 compared to Step 2 CK. We isolated data from students who stated they felt significantly more prepared for Step 2 CK than Step 1 to identify patterns in their st udy strategies. We compared data from this subgroup to all responders and also compared their responses to similar stu dy-strategy questions on the Step 1 exam survey. Results: A total of 119 students completed the Step 1 exam survey in 2019. Of these stud ents, the largest group of students reported taking 6 weeks for a dedicated study period (n=41) and reported studying 10- 12 hours per day during their dedicated time (n=41). Most students (n=102) started studying prior to the start of their dedicated study period; however only 16 students started studying before the start of the second year of medical school. We found tha t some students reported feeling more prepared and satisfied with their Step 1 scores than others and anticipate similar patterns for students who took the Step 2 CK exam with some key differences which will be elaborated further in our study. Thus far, a total of 54 students in 2020 completed the Step 2 CK survey after receiving their exam score. 21 of these students indicated feeling signi ficantly more prepared for Step 2 CK compared to Step 1. We anticipate receiving additional surveys in the coming mont hs as more students complete the exam. We intend to report on specific trends and factors, including patterns of behavior and resources us ed among students who report feeling they were significantly more prepared for the Step 2 CK exam compared to the Step 1 exam. Potential Impact : The USMLE Step 2 CK exam is a capstone of clinical education and an increasingly important component of reside ncy program applications as we transition to a pass/fail Step 1 exam. We hope that by comparing trends on study strategies we can help guide individual approaches and institutional recommendations for Step 2 CK exam preparation. residency interview: Differences by medical specialty [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 4].

Rationale: Key elements in a pediatric history and physical exam (H&P) make it stand apart from the standard H&P taught in medical school. It is vital to provide feedback to first-year pediatric residents to help develop their com munication skills to children and caregivers and develop their critical thinking skills in the hospital setting of the acutely sick child. It has been shown that a delay in feedback provides a lack of clarity and detail in performance to the learner [2]. A lso, using the traditional pen and paper format resulted in lost evaluation forms or minimal feedback given to the residents that did not translate to formative change. The evidence shows that using a smartphone- based evaluation tool has increased faculty engagement[1]. We hope to create an online platform that is easily accessible through a smartphone or tablet device to improve participation in directly observed H&Ps and ultimately improve communica tive and critical thinking skills of first -year residents . Methods: We have created a new online grading rubric on Qualtrics, which evaluates 4 major domains including history taking, physical exam, plan of care and communication skills. We found that our grading rubric was geared towards an outpatient encounter and have revised the evaluation tool to account for key elements that are unique to an inpatient pediatric H&P. This online evaluation can be accessed via a portable device including a smartphone, tablet or laptop with a provided Quick Response (QR) code. We will make the QR code accessible for the learners and observers by distributing it throughout the resident and physician workspaces in the hospital. This evaluation will be opened at the time of the observed history and physical exam by the pediatric hospitalist in the inpatient setting when an appropriate patient is identified. For the subsection of each of the 4 domains (history, physical, plan of care, communication), the observer will document \"yes or no\" if the learner has completed the task. We w ill then use the Likert Scale to provide the learner with feedback on how well they completed each section along with a free - text comment field. Observers will be instructed to complete the grading r ubric the same day as the observed H&P is done for optimal feedback to the learner. Once submitted, the evaluation will be sent directly to the pediatric resident for review as well as to the pediatric residency program. Results: In order to assess if our tool is successful and effective, we will compare intern and pediatric hospitalist participation to previous years. We will obtain intern and pediatric hospitalist feedback on the effectiveness of utilizing this evaluation tool. Based on the feedback we receive from all parties, we will continue to improve on s pecific aspects of our evaluation tool. A measure of success would be if we see 100% participation from the intern class. If this platform proves to be an effective evaluation tool, we hope to observe the learner twice throughout their intern year to asses s for improvement over the course of the year. As a secondary study, we then would like to create a second grading rubric that will allow the observer to provide feedback on documentation of the obse rved pediatric H&P and assess for accuracy of documentation. Potential Impact : Our overall goal is to create an evaluation tool that is accessible for the learner to receive feedback in an efficient, timely manner. Our hope is that this will be easily int egrated into the existing workflow for both residents and pediatric hospitalists. If successful, we hope to share this with other pediatric residency programs. 85References: 1) Green JM. An Innovative, No -cost, Evidence -Based Smartphone Platform for Resid ent JD, Dunnington GL.

Rationale: A virtual platfor m was created to assess the feasibility and utility of training standardized patients (SPs) to serve virtually in the capacity as actors in providing similar experiences as those demonstrated in face -to-face settings. The rationale was twofold: a) t o assess the effectiveness in using a virtual training method for FNP students with aims to assess (FNP) students' clinical skills as an alternative method to the traditional face -to-face OSCE format and b) to assess clinical decision reasoning using pediatric case studies and debrief methods post encounters. Methods: A descriptive study was employed involving 36 FNP students enrolled in an online/hybrid Nursing 601 Childrearing and Childbearing clinical course at the Suzanne Dworak -Peck School of Social Work, Department of Nursing Spring 2020 course. Students resided in various geographical regions within the United States. In collaboration with Dr. Win May, Director of the Standardized Patient Program and faculty from the Keck School of Medicine, Clinical Skills Education and Evaluation Center (CSEEC), standardized patients identified by the CSEEC were trained virtually and participated in mock dry -runs in preparation for the scheduled OSCE. Four faculty from the Suzanne Dworak -Peck Department of nursing provided faculty oversight and debriefed students. Results: Students (N = 36) enrolled in a childbearing/childrearing clinical course participated in the virtual OSCE experience using Zoom. The experience included a briefing and debriefing session. Students were evaluated for their cumulative learning and ability to assess two adolescent patients: one acute with behavioral problems presenting for a checkup and one witha headache. Findings (Results): Students (n = 29; 83%) completed a nine -item online surve y following the experience. Students (79%) preferred face -to-face experiences as an opportunity to connect with faculty and peers. Student feedback on the feasibility and utility of using virtual OSCE experiences with SPs to demonstrate their clinical capacities in a pandemic situation was positive. Assessment scores showed all students who participated in the virtual OSCE experience demonstrated the ability to cultivate clinical decision reasoning skills. Potential Impact : The use of a virtual platform fo r simul ated OSCE experiences is feasible in training nurse practitioner students enrolled in a FNP program. Standardized Patients (SPs) provided a virtual training experience conducive for students to transfer history and physical assessment skills in cult ivating the necessary skills needed in demonstrating competency.

Need /Rationale: The ACGME requires residency programs to assess residents on their clinical competency based on nationally establ ished milestones for each specialty. While the milestones framework represents a more generalized assessment, the need persists for workplace -based assessment tools used to observe specific behaviors within the milestone sub- competencies. Workplace - based assessment of emergency medicine residents is particularly difficult as faculty interactions with residents are sporadic and brief. As GME moves towards competency -based assessment, residency programs need to develop robust assessment tools to ensure their learners are prepared for graduation. Previously established workplace -based narrative assessments have demonstrated little correlation to the milestones sub -competencies, leaving competence to be implied when assessment data is lacking. While no set of pu blished observable practices in emergency medicine exists, the following tool was created to assess residents on observable behaviors that translate to the sub -competency domains within the emergency medicine milestones framework. Methods: A series of \"Sh ift Cards\" were created as a workplace-b ased assessment tool aimed at targeting the milestone sub -competency domains. Data fields were created based on Observable Professional Activities that are being actively developed by an American Medical Association grant- funded national work group. Due to the acuity based pod model of our Emergency Department, the Shift Cards were designed to target specific behaviors that would most likely be observed during a shift based on the nuances of each pod. The Shift Cards were internally reviewed amongst a group of educational content experts within the residency program for accuracy in content and response process. Shift Cards were piloted for a 3 -month time frame and feedback was gathered from resident and faculty stakeholders. A longitudinal series of faculty development seminars took place that provided instruction and highlighted best practices for completion of the Shift Cards. Faculty compliance was monitored and incentivized through its integration into annual facult y merit scores. Shift Cards were subsequ ently provided to the Clinical Competency Committee for use in the semi -annual evaluation of residents. Evaluation Plan: Evaluation of the \"Shift Cards\" will be performed at the end of the academic year. We will survey residents, faculty, and Clinical Com petency Committee members for their reactions to the assessment tool. Additionally, we will analyze whether assessments made on the new \"Shift Cards\" tool identified specific milestone sub -competencies at a higher ra te compared to previously published emergency department workplace- based assessment tools. Potential Impact : As GME continues its evolution toward competency -based assessment, this framework could serve as a model for on -shift assessment of residents through the use of EPAs, particularly in the field of emergency medicine where internal variables unique to the specialty create a challenging assessment environment, and literature on this subject is scarce. 88References: 1) Diller D, Cooper S, Ja in A, Lam CN, Riddell J.

Rationale: Traditionally, an Otolaryngology resident's competency in per forming a mastoidectomy is assessed by experienced surgeons through subjective evaluations obtained weeks to months after the procedure was performed. The evaluations are prone to bias and human. Intra -operative videos are routinely utilized during these s urgeries to demonstrate procedural techniques and to illustrate interesting cases. Despite the availability of this technology for decades, research pertaining to objectively measuring and analyzing what happens during both trainee and expert otologic surg ery is sparse. In preliminary work carried out by our group (1 -2), videos of mastoidectomies have been analyzed manually frame by frame or with the use of Kinovea -0.8.27 video analysis software. We obtained objective measures of total distance and average speed of the drill, the patient's head, and the suction irrigator, the average stroke length, and correlations between movements of the dominant and non -dominant hand. Some characteristics in these preliminary data correlated with the experience level of the surgeon; however, it was quickly realized that this data collection methodology lacked efficiency and accuracy. Methods: New methodology was developed utilizi ng MatLab, a mathematics software, to breakdown the components of each mastoidectomy video int o frames and pixels, isolate the instruments of interest, and track their motion. This proved to be significantly more efficient and moderately more accurate than prior results. To further improve accuracy, we have turned our attention to utilizing convolutional neural networks to allow for machine learning to extract data and analyze the videos. Evaluation Plan: As more data are input into the networks, we teach the machine learning system to recognize, isolate, and measure various aspects of a mastoidect omy. We will first assess the system's accuracy in differentiating between an expert and a novice surgeon. We will then assess the factors of surgical technique a nd behavior that play a role in this differentiation. We hope to determine definable milestone s based on these factors. Finally, we will implement video -review sessions and focused intraoperative teaching for the development and improvement of these skills . Potential Impact : The goals of this project are to improve surgical education, training, an d outcomes. This will occur through the development of an automated, objective means of skills assessment. We will then be able to better determine behaviors that correlate with surgeon competency and improve performance, outcomes, and hopefully patient sa fety.

Rationale: Critical resuscitation events are rare occurrences in pediatric patients. Research shows that teams need significant improvement in skills including response times, role identificati on, communication, procedural skills, and adherence to standard of care guidelines. Furthermore, studies have shown that there is a progressive loss of retention of procedural/resuscitation skills. Residency training programs are designed to measure successful achievement of competency through performance in a multitude of clinical settings including managing acutely ill patients. However, residents endorse a lack of confidence in their competency during resuscitation events. The purpose of this project is to further augment an existing simulation resuscitation curriculum by introducing video -assisted debriefing and self -reflection for long-term retention and adjustment and validate an Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) -based assessment tool for evaluation of residents during resuscitations. Methods: This study is currently in prog ress at CHLA, the population being the program's 105 current pediatric residents. Collaborators from various departments formulated unique resuscitation scenarios, mapped th em to applicable ABP Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs), and committed to o ffering these simulations to residents. These simulations will be video recorded. An EPA assessment tool developed in 2019 will be utilized for both faculty assessment of residents and resident self - assessments. The EPA tool is linked to a QR code that allows for tracking of residents' progress through the simulation curriculum and compilation of EPA data. Each resident's faculty - and self -assessment EPA data will be tracked, de-identified and analyzed. A set of standardized faculty facilitators will indepe ndently review each recorded simulation and evaluate the resident performance using the EPA assessment tool. Interrater reliability will then be used to validate the EPA assessment tool. Additionally, this study will use the framework established by Kolb t o allow for reflection and actionable change after the simulation intervention. After each session, all residents will have a group debrief. An experimental group of residen ts will be invited to a post -simulation video feedback session, where they will rev iew the recording, receive constructive feedback from facilitators, and re -evaluate performance. The control group of residents will not participate in the video reassessmen t. Evaluation Plan: The primary outcome will be measuring the dose -dependent relat ionship between resident competence in leading resuscitations, as measured by self - and facilitator -EPA scores, and number of simulation exposures. Content validity for the EPA Assessment Tool has been established through prior validation and expect consen sus, but this study will seek to validate other elements of Messick's framework including response process through user feedback, internal structure with interrater reliability and intra -class correlations (PGY1 with more exposures has higher EPA scores th an PGY1 with fewer exposures), and relations with other variables by assessing for inter -class test will b e used to identify a difference and Spearman Rank will be used to identify correlat ion linearity. The secondary outcome will be the difference in resident competency and skill retention in residents exposed to video feedback as compared to those without video feedback. Changes in faculty- and self -evaluations after video review will also be analyzed. The Mann -Whitney U test will be used to compare the two groups. Potential Impact : The long -term outcomes of the project can potentially validate a simulation curriculum that improves resident competence in resuscitation events and a trainee assessment tool for use at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, while also providing a framework for curriculum development for other trainee programs. 91References: 1) Yager P, Col lins C, Blais C, et al.

Rationale: Having strong coaching relationships can be of unparalleled influence on the development of medical students into physicians. While this has long been known, many of these relationships are considered outside the purview of the medical school curriculum. Across the coun try, schools are considering methods to formalize these relationships that support students' professional development, and as a result, we are seeing the prevalence of new coaching programs increasing throughout the United States. The overarching goal of t he emerging coaching programs is to help students learn to self - monitor and integrate external feedback to reach their full potential. The challenge with implementing coaches is four -fold: training the coaches, establishing a supportive culture within the medical school classes, providing enough oversight to make this a part of the curriculum and ensure quality, while also letting relationships grow organically. Methods: Non- evaluative community faculty interested in connecting with students outside of clinical practice were recruited for this pilot year. Coaches need to embody the professional traits including help - seeking behaviors, healthy coping skills amid stress and conflict, trustworthiness, and leadership skills. Coaches were trained in delivering f eedback and teaching students how to provide and receive feedback effectively. They were presented the UNR School of Medicine curriculum to provide transparency on medical students' current experiences and were given instruction on assessing professional d evelopment using Medical Education Program Objectives. Student introductory training was conducted to convey the goals of the coaching program and set expectations for the coach -coachee relationship. 11 coaches were introduced to the Class of 2022 in their transition module from preclinical to clinical training in the month prior to the start of clerkships. Coaches participated in a minimum of 4 designated \"checkpoints\" after the initial meeting where professional development topics were discussed with thei r assigned students. Data is collected from coach and student evaluations throughout the year using the Kirkpatrick model for evaluating training outcomes. Results: We are currently gathering data during the pilot year of our program. Preliminary data fro m the coach on boarding and student training suggests strong support for relationship potential (81.5% somewhat or strongly agree they'll connect with someone who will help them grow personally and professionally) and curriculum content (79.6% somewhat or s trongly agree the coaching program will provide content that is relevant to them as a future provider). In addition to the strong support for the curricularized coaching relationship, our preliminary results suggest that there may be some trepidation around the value of such a program (37% of students neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree that the coaching program is a valuable resource at the school, and 42.6% of students neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree when asked if they would recommend coaching to their fellow medical students). Our on -going data gathering plans are as follows: First survey: following student training - Level 1: reaction to/satisfaction with program - Level 2: evaluates actual learning (competency) Second survey: after initial group meeting with coach - Level 1: on- going reaction to/satisfaction with program Future surveys - Level 2: after spring individual meeting - Level 3: transfer of behavioral changes to the professional setting - Level 4: results and impact of changed behavior on the environment 93Potential Impact : Coaching programs in medical education provide enhanced team functioning and increased psychological flexibility amongst physicians. Integration of the program into the curriculum of the Class of 2022 demonstrated that this requires on -going investment and commitment from both the coach and coachee.

Rationale: Metacognition is a twenty- first-century requirement for optimal student learning and higher standards of achievement.\u00b9 Educational initiatives and curricular reform have necessitated the use of higher -order cognitive skills in learners in order to thrive in a competitive a cademic environment. Sustaining this high level of mental energy is challenging and requires motivation and emotional stability\u00b2 and needs to be exa mined.\u00b3 The purpose of this study is to analyze the predictive relationship of medical student motivation on metacognition as mediated by emotional stability. Methods: In 2019 -20, forty -one medical students voluntarily completed three self -reported surveys: Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (58 correspond, 5=corresponds (IPIP - 120, scale: 1=very inaccurate, 5= very accurate) to measure emotional stability. Single sample t -tests used to compare mean metacognitive awareness scores to instrument midline. Pearson correlations (r) and stepwise multivariate linear regression were used to predict metacognitive awareness scores from motivation and establish mediation via emotional stability. Inter -item reliability reported via Cronbach alpha. IB M\u00ae SPSS\u00ae 24.0 used for statistical analysis. The study is IRB approved. Results: The range of metacognitive awareness (alpha=0. 82) scores was 22- 50 with a mean (sd)=37.1 (6.8) and was significantly (p<0.001) above the instrument midline=26. Statistically significant (all p<0.001) Pearson correlations were reported between metacognitive awareness and: motivation (r=0.6), metacognit ive awareness and: emotional stability (r=0.6), and between motivation and emotional stability (r=0.4). Statistically significant linear regression (R\u00b2=0.7, p<.001) of metacognitive awareness on motivation facets of: Intrinsic motivation to know and learn, intrinsic motivation towards achievement/accomplishment, extrinsic motivation through rewards/constraints, introjected regulation (self- stability mediated motiva tion facet of internalization of extrinsic motives (beta=0.0). Potential Impact : Medical student metacognition scores were wide -ranging and directly impacted by motivation. A wide -spectral response of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotiva tion predicted metacognition scores, but only extrinsic motivation was mediated by emotional stability requiring a collective re gulation of student cognition and emotion.

Need /Rationale: While previous studies have assessed the benefits of peer tutoring and instruction (Allikmets, 2016), the potential benefits of content cre ation on creators, especially medical students, is still unknown. Prior work has shown \"tutor self -perceived benefits included skills in professionalism and development in the understanding of knowledge\" (Burgess, 2014). However, this work was unable to determine the discrete impact on specific areas of focus, did not study the effects of content creation, and emphasized the need for further research in this field. Student s who were involved in another interprofessional peer teacher training program reporte d an increased likelihood of tutoring and teaching in the future (Burgess, 2017). In this case, however, the results were not quantified or specific, and did not uniquely study the experiences of medical students. We aim to fully understand the qualities g ained by medical student peer content creators for KOLI (Keck Online Learning Initiative), Keck Anatomy Mentorship Program (KAMP) mentors, Keck Peer Instruction Program ( KPIP) instructors, and academic coaches, and how participation in these programs influ ences their career goals. Methods: In this cross -sectional study, current and former 2nd, 3rd, and 4th -year medical students from the Keck School of Medicine of USC (KSO M) will be asked to evaluate the impact their participation in KOLI, KAMP, KPIP, and/or academic coaching had on their leadership skills, professionalism, career development, and instigating a sense of belonging. The data will be collected in an anonymous, de- identified REDCAP survey. Each students' identity will be anonymous and assig ned to an alphanumeric code by our Faculty advisor. All identifying information, chiefly email addresses and USC ID (as no other identifying information are collected), will b e removed. Descriptive analyses will be conducted to understand the nature of the data collected. Appropriate univariate and multivariate analyses (e.g. t- tests, regression) will be performed to determine whether and how participation as KOLI content creators/editors, KAMP mentors, KPIP instructors, and/or academic coaches influences s tudents' leadership skills, professionalism, career development, and feelings of sense of belonging. Responses from open -ended questions will be coded and used as both quantitative and qualitative data. Data from the 2015 -2016, 2016- 2017, 2017- 2018, 2018-2 019 and 2019- 2020 populations of KOLI content creators and editors, KAMP mentors, KPIP instructors, and/or academic coaches will be used for the analyses described here. Evaluation Plan: We aim to identify specific benefits gained by medical students who participate as KOLI content creators, KAMP mentors, KPIP instructors, and/or academic coaches. KOLI is a student group dedicated to creating and updating content in a memoriza tion aid program (MAP) through the Memorang platform. This platform provides flas hcards, multiple- choice, matching, and mini -game studying modes. KAMP is a mentorship program in which mentors help mentees navigate and understand human anatomy in the Gross Anatomy Lab. KPIP is a program where peer instructors provide high- yield, subject- specific, interactive lectures to their students. Academic coaches are one -on- one peer tutors. KOLI content creators, KAMP mentors, KPIP instructors, and academic coaches wil l be invited to anonymously complete an online survey through REDCAP. The survey will assess the degree to which the peer instructor perceives the impact of being a peer instructor on their own personal development. The questions will be focused on the areas of leadership, professionalism, career goals, and sense of belonging within medical school. The survey will also include open -ended qualitative questions, which will be coded and used as both quantitative and qualitative data. Potential Impact : Through this study, we aim to pinpoint the skills gained through peer tutoring which will allow us to continue developing and expanding these programs to further the growth of future 96physicians who can effectively teach other physicians and lead the field of medi cine in combating the rapid changes to come.

Rationale: Social awareness gives you the ability to understand and respond to the needs of others and is one of the hallmarks o f interpersonal emotional intelligence.\u00b9 Unlike self -awareness which involves looking inward to learn about yourself, social awareness is looking outward to learn about and appreciate others. Decreased social awareness can result from the anxiety caused by being in unfamiliar socia l settings.\u00b2 In addition, intrinsic characteristics such as the personality traits of extroversion and conscientiousness will impact social awareness.\u00b3 The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of medical student anxiety and personality on social awareness across the first two years of medical school. Methods: In 2017- 18, 205 of 500 M -1/M-2 medical students (130 M1/75 M2) voluntarily completed self- reported electronic surveys using the following validated instruments: (1) Trait Emotional Intellige nce Questionnaire (TEIQue -sf, scale: 1=completely disagree, 7=completely agree) to measure social awareness scores; (2) State -Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI -AD) (1=almost never, 4=almost always) to measure anxiety, and (3) Five- Factor Personality Inventory (IPIP 50 -5, 1=very inaccurate, 5=very accurate) to measure conscientiousness and extroversion. Independent t -tests and Cohen's d effect sizes determined difference in mean self- awareness scores between M1 and M2 medical students. Pearson (r) cor relations and stepwise multivariate linear regression were used to predict social awareness scores from anxiety and personality scores. Inter -item reliability determined with Cronbach alpha. IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae 24.0 was used for statistica l analysis. This research was IRB approved. Results: The empirical range of social -awareness (alpha=0.7) scores was 1.0 - 7.0 with a mean (sd)=5.2 (1.1) and 84% were significantly (p<0.001) above the midline score=4.0. Social awareness scores were significantly higher (d=0.4, p<0. 024) for M -1 students (5.5 (0.9)) than the M -2 students (5.1 (1.2)). Anxiety scores were significantly lower (d=0.4, p<0.010) for M -1 students (37.9 (8.2)) than the M -2 students (41.3 (9.0)). No significant difference in conscient iousness or extroversion s cores for M1 and M2 students. There were statistically significant Pearson correlations for the M -1 students between the factors of social awareness and (a) anxiety (r= -0.5, three correlations all significantly decreased (p<.050) for the M - 2 students to: (a) (r=0.1, p<0.112), (b) respectively. M -1 Students: Linear regression of social awareness as the outcome variable generated a significant predictive model (R\u00b2=0.5, p<.001). The significant predictors included conscientiousness (beta=0.4), extroversion (0.3), and anxiety (0.2). M -2 Students: Linear regression of social awareness as the outcome variable generated a signif icant predictive model (R\u00b2=0.3, p<.048) which included of the single predictor of conscientiousness (beta=0.2). Potential Impact : Medical student social awareness scores and its association with personality and anxiety decreased over their first year of medical school. This suggest that personality traits and emotional instability no longer impact the ability to understand and respond to the needs of others after their first year and other characteristics should be examined.

Need /Rationale: After graduating from med ical school, residents are expected to step into the role of an educator to medical students despite minimal instruction or deliberate practice. Now required by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educa tion, \"Residents as Teacher\" curricula have gained popularity (1). To prepare future residents for this role, it is imperative that formal training on teaching in medical education be incorporated into medical school curricula. Near -peer teaching is used t o provide medical students informal teaching experience by way of tutoring, teaching assistant, and mentorship programs (2, 3). Few medical schools have started electives to instruct students on how to be effective teachers. We developed a novel year -long and longitudinal course that develops fourth -year medical students as teachers within Clinical Skills. Unique to this course, student teachers engage with learners by observing their simulated patient interactions, leading group discussions surrounding simulated patient cases, and providing feedback on student history -taking and physical exam skills, clinical decision -making, professionalism, and communication. Methods: The CTE was a collaborative effort among Clinical Skills (CS) Course Directors and two fourth- year medical students (M4) who served as the pilot student instructors for the first year of the elective. The elective was designed as a longitudinal elective in which students receive credit towards graduation requirements. The large majority of time spent in the elective involves teaching in the UCCOM Simulation Center where M4 student instructors teach first and second -year medical students. Each session, in addition to simulated patient case topics, will emphasize the applicat ion of a key topic within medical education (i.e. independent learning, clinical reasoning, reflective practice, and dual - process reasoning). Student instructors will utilize a variety of resources to reinforce these topics along with dedicated time for in dividual and group reflection on the application of medical education topics. Student teachers also further investigate medical education pedagogy to incorporate during teaching sessions. Student instructors will also deliver informal lunch talks, create a clinical teaching podcast, attend resident as teacher didactics, and reflect on their performance as educators by watching recordings of their sessions in CS with faculty. Evaluation Plan: During each session, student learners and course directors will b e asked to complete an anonymous survey evaluating the performance of the student instructor. The survey will use Likert scales to evaluate: instructor's effectiveness of teaching about case topic, instructor's ability to promote a collaborative learning e nvironment, and instructor's ability to provide feedback about clinical reasoning to student learners. The survey will include a space for open -ended comments on teaching from both student instructors and faculty. Course directors will utilize video review to further evaluat e the performance of student instructors after each session. Course director surveys will include a Likert scale rating student instructor's teaching effectiveness, promotion of collaborative learning environment, and provision of actionable feedback. Potential Impact: A novel CTE for fourth- year medical students that emphasizes medical education pedagogy prepares students to become effective residents. Additionally, it may fill a teaching shortage, improve pre -clinical education, and en hance professional identity formation for students prior to residency. 100References: 1) Bree KK, Whicker SA, Fromme HB, Paik S, Greenberg L.

Tyson School of Medicine Problem Statement : Medical educators face the challenge of building and strengthening community for first-year medical students during a pandemic. Rationale: The pandemic has altered the way we train health care providers (1). Medical schools have had to adjust teaching models to ensure that students get a quality education (2). Ensuring that students at a new medical school can build the community that is central to learning and is particularly difficult during a pandemic, presents a unique challenge (3). So cial learning theory suggests that interaction with and observation of others in a social context is integral to learning (4). However, the need for distancing and masks and the shift of some in -person learning activities to an online environment alters and adds complexity to these social interactions. Without traditional opportunities to build community, students are at risk of failing to learn the relational sk ills that are critical to being a physician. To address these issues, we designed a Community Ag reement activity that used several educational technologies to foster a sense of community. Methods: An entering medical school class created a community agree ment through assigned pre - session tasks and a 90 -minute synchronous session via Zoom. Students p articipated in- person in small, physically distanced groups in a classroom equipped with a Zoom- connected collaboration board. To avoid digital inequities, students were provided MS Surface Book 2 laptops preloaded with software, digital pens, an iPhone, and headsets. Pre- session activities included reviewing a community agreement framework and reflecting on the prompt: \"What do you need from your classmates in order to feel safe and supported so you can do your best work?\" The session started with a short, didactic exercise followed by a move to Zoom breakout rooms. Students shared their learning needs in the small group as a volunteer collected themes and ideas on the Zoom whiteboard. After discussion, students wrote an agreement statement with a partner and uploaded it to a shared Poll Everywhere Q&A survey. In sync with their classmates, students used their laptops or iPhones to individually up - or down- vote th e statements. Students reviewed and discussed the statements and returned to the main room where a representative reported the group's support or dissent of statements before students cast a final individual up -or down- vote. The agreement was finalized by a student representative from each group in a follow- up meeting facilitated by the Office of Student Affairs. Results: The community agreement building session was completed by the 2020 entering class at Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine (KPSOM) durin g the 1st week of the Early Immersive Experience (EIE) course. Six classrooms were mapped out to accommodate students in- person, following COVID- 19 safety restrictions and all 50 students attended in -person along with their facilitators. Since students posted their prework paragraphs onto our LMS for their small group peers to review before class, th ey came together quickly to generate community agreement statements. A total of 29 statements were generated with strong support for 12 after the second -ranking vote. Student representatives finalized the agreement during the final EIE week with 10 statements that included both relational and operational agreements in addition to aspirational statements consistent with KPSOM's mission, vision, and values. The final agreement was shared with the KPSOM community and will be edited or renewed annually. The Zoom- based session allowed a large group to come together to create an agreement with individual input from everyone. Anecdotal feedback on the activity was strongly positive. Our Founding Dean and CEO noted that the student -created Community Agreement was, \"sophisticated, thoughtful, and respectful.\" We will follow this and subsequent cohorts through their years at KPSOM and monitor the role of community agreements in establishing and upholding a positive learning environment. Potential Impact : Our Community Agreement activity will serve as a model for how medical educators can use technology to build and foster community during uncertain times. Medical educators s hould 102develop these skills and infrastructure in advance to enable the flexibility to pivot more efficiently while still achieving the objectives of community building.

Need /Rationale: Empathy has traditionally shown a decline in the third year of Medical School, which can lead to a loss of resilience and eventual burnout (1). This curriculum is comprised of exercises from the Lynn Leadership Group that emphas ize the emotional intelligence indices of self -awareness, self - regulation, others awareness, and relationsh ip management (2). Participants engage in these exercises through reflective work in order to help them think logically, communicate clearly, and meet the Physician Competency Reference Set (PCRS) #8 - Personal and Professional Development (3). Methods: A curriculum comprised of exercises from the Lynn Leadership group would be deployed over a period of one year. These exercises would aim to equip participants to fulfill the PCRS #8 - Personal and Professional Development Indicies (3): (1) Develop the abil ity to use self- awareness of knowledge, skills, and emotional limitations to engage in appropriate help -seeking behaviors; (2) Demonstrate healthy coping mechanisms to respond to stress; (3) Manage conflict between personal and professional responsibilities; (4) Practice flexibility and maturity in adjusting to change with the capacity to alter behavior; (5) Demonstrate trustworthiness that makes colleagues feel secure when one is responsible for the care of patients; (6) Provide leadership skills that enha nce team functioning, the learning environment, and/or the health care delivery system; (7) Demonstrate self -confidence that puts patients, families, and members of the health care team at ease; (8) Recognize that ambiguity is part of clinical health care and respond by using appropriate resources in dealing with uncertainty. Evaluation Plan: An emotional intelligence self -survey would be deployed to measure the 4 dimensions of emotional intelligence: self -awareness, self -regulation, others awareness, and relationship management. This would be administered before and after participation in the emotional intelligence curriculum to determine if students are retaining information from the course. Potential Impact : This curriculum has the potential to increase empathy and interpersonal success for third-year medical students, thereby fulfilling the Physician Competency Reference Set (PCRS) #8 - Personal an d Professional Development (3).

Need /Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic has brought on an unprecedented lack of summer clinical opportunities for medical students. The most important part of medical education training comes from experiences gained from direct patient care, therefore the need to find alternatives cannot be overemphasized. Online programs have traditionally been used for independent assessment, evaluating knowledge based off of a patient scenario rather than as a comprehensive learning tool. The goal of the AtlaMed National Medical Fellowships (NMF) - Primary Care Leadership Program (PC LP) is to increase the number of primary care physician leaders committed to careers in medically underserved communities. Our scholars illustrate that when given the right tools and resources, online medical education clinical training is not only feasible but moreover, beneficial in teaching clinical skills. Methods: AltaMed PCLP scholars had 47 hours of virtual clinical time embedded into the curriculum using Kaplan's iHuman platform, supplemented by a variety of virtual workshops including presentation s on mentoring and motivational interviewing. In addition to a traditional medicine curriculum, the program emphasized patient -centered communication and social determinants of health screening through a health equity lens. Through a tiered- mentorship appr oach, scholars were presented a patient case by the program director, reviewed the case with their designated partner, and taught the case to AltaMed Health Careers Opportunity Program pre -med scholars with faculty support. Evaluation Plan: The virtual co mponent of the program was evaluated through a pre and post -survey, daily written evaluations, and a qualitative focus group. Scholars' confidence in how to take a patient history and physical, screen for social determinants of health, develop patient trea tment and management plans, gather essential and accurate patient info rmation, convey patient findings to peers, and how to demonstrate patient- centered communication all increased. In addition, to evaluate the impact of a virtual platform on student engag ement, we compared surveys with the previous summer 2019 AltaMed PCLP on- site program, which scored extremely high in these categories. The results showed no drop off in developing a sense of comradery, community, and feeling supported by faculty and staff. In the future, scholars' knowledge gained will be evaluated through a series of objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), surveys, and free -response questions. The OSCE rubric developed will emphasize a health equity component screening for soc ial determinants of health. Potential Impact : The AltaMed Summer Program demonstrates that, with vetted faculty who have a passion for teaching, scholars who are committed to serving the medically underserved, and a strong curriculum foundation, online cl inical platforms may be used to develop future physician le aders who are committed to achieving health equity.

Need /Rationale: Studies have shown medical students have a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression than age- matched peers and up to 11% admit to suicidal thoughts in the past year (1). Help - seeking behavior is often avoided due to perceived norms which dictate that having a mental health problem can be viewed as a weakness or can lead to decreased success in their career (2). To address this problem, the LCME guidelines now call for \"an effe ctive system of personal c ounseling for its medical students that includes programs to promote their well -being and to facilitate their adjustment to the physical and emotional demands of medical education\" (3). A pilot study consisting of resident- led voluntary reflection groups for medical students found that over 90% of participants agreed the groups helped them feel more connected to one another. Additional wellness- related benefits were observed indicating that this is a promising model that deserves f uture study (3). We aimed to enhance support and decrease the stigma of help -seeking through the start of a student -led peer support network at Wayne State University School of Medicine (WSUSOM). Rather than one to one student support, the program focuses on interaction in group se ttings to build community. Methods: Med2Med was created as a student -run Peer -to-Peer support pilot program that was available to all 600 pre -clerkship students. An introductory anonymous survey was sent to all first - and second- year students to gauge int erest before implementation. Over 84% (n=54) of respondents stated that a program like this is needed within the medical school and over 80% (n=54) stated that they would attend at least one session. Sessions took place once a month from June 2019 until February 2020 with 20+ students in attendance. The program started as 1 -hour lunchtime sessions led by medical students who completed training in mental health first -aid. Students were broken into small groups and asked to discuss their \"rose and thorn\" of t he week or their high and low points. It was then up to the students, with the assistance from Med2Med leaders, to facilitate healthy dialogue around life stressors, working to connect to their peers on a deeper level. Stud ent leaders were mentored by a ps ychiatry faculty member. During the COVID -19 pandemic, we switched to an online format, using Zoom to host virtual sessions. Using this virtual method, we expanded to all 1200 students. Virtual sessions have had fewer stude nts in attendance than in -person programs, encouraging us to tailor Med2Med more effectively to a virtual environment and meet students' diverse needs. We plan to evaluate this program's impact and its potential for incorporation into wider efforts to expand mental health resources. Evaluation Plan: We will continue to track Med2Med sessions to ensure we are reaching our target level of one session per month. We are in the process of developing a program evaluation survey which aims to assess four factors: social support, learning environ ment, self -efficacy to manage stressors and mental health, and mental wellbeing. Students will also be asked how this program could expand to further meet their needs, for example through changes in meeting time/frequency or topic- focused sessions. Surveys will be first be administered to all pre -clerkship students and results will be compared between those students who have attended at least one Med2Med session and those students who have not attended any Med2Med sessions. We will then expand surveys to cl erkship students and results will again be compared between those who have attended at least one virtual session and those who have not. We will ask students if attendance increased their likelihood to seek help when needed. We will integrate student feedb ack into our session planning, making adjustments as needed. Potential Impact : After two years of Med2Med sessions, students have shared many positive anecdotes. If this pilot program proves to be impactful, it will serve as an example of how student- 106initiated programs with faculty support may positively impact student wellbeing and the learning environment.

Need /Rationale: Studies of North American medical students show a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression than age- matched peers (1). In response, the LCME guide lines now call for \"an effective system of personal counseling for its medical students that includes programs to promote their well -being and to facilitate their adjustment to the physical and emotional demands of medical education\" (2). A recent study al so found that medical students are experiencing increased anxiety due to the COVID -19 disruption, yet are less likely to seek support (3). To date, there is little data on the impact of virtual wellness initiatives on medical students' overall health, but as we were forced to adapt to a virtual educational setting, we must also continue to support student health on this new platform in accordance with the LCME guidelines. With these realities in mind, programming at Wayne State University School of Medicine (WSUSOM) pivoted to virtual student and faculty -run initiatives rapidly developed to prioritize student wellness during the pandemic and beyond. As the larg est single- campus medical school in the U.S., our virtual initiatives allow us to reach all of our students and appeal to various student interests and needs. Methods: Our virtual wellness initiatives were targeted to all 1200 medical students and can be divided into three categories: 1) optional initiatives held live over Zoom, 2) mandatory curriculum held live over Zoom, and 3) ongoing initiatives held on social media platforms. For optional initiatives on Zoom, students were asked to vote on a list of p otential initiatives through a poll on each class' Facebook page. Students voted on the sessions th ey found most appealing. Initiatives with less than four student votes were not implemented. 6 -15 sessions were offered every month starting in April 2020. V irtual small groups were conducted over Zoom and consisted of 3 -15 students who signed up for initiatives of their choice, led primarily by fellow students. Virtual initiatives included CrossFit workouts, yoga classes, Med2Med (a virtual support network), bring- your- own pet therapy, book discussions, how -to cook sessions, and meditation. Mandatory curriculum includes large group wellness -focused panels for each class of 300 students. Ongoing initiatives held on social media included a 21 -day meditation chal lenge via WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram wellness challenges. The meditation challenge was led by a student who sent reflection prompts to interested peers through a WhatsApp group. Instagram photo challenges consisted of monthly topics pertaining to sel f-care and health. Students submitted photos to Instagram for their peers to see, fostering a sense of community online. Evaluation Plan: These initiatives were developed to support student wellness in a virtual setting and foster connections between peer s to reduce feelings of isolation. We will continue to track the number of sessions offered to make sure we are reaching our target level of initiatives per month. Following future optional virtual initiatives, we plan to assess student wellness based on factors of physical health, mental health, and sense of overall support through a student survey after event participation. We will continue to track student participation based on Zoom attendees and social media participants to gauge which initiatives fost er the most interest. Student feedback of all mandatory curriculum events will continue to be analyzed. Comments or additional recommendations made by participating students will be reviewed. Overall improvements in student wellness will be assessed throug h our bi- annual survey of all students at WSUSOM. If proven to be impactful through our surveys and evaluations, we will further adapt our initiatives for long -term sustainability. We will continue to integrate our virtual initiatives into our health and wellness curriculum as we adapt to a more virtual society in the upcoming years. Potential Impact : Supporting future physicians' wellness is vital because of its impact on physician health and patient care. Understanding which virtual initiatives foster a sense of community can help 108medical schools create a positive environment for students, using both optional and mandatory sessions, especially during times of increased stress and isolation.

Need /Rationale: Medical training is hallmarked by multiple transitions that disrupt the usual responsibilities by systematically placing more leadership tasks and responsibilities on trainees. Transitions consist of personal characteristics, task readiness and contextual factors. The interse ction of these three components is how one navigates discontinuity potentially leading to burnout or satisfaction. Grit and mindset are included und er the category of personal characteristics. Opportunity exists to foster these characteristics in residents, thereby enhancing personal growth and performance. One of the major challenges to residency training is the high level of burnout and attrition. R esident burnout has been associated with greater risk of medical error and decreased patient satisfaction. M indset, Grit and Emotional Intelligence are concepts which have been applied in leadership development. They have each been associated with improved performance and well -being. Through this framework of a mentorship based program, we hope to reduce attriti on in surgical residency and improve personal growth and career satisfaction through a structured program in Grit, mindset and emotional intelligence. Methods: Faculty mentors will be required to attend a workshop on Grit, Mindset, Emotional Intelligence and Well -Being (known as \"core concepts\"). At the conclusion of these sessions, faculty will be able to: Discuss the core concepts. Utilize these co ncepts as they provide mentorship and coaching to their assigned mentees. Develop learning plans incorporating these concepts. Identify residents in which any of these concepts are threatened. Promote the use of these concepts in the learning environment a s they teach and provide evaluative data. PGY1 residents will participate in the mentorship program. Interns complete an online assessment tool for the core concepts. They will be provided with their results. Individual data will only be disclosed to progr am administration if the data from the well -being index demonstrates that the individual is at high risk for personal or professional consequences. During orientation, the residents will participate in a1.5 hour workshop to review these concepts and the mentorship program. At the conclusion, trainees will be able to outline these core concepts and utilize them during their meetings with mentors. Mentorship meetings are expected to occur several times per year. In addition, ABSITE scores, faculty and peer ev aluations will be reviewed during the meetings. Faculty will incorporate the core concepts as they develop i ndividual learning plans across all six ACGME competencies, promote wellbeing and career development. Evaluation Plan: The first marker of the succ ess of this program will be the percentage of residents and faculty who complete the core concept surveys di stributed periodically throughout training. Second, feedback received during the workshops will be important. Suggested areas for improvement will b e evaluated and reviewed for workshop enhancement with the goal of maximal engagement. Concluding the first year of training, each resident will complete a brief reflection on the mentorship program and how/if it has benefited them. We ask them to comment on whether core concepts have been incorporated into daily life and professional development. Long term succ ess will be determined by noting trends in attrition as they compare to core concept survey scores as well as the success of remediation along the A CGME competencies of professionalisms, interpersonal skills and communication. Our program is in its first y ear after two local surgical residencies combined to form one program. No one should be left behind and all trainees (and faculty) have the support they need. This program will help the clinical curriculum committee be alerted to developing issues and provide residents and faculty with tools to be successful professionally and personally. 110Potential Impact : The core concepts presented in this idea hav e implications to reduce burnout, enhance professional satisfaction and promote a culture of mutual respect, support and positivity. These factors will translate to improved clinical outcomes and overall success of our program. References: 1) Jorie M. Colber t-Getz, Steven Baumann, Kerri Shaffer, Lamb, Janet E.

GME staff will use virtual storytelling to find renewed meaning and connection with their work. Need /Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic has forced many employees to work remotely. This sudden and prolonged work environment has resulted in staff members experiencing a d isconnection with other team members. The staff have expressed issues of social isolation, decreased sense of well -being and disengagement due to the loss of structure and routine. The use of storytelling supports improved engagement, teamwork, well -being and ultimately, shared team goals (1). Methods: The interventi on will focus on the 15 GME staff over a 6 -month timeframe. The intervention will include the following 1) Videotaped interviews of each staff member to share their 'story of self' (1) using script and prompts. Each interview will last up to 20 minutes. 2) Staff will have access to these video sessions of team members on demand. 3) Staff will complete their reflection on the process, the impact that they experienced sharing their story, and hear ing other team member's stories . Evaluation Plan: An engagemen t survey will be used pre - and post -activity to measure the change in participant views and perceptions associated with their work and well -being as a result of the intervention. Potential Imp act: In order to adjust to the new reality of working remotely, opportunities and interventions to enhance well -being and connection with others using innovative methods such as virtual storytelling must be explored.

Need /Rationale: Clear evidence from studies (1) have shown that residents and their faculty lack sufficient education and training in teaching and teaching assessment. Studies (1,2) have also demonstrated the efficacy and satisfaction of various teaching programmes. Based on an informal anecdotal survey of local medical students, residents and faculty, there is a perceived need from all learner levels to improve the quality of teaching skills, teaching assessment methods and delivery of feedback on teaching. Based on eff ective resident -as-teachers curricula by others (1,3) and applying the principles of collaborative medical education, we have planned an intervention aimed to improve teaching effectiveness of both residents and faculty within the UMKC orthopedic surgery r esidency program. Ultimately the goal is to equip the participants to effectively fulfill their roles as teacher, learner and leader throughout their careers. Methods: This idea was crafted with orthopedic residents as learners and their faculty as teache rs in mind. Residents will be divided based on training year and paired with faculty into collaborative learning groups. Groups will attend quarterly classroom -based 2- hour sessions facilitated by a medical education expert. Each year, residents would be g rouped with attendings according to the upcoming year's rotation schedule. Learners would participate in active learning techniques such as interactive lectures, role play and simulation, reflective writing, video analysis and small group discussions. The curriculum will aim to teach the principles of educational theory and adult learning as well as practical skills appropriate for each learner level. They will also participate in interactive exercises to practice their teaching skills with feedback. The qu arterly workshops would culminate in an OSTE for the residents that faculty would evaluate. The faculty would discuss their evaluations and debrief with the facilitator providing direct feedback to the residents. Longitudinally the residents and faculty wi ll be paired for yearlong teaching mentorships. OBJECTIVES: At the end of the sessions, learners should be better able to: 1 - Describe the main principles of collaborative education 2 - Apply the principles of adult learning to their clinical teaching 3 - Express confidence, comfort and willingness to improve teaching within their program Evaluation Plan: Workshop attendance sheets and adherence to the teaching plan will assess accountability. Post -workshop surveys and final yearly program evaluation will determine participant reaction such as satisfaction, perceived learning and program efficacy and quality of teaching sessions. Comparing pre/post written test scores, review of self -reflections, resident OSTE scores and review of faculty assessments a nd feedback will determine learning. End- of-rotation performance evaluation forms focusing on teaching and follow up on commitments to act will assess learner behaviour. Impact will be assessed by learner evaluation forms of their supervisors and subsequen t participation and interest from faculty and residents. Potential Impact : Potential institutional impact is significant for improvement in the education and educational satisfaction of faculty, residents and students, generalizable to all specialties and institutions. Specifically, the hope would be to help streamline and standardize the learning experience within the program. 113References: 1) Hill G, et al.

Need /Rationale: The ACGME specifies proficiency in basic educational and assessment activities as a core competency for resident physicians. However, many programs lack formal training to prepare residents for these responsibilities. Results from a needs assessment at our pro gram suggest that residents and faculty perceive variability in the effectiveness of senior residents as clinica l teachers. Furthermore, our residents feel that they would benefit from more formal training on clinical teaching skills. Formal \"Resident as T eacher\" curricula have been shown to improve both skills and confidence of residents as educators. However, existing curricula often focus on preparing residents for elective rotations or protected teaching shifts. Residency programs in resource -limited se ttings or those with high levels of resident autonomy may rely more heavily on residents for day -to-day clinical teaching of junior learners. Indeed, results from our needs assessment suggest that senior residents in our program perform the majority of on -shift teaching. In these environments, such models may inadequately prepare senior residents for such a substant ial teaching role. Thus, we sought to design a rigorous, longitudinal teaching curriculum to meet this need. Methods: Prior to developing our local teaching curriculum, we piloted our needs assessment survey with a member of each stakeholder group to ensu re clarity and feasibility. Finalized surveys were then emailed to all 76 PGY1 -PGY4 residents and to 10 emergency medicine facul ty within the division of medical education. Based on the results of this survey, a teaching skills curriculum will be implement ed targeting our 20 current PGY2 residents, spanning the end of their PGY2 year into the beginning of their PGY3 year. The cours e will be scheduled during protected educational time and will include three, 90 - minute sessions on a video conferencing platform and one in -person didactic session in June 2021. At the outset of the curriculum, participants will be asked to create persona l development goals for themselves as resident educators. Using modalities such as lecture, small group discussion, and simulate d teaching exercises, faculty educators will cover topics such as bedside teaching skills, diagnosing learner needs, and giving and receiving feedback. During mock teaching exercises, residents will be directly observed by education division faculty to ens ure targeted, real -time feedback. Participants will also be given proctored time to create and share their own teaching material s such as visual learning aids for on- shift mini- review talks. A final session in early PGY3 year will require residents to refl ect upon their application of techniques developed during the curriculum. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We will track the number and duration of curriculum sessions as well as resident attendance at both video and in -person sessions. 2) Reaction: Participants will evaluate individual sessions through brief end -of-session evaluation forms; additionally, follow -up surveys at the end of the curriculum will elicit resident feedback on course educators, content and curricular design. 3) Learning: Participants will be asked to recall topics covered during previous sessions at the start of every new session. Resident teaching behaviors will also be assessed through direct observation during in-person simulated encounters as described above. Following complet ion of the curriculum, residents and faculty will complete follow- up surveys to evaluate senior residents' confidence, motivation and effectiveness in clinical teaching, in comparison to pre- intervention results. 4) Behavior: Early in their PGY3 year, participants will be asked to reflect on their experiences with clinical teaching since the completion of the curriculum. A t this time, they also will develop a commitment -to-act for future clinical teaching opportunities that will be reviewed as part of their semi -annual evaluation with a residency office faculty member. 115Potential Impact : This innovation could improve on -shift education in our program for both resident teachers and learners, while also preparing residents for future teaching roles in other pr actice environments. If effective, it could serve as a model for other training programs with similar clinical learning needs in high- volume, resource -limited settings.

Acad Poster Ses sion 3: Communication Skills Development / Humanism and Professionalism, Poster #026 Integrating EHR into the Current Pre -Clinical Curriculum at the UCSD School of Medicine Halabi, Reem; Clay, Brian; Rifkin, Dena; Lander, Lina University of California San Diego School of Medicine Idea: To integrate EHR use into an existing part of the pre -clinical education at the UCSD School of Medicine, the Problem Based Learning s essions. Need /Rationale: The use of EHR has been widely adopted worldwide for its safer data storage, ease of communication, organization, and billing compared to paper charts. EHR, however, has certain disadvantages, such as potential breaches of confidentiality, difficulty navigating charts, and increased administrat ive burden, which has led to physician burnout (1). To tackle these challenges, many institutions have realized the need for EHR training early in the curriculum. In a survey conducted by the AAMC, 140 out of 141 medical schools indicated that their studen ts used EHR during clinical clerkships during the 2014- 2015 academic year (2). Despite this, EHR training remains limited in the pre -clinical curriculum. The AMA acknowledged these shortfalls in medical school and residency program EHR training systems and designed a policy in 2018 that encourages all institutions to develop EHR training to prepare trainees for the clinical rotations (3). This project will demonstrate pathway one medical schoo l is taking to provide opportunities for students to practice EHR skills and gain confidence in navigating the EHR prior to the start of their clinical rotations. Methods: 1) Integration of PBL case into EHR format: One PBL case will be selected from the late - Winter and Spring quarters of the MS1 curriculum at the UCSD School of Medicine. By then, students are expected to have become familiar with the structure of PBL sessions. The case will be selected based on multiple criteria including a) Length: shorter cases will be given preference to lower pressure on students' and facilitators' times during the sessions, and b) Cases with lab values and images (X -ray, MRI...etc.) will be given preference so as to teach students how to access such data. Each PBL cas e is normally discussed over two sessions, which include seve ral follow up visits. Each visit will be integrated into the EHR including any associated lab values, exam findings, etc. The visits will still be introduced in sequential order; meaning students will not be able to proceed to the next visit until the one before has been viewed. 2) Instruction material: Guidelines on how to navigate the case and access specific patient information will be developed and provided to faculty and students prior to the case. Addition of EHR component will not change the case lea rning objectives and facilitators will be provided additional guidance on how to navigate the case in the non- production EHR. Students may refer to the developed instructional materials during cl erkships. Evaluation Plan: A post- session survey will be adm inistered to the students after each case to assess students' perception of their own comfort with EHR before and after the case, and their general attitudes towards the experience. The survey wi ll be anonymous and administered via Qualtrics, an online platform. Potential Impact : Electronic Health Records have been largely adopted worldwide, and every physician must be proficient in using the EHR as part of patient care. In most settings, medical students are expected to develop proficiency in using the EHR during their clinical years. This project will help prepare UCSD students for such expectations. 117 References: 1) Downing NL, Bates DW, Longhurst CA.

Need /Ration ale: While people with disabilities (PWD) are the largest minority group in the United States, most medical school curricula lack explicit content that teaches students to care for PWD. Recent data shows that 52% of medical schools, at most, incorporate any kind of disability education during students' four years of training. [1] The lack of organized curricula leaves medical students and, ultimately, physicians without the tools to provide culturally and medically competent care for their patients, leading to poor health outcomes among PWD and patient dissatisfaction with care. [2] In evaluating our medical school's curriculum, we found that there was no explicit detailed training on how to screen for and assess patients with a disability during a clinical encounter. Yet, all clinicians will undoubtedly care for patients with one or more disabilities (including physical, sensory, intellectual, developmental, mental health) during their careers. We saw the need to develop and implement curricular content to p repare medical students to interview PWD and assess patients' abilities to interact with their environments, access healthcare, and engage in their communities. Methods: We expanded our medical school's Interviewing and Communication Skills (ICS) course t o provide first-year students with their first formal exposure to screening for functional impairment and interviewing PWD. Specifically, we embedded functional history as a subsection of the full social history students learn to obtain for all patients, a nd developed a mul timodal suite of materials/experiences to teach the functional history. Our approach was informed by literature review and input from medical students and educators with and without disabilities. Each 160 - student first -year class will receive this functional history training beginning in November 2020. Students will receive an ICS course guide with a functional history section that provides a rationale, a graphic tool we designed to guide functional assessment, related readings, and required written reflection questions about experiences with disability. Students will also be directed to a video we created that includes student and faculty testimonials and a short lecture to 1) highlight potential barriers to conducting complete clinical e ncounters with PWD, and 2) describe how physicians can mitigate these barriers. Students will apply content from these materials during the 3- hour ICS social history session, which will include practice obtaining a functional history from PWD in real -time and a de- brief with peers and faculty. Evaluation Plan: We will use qualitative assessment methods to evaluate our curricular content. Prior to the social history session, students will complete a set of reflection questions that assess their previous experience(s) with di sability and expectations for their interviews with PWD, providing a baseline of students' familiarity with the function and disability content we are presenting. After the social history session, students will complete a reflection on th eir encounters with PWD, as interviewers and/or as observers. We will perform thematic analysis on pre -and post -session reflections to assess themes of comfort and confidence in caring for PWD, perspective on skills necessary for successful encounters with PWD, the language used when referring to PWD, and learning needs relating to disability. In addition, we will review standard course feedback to inform iterative improvements to our function and disability module. Combined, this evaluation plan will enable us to examine the impact of our curricular intervention on skill development and sensitivity to disability, as well as the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention within the context of the Interviewing and Communication Skills course overall. 119Potential Impact : Our curricular content aims to train the next generation of physicians to address function during clinical encounters and provide sensitive, comprehensive care for PWD. We plan to disseminate our materials beyond our institution to advance the needed expansion of explicit disability education in U.S. medical schools. References: 1) Seidel E, Crowe S.

Rationale: An estimated 8% of people in Cal ifornia suffer from substance use disorders (SUDS) and, in 2017, there were 2199 opioid related overdose deaths in the state (1, 2). Primary care physicians are on the front line of preventing, identifying and treating people w ith SUDS and opiate use disor der (OUD), and yet a minority of primary care physicians finish their residency training ready to treat patients with SUDS and licensed to prescribe medication assisted treatment (MAT) (3). This project aimed to improve resident knowledge and attitudes tow ards caring for people with substance use disorders by integrating the patient experience into the residency curriculum. Methods: We recruited patients with lived experience of substance use disorders to teach family medicine residents about their experie nce of receiving care. We began by consulting with the Medical Center's Patient and Family Centered Care department, who operate seven councils with over 90 volunteer Patient Advisors. They provided advice about the process for recruiting new patient advis ors. We then recruited broadly for patients who were willing to share their stories. We developed promotional brochures, recruited face to face at patient groups, and had physician partners reach out patients. After several mon ths, we recruited 3 patients who were willing to share their stories. We developed a resident driven session which began by training residents in how to ask open ended questions, listen and engage well with patients. Then residents developed questions and interviewed patients about th eir experience of receiving care. Due to COVID we had to run the patient session virtually rather than in person. Even so, patient stories were remarkably powerful and left a big impression on residents. Results: We developed a survey to assess changes in knowledge and attitudes towards treating patients with substance use disorders among residents. Residents were surveyed before participating in the residency's substance use disorder curriculum and the survey will be repeated once residents complete the curriculum. Baseline data indicated that residents are very motivated to learn about substance use disorders and to use medication assisted treatment in their practice, with 100% of residents (n=18) interested in learning more a bout prescribing buprenorphine for treating opioid use disorders. While there was a high degree of motivation among residents to treat patients with substance use disorders, only 22% of residents felt comfortable diagnosing opioid use disorder before the t raining started. No residents (0%) felt comfortable treating patients with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. This indicates that further training is essential to ensure that future primary care doctors are appropriately equipped to treat chemical depe ndency and chronic pain. Potential Impact: Training the next generation of primary care physicians is critical for improving our community's ability to effectively treat patients with substance use disorders. This project is an important step forward to e nsure resident training is co mprehensive, evidence based, and patient centered.

Need /Rationale: Healthcare providers frequently experience difficult interactions with patients or their families and these are estimated to account for 15 -30% of all provider -patient -family interactions (1). The reasons can be multiple a nd at their most extreme involve patient or family incivility or aggression directed towards healthcare personnel. Multiple studies have documented the negative impacts of rude or aggressive behavior on provider and patient happiness, patient care and safety, healthcare teamwork efficacy and provider burnout (2). Despite their frequency, many providers report feeling inadequately prepared to deal with difficult patient or family intera ctions (3). Our own HRSA Pediatric Pulmonary Center fellows attribute thi s to inadequate formal training. To address this need, we propose a 2 -session class and workshop to explore the reasons for difficult provider -patient -family encounters and to explore, and then practice, practical strategies to prevent or mitigate breakdowns in communication. Our fellowship program includes fellows drawn from multiple disciplines within healthcare, including social work and psychology. We will use a pulmonologist and two social workers to facilitate the workshop. Methods: Learners will be ten post -graduate fellows drawn from different disciplines within healthcare (medicine, nursing, social work, dietary, psychology and respiratory therapy) and enrolled in our Children's Hospital Los Angeles HRSA -Maternal and Child Health Pediatric Pulmonar y Center training program. Learners will participate in a one -hour classroom session followed by a 2- hour workshop session delivered within weekly HRSA -fellowship meetings. In the first session, the nature of the problem will be introduced along with cours e goals and objectives. Participants will work in small groups to share previous experiences of difficult patients/families and develop cases for use during session 2 workshop role-playing. Prior to the second session, fellows will complete reading assignments to explore the theoretical basis of disruptive behavior and learn techniques for dealing with disordered communication. In the second session, clinical social workers wil l briefly review practical approaches to disruptive patients and families and discuss the effect of emotional state and implicit bias in communication. The workshop progresses to paired role -playing exercises to practice learned techniques. The session is concluded with a group review of lessons learned from the workshop and individual commitments to action. Evaluation Plan: (1) Accountability. The number of sessions, their duration, the number of attendees and professional demographics, the number of assignments submitted and cases discussed will be recorded for course review. (2) Rea ction. Course participants will complete an evaluation form at the end of the workshop session to assess the degree of new learning, perceived utility of workshop exercises and satisfaction with the workshop. (3) Learning: Fellows will be evaluated on an assignment (MEQ) submitted prior to the second session to assess main learning points from a book chapter and assigned original papers. This assignment will ask learners to des cribe an example of a difficult patient -provider - family interaction and apply the principles learned. At the end of the second session, learners will be assessed on their application of learned principles in role- playing exercises. (4) Behavior. Group follow- up and feedback will be solicited two months after the workshop to determine whether concepts and skills learned during the sessions have been applied to cases of a difficult patient or family. Reasons for not employing learned techniques will be assessed. Potential Impact : This workshop aims to develop the skillsets necessary to m anage difficult provider - patient -family interactions. One aim is to improve the satisfaction of both provider and patient in their interactions. Another potential outcome is improvement in quality of care. If successful, this workshop could be disseminated to other healthcare settings. 122References: 1) Van Servellen GM.

Need /Rationale: A recent survey of primary care physicians found that 87% expect to see increases in patients living with dementia in the next five years, with 51% noting inadequate options for continuing education and training (Alzhei mer's Association, 2020). Patients with dementia experience symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, disorien tation, and behavioral and psychological symptoms. Communicating effectively with these patients in medical or long -term care settings requires emp athy, active listening, and techniques such as validation and redirection. Improvisational (\"improv\") training has been shown to improve coping skills in family caregivers of people with dementia (Brunet et al., 2019) and is a technique used with increasing frequency in medical education (Hoffmann- Longtin et al., 2018). This novel workshop aims to teach trainees essential skills through improv for communicating effectively with patients with dementia, thereby improving the care provided to this growing segm ent of the population. Methods: This 90 minute workshop, piloted with a small group of geriatric medicine fellows, included an initial 30 minute lecture on a) common dementia symptoms and the communication barriers they create; b) group discussion of past interactions with patients or others with dementia symptoms, and the typical reactions they often illicit, including failed attempts to correct, reorient, or redirect; c) communication strategies; and d) the basic tenets of improvisation (e.g., active lis tening, agreement, partnership, flow, presence, and playfulness). The latter part of the workshop included active engagement with fellows, playing a series of improv \"games,\" such as Yes/No Storytelling, Word Association, and Mirroring. Games are demonstra ted by the instructor, and then facilitated in pairs or small groups. These activities are distinct from \"role playing\" physician -patient interactions, but rather involve verbal, visual, and physical exercises to demonstrate the impact of being seen, heard , and understood by others. Throughout, the instructor paused for trainees to reflect, discuss, an d apply the experiences to physician- patient interactions, focusing on the impact of listening skills, attention, and spontaneity on communications with patie nts with dementia. This workshop was originally designed to be taught in a physical classroom sett ing, however all improv activities were converted and implemented through a video- based online platform due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Evaluation Plan: This pilot workshop evaluated the following learning objectives: a) increased understanding of the challenges faced by people living with dementia and their family caregivers, and b) acquisition of new improv-based techniques for responding to patients with dementia experiencing memory loss, confusion, or disorientation. Pre - and post -surveys measured traine es' self -perception of their knowledge and skills in these areas before and after the workshop. The post -survey, gauged the effectiveness of the improvisation activities as a learning method, and inquired if the fellows incorporated any of the techniques into their communications with patients living with dementia in the 60-day period since attending the training. 66% (n=3) of the fellows reported that they hav e incorporated improvisational techniques into communications with patients living with dementia. Open -ended narrative questions provided trainees with an opportunity to share insights gained during the workshop, and offer suggestions for improvement. This pilot program administered to a small sample of fellows suggests positive perceptions of the training, achievement of the learning objectives, and utility in patient care. Potential Impact : Innovative teaching methods for building patient communication s kills are critical to prepare clinicians for the growing challenge of caring for patients living w ith dementia. Improvisation techniques can improve quality of care, and enhance trainees' experience by incorporating interactive play and movement into medical education instruction. 124References: 1) Alzheimer's Association (March 10, 2020). \"Primary Care Physicians on the Front Lines of Diagnosing and Providing Alzheimer's and Dementia Care: Half Say Medical Profession Not Prepared to Meet Expected Increase in De mands.\" Retrieved from https://www.alz.org/news/2020/primary- care-physicians -on-the-front-lines-of-diag 2) Brunet, Hannah E, Sarah J, Anne, Willingham -Jaggers, Melanie, and Alm\u00e9n, Ruth A. \"Training in Improvisation Techniques Helps Reduce Careg iver Burden and Depression: Innovative 3) Krista, Rossing, Jonathan P, and Weinstein, Elizabeth. \"Twelve Tips for Using Applied Improvisation in Medical Education.\" Medical Teache r 40.4 (2018): 351 -56. 125Thursday, 2/18/2021, 3:15 - 4:15 pm Poster Session 3: Communication Skills Development / Humanism and Professionalism, Poster #031 De-Escalation in the ER: Care of Acutely Agitated Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Patients Wattenba rger, Sara (1); Nyquist, Julie (2) (1) Kaweah Delta Health Care District Emergency Medicine Residency (2) Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: An innovative workshop wherein emergency medicine (EM) residents build verbal de -escalation skills for caring for acutely agitated patients. Need /Rationale: In the US, the number of emergency room visits for primary mental health complaints and substance use disorder is on the rise (1,2). Due to the nature of their illness these patients are at high risk of becoming agitated, necessitating the implementation of de -escalation techniques and in some cases, physical restraints and anxiolytic medications. Thus, emergency medicine (EM) physicians must demonstrate a high level of competence in managing these situations, creating the need for consistent, organized training for EM residents in caring for the acutely agitated patient. Unfortunately, 59% of EM residents in US residency programs state that more formal training is needed in managing psychobehavioral conditions (2). This idea involves the development of a formal curricular unit to assist residents in building verbal de -escalation and persuasion skills for proposing necessary medications to acutely agitated patients. Methods have been selected based on adult learning principles (Ambrose, 2010): 1) quality of learning is enhanced by goal- directed practice coupled with targeted feedback, and 2) mastery of concepts is achieved via integration and application. Methods: The intervention is planned fo r implementation wit h ten EM residents and will take place over the course of three sessions. The goal of the intervention is mastery of verbal de -escalation and persuasion skills for use with agitated patients in clinical practice. The method is a hybrid approach utilizing c lassroom -based and SIM modalities.1) The first two sessions (2 hours) are held in a classroom setting and introduce verbal de -escalation and persuasion techniques, utilizing the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA De-escalation Workgroup tool (3). Instructional methods include small group discussion where learners share one story of an incident with a patient; two -person role- play utilizing the resident stories submitted, and team interviews using an avatar. 2) Ses sion 3 (3 hours) is held in the simulation center where residents complete standardized SIM scenarios, integrating/applying skills acquired in the classroom. Session opens with a 15 minute introduction. Thereafter, each simulated interaction will take no m ore than 15 minutes, directly followed by 10 minute debriefing/assessment, and 5 minute passing period allowing station rotation. Each learner completes four total SIM cases. The final 45 minutes of session are allotted for group -wide debriefing, discussio n, and reflection. 3 ) Residents are assessed by a trained evaluator during each SIM, utilizing a standardized rubric. Debriefing sessions provide targeted and timely feedback. Evaluation Plan: Accountability will be ensured via tracking of attendance by t he targeted EM learners and successful execution of all program sessions. Learning will be assessed via 1) successful completion of standardized multiple -choice quiz following classroom sessions (with opportunity for a retake as necessary), and 2) successf ul application of acquired knowledge/skills as determined by an assessment of SIM cases by trained evaluators, utilizing a predetermined grading rubric and designated passing score. Residents' reactions will be assessed via a confidential survey after the workshop to determine if the workshop met their perceived need for formal instruction in managing acute psychobehavioral emergencies. This will be followed with a focus group convening 3 months following intervention to determine fulfillment of curriculum goals (i.e. successful integration of skills into clinical practice) and identify areas of needed improvement for future workshop sessions. Potential Impact : If this intervention is found to be effective, it could serve as a model for other emergency medi cine programs seekin g to enhance EM resident competence and confidence in treating psychobehavioral conditions, thereby providing safer and improved quality of care for patients suffering from psychiatric and substance disorder -related agitation. 126Referenc es: 1) Moore BJ, Stocks C, Owens PL.

Need /Rationale: Radiologists today face mounting expectations to conduct more direct patient communication as a matter of optimal patient -centered care from both patient groups and professional organizations.1- 9 The ACGME now requires that graduating radiology trainees be able to communicate \"complex and difficult information, such as errors, complications, adverse events, and bad news\".10 Radiologists face conside rable barriers to meeting these standards. Nationally, even veteran physicians experience substantial stress communicating with patients about unexpected or difficult diagnoses.12 Opportunities for robust ongoing ICS training or skill maintenance following completion of a radiology GME program are scattered and faculty express uncertainty is how best to teach these skills to trainees.12. 13 Several local academic radiology department' program evaluations demonstrated that interpersonal and communication skills teaching was suboptimal. Furthermore, radiology residents pursuing advanced training in or employment in increasingly patient -facing arenas of radiology reported being underprepared for engaging in difficult conversations with patients and families. Methods : As a pediatric hospitalist with an interest in teaching communication skills, I was approached to design a faculty development program for the radiology teaching faculty at 3 diagnostic radiology residency programs in the greater Hartford, CT region to further develop interpersonal and communication skills. The designed curriculum spans an entire academic year and consists of six 120- minute sessions. The sessions cover general principles of non -violent communication, crucial conversations and emotion al intelligence; developing rapport with limited prior contact; delivering \"bad news\"; diffusing highly -emotional situations; special considerations for communication with pediatric patients; and introduction to teaching and assessing ICS in the clinical setting. Given the limitations of the COVID -19 pandemic, and drawing from the literature of teaching ICS successfully to radiology residents, the major teaching techniques to be employed are virtual large group didactics, small group work viewing and debrie fing videos of communication interactions, individual work conducting and appraising personal emotional intelligence instrument scores, and standardized patient virtual encounters for skill -based practice with direct feedback. Evaluation Plan: To measure the effectiveness of this curriculum, I will conduct session evaluations following each installment and end -of-curriculum program eval uation assessing learner attitudes and reaction. Knowledge acquisition will be measured using pre -post brief multiple- choice assessments. Skill acquisition will be demonstrated using a standardized, published observational instrument, the Kalamazoo Communi cation Assessment Tool for Radiologists, for each specific learning case, video, or standardized patient interaction. In a ddition, self -report knowledge, skill, attitude changes will be measured pre -and post -curriculum. To evaluate for downstream effects w ithin the educational environment over time, resident scores on ICS sub -competencies could be tracked to demonstrate if faculty development translates into improved resident performance. For impact level outcomes, aggregate patient satisfaction scores could be compared pre- and post -curriculum to evaluate for behavioral change and impact on patient care. Potential Impact : Using approaches demonstrated to be successful in achieving long- term skill acquisition in radiology residents, this curriculum is designed to improve radiology faculty interpersonal and communication skills. The educational environment for the radiology trainees and patient care delivery by radiology faculty may also be enriched. 128References: 1) Kemp J, Mahoney MC, Mathews VP, et al.

Need /Rationale: The Humanism Symposium aims to create a space for preclinical medical students to reflect on personal and professional growth while engaging in meaningful conversations about compassionate patient care. Patient autonomy is well understood t o be an important factor in medical care. Patient -centered care has been associated with improved satisfaction and self -management. The physician -patient relationship has long been touted as sacred in literature, pop culture, and historic references. This connection is essential in maintaining optimum patient c are and preventing physician burnout. Integrating these values in preclinical medical education allows students to develop a philosophy for their own medical practice while simultaneously creating faculty and peer mentorship opportunities. In order to foster the caring nature that draws students to medicine, it is imperative to create a supportive learning atmosphere without losing sight of the ultimate goal: patient -driven care. The move to a virtual format is necessitated in the time of this global pandem ic. In the absence of in -person interaction, the human interaction and depth of conversation encouraged by The Symposium - regardless of its online format - will be paramount. Methods: Each session o f this course will be held on a virtual platform, Zoom. Weekly sessions will last for two and a half hours and be conducted over the course of 13 weeks. Session topics are decided by the student leaders, yet the course itself hinges on discussion led by current students. Student leaders, and often a panel of in vited faculty, act as facilitators for each session. A Google site for the course provides an online space hub of information. This includes a calendar and syllabus for the year, session information including assigned pre -readings, and an area to submit co urse requirements. Evaluation Plan: In a course developed to celebrate and highlight human interaction, a virtual format is not without its limitations. To address the lack of in -person meetings we have planned additional opportunities for small group, in -person, socially distanced activities. Instead of typical ice- breaker activities of years past, we will incorporate virtual improv- style activities designed to highlight the importance of communicati on and build a safe space amongst the students. Instead of moving to a corner of the room to participate in small groups, we will utilize Zoom breakout rooms to allow a smaller, more intimate space for more students to share their thoughts. Finally, we pla n to empower students to provide constructive feedback. We feel that room for flexibility to shifting aspects of our course layout, particularly in the virtual format, will be a crucial aspect of the methodology. Potential Impact: Given the goal of this c ourse to enhance and augment preclinical training and support, an evaluation will be conducted on a pass/fail basis. Passing the course will be contingent upon completion of requirements designed to foster collegiality among classmates and wellness for individuals. Requirements include: 1) leading a class discu ssion on assigned reading materials; 2) completion of three elective activities outside of the classroom designed to enhance wellness during the pandemic and/or connection to the city of Baltimore; 3) completion of a personal reflection highlighting a topic of the student's choosing from his/her life or interests; 4) completion and showcasing of a final creative project.

Develop critical analysis and elicitation of Type I & Type 2 narratives. Need /Rationale: This innovative pedagogical activity engaged medical and health professional students to use narrative analysis to examine ethical processes and decision making in medical contexts. It offers the opportunity to learn about medical ethics through the testim onies of individuals who were forced to participate in medical experiments in the name of science and advancement. Narrative analysis allows for participants to become aware of tacit assumptions, beliefs, and values about the world. Moral stance - taking in narrative analysis allows for participants to explore how human beings navigate ethical tensions and apparent contradictions in order to develop coherent identities across time and space (Barber & Moreno -Leguizamon, 2017). Holocaust narratives in particular are effective for navigating moral dilemmas in medicine (Clark, 2005). Students will specifically examine narratives as movements through contestation toward empowerment. Students will learn how participants in the testimonies engage in moral stan ce-taking concerning medical experiments during World War II. Ultimately, this activity takes students through a complete cycle of what it means to live, share, and analyze narratives as well as analyze effect and empathy. Methods: Prior to the activity, students read excerpts from articles about Nazi medical experiments. One article was about eugenics (\"Creating the Master Race'). The second article will be about euthanasia. Once the students had the necessary background information about the Holocaust, t he eugenics and euthanasia programs and its impact on medical ethics, they learned about narrative analysis and how it can help us understand the moral dilemmas and ethical practices of survivors of Nazi medical experimentation. Students then viewed the te stimoni es of selected Holocaust survivor(s). One example is the case of Eva Kor, who along with her twin sister, were subjected to dehumanization and medical experimentation. First, students watched all the testimony clips without transcripts. Then, studen ts watched the same clips with transcripts. This allowed for observation of the four levels of transcription: code, prosody, semiotics, and ideologies (Author 1, 2013). Students were asked to identify moral stances along the continuum of 1) Shock; 2) Anger; 3) Acceptance/Bargaining; 4) Empowerment. The second clip that students watched was of Jack Robbins, a Nuremberg Trials Expert witness who speaks broadly about the complicity of the medical profession during World War II. Students were asked to reflect on their moral stances and discuss. Evaluation Plan: Our evaluation consisted of both formative and summative performance measures. Our formative assessment included an analysis of classroom discourse transcripts and student writing. We specifically look for mor al stance- taking as well as narrative length to measure shifts in engagement. We used multiple codes in order to ensure the validity and reliability of our measures. Specifically, we coded moral stance -taking in relation to the narratives. Type I narratives were rated according to the five - point scale of moral stance, linearity, tellabiliy, tellership, and embeddedness. Thus, type 1 narratives consisted of singular moral stances, highly linear, high in tellability and tellership, and low in embeddedness. Type 2 narratives were emergent and opposite of the continuum: singular moral stance, low in linearity, low in tellability and tellership, and highly embedded. Thus, type 2 narratives pointed to moral dilemmas that were contradictory and in process. O ur summative assessment consisted of pre and post-tests with questions related to medicine, ethics, and WWII. This was used to establish a baseline in order to determine movement in ethical reasoning in relation to narrative analysis. Potential Impact : This peda gogical innovation contributes to the growing field of medical humanities and narrative medicine (Greene, Pearson, Uwhubetine, Rowley, & Chung, 2020). We demonstrate how 131medical instructors and students can use narrative analysis to understand the m oral di lemmas and ethical practices of the survivors of Nazi medical experimentations.

Need/Rationale: Patients living with disability experience significant disparities in both access to medical care and health outcomes [2]. One key area for improvement is within the physician -patient relationship. Many patients livi ng with a disability express concern that physicians are unable to fully understand their disabilities and needs. A dearth of disability education for physicians may directly perpetuate these inequities. Nationally, only half of all medical schools incorporate any kind of disability education into their 4- year curriculum [3]. In order to better serve patients with disabilities, we need to efficiently and expediently mobilize for curricular change within medical education. Part of this effort includes identi fying and capitalizing on opportunities to modify curricular elements common across many medical institutions. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman is a text commonly used in medical education to highlight differences between the Hmong culture and that of the United States healthcare system. The book centers a protagonist, Lia, who has a disability, which provides an opportunity to infuse disability themes within existing Spirit Catches You curricula. Methods: The Spirit Catches You is required reading for our school's incoming medical students. The curriculum relating to the book does not currently include a disability perspective. We created a 10 - minute presentation and shortlist of discussion questions centered around disability th emes in the book. We designed the materials t o complement the existing curriculum on the book's cultural themes. A fall 2021 implementation is being explored. The 160 -member first -year medical school class would receive the intervention during their first week of school, integrated into the existing Spirit Catches You curriculum. Students and faculty would be provided with our pre -recorded presentation and questions prior to existing 90 -minute book discussion groups (each 10 -12 students, faculty preceptor). An existing collaborative group writing assi gnment would provide the opportunity to articulate lessons learned. Our presentation centers around the question \"How is Lia's epilepsy understood by the various cultural groups represented in the book?\" We use three cultural lenses to explore the meaning of epilepsy for Lia and her family: Hmong, medical, and disability culture. Disability culture is defined, and students will be asked to reflect on the importance of disability culture in Lia's story. Definition s of epilepsy and disability will lay the fou ndation for discussion of medical and social models of disability. Live small group discussion questions emphasize cultural humility and intersectionality. Evaluation Plan: Our Spirit Catches You lesson will be assessed as a standalone curricular component and as the introductory disability experience in a longitudinal disability curriculum. As a standalone, impact on students' ability to articulate the principles of disability culture, humility, and intersectio nality will be assessed through thematic anal ysis of written discussion group assignments in response to the pre-existing prompt to list takeaways \"to use in the future to improve cross -cultural communication and care.\" Findings will be compared between ye ars pre -and post -implementation of our disability intervention. As part of a longitudinal disability curriculum, the assessment will include IRB -approved surveys that query a single medical school class year cohort about knowledge of disability terminology , culture, and healthcare disparities pre -and post-session. The cohort will also be surveyed over four years for 1) retention of principles presented in The Spirit Catches You curriculum, and 2) perception of the value of The Spirit Catches You curriculum in providing a foundation for integrating sub sequent disability knowledge and skills. Faculty focus groups will be used to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. 133Potential Impact : If effective, the materials presented here can introduce disability as a valued lens and imbue disability humility from the beginning of medical school, in turn providing a foundation for the development of a disability- sensitive workforce. The materials c an also be utilized within training programs across healthcare professions. References: 1) Fadiman, Ann e.

Need /Rationale: As a new medical school located in the bicultural/bilingual South Texas Rio Grande Valley region, we train competent, compassionate physicians who serve the needs of our underrepresented Hispanic community. We offer an innovative learning experience designed to instill superior standards of scientific, clinical, research, and professiona l acumen. Concurrently, central to a well-rounded graduate medical education (GME) curriculum is the prioritization of the art of caregiving. The perceived loss of empathy among resi dents in the clinical setting can lead to negatively impacted patient care and physician burn out. Teaching character is as important as teaching medical knowledge and patient care; however, they have traditionally not been awarded similar value in the modern medical curriculum. Character is part of the Accreditation Council for GME (ACGME)'s competency of professionalism, one of six categories in which learner progression is assessed in the training continuum. When encountering difficult situations, reside nts have the chance for sustained, thoughtful reflection, as well as to ap preciate and reconcile multiple perspectives to be better prepared to respond well when they encounter these dilemmas in the clinical setting. Methods: Objectives: Explore how a rts & humanities broaden clinical acumen; Improve self -expression through the arts Enhance the sense of emotional well -being & communication Expand the ability to self -express & analyze data by sharpening perceptions via art Augment ability to e ngage in clinical settings with empathy Foster creativity & appreciation of commonalities & differences through arts & humanities An introductory session will cover the role of humanities in medicine for the development of professionalism and empathy using avenues such as narrative medicine. Thereafter, we will host a quarterly competition to promote humanistic skill and professional conduct as it pertains to ethics and humanities through artistic expression. Each quarter, we will announce a different theme and invite participants to interpret the theme and submit a personal piece for the opportunity to win an award. Submissions may be original works of poetry, painting, music, and more. All submitted work will be published in an end- of-year compendium o f artistic works. In line with each quarterly competition, we will also host a workshop that mirrors the selected theme for that quarter, in which presenting faculty will review an aspect of medical education as it relates to that specific theme of humanit ies. Themes include: Bicultural & Bilingual Experience of the RGV Personal Reflections from Times of Crisis The Personal Experience of Being \"Different\" Racial Equity & Social Justice in Healthcare Evaluation Plan: Competencies and formative assessments have become the norm in medical education evaluation. Through the use of quarterly pre -and post -intervention surveys, focus groups and follow -up, we hope to demonstrate positive changes in medical student's and resident's professional interactions with patients, patient families, peers, and their medical community. Evaluations will include participants' perceptions on communication skills, capacity to collaborate, empathize, and achieve a patient -centered focus through person al and professional development and reflection. Sample questions 135used to collect reflections from participants will include how a session influenced their capacity to respond to patients or relate to their peers as well as how they feel medical humanities influence their role as a provider. Should deficiencies be identified, we will explore how program improvements can be made and implement these in the following year. These activities will ensure that evaluation methods are appropriate to the project's objectives. Potential Impact: Findings will be shared at regional and national meetings to spur creativity at other current partner institutions. Incorporating medical humanities in the curriculum will provide an overall impact on improved physicianship including empathy, compa ssion, patient care, and preventing burn out.

Need /Rationale: The twin pandemics of racial injustice and coronavirus have upended clinical practice in 2020. Students entering the health professions are grappling with questions that will follow them through their careers: How do I provide equitable care to all my patients? What does it mean to be a 'good clinician'? How do I retain a humanisti c spark in an increasingly technocratic environment? What is my purpose? While these questions a re not new to health professional students, the socially -distanced nature of virtual learning make it even harder for them to create the communities that are in tegral to professional identity formation; students who are isolated from peers are at higher ri sk of burnout and moral injury [1]. We have created a novel interprofessional virtual elective, bringing the resources of the medical humanities and medical eth ics to bear on these twin pandemics, allowing students to form new, trans- disciplinary connections that will inform their professional identity as they enter their respective careers. This work is funded by the Purpose Project at Duke University, a campus -wide initiative to promote student resilience and meaning- making in their educational careers. Methods: Students from the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Physical Therapy, and the Physician Assistant Program enrolled in the elective in September 2020 and wi ll complete at least 20 hours of coursework during the academic year. Each student in the elective chose one of several themed seminars, which meet monthly. To promote trusted communities, seminars are limited to 10 students each and co- led by two faculty members from different schools. For 2020 -2021, the themes are: Voices in Pandemic: Stories of Re sistance and Social Justice; Plague Literature, Past and Present; Documenting Pandemic through Photography; Epidemics, Disparities, and History; Covid Stories: Narrative medicine in the midst of Epidemic. The remaining 8 hours of credit are earned through a menu of options: Bioethics Interest Groups (1 hr each): Monthly discussion of pertinent topics in bioethics; Book club: (4 hr) Reading & discussion of a narra tive related to pandemics or race in healthcare; Pandemic movie nights (3 hr): Share a movie exp erience and explore connections to COVID- 19; Walks through Social History (2 -3 hr each): Covid- permitting, walks to local areas exploring how history has shaped health disparities. Humanities in Medicine Lectures (1 hr each): Invited speaker series, if related to disparities, disease, and/or social justice; Webinars (1 -2 hr each): Online webinars sponsored by campus organizations or external events, if related to pandemics or social justice. Evaluation Plan: Students will be evaluated on seminar participat ion as well as short written reflections on their individual options chosen. Students also took the Interprofessional Attitudes Scale [2] immediately after enrollment and will take it again at the end of the course. Pre -post exploratory analysis will be co nducted to determine if participation in the elective increased students' comfort with interprofessional teams. Additionally, focus groups will be conducted at the conclusion of this pilot elective in order to develop additional options for future years. Potential Impact : This elective has the potential to influence the development of future interprofessional and trans -disciplinary teaching at our institution and at others. The predominantly virtual format is translatable to a variety of locations and coul d even allow the possibility of cross -institutional collaboration in future.

Need /Rationale: Cultural safety, when the receiver or care determines whethe r the care received was safe, is important for all individuals. In Canada, there is a history of racism and trauma in flicted on Indigenous populations in addition to health disparities relative to non -indigenous populations. The Truth and Reconciliation Co mmission of Canada 2016 called for medical education to implement cultural safety training related to Indigenous health (2). The Royal College of Canada has also included Indigenous health in the learning objectives for accredited programs across Canada. P rior to the implementation of this curriculum, these objectives have not been formally incorporated into the PM&R res idency program educational curriculum at the University of Alberta. Methods: The curriculum content will cover and expand on the informati on in the Royal College of Canada Indigenous Health Primer (3), including key terminology, an outline of the historical trauma, the spectrum of cultural competency and racism, conducting research, health policies and health disparities. Information relevant to Indigenous populations and health legislation in our local region is also included. The curriculum will be delivered over four two- hour sessions. The sessions will be held during the regularly scheduled protected academic time for the 15 residents in the PM&R program at the University of Alberta. Each session will contain a didactic component and 2 small group discussions. The didactic component will cover key concepts, terminology, and history. Small group discussions will be 10 -15 minutes long, with 5 residents per group and one moderator to facilitate and guide discussion. Evaluation Plan: Learners will complete an anonymous pre and post curriculum assessment designed to evaluate changes in baseline knowledge and perceptions. There are 8 multiple ch oice questions to assess knowledge -based content from the Royal College Indigenous Health (3). There are 12 statements with a corresponding rating scale designed to assess perceptions pertaining to Indigenous health and culture (1). The pre -assessment will allow participants to indicate prior exposure to indigenous culture and health. The post -assessment will inc lude the same 20 questions, and opportunity for narrative comments and general feedback. Anonymous unique identifiers will be randomly assigned to each participant to maintain anonymity during the assessments and in order to measure change over time. Anonymity is important to improve safety for the residents to express their perceptions and feedback openly. Evaluation outcomes will include paired t -test analysis of change in knowledge or perception scores following the last session, and thematic analysis of narrative comments provided by participants. Potential Impact : Developing an Indigenous health and cultural competency curriculum will guide learners towards achieving cultural humility and promote cultural safety for indigenous individuals. Establishing a curriculum with specific content and delivery methods may facilitate implementing the curriculum in other Canadian residency programs. 139References: 1) Keith L. (2020).

Need /Rationale: Medical dramas like House M.D. are frequently utilized in medical education as an engaging medium for instruction on ethics, professional norms, and medical errors [1]. However, little has been written on the application of critical social communication theory to the analysis of medical dramas in the medical educ ation setting. Such an application is necessary because popular culture texts shape and reinforce beliefs and behaviors in subtle ways [2] and because medical dramas often display violations of professional norms [3]. Meth ods: Kenneth Burke's Dramatistic pentad can be applied to the analysis of popular culture medical narratives used in medical education using the following five -prompt approach. Students will be directed to watch the episode or scene to be analyzed, then an swer the five prompts with justif ications for their answers. After, students' answers can be discussed collaboratively or turned in individually. The five prompts are as follows: 1. Identify the five elements of Burke's pentad \u2014act, agent(s), agency, scene, and purpose\u2014 for each scene in question. 2. Compare the pentad components and identify one as the scene's dominant absolution motive. 3. Classify the dominant absolution motive in one of three categories. Transcendence refers to motives that absolve by appealing t o a higher calling. By contrast, mortification refers to a situation in which the agent confesses guilt and is punished for it in order to be purified and redeemed. Lastly, victimage refers to absolution through blaming. Two sub -types of victimage are pres ent in dramatistic analyses: the comic fool, when something inevitable is portrayed as causing the agent's action, and the tragic hero, when the agent blames something else, but ultimately suffers mortification for their actions. 4. Repeat for the number of s cenes to be analyzed. 5. Collectively analyze the narrative's dominant motive classifications. Evaluation Plan: Evaluation plans will assess students' ability to both follow the five -prompt method outlined in this abstract and critically analyze their findings. To illustrate its potential, the Dramatistic pentad is applied to six scenes from three episodes of the television show, House M.D. Two professional norm violations were selected per episode for demonstrative analysis. The analysis demonstrated utilization of the comic fool (x3) and transcendence (x4) justifications to provide redemption for Dr. Gregory House's patterns of errant behavior in House M.D. As a comic fool, House is absolved from his sins due to his intelligence, effectiveness, gender, arrog ance, and position in the hospital. When transcendence is used, Dr. House is absolved because he follows the higher callings of knowledge, saving lives, and the greater good. If audiences can be led to excuse Dr. House for these reasons, they could also be led to excuse real ph ysicians for similar reasons. This includes physicians -in-training, who through the show are normalized to the use of similar justifications for inappropriate physician behavior. Potential Impact : Implementation of the Dramatistic pe ntad in medical ethics education could improve the quality of students' interaction with popular media sources, promoting more deliberate reflection and engagement with the material, in addition to improving awareness of how popular media influences perceptions of morality and professional norms. 141References: 1) Jerrentrup, A., Mueller, T., Glowalla, U., Herder, M., Henrichs, N., Neubauer, A., & Schaefer, J.

Need /Rationale: In the healthcare field, many different professionals develop specific skill sets through their respective training programs. It is vital that these professionals work together while recognizing their individual duties in certain medical scenarios. Research has shown that ineffective teamwork amongst these profession als can lead to tragic consequences in the outcomes of their patients (1). Interprofessional Education (IPE) is a vital component in medical education, and can effectively develop well-rounded medical professionals upon their completion of training (1). IP E plays a role i n improving the quality of patient care by augmenting communication amongst health care professionals. While there is limited literature regarding IPE, the few articles published on this topic have proven its efficacy and positive impact on students, depen ding on the context, planning, and delivery of IPE information within medical curriculum (2). Therefore, the monitoring of the effectiveness of IPE events is key. This research examines the impact of three IPE events on students in order to maximize positi ve outcomes for all. Methods: Three virtual IPE events were hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno IPE Consortium. Each event focused on different medical topics that training healthcare professionals could experience as an interprofessional team, inclu ding Oral Health, Advanced Care Planning, and Diversity and Diagnosis. Students were evaluated at each event and asked to complete both a pre - and post -survey. For this evaluation, two published instruments were utilized. The Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey (ICCAS) and the Interprofessional Attitude Scale (IPAS) instruments were combined and slightly modified to better reflect the needs and evaluation goals of these events. The instrument concepts we re not changed, however, the phrasing of concepts were slightly modified to elicit proper comprehension and honesty in responses during the self -evaluation process. Additional questions involving the effectiveness of virtual IPE events were evaluated since IPE curriculum is usually administered in -person. These events included students who will become future Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, Social Workers, Doctors, Nurses, and Public Health administrators. The goal of these instruments was to gaug e how medical professionals v iew interprofessional roles and interactions, and how these views changed with increased exposure to IPE content. Evaluation Plan: This project was designed to evaluate healthcare students' perceptions of interprofessionalism in the medical field. Nine different IPE- centered categories of assessment were evaluated through this project. These categories included communication, collaboration, roles and responsibilities, collaborative patient/family -centered approach, conflict man agement and resolution, team functioning, attitudes of teamwork, roles, and responsibilities, interprofessional biases, and effects of online learning. For each category, we evaluated the variation between the different types of professional students and the disparity seen between those with varying levels of past medical experience. In addition, we analyzed students who preferred working in groups compared to those who preferred working alone and the changes in student perspectives following consecutive exposures to IPE curriculum. St udent responses to each event were also evaluated, with a future goal of developing and hosting IPE events that are effective and efficacious. This data will be used to further develop a comprehensive and complete training for IPE students within the parent institution of the University of Nevada, Reno. 143 Potential Impact : The survey data will be used at the parent institution to implement the most effective means of delivering IPE curriculum. The overarching goal is to provid e other medical institutions with the information necessary to provide a consistent, sufficient IPE curriculum that students can utilize in the healthcare setting.

Rationale: Learning clinical reasoning is necessary to make the difficult transition from the basic sciences to clinical competence. Without clinical reasoning skills, basic science knowledge is poorly applied and integrated into patient care [1] While many US medical schools try to teach clinical reasoning and emphasize its importance in all four years of medical education, few have developed dedicated courses. A majority of facul ty feel that their students have poor clinical reasoning skills [2]. A recent consensus statement from a group of UK medical educators outlined 5 core domains of clinical reason ing pedagogy and highlighted the role clinical reasoning plays in the developme nt of diagnostic skills critical for clinical practice and patient safety [3] Attempts to teach clinical reasoning as an introductory curriculum and a pilot project have been re ported using a flipped classroom and a case - based pedagogy [4,5]. The feedback of stakeholders was reported to be favorable in both studies. Our interventional program, Foundations of Clinical Reasoning (FCR), shows how optimal clinical care of patients is founded on knowledge of the basic sciences. Methods: FCR was delivered to 2nd -year medical students for 3 consecutive terms. Students learned how to develop clinical reasoning skills using three main domains, Pathophysiology, Infectious Disease and Therapeutics. Disease presentation required students to identify a chief complaint, which was then used to make system -based differential diagnoses. Basic science knowledge was required to explain all aspects of a disease, including presentation, pathophysiology and treatment. This approach required application of pathophysiology at the organ, tissue, cellular and molecular level. Students learned the patient presentation, including symptoms, physical findings, laboratory test results and imaging, correlations with basic science principles. They then applied concepts with multiple clinica l cases and tested their abilities to solve clinical problems in quizzes. The clinical faculty (specialty in pathology) and medical science faculty (specialty in immunology) developed and delivered FCR session materials. These were published as pre -reading, student notes and session products. The faculty trained two other faculty members during the FCR sessions. Students had options for their preferred leaning modality: 1. In-Classroom, 2. Live Interactive Online Sessions and 3. Virtual Self -learning on Vid eo Platform. We made live interactive online sessions available with advanced technology in 2020 for students who participated remotely due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Evaluation Plan: The effects of the FCR pedagogy on learning clinical reasoning were eval uated with the survey, which consists of 8 -Likert scale questions. The answer options include 'agree,' 'neither agree nor disagree' or 'disagree.' The response rate was 58% and 43% in In- Classroom and Interactive Live Online Sessions, respectively. The number of participants in Virtual Self -learning on Video Platform based on the recorded Interactive Live Online Sessions was unknown; however, 55 students responded to the sur vey. The observed overall mean '%Agree' was 83% based on the feedback from the comb ined, 8 survey questions, three subjects and three instructional delivery methods. For the last question, 'Are you ready to apply clinical reasoning skills to solve clinical cases in high -stakes exams?', most students (88%) responded that they developed cl inical reasoning skills for problem solving. One of the authors (HY) observed their gradual progression and improved learning as active, spontaneous interactions for questioning and answering between students and faculty increased over time. To validate the FCR effects, student performance in Step 1 of the cohorts of FCR participants and non -participants will be assessed. Potential Impact : Understanding of disease from patie nt presentation to molecular levels through organs and cells could be key for maste ring basic science concepts. Enhancing clinical reasoning of 145undergraduate medical students with effective pedagogies and technology may improve student's abilities to apply basic science knowledge and concepts to patient care.

Rationale: As NHS hospitals and primary care services around the UK prepared for the pandemic, university students were sent home and clinical placements abruptly ended. Experiential learning is key in medical educatio n and the pandemic has interrupted this passage of development (2). At a time where the progression of medical students is more vital tha n ever, the use of innovation technology will be essential in allowing them to develop clinical skills and knowledge re motely. Hololens Augmented Reality (AR) headset allows students to be virtually present in a consultation and interact with both user and patient. Methods: In September 2020, an AR teaching session was piloted for the first time in a primary care setting in the UK with a group of medical students from Oxford University. The students were socially distanced in a separate teaching room, whil st the primary care physician trainer carried out a consultation wearing an AR headset. The headset allowed the students to view the consultation virtually from a 'doctors perspective', whilst the trainer could see and interact with the both patient and st udents. The trainer was able to open and view images in an augmented construct, which the students could view, these included example scans and observations. Medical student experience was collected using questionnaires and a brief interview. Results: From the feedback the three students provided, all would recommend the session to their peers. Thematic analysis of interviews gives insight to key areas of learning. The first was being able to \"see\" the consultation from a doctor's perspective and the secon d was interacting with an \"actual patient\". All agreed AR would be a beneficial addition to their course if they were to be removed from clinical placement due to COVID -19, or to supplement hospital or primary care education. One limitation highlighted by our patient was that they were unable to see the students and screens in the GP trainers augmented reality construct. This changed the dynamic of the consultation and further work integrating patient feedback will be needed to assess the impact of AR on the patient experience. The limitations raised by the students were centred around technical issues. These should be quic k to resolve with AR training and preparing the AR screens before each session. Potential Impact : AR teaching offers live patient contact remotely, allowing students to further their learning amid the COVID -19 restrictions. In a time where both students and trainers are required to adapt their teaching and learning styles quicker than ever before, it has great potential to ensure continuity of education as a second wave of COVID- 19 threatens.

We propose the \"syste matic review lite\" as an effective means to deliver these skills. Need /Rationale: Acquiring research skills and attributes is recognized as an important learning outcome of medical education by the AAMC and GMC. Indeed, in a survey of experts, the seven h ighest ranking attributes found necessary for a professional to possess were the same for both researchers and clinical practitioners. These seven skills included: an inquiring mind, core knowledge, critical appraisal skills, understanding of the evidence base for professional practice, understanding of ethics and governance, ability to work in a team, and ability to communicate. Systematic reviews (SR) are widely recognized as a cornerstone of evidence based medicine (EBM). A SR project can confer on stude nts numerous benefits, including an excellent opportunity to develop essential research skill s. Here, we report on the successful use of a rapid low -cost systematic review process, the \"systemic review lite\" (SRL) model, and propose its wider adoption into medical school curriculums. The SRL model presents numerous benefits; namely, it allows stud ents to develop essential research skills, empowers students to produce meaningful research outcomes, and can be completed in a short period that can easily be inc orporated into a medical school curriculum. Methods: A systematic review lite (SRL) on the t iming of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (PTP) after traumatic brain injury was undertaken by a group of first year medical students from The University of Edinburgh Medical School as part of a 10- week student selected component. As part of the \"lite\" method, students wrote a project protocol under the direction of their faculty advisors but did not publish this. In the first filter, studies were excluded if full text or English translation were not available. Non - human studies and studies on neonates and children were excluded. Authors were not contacted for missing data and individual references were not individually hand searched and cross checked for relevant publications. In the second filter, full text articles were assessed and excluded if they lac ked appropriate comparators. Studies were extracted by three independent assessors and cross checked. Data was extracted to Review manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaborat ion 2014). Quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale . Results concluded that early PTP may reduce the risk of VTE in traumatic brain injury, particularly in the more severely injured. The process allowed students to develop skills and produce a viable abstract and poster of the findings. This has since been accepted at the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine 33rd Annual Congress. Evaluation Plan: The systematic review lite format proved to be viable method f or conducting research and acquiring key skills. The students delivered clear results in a short time frame. While the methodology was not as comprehensive as possible, we argue this is a useful compromise, particularly when a definitive prospective study is likely to be needed anyway to resolve a clinical problem. Similar to a traditional systematic review, the outcome was a valuable summary of current data to direct future research. In addition to producing meaningful research, anecdotal data suggests the project allowed students to foster research skills in 6 of the 7 previously mentioned essent ial skills. To evaluate this, we propose a pre- and post -project survey assessing student self -reports on these skills. We would also survey if such projects produced peer- reviewed publications/presentations. This would be further evaluated with feedback f rom the project faculty advisors. Although this project was completed prior to the COVID -19 outbreak, it would be well suited to an environment of virtual collaboration. In a time where other direct research may not be as available to students, it would st ill provide a viable opportunity to undertake first- hand research. 148Potential Impact : The systematic review lite model can be used by other medical schools for eng aging students while teaching valuable research skills. SRL can be implemented over 10 weeks under a principal investigator. By giving students ownership over the project, students experience independent research while also learning key skills in the curri culum. References: 1) Laidlaw A, Aiton J, Struthers J, Guild S.

(1, 2, 3); Null, Gregory (1); Serra, Allison (1, 4) (1) School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh; (2) Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University; (3) Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute; (4) Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Pittsburgh Idea: Medical schools need a coher ent strategy to evaluate the stages of crisi s management to maintain a record that is useful in future crisis response. Need /Rationale: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, many organizations have aptly used the phrase \"building the plane while it is flying.\" Under typical circumstances, organizations have time to plan for anticipated events and reflect on these events as they plan for the future. But how can an organization, such as a medical school, evaluate its response to a crisis as the situation continues to un fold? A structured reflection process to evaluate a medical school's changes to curricular operations in the initial stages of crisis management appears necessary, although few models for this process exist. Here, a novel app roach was applied to review the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine's (UPSOM) response to COVID- 19 and adaptation of its curriculum: the After Action Review (AAR) process. This process, adopted from the United States Army, focuses on strategies for self- reflection for future improvement. The objective was to use this approach to prepare the school for future crises and to explore avenues for curricular reform. Methods: The process began with a subcommittee discussion on the importance of reviewing the medical school's response t o the initial \"shutdown\" as a way to prepare for its future curricular operations. Working groups of faculty, staff, and students were asked to reflect on significant events, create possible survey questions if additional inf ormation was needed from faculty/staff/students, and answer the four AAR \"central questions\" in the context of the group's focus area. The working groups focused on five critical areas (online teaching and learning, student/faculty support, governance, technological resiliency, crisis communication). Each group reflected on the timeline and events, and through the AAR process, supplemented by survey data, constructed a narrative account of significant events and developed focused recommendations for future crisis response. The survey consisted of in - house questions developed in consultation with the working groups (who were asked to reflect on their own personal experiences in their respective roles) as well as questions adopted from the Council for Higher E ducation Accreditation's \"Quest ions for Quality.\" Furthermore, a detailed timeline was created and included curricular events/Curriculum Committee decisions as well as external events (Liaison Committee on Medical Education guidance, SOM actions, Universit y actions, local COVID -19 cases) for context. Evaluation Plan: Through this structured reflection process, multiple areas of strength within the UPSOM's response to the crisis were identified. The AAR process revealed the extent of adaptability and engagement of each faculty, staff, an d students during the initial crisis phases. The process also demonstrated that despite the implications of a global pandemic and the need for a rapid and complete transition to remote instruction, the UPSOM continued to oper ate and provide students with sufficient preclinical and clinical education without interruption to graduate timelines. At the same time, the process allowed for identification of several areas of improvement that were agreed upon from faculty, staff, and students. Importantly, these st eps and strategies are not specific to the COVID -19 pandemic and can be adopted for future crisis management or even curricular reform. Potential Impact : This review process can serve as a model for 1) the efficient and conv enient use of documentation bui lt from the report, 2) preparedness for future shutdowns, and 3) normalization of the AAR process in all facets of a medical school's curricular operations. 150References: 1) Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

Rationale: COVID -19 has caused a significant impact on the United States healthcare field due to the high intensity of cases as well as shortages of PPE, hospital beds, and ventilators [1]. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) originally called for all elective and non -emergent cases to be postponed until the COVID- 19 curve of cases had flattened [2]. This particularly affects surgical fields, as they had to reevaluate and shift current practice s in order to minimize the spread and allocate proper PPE and resources for COVID -19 positive patients and frontline workers. This further affects surgical residencies and fellowships, aesthetic fellowship surgery included, where most of the training depends on surgical experience. These changes caused programs to shift focus and establish rapid solutions so that residents and fellows can still receive training without delay [3]. The impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on current and upcoming aesthetic surgery fellows has not yet been evaluated. Methods: A 23 question anonymous web -based survey was sent electronically to all aesthetic surgery fellowship directors with an active program in the United States, found through the Aesthetic Society (ASPAS) website. S urveys were sent and collected from April 18, 2020 through May 14, 2020, through Qualtrics\u00ae, then analyzed with Microsoft Excel\u00ae and descriptive statistics. A follow -up survey was sent to directors with 7 questions, and data was collected from June 6, 2020, through August 18, 2020. A 23- question survey was additionally sent out through the ASPAS to aesthetic surgery fellows in order to gain their first- hand insight. Data for the fellow specific survey was collected from June 6, 2020, through August 18, 2020 . The surveys includ ed questions pertaining to the impact on the fellow's surgical and clinical experiences, financial status, as well as if there were any adjustments in their training. Additionally, questions were included to determine any impact on the interview process an d training for fellows starting in July 2020 and 2021. Demographic questions regarding location were included in the survey, and fellowship directors and fellows were given the opportunity to share any additional comments on the topic. Results: There was a 65.5% response rate for the initial director survey (19/29). All directors reported that the COVID- 19 pandemic had an impact on aesthetic surgery fellows. 73.7% of directors recognized at least a \"moderate impact\" on educational exper ience, and the same percentage reported the same for clinical experiences. Only 5.3% of directors reported that they believe COVID -19 would have a \"significant impact\" on their fellows becoming well -trained surgeons, and only 5.3% of directors reported that they believe there will be a \"significant impact\" on the new fellows starting in July 2020. Nine directors (31.0%) responded to the follow -up survey. 28% (9/32) of fellows responded to the fellow specific survey, and all fellows reported that COVID -19 had at least some impact on their fellowship experience. 66.7% of fellows reported that COVID -19 will have a \"mild impact\" on their ability to become a well -trained aesthetic surgeon. Impact on 2020 and 2021 fellows was not as significant as with the current fellows. Data showe d that aspects of training were shifted and that facial aesthetic surgery in particular had been greatly impacted. Potential Impact : Telemedicine, educational efforts, and standardization of new guidelines can be increased to minimize loss of fellow training due to COVID -19. Ongoing evaluation and shared experiences can assist fellowships in customizing programs to provide an educational environment that balances patient needs and well -being in this period of rapid adaptation. 152References: 1) Khot, U.N., Navigating Healthcare Supply Shortages During the COVID -19 Pandemic: A Cardiologist's Perspective.

Need /Rationale: Introductio n of deliberate practice into training has been shown to help develop mastery of skills in a variety of fields and professions including multiple areas in medicine (2). D eliberate practice (DP) involves usage of specific practice goals, immediate feedback regarding performance and adequate opportunity to refine skills (2). By introducing DP processes into pediatric urology training, there is potential to improve the acquis ition of surgical knowledge and technique, espcially when accompanied by focus feedback from faculty. A disparity exists between ideal and actual feedback practices in the OR (3). There have been multiple studies which have described feedback tools for giv ing specific step -by-step post op feedback but there are none in pediatric urology. In pediatric urology we do not have the prerequisite detailed breakdowns for commonly performed procedures. To address this national challenge, we propose a two -step process: 1) develop a repository of data with detailed structure of key operations to teach and assess surgical skills; and 2) piloting of these checklists with fellows utilizing trained faculty. Methods: The primary learners will be pediatric urology fellows across the country (~25/year) within their single clinical year. The main outcome goals are to 1) develop frameworks for six key surgical procedures in pediatric urology to guide deliberate practice; and 2) pilot each tool developed with a sample o f fellows (~5). Each framework will include major steps of the operation. Each major step will be broken down further into sub -steps. Each procedural framework will then be used to develop DP strategies for fellows, an assessment tool, and key DP feedback points for faculty. A national taskforce of program directors and senior fellows will be assembled to develop the framewoks. National cooperation will ensure that leaders in the field contribute to frameworks in which they possess particular expertise. In Step 2 of the this process, each of the six frameworks (DP strategies, tool and feedback points ) will be piloted by at least 5 fellows. In formulating this taskforce our long -term goals is to determine specific surgical techniques that are most common across all procedures and which are most important for becoming surgically proficient. In this way, we can focus on ensuring that fellows master the component skills necessary to perform more complex procedures since many procedures are rarely performed. This will help standardize the educational experience fellows receive nationally and provide a commo n structure to deliver high quality feedback for all surgical procedures. Evaluation Plan: The evaluation will have multiple steps. 1) Work of the taskforce wil l be tracked over the first four months for completion of the materials for the six procedures. 2) During the pilot phase (8 months) we will use a common online tracking form to record each pilot usage with accompanying user assessment. The faculty will focus on assessing accuracy of the steps and sub -steps for the procedure, and the usefulness of the checklist in providing feedback. The fellows will rate the usefulness of the framework in preparing for the operation, and the usefulness of the immediate fee dback provided by faculty during deliberate practice. 3) Learner behavior (surgical skills) wil l be assessed through directly observing fellows and will be able to determine level of mastery for each of the six procedures. These data will help inform the specialty in this pilot round about current level of skills. 4) Impact will be assessed across time as the deliberate practice frameworks become fully integrated into programs. Since most of the 25 programs will be part of the project, this will be possible as learner behaviors associated with using deliberate practice for acquisition of new skills a re tracked and performance assessed. Potential Impact : If successful, this project will impact education within our entire sub -specialty (pediatric urology) and could also provide a model for other small surgical sub -specialties to enhance their competenc y-based training and assessment of learner operative performance. 154 References: 1) Gil, Joseph A.

In the era of COVID, this has become an even larger consideration as didactics and cli nical experiences are being presented remotely(1) and limitations of physical gatherings have amplified the difficulties in social connection. In addition, widespread application of adult learning theory to residency education is lacking. Many programs still use traditional formats (such as lectures) for didactics, which seldom allow for active learning. Key learni ng methods of proven benefit like retrieval practice or spaced repetition(2) are not used; instead lectures are scattered throughout the year wit hout being revisited. Gamification can bridge this gap by simultaneously incorporating adult learning theory an d improving learner motivation and engagement(3). We developed \"The Knowledge Games\" to capitalize on gaming, technology and adult -learning theor y to reinforce didactic material covered remotely, offer additional \"touches\" with learners we otherwise strugg led to accomplish during the pandemic, and foster social connection. Methods: Each week, residents (n = 22) attend Academic Half Day, which invo lves a topic presentation and discussion presented by a sub- specialist. Few attend the session in person, with the rest of the residents viewing remotely. To help enforce key principles learned, the program director (PD) sends a question related to the material presented in prior weeks to all residents via secure group text. Residents are instructed to respond to the PD directly to allow all residents the opportunity to engage in retrieval practice when it is convenient for them. The first person to respond is awarded a point. The following day, answers and rationale are shared via group text and the daily winner is announced. At the end of the month, the resident with the most points is awarded a small prize. Rules are intermittently changed to allow for multiple winners (for example, during the month of September each post -graduate year [PGY] cohort competed as a t eam). Evaluation Plan: We have found that by providing daily case- based questions pushed via group text, learners can engage in material asynchr onously. They are also able to participate in retrieval practice for the main concepts learned during their did actic time, and the content of questions can be repeated over time to facilitate spaced repetition. Instructors can interact with the residents t o provide explanations for common incorrect responses. Importantly, residents can interact with, and cheer on e ach other. To further evaluate the impact of this activity, we will track the number of individual daily winners over time and evaluate the distribution between the PGY levels. We will also survey the residents to understand how this activity increases their engagement with Academic Half Day, and how it affects their connection to their classmates. We may also track change in in -training exam performance compared to prior cohorts of residents who did not participate in the Knowledge Games. Potential Impact : The Knowledge Games may have significant impact on knowledge retention and learner satisfaction without much added faculty time. This activity would be easily adaptable to any program of any size in any specialty. Importantly, it may also be a low effort, high yield intervention to improve the feelings of social isolation that COVID -19 has created.

Need /Rationale: Program Coordinators play a valuable role in the successful function of any residency or fellowship program. Research indicates this niche profession is vital for successful operation of any Graduate Medical Education program, but \"there is no formal path for new coordinators to gain the necessary skills to perform the job\"(Dubois, Marsh, Demers, 2017, p.114). It is noted, \"in many cases training for the role is obtained through on -the-job trial and error\" (Dubois, Marsh, Demers, 2017, p.732). Interestingly, \"high turnover and burnout likely result from the discrepancy between ACGME requirements and the lack of recognition in many institutions; [one] survey found 33% program coordinators turnover in the prior 12 months\" (Feist and Gilbert, 2019, p.732). Based on this evidence as well as in influx of new coordinators at our institution and a desire they expressed for training, the Program Coordinator Training Group program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was established. Methods: The program is designed to provide formal training to newly hired Program Coordinators, equipping them with the skills necessary to thrive in their role. Our projects' aims are focused on professional development and development of community practice. Specific learning outcomes include operating the institutions Resident Management System (RMS), becoming familiar with ACGME general program guidelines and annual program timeline, and developing the ability to describe the role of a Program Coordinator as defined by the AC GME. This pilot program was designed using the four level s of Kirkpatrick Model of Training Evaluations and Paulo Freire philosophy of critical pedagogy or problem - solving education. Participants understanding of new concepts were measured by the 4C model: Connections, Concepts, Concrete Practice and Conclusions . The Program Coordinator Training Group program launched in April 2020, conducting monthly 1.5- hour virtual training sessions for six- months. Training sessions covered a litany of topics including f ellowship/residency program cycle, MyEvaluations (CHLA's RMS), ACGME fundamentals, Continuing Medical Education, and several other key areas. Assignments included monthly Learning Log entries, video and reading resources. Additional support components implemented were peer mentorship, virtual check -ins, and Micr osoft Teams support group. Evaluation Plan: All participates were required to complete a post -assessment survey to assess if our program was successful in meeting our pilot program objectives and aims. Results are pending; we should have complete data by 11/1/2020. Potential Impact : Significance will be updated after review of finalized data. We anticipate our results depict participants developed a stronger since of community by participating in ou r training program. Additionally, we hope it demystifi ed possible position expectations while supporting professional development and development of community practice. References: 1) Dubois, Lauralee et al. (2017).

A.T. Still University School of Osteopathic Medicine Problem Statement : Curr ent incoming medical school students come from diverse academic backgrounds and can feel unprepared for the initial rigor of medical school. Rationale: The undergrad pre -med curriculum has changed as modern education evolves. Today's incoming freshman hav e very diverse academic backgrounds with some majoring in hard sciences while others in fine arts. The MCAT has historically been used by admissions committees as the academic equalizer to give a needed objective measure to judge both their ability to succeed in medical school and their aptitude and preparedness for a medical career. There are academic subjects not reflected on the MCAT that are helpful to the incoming students that are not currently required for application, and therefore some students are more prepare d for the initial coursework than others. Our curriculum stresses student -led learning. We hypothesized that releasing pre -matriculation material to all incoming students would allow for better initial student experiences and grades as all stu dents would have a basic level of knowledge to better participate in initial student -led activities. Methods: Prematriculation programs have been implemented in many medical schools to prepare students for initial coursework and level the academic playing field. To better prepare students for our program, basic science educational material was provided to all students. Faculty members in biochemistry and microbiology prepared required foundational online content and associated self - assessments that were re leased to s tudents 5 weeks before the start of the first classes. Prematriculation material for genetics, immunology and physiology was purchased from an outside vendor and those coordinated online lectures and self -assessments began 3 weeks before classes started an d continued in a self -paced fashioned throughout the course. Faculty and students were told that the material covered in the prematricualtion content was foundational to the content released as graded material by the faculty, and this prematricu lation mate rial would be seen on the exams, sometimes alone, bit often as material integrated into higher -order questions. Students took surveys on their initial satisfaction of the core curricular content of the first course, and their later satisfaction as the course ended. After the course was completed, the students' demographic and academic data submitted through AMCAS was analyzed to assess the level of academic preparedness for starting school and was correlated with their performance on the prematriculation ma terial and their grades for their first course. Results: The purpose of the study was to determine the correlation of completing prematriculation material with course satisfaction and grades. Students were initially divided by their transcripts into two comparative subject pools demonstrating either significant science preparedness or possible lack of science knowledge by their completed academic classes. The initial and final course surveys were also subjectively scored for a degree of perceive d satisfact ion with the content of the course. Correlations were measured for student grades in the course for the prepared students versus the non -prepared, and showed that academically prepared students performed somewhat better and had a higher degree o f course sa tisfaction. The effect fully completing the prematriculation content to the course grade was also measured across these two groups and showed that low performing students that did not do well on the prematricualtion material were at a greater ri sk for lowe r course satisfaction and grade performance. Other applicant performance data such as MCAT and GPAs was also analyzed for correlation to compliance to prematriculation content and course grade. Finally, clinical experiences like working as a medical scribe and volunteering in a clinical environment were also analyzed for correlation to initial performance in medical school to see if these academic vs real- world experiences were a better predictor for initial success in course grades and student satisfaction. Potential Impact : Findings demonstrated that prematriculation material had an impact on students without strong science backgrounds. Although not a panacea to cure student preparedness, students 159who were more engaged with online prematriculat ion material earned higher grades and reported increased curricular satisfaction compared with their peers.

Rationale: MedFIT is a 2 -week, robust orientation program for matriculating first year students. The program implemented a skills- based approach over a lecture -based approach to combat the boredom offered by many orientations. The goal of MedFIT was to prepare studen ts for the academic rigors they would soon face in their first year of medical school, but in a low- stakes environment. Sessions held during the orientation included mock lectures and anatomy labs, as well as mock written tests and practicals. These assess ments are offered to students to allow them to experience taking a medical school assessment without the risk of failing. Additional sessions offered provide information on study skills, physicianship, professionalism, team -building, and mentorship. The Pa ck Mentor program is a formal peer mentorship s ystem in which students are paired with a second -year medical student who serves as their mentor for the remainder of their first year and beyond (1). Methods: The MedFIT curriculum incorporated the following content areas: Gross anatomy, histology, and physiology lectures; clinical sessions (e.g. history -taking, physical exam skills); student success sessions (e.g. study skills, career advising); informational sessions (e.g. financial aid); nutrition for students and patients; Student Outreach Clinic training; a mock written exam; a mock lab practical exam; Family Day; and A White Coat Ceremony. Additionally, the seventy incoming first -year medical students were allocated into eighteen groups, each consisting of three to four members. These student groups were formed based on certain characteristics including demographics, prior work and medical experience, as well as academic background. Each group was assigned a second -year medical student to serve as a mentor. The one second -year student with 3 -4 first-y ear students is termed a \"Pack,\" after UNR's mascot. The Global MedFIT Committee, consisting of faculty and previous Pack Mentors, oversaw the MedFIT planning process. This involved creating the schedule/content, selecting pack mentors, and training new pa ck mentors. At the conclusion of the MedFIT orientation, qualitative and quantitative data about the MedFIT program was collected through surveys. The results were then analyzed by the UNR Med Global MedFIT Co mmittee. The committee uses the responses from students to help guide improvements that are made to the MedFIT program on an annual basis. Results: The feedback and overall scores from the MedFIT surveys for years 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are presented here. Overall, feedback from each subsequent cla ss has been increasingly positive and rewarding, demonstrating the effectiveness and benefit of the MedFIT program as a means of transitioning into medical school. Despite the hybrid in -person/online MedFIT program held in 2020 due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, overall ratings of the program were as positive as the previous year. Qualitative data from the Class of 2024 (MedFIT 2020) indicated that most students enjoyed the introduction to UNR Med, meetin g their fellow classmates, and meeting their pack mentors prior to the official academic school year beginning. Students felt more prepared overall in regards to time management, social support, and academic resources. Additionally, students appreciated th e opportunity to practice taking a written exam and lab pr actical in a low- stakes environment in which their grades did not impact their record. The most common constructive feedback revolved around the hybrid in - person/online nature of the program for 2020. Students recommended more active learning and participation during online informational sessions and more opportunities to meet their classmates before entering a primarily- online first year of school. 161Potential Impact : Matriculating students cultiva ted lasting relationships with upperclassmen, practiced study skills in a low- stakes environment, and left prepared for their first year. MedFIT has proven its success and adaptability through both in -person and hybrid programs, and has continued as the orientation program for UNR Med for the last five years.

Unfortunately, it is also one of the rotations where residents in Family Medicine (FM) tend to struggle (2). In our hospital we conducted a needs assessment and found that two -thirds of our residents also reported struggling. In response to this need two F M residents, with the guidance of a faculty member, began in 2018 to develop a Survival Guide for Labor and Delivery (L & D). The Survival Guide was made available to our resident in 2019. It is an easily accessible (digital and print version) instruction manual designed to meet the learning needs of our residents on L&D, as well as the ACGME Family medicine milestones requirements. L&D Survival Guide provides a centralized location for important practice information and well as a reference and resource on daily practice details on L&D. This study was designed to determine the usefulness of the guide. Methods: The participants in this innovation were 8 PGY1 FM residents 2019-2020. The Survival guide is a 22 -page manual for residents to utilize during their Obstetrics rotation, which is an 8 -week experience in Labor and Delivery. San Joaquin General Hospital is a county hospital with 150 deliveries per month, where most patients are high risk pregnancies. The PGY1 residents work alongside nurse midwives, with no senior resident on the rotation. Residents are supervised by Obstetrics/Gynecology and Family Medicine Fa culty. The manual was created using the Dick and Carey (3) instructional model (identify goals, task analysis, identify learner behavior and characteristics, develop performance objectives, develop content and program evaluation). All steps were followed. The manual has 8 areas of focus. The areas are: 1) Orientation to the rotation; 2) Roles and responsibilities; 3) Work efficiency; 4) Documentation ; 5) Communication protocols; 6) EMR, Cerner Order sets; 7) Important Contact Numbers; and 8) Readings and re sources. To assess the impact of the manual, we have utilized both quantitative methods, use of specific survey monkey survey focused on the manual and qualitative debriefings at the end of each rotation with all of the residents in 2019 -2020. The manual has had two revisions based on the ongoing feedback by residents. Results: The qualitative debriefings throughout the year resulted in making addit ions to the manual to meet specific learner needs. For example, the authors added more content about the rota tion itself especially the expectations for pre- sign- out rounds in the morning, as well as adding references. The authors (PGY2 and PGY3 residents in 2019 -20) collaborated with the rotating residents to make changes. The quantitative data collection in Jun e 2020 using survey monkey to gather anonymous data A 4-point importance scale was utilized (unimportant, slightly important, important and very important in relation to learning within the Obstetrics rotation). All PGY1 residents, n=8, completed the surve y. The overall rating for the survival guide was 3.75/4 with 7 of the 8 residents rating the Survival Guide as very important to their learning within the rotation. Use of the OB Survival Guide 3.0 has now been made a permanent part of the rotation. The program will also continue to query residents in rotation debriefings about the Guide as well as including it in the annual survey on Maternity Care and Learning. Potential Impact : The OB Survival Guide has been shown to be effective for use by PGY1 residen ts in one program. Other Family Medicine and Obstetrics/Gynecology Programs as well. as Nurse Midwife training programs could modify the document for their own usage. It will be made available to all IME attendees. 163References: 1) Goldstein JT, Hartman SG, MD, Meunier MR, et al. Supporting Family Physician Maternity Care Providers.

Need /Rationale: The transition from medical school to internship is often associated with the perception of unpreparedness across specialties. To address this issue, many medical schools have implemented a \"bootcamp\" to teach essential skills needed to transition to internship. Most research done in this area applies for specialties that focus on skills done in simulation labs or procedural skills. In many cases, learners report an increase in confidence and self -perceived competence (1). They have also viewed it to be an essential part of their professional t raining even years after the intervention (2). Psychiatry would benefit from similar interventions prior to starting internship. Easing this transition involves skill building in addition to consideration of personality characteristics and contextual facto rs such as relationships with supervisors and peers (3). This bootcamp will focus on the sk ill portion in combination with character skill discovery. A psychiatry bootcamp will help to meet these needs and if effective, can serve as a model for institution s to train competent and more confident learners to begin their postgraduate medical traini ng. Methods: Participants will be 10 -15 M4 students who have matched into psychiatry. The bootcamp is a 2 half-day experience (spring 2021) designed to prepare students (character and skills) for internship. Prior to the bootcamp, students will complete a pre-intervention assessment of character -related skills using four tools: Resilience Scale, Mindset Self -Assessment Tool, VIA Character Strength Survey, and Grit Scale Quiz. This will be followed by a team- based assessment of character strengths on the fi rst day. The skill portion will include psychiatric interviewing, behavior chain analysis, and de -escalation techniques. Techniques will be introduced in brief didactic presentations including interactions through use of progressive disclosure cases and think -pair-share. Additional classroom techniques include review of video case vignettes. Skills will be built using role -play and standardized patients with direct faculty observation to allow assessment of individual learner skills. At the end of the bootc amp, students will complete a written self -reflection about the bootcamp experience and develop a personal plan of action related to their character -related skills. Students will be surveyed 3 months into intern year on the progress of their plan. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We will track attendance, timing of the activities, and level of participation in each activity so that we can modify the plan for next year as needed. 2) Reaction: All sessions will be assessed via session evaluation forms com pleted by learners to gain their opinions on quality, organization, and usefulness to them in their transition to residency. A resident survey 3 months after implementation will assess perceptions about the usefulness of the elements of the bootcamp. 3) Learning: Throughout the didactic sessions, board type questions will be given to assess their knowledge acquisition. A written reflection about the vulnerability and perception of patients with personality disorders will be monitored for depth of reflection . Direct observation of participation in small group activities and work with a standardized patient will provide in vivo feedback to learners. 4) Behavior: Learners will create a plan of action/commitment to act which we will follow -up on as part of the 3 -month post-participation survey. Potential Impact : For rising psychiatry interns to be adequately prepared for residency, they must be equipped with adequate character skills and relevant knowledge/skills prior to internship. If effective, this bootcamp can serve as a model for other institutions to ease the transition to residency. 165References: 1) Dversdal, R. K., Gold, J. A., Richards, M. H., Chiovaro, J.

Need /Rationale: Our Transition to Clerkship (T2C) course occurs immediately prior to starting of clerkship rotations and includes an evidence -based medicine (EBM) module. T2C had been synchronous and in- person for all Year 3 medical students, but due to the COVID -19 pandemic, content needed to be revised to be delivered virtually. This prompted instructors of the EBM module to re -envision the content to increase emphasis on the main module deliverable: a practice oral evidence presentation. This deliverable was also identified for increased emphasis from prior years' students and course faculty leaders. Furthermore, it addresses Core Entrustable Professional Activities (1) and identified needs to practice oral presentation (2). The content was revised to be asynchronous and to further develop learner skills in finding evidence relat ed to a clinical question, synthesizing that evidence, and then supportively practicing (3) the new skill of presenting an oral evidence synthesis for a clinical setting. Methods: Learning objectives for the EBM module focused on: 1) identifying tools fo r finding evidence at the point of care, 2) using effective search strategies for finding evidence, including guidelines, 3) synthesizing evidence into a brief oral evidence presentation, and 4) practicing delivery of an oral evidence presentation, including giving and receiving feedback. Instructors provided learners with frameworks and instructions to support their success with the activities, which were designed to be accomplished in 2 - 3 hours. The module consisted of pre -work and a paired activity. Th e pre- work focused on context for clinical oral evidence syntheses and on finding quality evidence. The paired activity consisted of selecting from a menu of topics, finding a relevant guideline and a primary s tudy, synthesizing evidence found, recording a nd presenting a brief oral update to a peer, and providing peer feedback.To encourage self -direction as well as teamwork (3), learners were asked to complete the pre - work and organize with their pre -assigned partner an online meeting to practice presenting the oral brief as well as providing feedback according to a rubric for one another.Learners each submitted and recorded a video of themselves delivering their brief evidence oral presentation. In this format, learners are able to deliberately practice an oral evidence presentation in a safe environment assuring a supported practice opportunity before moving into the clinical environment. Evaluation Plan: Instructors viewed each student's submitted video bas ed on the peer feedback rubric and then provided aggregate feedback to the students. Instructors also reviewed all of the submitted peer feedback forms with an eye to how learners analyzed each other's performance. Both instructors agreed that this was a more effective way to assess the quality of student work related to the activity and their ability to provide constructive peer feedback. Instructors also asked learners to provide (optional) immediate feedback about the EBM module. Students responded that the instruction was effective and that they ap preciated the overall organization and structure, learning how to find guidelines, and the opportunity to practice presenting in a safe environment. The School of Medicine also solicited student feedback about the EBM module, with largely positive results. In preliminary feedback, most students who rated the module rated it as very effective (in line with or better than other sessions in T2C). There were many favorable student comments such as, \"I loved the EBM project and found it especially useful specifically to 3rd year.\" Instructors were impressed by the high level of engagement that students demonstrated for the activities in this module, as compared with prior years' in -person sessions.In the future, instructors hope to seek additional feedback from learners once they are further along in clerkship rotations and integrate further goal -directed practice. Potential Impact : Synthesizing and orally presenting evidence in the clinical space is a core skill (1 ) requiring practice and feedback. Providing m easurable, skills- based learning activities immediately applicable across all clerkships will help learners more readily succeed and perform in clinic. 167 References: 1) Association of American Medical Colleges.

(1); Frisch, Emily H. (1); Greenberg, Milton L. (2) (1) School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine; (2) Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine Problem Statement : Teaching ECG in undergraduate medical education can be challenging given minimal clinical experience and the nuances of the subject matter. Rationale: Teaching clinical concepts in pre -clerkship medical education can be challenging. Cardiovascular physiology, including electrocardiogram (ECG) interpre tation and analysis, have proved difficult for first year medical students. In prior years, implementation of an active learning ECG activity using AliveCor KardiaMobile, medical -grade single lead ECG was successfully utilized for teaching ECG interpretation. The KardiaMobile is an FDA -approved medical device intended to record, store, and transfer single channel ECG rhythms and is widely used by patients outside of the cl inical setting. By including the newly developed KardiaMobile 6 -lead ECG to the existing active learning ECG session, we hope to improve the quality of cardiovascular physiology education at University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. Here, we des cribe the use the KardiaMobile iOS - and Android- enabled 6- lead ECG device to improve the hands- on learning experience and interpretation of cardiovascular physiology. Methods: Prior to the active learning ECG activity, all students took the same nine -question ECG interpretation quiz through the Canvas course management software to establis h a baseline of student understanding. The quiz contained two questions on ventricular hypertrophy and two questions on axis deviation. Students were then randomized to participate in either a single- lead ECG or 6 -lead ECG activity. One day prior to the EC G active learning session, students were given a digital handout detailing the instructions for the activity. Students organized into groups of 3 -5 students with sufficient distance between groups and proper PPE to comply with UCISOM COVID -19 guidance. The single- lead ECG activity focused specifically on detecting hypertrophy, while the 6- lead ECG activity focused on detecting axis deviation. During the activity, students were encouraged to work through the different exercises and answer associated question s. Activities included interpreting ECG readings, comparing ECG readings, and autonomic regulation. After the active learning session, students again completed the initia l ECG quiz in order to determine the benefit of both the single -lead and 6 -lead ECG ac tivities in teaching ECG in a first year, pre -clerkship medical physiology course. Students also completed a Qualtrics survey to assess attitudes regarding the utility and applicability of the ECG activity to their classroom learning. Results: Scores for the ECG interpretation quiz improved following the active learning session, regardless of the device (single lead or 6 -lead) used during the active learning session. Ther e was also no difference on hypertrophy or axis deviation questions regardless of the device used during the active learning session, suggesting that either KardiaMobile device was sufficient to teach these concepts. Regarding the post -session attitudes su rvey, 90% from the single -lead group and 95% of the 6 -lead group of students either ag reed or strongly agreed that the AliveCor KardiaMobile device was a valuable addition to the \"Reading ECG\" session in Physiology. 78% from the single- lead group and 79% o f the 6- lead group of students felt that using the AliveCor KardiaMobile device helped further their understanding of ECGs. Additionally, inclusion of the 6 -lead Kardia device was not found to be detrimental to the existing active learning ECG session. The 6-lead Kardia device was not inferior to the currently- used single lead Kardia device . Potential Impact : The new KardiaMobile 6 -lead ECG device was easily integrated into the existing active learning ECG session. After the activity, quiz scores improved regardless of ECG KardiaMobile device used. The 6- lead KardiaMobile device represents a novel educational tool to improve the clinical relevance of the cardiac physiology curriculum within UGME. 169References: 1) Lau JK, Lowres N, Neubeck L, Sy RW, Galloway CD, Albert DE, Freedman SB. iPhone ECG application for community screening to detect silent atrial fibrillation: a novel technology to prevent stroke.

Rationale: In response to the COVID epidemic, many medical scho ols have transitioned to fully online curricula, especially for pre -clerkship students. Some modalities, suc h as lectures and team - based learning, have been easily adapted to remote learning. However, significant challenges have been faced in adapting tra ditionally interactive, in -person and hands- on sessions to online formats. Many schools have deferred these classes entirely, but with the pandemic raging on, short -term changes have become semi -permanent, raising questions about learner equity and performance standards. We proposed that using a live, case- based approach for online US instruction for medical students would: 1) allow for continuation of live, interactive, US teaching to pre -clerkship students in an online curriculum, 2) increase the faculty to student ratio and reduce the probe to student ratio needed to facilitate the sessions and 3) improve stud ents' application of US skills to clinical diagnosis. Methods: In groups of 100 students at a time, MS2s joined an online session using the Zoom pl atform. The session leader (typically a faculty member) began by introducing the session, timing, expectatio ns and learning objectives. Students were then moved into breakout groups. In the first breakout group, the session leader demonstrated the use of U S to visualize the heart, lungs and kidneys to a group of 50 students, using a near peer educator (MS3 or MS 4 student) as a model of normal anatomy. This was accomplished by using a webcam to show the session leader demonstrating probe placement, in addition to using a handheld US probe connected to an iPad to screenshare the US images being acquired in real -time. As this was done live, students were encouraged to ask for clarification and repetition. In the second breakout group, groups of 10 students were presented with clinical vignettes of suspected hydronephrosis, pulmonary edema, and aortic dissection. Thes e vignettes included examples of expected US images for each case, with examples of normal US images provided in order to facilitate the identificat ion of pathological findings. Students were guided through a series of relevant questions by a near peer edu cator. The breakout groups were then brought together and the Kahoot platform was used to administer a quiz covering topics taught during the session. Finally, the session leader led a debriefing discussion to conclude the session. Evaluation Plan: A 10-q uestion multiple choice quiz comprised of questions relevant to the session learning objectives will be administered at the end of every session usi ng the Kahoot platform. Analysis of reports generated via this platform will allow for determination student performance on questions testing the understanding of learning objectives. In addition, quantitative and qualitative feedback will be solicited fro m the students via Google Forms. This feedback will encompass questions regarding self - reported perception of the module, including a comparison to similar in -person US sessions conducted in the first year. Students will also be asked to self -report their comfort with using US to aid in clinical diagnosis. Any qualitative feedback will be reviewed for common the mes. Students will also have multiple choice questions pertaining to the session included on their end -of-unit summative examinations, which will al low for comparison to performance on similar questions included on exams in past years. Potential Impact: This innovation provides a model for a remote US session for pre -clerkship medical students that decreases the necessary resources while remaining in teractive. It is our hope that it will be replicated by educators who are seeking engaging, low -cost solutions to provide continuity to their US curricula during a period of online learning. 171References: 1) COVID- 19 updates and resources.

Need /Rationale: As students transition from the preclinical to clinical years of medical school, it becomes imperative not just to arrive at a correct answer on a multiple -choice test, but to be able to employ clinical reasoning skills for diagnostic assessments in real -word scenarios. These skills are often left to the \"hidden curriculum,\" obtained by observing attendings and residents discuss their diagnostic reasoning on rounds and during morning report case conferences. As such, there is a need for opportunities for students to both learn the terminology and theory of clinical reasoning, and to have structured practice and coaching working through cases. Previous work on teaching clinical r easoning and adult learning theory suggest that deliberate, repeated practice is required to accomplish improvement in a new skill, such as diagnostic reasoning (1). The need for this type of formal curriculum is supported by a nationwide survey of internal medicine clerkship directors that showed most institutions lack sessions dedicated to topics of clinical reasoning, despite the belief of the majority of clerkship directors that clinical reasoning should be taught during medical school, with the greates t emphasis during the clinical years (2). Methods: This four- week part- time elective provides a small group of MS3 and MS4 students with three curricular elements aimed at strengthening skills in clinical reasoning - (1) Didact ic material on theories of clinical reasoning, (2) Active participation in case discussions, and (3) Guided production of educational content to be shared with peers. The elective takes place virtually, with all sessions held via the Zoom platform, but can be easily adap ted to in- person sessions. Didactic material is introduced over the first three weeks of the elective, with a different theme each week. Students engage with curricula published on online platforms and answer discussion questions. Active par ticipation in case discussions takes two forms: weeklong cases released and analyzed in daily aliquots, as well as live morning report style case discussions. As students work through weeklong cases, they submit their clinical reasoning and problem representations for re view by a faculty facilitator, encouraging the deliberate and repeated practice described above. Live morning report style cases occur twice during the elective. Students are divided into two groups, with each group responsible for presenting a case one week, and discussing a case one week with the guidance of an expert faculty discussant. Finally, production of educational content involves students preparing two diagnostic schema and two illness scripts to be shared with the rest of the stud ents in the elective. Evaluation Plan : To maintain accountability, we track student completion of didactic training, weeklong cases, and produced educational material through student submission of completed work in each respective component. To assess stu dent and faculty reaction to the elective, we seek feedback in the form of end of elective reflection essays. Results of a pilot cohort of this elective revealed one student's thoughtful reflection - \"this deliberate approach to how we build these mental s hortcuts (schemas/scripts) will not only help us build them more efficiently but also will allow us to constantly be aware of how they may fail us.\" Evaluation of the elective's effect on student outcomes will take place through review of daily submitted problem representations according to grading rubric. Student competency in forming problem representations will be assessed longitudinally as they progress through the elective as a way of qualitatively measuring improvement. Additionally, students will undergo pre - and post -assessments to measure changes in knowledge of clinical reasoning topics and self -perceived competency in components of diagnostic reasoning. Potential Impact : To become successful clinicians, it is imperative that medical students buil d skills in clinical reasoning. This elective provides a platform for active and deliberate practice that can lead trainees become stronger and more confident in their clinical reasoning skills. 173 References: 1) Kassirer, Jerome P.

J Gen 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 5 : Skill Teaching Poster #060 Inter- Professionally Achieving Change: Implementing Evidence Richmond, Richard; Vallabhaneni,Pramodh Department of Paediatrics, Morriston Hospital, Swansea Problem Statement : Infant lumbar punctures are often difficult and latest positioning techniques are not commonly used. This gap in knowledge may cause potential harm. Rationale: With rapidly evolving evidence, it is often difficult to keep up with latest techniques and advances. It is good practice to check oxygen saturation during infan t lumbar punctures and also to use the soto -ramp technique. It is also important not to flex the neck of infants during lumbar punctures. Anecdotal evidence suggested very few clinicians and nurses new about these two me asures. It could be argued that such lack of awareness about a fairly common procedure in paediatrics was of concern. Keeping in line with incremental change principle of quality improvement we worked with nursing colleagues as the first intervention to im plement evidence based practices for infant lumbar punctures. The rationale for doing it with nursing colleagues in the first instance was keeping in view of long term learning application as junior doctors rotate frequently between departments. Methods: A initial scoping survey was underta ken followed by an educational package that incorporated principles of retrieval practice. The survey was repeated following the successful delivery of the educational package to check retention of facts. Education was delivered both via face to face methods and power -point slides. The key learning objectives were the role of pulse oximetry in infant lumbar punctures, why neck flexion should be avoided in the lateral decubitus position and the Soto ramp technique for infa nt lumbar punctures. An info graphic was created to help in further consolidation of learning and for future use. Quizzes were undertaken to check retention of knowledge and thus using principles of retrieval and interleaving. We also wanted learning to be encouraged even in busy work settin gs. We emphasised on retrieving knowledge and applying it to current practice. The retrieval practice technique was used as no pass/fail approach. Results: The initial survey was completed by 15 nursing colleagues. The survey respondents were voluntary an d random.None of the participants were using pulse oximetry during infant lumbar punctures. 11 of the respondents felt neck flexion was important during the procedure. Only one respondent knew any alternative positions to hold infants during lumbar punctures. Following this the same cohort were invited to undertake the learning package. The learning package was undertaken over the next four weeks. Through word of mouth another twelve participants were enrolled. This meant 27 colleagues completed the learnin g package. A retention quiz was undertaken to see retention of knowledge. This was completed by 22 participants who undertook the learning package. The median score achieved by the group was four out of five. Potential Impact: This simple but effective qu ality improvement project demonstrates to achieve long term changes it is important to engage learners and focus on behaviour change. This change can only be achieved when learners have the knowledge, skills and attitude . We used retrieval practice methods to aid retention of knowledge and thereby impacting change.

Need /Rationale: As defined by the American Osteopathic Association, Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) is a set of hands -on techniques used by osteopathic physicians (DOs) to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness or injury (1). Benefits of OMT include restoring the body's innate ability to heal itself, speeding up recovery time, providing quick r elief for patients who have been suffering from muscle aches and pain, and relieving joint restriction and bone misalignment. DO residents are required to have supervision from a DO attending in order to perform OMT on patients. Currently, there are no guidelines or curriculum in place at our residency program in order to allow residents to practice OMT. East Valley Community Health Center, where our residents see c ontinuity patients, is an FQHC. Many of our patients are uninsured and/or underinsured and are unable to afford physical therapy or alternative treatment modalities. Providing OMT in our clinic would offer them an additional treatment option. Methods: Pat ients would be offered the following OMT techniques: articulatory, soft tissue, myofascial release, counterstrain, balanced ligamentous tension, muscle energy, and lymphatic drainage. OMT may be deferred on patients with contraindications, such as those with malignancy, osteoporosis, current deep venous thrombosis, bony joint instability, and myelopathy. OMT is ideally performed on a flat, cushioned massage table. Patients are recommended to be dressed ideally in sporting wear to provide an improved experience, and offered a light sheet and pillow. There is an initial intake appointment to evaluate whether the internal referral for OMT is reasonable. Subsequent appointments will be devoted to OMT on the proposed medical issue and will be 30 minutes in length. Patients may be asked to fill out a questionnaire before and after OMT is offered to evalua te the efficacy of this treatment modality for them. A curriculum for expanding and reinforcing our knowledge of OMT will be further developed with Dr. Chen- Joea for DO residents in the Emanate Health Family Medicine Residency Program. DO residents may be signed off by our DO preceptor Dr. Chen -Joea after passing a competency evaluation to perform OMT in clinic. All encounters in which OMT is performed may be superv ised, and/or signed off by a DO preceptor. Evaluation Plan: There are three components to th is project that must be evaluated: residents' ability to perform OMT, the OMT curriculum to be developed, and the efficacy of OMT in our clinic. In order to deem a resident competent in performing OMT, s/he will be evaluated by our DO preceptor Dr. Chen - Joea following a rubric with criteria to gauge performance of each technique, ability to explain the technique, and confidence level. Residents must pass the compete ncy exam to perform the technique in clinic on patients. The OMT curriculum may include, alth ough not limited to, didactic lectures, hands on learning during workshops, virtual video procedure review of OMT techniques, assigned readings and journal article s, osteopathic medical education conference, and OMT case presentation. The curriculum will further DO resident existing osteopathic principles and philosophy and techniques, as well as introduce the concept to MD residents. The curriculum's efficacy will be assessed through pre - and post - tests with residents. In the long term, we can assess patie nt improvement in pain and function after OMT through serial patient surveys and by reviewing physician documentation. Potential Impact : By incorporating OMT into ACGME accredited residencies, the Emanate Health Family Medicine Residency is modeling a way to keep the osteopathic tradition alive amidst a predominantly allopathic program. Additionally, offering OMT at our partner FQHC provides additional treatment options to patients with limited resources. 176References: 1) American Osteopathic Association. 2020. 177Thursday, 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 5: Skill Teaching Poster #062 Procedural Skills Training for Non -US Medical Graduates Entering a Transitional (1) Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi; (2) Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: Interprofessional coll aborative workshops and longitudinal precepting for transitional year residents to build basic procedural competency. Need /Rationale: There is growing concern that medical school graduates are inadequately prepared for basic procedural skills when entering into residency (1,2). In a study by Bruce (2017) graduating medical students note that while some skills (e.g., basic CPR, bag/mask ventilation) were well taught, other skills like venipuncture, IV -line placement were given less importance (1). For Inter national Medical Graduates (IMGs) a significant gap exists between the actual and expected stan dards of procedural skills proficiency at the time of internship (2). At our center, we identified this gap and began formulating a one - year curriculum for basic procedural skills training. Due to diverse skills sets, an innovative skills building simulation workshop is being created to be led by a multidisciplinary team of phlebotomists, nurses, physicians utilizing the concepts of Interprofessional collaboration that engages, \"diverse professionals to complement own professional expertise and utilizes ful l scope of knowledge and skills to provide safe, efficient care\" (3). To accomplish the goal of resident procedural competency we propose a multi -station worksho p combined with longitudinal precepting of skills at the bedside. Methods: The learners are 10 Transitional Year residents. The four skills are phlebotomy, IV -line insertion, nasogastric tube and urinary catheter placement. Step One: 5 -hour workshop to include 1) review of the four procedures using video illustrations of each; and 4 hours of skill training, one hour per station, with residents rotating in pairs or trios. The workshop will be led by the program director and executed by our multidisciplinary team. All stations utilize a mannequin so that each learner could practice the skills multiple times. Step Two: Learners will then proceed through their clinical rotations with bedside preceptors who will train and directly observe learners performing the procedures across various inpatient clinical areas. The preceptors will be phlebotomists, nurs es and physicians who will utilize the principles of collaborative clinical education (Westberg & Jason, 1993) and deliberate practice (Ambrose, 2011) with each learner. Step Three: A mid-year, 4 -hour Simulation Training Workshop will be conducted to conti nue skill building and measure current competency. Step Four: End of year bedside skill evaluation by faculty. It is expected that simulation and bedside training by multidisciplinary preceptors will lead to better learning outcomes. Our team build this pr oject using principles of adult learning (deliberate practice with feedback, motivation, active learning) and interprofessional teaching in creating the procedur al curriculum. Evaluation Plan: The project evaluation includes four elements: 1) Accountabili ty: A checklist will be provided to track all workshop, precepting, and assessment activities and midyear feedback survey of instructors will gather data on thei r precepting activities. 2) Reaction: Standard session and preceptor evaluation forms will be used to gather student opinions on project elements. 3) Learning: A pre -post quiz will be administered assess knowledge. conducted to identify baseline knowledge. Procedural Logs will be maintained by each learner and reviewed. The midyear workshop will hav e added measures of competency. Post workshop debriefings will allow for self -reflection, and areas for improvement. Behavior: As learners go through their clini cal rotations, they will maintain documentation that capture competency milestones and targeted feedback comments from preceptors. End of rotation forms and face- to-face feedback forms will track learner behavior over time. Potential Impact : If our interprofessional collaborative project demonstrate effectiveness it could be used as 1) a model for procedural skill training in GME programs where Incoming learners lack required procedural skills, or 2) expanded to other skills related to systems -based practi ce and communication that are perhaps best taught by an interprofessional team. 178References: 1) Bruce A.N., Kumar A., Malekzadeh S.

Need /Rationale: Procedural sedation is considered a core competency in emergen cy medicine (EM) residency training. The Review Committee for Emergency Medicine expects EM residents to performed at least 15 supervised procedure sedation encounters by graduation (1). It is challenging to ensure that current trainees have sufficient exp erience in sedation with limitations on t raining hours, demands for more extensive supervision, and an increasing focus on patient safety (2). In our community -based program teaching, the skills with actual patients are particularly challenging. Simulation (with structured debriefing) is a well -established method used to educate sedation providers to demonstrate their knowledge and practice their techniques without placing patients at risk. (2) Simulation exercises enable participants to develop their competency in a safe learning environment; it has improved provider proficiency in performing procedural sedation and analgesia, independent of provider profession and clinical experience (3). This project is the first simulation project in our department with the emergency department chair's support and the oversight of a fellowship- trained simulation EM physician. Methods: The learners will be 12 emergency medicine first and second residents at the beginning of their academic year. It will be conducted in the hospital's simulation center. The sessions will be on Thursdays for two hours, with four sessions in total. A board -certified emergency medicine physician will lead the simulation -based education cases. The simulation project's primary goal is to enhance residents' knowledge and skills in relati on to procedure sedation. It will include helping residents build knowledge related to the wide range of pharmacology utilized for sedation, assisting them in skills for difficult airway management, and monitoring p atients during and after the sedation. The four sessions will be: 1) selecting and administering the correct drug; 2) airway management; 3) anticipating and handling complications, and 4) monitoring patients during and after sedation. Each session will sta rt with a ten- minute introduction and nee ds assessment, followed by twenty minutes of an interactive case presentation focus on the topic of the week. After that, the resident will participate in a sixty -minute simulation using rapid cycle deliberate pract ice (RCDP) with relevant procedure sedati on cases. The simulation portion includes targeted feedback to enhance procedural skill and analgesia knowledge. The final 30 minutes of each session will include a debriefing of the simulation with 5 minutes for a knowledge post-test and session evaluatio n survey. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: The instructors will use a checklist for observation of program elements to track all planned activities and ensure that all learners participated and were supervised in t he simulations as planned. Reaction: Lear ners will complete standard session evaluation surveys at the end of each session and a follow -up survey one month after completion of the curriculum. Learning: Learning will be assessed using direct observation (wi th a checklist) during the simulation sce narios. Targeted feedback will be provided during each simulation scenario. Session posttests will be utilized to assess relevant learner knowledge. Behavior: Direct observation with a checklist for each resident wi ll be conducted at least once during a sh ift in the emergency room, post -participation. Potential Impact : This model for enhancing procedure sedation knowledge and skill for emergency medicine residents (EM) can be shared with anesthesia, pediatric reside nts, or pediatric EM fellows as it is a core competency in their training. If successful, we can share our process and our cases with other programs nationally and internationally. 180References: 1) Acgme.org.2020.[online]Availableat:&lt;http://www.acgme.org /Portals/0/PFAssets/ProgramResources /EM_Key_Index_Procedure_Minimums_103117.pdf&gt; [Accessed 15 September 2020]. 2) Fehr JJ, Chao J, Kuan C, Zhong J. The important role of simulation in sedation. Cur r 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 5: Skill Teaching Poster #064 Gel-ling Together an Inpatient and Outpatient Ultrasound Curriculum in a 10 Day Course Gabriel, Andrew; Brickner, Leslea; Ingraham, Au brey Kaiser Permanente, Oakland Internal Medicine Residency Idea: Incorporating a 2 week ultrasound curriculum with both inpatient and outpatient components will better prepare residents for their future practice. Need /Rationale: With the advent of cheap er, portable ultrasound technology, the standard of care for practicing medicine is changing to incorporate bedside ultrasound in the patient evaluation. Emergency medicine is amongst the first fields to incorporate point of care ultrasound (POCUS) into th eir residency curricula. Internal medicine (IM) is now in its transition phase and prototype curricula should be trialed to discern where ultrasound could be most helpful. In addition to providing real time clinical information to guide decision making, bedside ultrasound is cost -effective when answering simple yes or no questions. This allocates hospital resources more effectively while expedit ing the care of patients. This paradigm not only applies to the inpatient setting but also the outpatient setting. Designing a 2 -week prototype ultrasound course (with both inpatient & outpatient opportunities) will allow programs to provide training for their trainees in whichever career pathway they choose. Methods: The proposed curriculum would have 10 days, split up into morning and afternoon parts. Every afternoon, residents would go to procedure clinic in the outpatient setting, performing paracenteses and thoracenteses with ultrasound assistance. For the morning schedule: Day 1 AM - Orientation to knobology, ind icator, and image optimization with experienced ultrasound clinician. A pre -test will be given on image recognition of common pathologies. A google doc with collected youtube instructional videos on image acquisition and pathology cases will be given for i ndependent study. Days 2, 5, 6, 7 AM - Inpatient experience with ultrasound clinician where the resident and preceptor would ultrasound patient s on ward teams to answer a specific question or to observe a known pathology after obtaining permission from the patient. Days 3, 4, 8, 9 AM - Resident outpatient clinic where residents are given the opportunity to use ultrasound to address urgent care que stions that their patients may have. This would entail analyzing for shortness of breath, tachycardia, fracture, leg swelling, abdominal pain, blurry vision/headache, lumps/bumps, and kidney injury. Day 10 AM - Final day where residents are assessed on their progress and surveyed on the effectiveness of the curriculum for further growth. Evaluation Plan: Residents wi ll be given a pre - and post -test at the end of their rotation on image acquisition and image recognition of common pathologies. They will then be surveyed on their thoughts on the curriculum and how to further tailor it to the ir needs. Potential Impact : This course could serve as a framework for IM residencies to structure their own ultrasound curriculum. In time, POCUS will become a cost -effective reality as simple questions would be answered in- office or in the patient's hospital room, foregoing a trip to radiology and allowing for expedited care.

Ultrasound Guidelines: Emergency, Point -of -care, and Clinical U ltrasound 7:30 pm Poster Session 5: Skill Teaching Poster #065 Funding and Developing a POCUS Curriculum for the Emanate Health Family Medicine Medicine Residency Program Idea: To develop a low cost one -year longitudinal POCUS curriculum at a community -based family medicine residency program (FMRP). Need /Rationale: Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a readily available tool that can improve pat ient care by cutting down costs and guiding physicians in their medical decision making. POCUS in primary care has proven crucial for screening and diagnostic purposes, including but not limited to aortic dissections, DVT, cysts, thyroid lesions, cardiac abnormalities, and more. (2). Growing evidence has demonstrated ultrasonography as a tool superior to auscultation and radiography in the assessment of acute respiratory failure (3). Currently, the Emanate Health FMRP does not have a POCUS curriculum. Our o bjective is to develop an innovative and engaging POCUS curriculum that takes place through live, interactive workshops rather than through didactic -style or computer -based learning in order to maximize engagement and practical application. Importantly fro m a budgeting standpoint, our set -up is designed to be more cost effective than alternatives, estimated to be approximately $14,000. Methods: Using grant funds previ ously awarded to our residency program, we plan to purchase five Butterfly ultrasound machines to start a POCUS curriculum for our residency program. POCUS lessons will be live, occurring 1 -2 times per month in the evening after residents have finished the ir shifts in order to facilitate attendance. Of the 28 residents in our pro gram, 10 are currently part of the interest group who will attend these evening sessions. In order to accommodate for the COVID -19 pandemic, meetings will take place in a large room with space for social distancing, while instructors may be streamed virtua lly. Residents will pair up to share the five available ultrasound machines and practice on each other throughout the workshop. Workshops will take the form of short lectures to tea ch the fundamentals of ultrasound technology and anatomy, interspersed with 10-minute increments for residents to practice on each other. Each workshop would focus on a different system, including OBGYN, cardiovascular, trauma, biliary, urinary, MSK/soft t issues, thoracic/pulmonary, and ocular, as recommended by the AAFP POCUS curriculum (1). After being evaluated for competency, trained residents will teach the material to the remaining residents in small groups during continuity clinic or inpatient rotati on, as residents are readily present in teams at these times. Over time, we will establish a longitudinal design where trained residents will continually train subsequent generations. Evaluation Plan: In order to assess the efficacy of our program's POCUS curriculum, we will evaluate residents in the following three groups: resi dents participating in POCUS training sessions (AY 2020 - 2021), residents NOT participating in training sessions (AY 2020 -2021), and residents trained by resident champions (AY 2021 -2022). Evaluations will take the form of pre - and post -tests covering the t opics of physics of ultrasonography; transducer types; ultrasound imaging orientation, optimization, interpretation, and terminology; anatomy; scanning techniques and modes; applications; and safety. Under statistical analysis, we would expect residents in POCUS training sessions to score significantly higher than residents who have not been trained, and we would also expect significantly higher post -test than pre - test scores. Reside nts trained by resident champions should score similarly to those who participated in the training sessions held the first year. OSCEs will also be implemented to test our ability to successfully carry out a POCUS exam. OSCEs are an excellent opportunity t o give feedback on performance in order to help guide improvement, as well as to gauge how confident the resident is in performing the POCUS exam. An additional pre- and post -questionnaire will be administered to measure comfort level on a 5 - point scale. Furthermore, residents will log each ultrasound procedure they perform in the clinic and hospital, to be signed off by a preceptor who will evaluate their competence. 183 Potential Impact : A survey in 2014 showed only 2% of FMRPs implemented a POCUS curricu lum (2). With the development of our POCUS curriculum, we are not only mode rnizing the field and keeping it up to date with the latest innovations in technology; we are modeling a cheap, champion -led longitudinal curriculum that can be replicated by other residents.

Need /Ratio nale: Learning to safely prescribe pediatric parenteral nutrition (PN) is daunting, as there is minimal nutrition education during medical school (1), residency, and fellowship training (2). PN is complex, individualized, and requires numerous calculations ; it is thereby prone to error (3). The initial learning curve is steep, and residents may periodically need to relearn the details of managing fluid volume, macronutrients, and micronutrients. However, teaching in the clinical setting may lead to incongru ent experiences between learners, and is limited by time; placing PN ordering is time- sensitive, as pharmacists need adequate time to prepare solutions. An online, interactive simulator where trainees can practic e PN ordering and administration prior to clinical rotations where patients will likely require PN (i.e. intensive care units) would allow for active learning outside the clinical setting. We hypothesize this tool would increase trainees' knowledge and confidence in PN ordering. Methods: Our interactive PN simulator learning tool will be designed by a multidisciplinary clinical team including registered dietitians, pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners, and will have two components. First, an Articulate interactive learning module will present foundational knowledge about PN indications, components, requirements, and management. Second, interactive cases will be built using an interactive medical education platform (Med2Lab). Trainees wil l care for simulated pediatric patient s across multiple time points to mimic the continuity of real patient care. Trainees will be able to review patient charts, check vital signs, perform physical exams, and place orders for labs, imaging, studies, and in terventions. Trainees will be responsi ble for prescribing initial PN orders and, using a structured framework, evaluating the progress of the patient, making any necessary clinical management decisions, and adjusting the PN prescription as needed. Trainees will receive individualized, real -time feedback, with each action categorized into a competency domain, so trainees will be able to review their strengths and areas for improvement. Evaluation Plan: We aim to conduct a prospective observational pilot study with a convenience sample of learners that voluntarily access the learning modules published on www.OPENPediatrics.org, a free, online learning platform for healthcare professionals. This pilot evaluation of this curriculum will help provide validity evidence for the learning activity. The module will be integrated into a curriculum that will include pre - and post -module testing. By comparing pre - and post -tests using paired t -tests, we will assess changes in knowledge after using the interactive PN module. Additionally, we will assess demographic information, including questions about users' clinical experience and past experience with PN; user confidence in prescribing and modifying PN orders; and basic knowledge of PN management. Confidence scores will be compared before and after using the modules. We will also collect qualitative feedback and satisfaction on user experience in order to identify potential areas of improvement for the learning activity. We plan to report descriptive statistics obtained from learning analytics including the number of users who accessed the module, geolocation, and how long they spent using the modules. Potential Impact : Errors in PN initiation, dosing, and daily adjustments to individual components can lead to significan t adverse events. This risk of error is compounded by the lack of comprehensive nutritional education in medical training. Utilizing an educational simulation tool may improve trainee knowledge, confidence, and independence in PN prescribing. 185References: 1) Devries S, Dalen JE, Eisenberg DM, et al.

Need /Rationale: Musculoskeletal complaints make up 20% of pediatric primary care practice (1). However, there is limited training in orthopedic skills. A 2011 survey of training gaps in graduating pediatric residents identified orthopedics as one of the three mai n curriculum needs (2). This study highlighted an educational gap in pediatric residency training and the need for an innovative curriculum to address these needs. There has been a paucity in literature focused on addressing how best to attain these skills. A 2001 study implemented a robust teaching intervention which improved pediatric ankle and knee examinations in trainees, however that study has not been replicated or expanded to include other clinical orthopedic skills (3). To solve the need to build orthopedic skills, we have developed an educational intervention: a workshop with four interactive case- based stations that will allow for pediatric residents to build on needed musculoskeletal physical exam skills by providing a systematic approach to assessing common orthopedic concerns at well child visits. Methods: The USC Pediatric Residency program has 17 residents (11 pediatric residents, 6 med/peds residents) per year. Since pediatric orthopedics is an elective, there is no formal training on these skills. This workshop will meet that need. Sixteen interns will participate. The following common orthopedic issues will be addressed at the 4 stations: in -toeing, scoliosis, developmental dysplasia of the hip, and flat feet. In addition to targeted physic al exam, we will incorporate videos, 3D printed models, and review of relevant imaging. Learners will also build skills in providing anticipatory guidance to parents and review the indications for referral. Each 40 -minute station will pro vide the opportuni ty for deliberate practice with focused feedback from an experienced clinician. The timing will allow for multiple practice opportunities at each station. This will be followed by board style question and answer review in a large group to cover important e lements from the four cases. This will be done in a rapid -fire method with 20 questions - team -based competition (question, team discussion, answer with visual image and explanation); At the end, a 5 -minute ARS quiz (10 seconds per questi on) we will determ ine group knowledge. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: a) track the timing of session to ensure that the plan can be completed in the time allotted, b) note any challenges with the models or volunteers at the station, and 3) track the timing of the know ledge portion. 2) Reaction: a standardized resident survey will be administered immediately after the workshop to evaluate resident perceptions about the usefulness of the session in their general pediatrics continuity clinic. 3) Learning: a) the ARS -delivered quiz at end of session focused on reinforcing the four topics will be used to measure learning. b) a retrospective pre - post questionnaire will be used assessing perceive confidence, skills, and of including the screen in their outpatient practice to m easure learner perception 4) We will conduct a follow -up survey after 3 months to query learners about any changes in relevant outpatient care or parent education practices. Potential Impact : By creating a standardized musculoskeletal wo rkshop for pediatr ic orthopedics, this can be shared nationally to be used at other training programs for not only pediatrics residents, but for family medicine residents and emergency medicine fellows, general pediatricians and nurse practitioners to incorporate in their practice.

Need /Rationale: As technology continues to transform medicine and healthcare delivery, physicians must not only understand upcoming tools to provide better care, but also ideate within new clinical contexts to bring future medical innovati ons to market. While physicians are often confined to evaluating safety and efficacy downstream of product ideation, their insights can prove crucial througho ut the development process [1]. They can better assess clinical needs in the context of realities that may otherwise lead to late stage failures or poor product design [1, 3]. Thus, there is a call for physicians to understand 1) the scientific and enginee ring foundations of biotechnology and 2) the process of product development, from needs finding and design thinking to market strategy. This enables physicians to communicate their ideas effectively to interdisciplinary teams and bridges perspectives in bi otechnology, entrepreneurship, and clinical medicine. While current medical education is slowly in tegrating these concepts into formal curricula, it may take years for structured integrations to become widespread. With in.vision, we demonstrate that studen ts can also initiate extracurricular opportunities to begin meeting this need. Methods: Four core objectives have been identified for this course: 1) recognize upcoming applications of technology in medicine, 2) identify clinical opportunities and challenges associated with each advancement, 3) conceive of novel ideas based on clinical needs finding and screening strategies and 4) understand the pipeline of concept generation to market implementation based on modern MedTech innovation education models [2,3]. The series consists of seven sessions, including 6 didactics, and a final presentation \"pitch d ay\". Didactics will have either a tech- focus or an innovation -focus. Each session will consist of a 45 -minute lecture aimed at coveri ng the foundations of an upcoming sphere of technology (ex. machine learning, tissue engineering, robotics), and a 30 -minut e hands- on workshop component aimed at helping students develop the basic technical skills, like 3D printing and simple coding, to pr ototype their future ideas. The course will culminate in a final \"pitch day\", where students will form teams to address and present an identified clinical need as well as a proposed solution. In a future context where in -person events & collaborations are appropriate, a longitudinal project experience will facilitate the development of proposed solutions, based on a timeline proposed by prior programs. Students may further advance their ideas to market using any takeaways and resources from the course. Evaluation Plan: Learner experience will be consistently gauged by: 1) tracking participant attendance at each event, 2) admin istering a feedback survey after every session, and 3) analyzing pitch day presentations to determine what additional experiences may benefit students. The survey will assess a quantitative evaluation of the quality of each session alongside open- ended feedback. Pitch day presentations will be analyzed for clinical feasibility by physician stakeholders. Exceptional projects will receive further support from healthcare systems at Boston Medical Center to pursue product development. Results will be examined longitudinally over the duration of the series to assess efficacy. Areas of improvement will be noted in further developing and enhanc ing the series for future years. As another platform of assessing the efficacy of in.vision, we will follow each year's cohort of participants in a longitudinal prospective study to identify how our didactics and practical workshops have influenced their own innovations and medical product development. 189 Potential Impact : This student -led initiative can offer a model for medical educators to build deeper curricular integrations of innovation education. The two -pronged approach of covering both technology education and product development/entrepreneurship may enable physicians to better leverage technology and structure their innovations.

Need /Rationale: The need for Business of Medicine (BoM) education for future physicians has been documented and recommended. Despite this well -documented need, many residents and fellows are ill - equipped to handle the BoM topics they face daily. One study interviewed surgical program directors and found that 87% of the participants agreed that residents should be trained in practice management, yet over 70% of the program directors reported that their residents were inadequately trained in t his topic. Unfortunately, this gap in BoM education seems to extend beyond the work -life of physicians into their personal finances. Despite the majority of medical students needing to manage a large amount of debt, only 5% consider themselves knowledgeable in loan repayment options. Upon identifying this gap in medical education, the University of Louisville School of Medicine designed and implemented a four - week BoM elective course for fourth -year medical students. Methods: A four -week elective course was created utilizing select modules from the Physician Business Academy by Medscape, Ted Talks, podcasts, and Harvard Business Review Articles to provide fourth - year medical s tudents with an education in the BoM. The University of Louisville School of Medicine partnered with Medscape to create a unique website for students to access, allowing them to complete selected Physician Business Academy modules. Student performance on t hese modules are to be reported to the school. Each week of the course fo cuses on a unique overarching theme, ending on Friday with a group discussion. For students wishing to complete the course with honors, additional Ted Talks, articles, and online modu les will be provided for completion. An IRB approved survey will be provided to the students prior to and after the course to assess student knowledge, confidence, and interest in the topics covered by the course, with the goal of determining the efficacy of the education program. If this elective is determined to be an effecti ve means of educating medical students, the course creators and Medscape hope to expand this curriculum to medical schools across the country, allowing many medical students to receive an education in important business topics. Evaluation Plan: To evaluat e this course, students will be asked to participate in a voluntary, IRB - approved survey. Prior to the start date of the elective, the students enrolled will be emailed a link to the Google Forms pre -course survey with a description of this study and a pre amble of consent. Upon completion of the course, the students enrolled will be emailed a link to the Google Forms post -course survey, along with the description of this study and a pr eamble of consent. The purpose of these surveys is to assess the students' baseline level of knowledge, interest, and confidence in their understanding of the business of medicine. The surveys will contain multiple -choice questions reviewing the material presented in the elective course to evaluate the participants' knowledge of the business of medicine. Both surveys will utilize a Likert Scale to assess the participants' interest and confidence in their understanding of the topics covered by the course. Additionally, demographic information will be assessed by the surveys. The pre- course and post -course surveys are identical with one exception, in which the post -course survey will also contain a section where the students can leave feedback of the course. T he results of the pre and post -course surveys will be compared to determi ne if the students gain confidence, knowledge, and interest in the business of medicine after completing the elective course. Potential Impact : Providing medical students with an edu cation in the business of medicine can allow students to develop an inter est in this field and possess more confidence to tackle the business side of medicine. 191References: 1) Wang, J.

Lewis Katz School of Medicine Problem Statement : To update our emergency medicine (EM) clerkship curriculum, we developed a targeted needs assessment as previously described by Kern and colleagues [1]. Rationale: Prior minor revisions and updates of our EM clerkship curriculum have been informal and largely based on perceived need. In addition, the prior clerkship curriculum has been loosely defined and at times modified on the fly. Embarking on a more formal process of curriculum renewal was well -timed with the recently published national 4th -year curriculum as well as the development of the National Board of Medical Examiners Advanced Clinical Examination in EM in 2014 [2]. A review of the published national curriculum helped set the groundwork for a for mal approach to curriculum renewal which we started with the development and implementation of a targeted needs assessment. This was also important as the time constraints associated with a 4 -week rotation woul d also prevent us from covering all topics out lined in the national curriculum. We felt a targeted needs assessment would provide us with valuable information as we moved forward with this process of curriculum renewal. Methods: A two -part targeted needs assessment was developed. The initial survey was distributed to a small group of educators (n -14). The participants included clerkship and residency leadership, senior educators and chief residents. The survey focused on; Clinical Concepts, Chief Complaint s, Clinical Conditions/Diseases, Procedures/Cl inical Tasks, Clinical decision rules and Topics specific to EM. This survey used open -ended questions to allow the participants to self- identify concepts, chief complaints, etc. that they perceived as importan t for all students to be exposed to during the ir rotation. All responses from this pilot were reviewed to identify patterns, duplicates, etc. allowing the response options for the larger follow up survey to be populated. The second part of the targeted nee ds assessment was a \"follow up\" survey of a la rger group of faculty, residents and students (n -61) to help prioritize data obtained from the first survey, this included the original 14 participants along with key teaching faculty at affiliate hospitals, medical students and interns in our residency program. The follow- up survey was arranged similarly in regards to format; however, the follow -up survey used closed- ended questions. Participants were asked to prioritize the response options as: Very Important, Somewhat Important or Less Important. The goa l for the follow- up survey was to prioritize the response options based on the perceived level of importance. Results: All 14 participants (100%) responded to the initial survey, data from this survey was used to populate responses for the follow -up survey. Fifty- three of 61 (87%) participants surveyed for the 2nd part of the targeted needs assessment responded. From the responses, we were able to identify 4 key clinical concepts that were felt to be \"Very Impo rtant\" to emphasize during the EM clerkship. These are: Approach to the undifferentiated patient, performing a focused H&P, recognizing \"Red Flag\" symptoms, sick vs. not sick. These concepts have since been incorporated into the curriculum and are a focal point of discussion during the rotation orientation. In addition, 4 key chief complaints were identified to be \"Very Important\" in emphasizing during the EM clerkship. These are; Abdominal pain, altered mental status, chest pain and shortness of breath. Th ese chief complaints have served as the basis for didactic cases used during the clerkship in our institution's simulation center. Additional didactic cases have been developed or updated to reflect the importance of various clinical conditions and topics specific to EM as identified th rough the targeted needs assessment. Key clinical decision rules identified as important have also been incorporated into our mandatory evidence -based medicine assignment. Pre and post curricular intervention evaluations have demonstrated a positive trend as noted by the students regarding these curricular changes. 193Potential Impact : Lessons Learned: Our curriculum renewal was approached systematically and incorporated data gathered from stakeholders; students, residents and faculty through a targeted nee ds assessment. The approach was organized and based on a best practice approach and was viewed positively by the students. References: 1) Kern DE, Thomas PA, Hughes MT.

Acad Emerg Med. 2010;17:638 194Thursday, 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 6: Curriculum Development Poster #071 Addressing the Need for an End of Life Care Curriculum for Pediatric Residents Weinberger, Kevin; Cramton, Rachel; Chen, Nancy University of Arizona Idea: Provide a curriculum dedicated to pediatric residents in providing end- of-life care to the pediatric population and families. Rationale: Curricula addressing end -of-life care for pediatric patients with terminal cancer, terminal neonates, cystic fibrosis and medically complex children can be found in MedEdPORTAL and PubMed. However, these curri cula are specific to the needs of fellows/specialists and other hospital staff (Nurses/NPs/Techs). No basic end -of-life curriculum is currently available for pediatric residents. However, as the ACGME requires pediatric tr ainees to have training in all stages of health and illness. Residents will undoubtedly care for patients in critical care settings who will unfortunately succumb to their illness. Most residents did not receive prior training on end -of-life care in medical school and therefore training is largely based on any clinical exposure. 1 Thus, the goal of this project is to provide a curriculum dedicated to pediatric residents in providing end -of-life care. Methods: We plan to follow Kern's 6 -step model for curriculum development. For our targete d needs assessment, we plan on surveying current University of Arizona Pediatric and combined Pediatric and Emergency Medicine residents using a Likert scale questionnaire. The survey will evaluate residents on their comfort level in end -of-life symptomati c management, delivering bad news and difficult conversations. The results of the needs assessment will guide the development of our educational interventions. Various educational strategies (lecture/small group/ role play/skill building) 2 will be used to deliver the content. The curriculum will be presented during one of the academic half days. Evaluation Plan: Residents will complete the same Likert scale questionnaire at the end of the curriculum to determine effectiveness of the curriculum. Further ev aluation could include end of academic year follow up as well as informal focus groups/discussions with residents after the completion of their Hematology/Oncology and PICU rotations. Potential Impact : Our new curric ula will address the needs of residents and pull from existing research to create a broad curriculum that can be used by pediatric residents in caring for pediatric patients at the end of their lives. This will improve patient care and increase residents' confidence in providing end of life care.

Rationale: Simulation -based education with standardized patients has become widespread in health care. Desp ite its broad uptake, existing models of patient -based simulation remain primarily instructor - driven. Few studies in the simulation literature have designed trainings that explicitly support trainees' role in self- regulating their own learning. Co -construc tive patient simulation (CCPS) is a novel approach that provides an individually t ailored and supportive alternative to traditional supervision and training. The framing of CCPS seeks to expand notions of narrative co -construction to include trainees and i nstructors as well as physicians and their patients. With the exception of MacKenzie (2018), no instructional design (ID) in medical education has explored the potential to utilize co -construction in patient simulation between a learner and an instructor to complicate power dynamics and foster mutual collaboration and learning. We describe the first implementation of CCPS in psychiatry. Methods: We conducted six CCPS sessions with senior trainees in child and adolescent psychiatry. Clinical scripts were co -developed with trainees and professional actors with experience performing as simulated patients (SPs). We conducted the simulation sessions with interviewers blind to the content of case scenarios enacted by the SPs. Each hour -long simulation was followe d by an hour- long debriefing session with all participants. We recorded and transc ribed case preparation, simulation interactions, and debriefing sessions, and analyzed anonymized transcripts by applying inductive thematic analysis within a constructivist framework, aided by NVivo software. Results: Each of the six CCPS sessions was at tended by a median of 13 participants (range, 11 -14). The first three sessions were conducted in person; the last three, which took place during the COVID -19 pandemic, via synchronized videoconferencing. Each of the sessions centered on clinically challeng ing and affectively charged situations informed by trainees' prior experiences. Through iterative thematic analysis we derived an alliterating '9R' model centered on three types of Reflection: a) in action / 'while doing' (Regulate, Relate and Reason); b) on action / 'having done' (Realities, Restraints and Relationships); and c) for action / 'will be doing' (with opportunities for Repair and Reaffirmation). Topics that are difficult to openly talk about may be especially appropriate for the CCPS model: wit hout overt guidance or solicitation, the scripts developed by learners for this series involved medical errors and error disclosure; racial tensions, including overt on-provider violence; sexual health; and the sharing of vulnerability and personal imperfections in the clinical setting. Potential Impact : CCPS and the 9R model can be effectively applied to psychiatry and have the potential to contribute uniquely to the educational needs of its trainees and practitioners. The 9R model, when combined with the co -construction of the case, can augment existing medical humanities and narrative medicine curriculum s. 196References: 1) Martin A, Weller I, Amsalem D, Duvivier R, Jaarsma D, Carvalho de Filho MA.

Frontiers in Psychiatry (submitted) . 197Thursday, 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 6: Curriculum Development Poster #073 Sleepy Kids: Helping Kids Get to Sleep with Digital CBT Dantus, Emily; Novak, Daniel Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: Developing pediatric specialists' knowledge of technology -based Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBTs) to help parents of children with sleep disorders . Need /Rationale: Insomnia and sleep disorders affect 40 -80% of children with neurodevelopmental disorders [1]. The gold standard for treating pediatric insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a technique which aims to change cognitive distortions and maladaptive be haviors that contribute to insomnia via coping mechanisms and emotion regulation [1]. Unfortunately, many pa rents do not seek out CBT for their children due to its high cost and a lack of access to trained professionals [2]. These issues are being addresse d in the adult population with digital CBT solutions such as Sleepio, an app proven to be as effective as live CBT at a lower cost and increased convenience [3]. In the pediatric population, however, no such product exists, and pediatric specialists do not uniformly receive training on digitally -provided CBT. This module will help to educate healthcare professionals on the role of these technologies in supporting parents of children who struggle to sleep. Methods: This online, self -paced curriculum will educate residents and providers in pediatrics and psychiatry on the benefits of using technology -enabled CBT tools with parents to ameliorate these conditions. Designed using the Challenge -based Learning Cycle (CBLC) learning framework, residents and physicians will encounter open -ended questions that will challenge their thinking. The learners will be asked to think about what they know about the use of technology -enabled CBT, review multiple perspectives, then reflect on how these resources can support changes in their work with patients. The curriculum introduces providers to key tools th at they can use to support parents, include validated measures such as the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire [5]. This thirty -minute module provides healthcare professionals with insight into three key questions that will orient the CBLC: 1) What does the current research indicate about the capacity of digital technologies to support parents and children in managing sleep disorders that stem from developmental disabiliti es?; 2) What role can technology - enabled CBT play in helping parents to manage and t rack their child's sleep disorder?; and 3) How can technology -enabled CBT help physicians to more effectively support parents? In learning about the latest developments and clinical applications of technology -enabled CBT, healthcare professionals will be better able to advise parents on the use of evidence -based tools and technologies. Evaluation Plan: This program will be evaluated using a mixed -methods approach. First, we will include an end- of-session satisfaction questionnaire to ensure that our module has provided the learner with a satisfactory learning experience and engaged them in the learning process. Second, we will include an end-of-session quiz that will test th e basic factual information from the module. Third, we will analyze the learne rs' responses to their initial thoughts and reflections questionnaires to determine if they have metacognitively identified changes in their thinking. Finally, in an automated fo llow-up email two weeks later, we will ask learners to identify how they have (or have not) changed their practice based on what they have learned in the module, or if they need different or additional information. By evaluating the online module using the se four strategies (satisfaction questionnaire, factual quiz, metacognitive reflection, and follow- up email), we will be able to determine whether our instructional materials are effective or need additional development in order to meet our instructional objectives. Potential Impact : Providing healthcare professionals with a better understanding of digital CBT for pediatric insomnia could increase access, decrease costs for patients and their families, and promote increased efficiency within the clinic. 198References: 1) Dewald -Kaufmann J, de Bruin E, Michael G.

Need /Rationale: Education on End of Life care is important and relevant as it is an experience that every physician will have to address at some point in their career. Patients may suffer unnecessary pain and families suffer as they see their loved ones suffer. Physicians suffer as they may have their own experiences with death and dying that are relived with each patient that passes. Meeting the needs of patients with terminal illness requires effectively trained clinicians to provide skillful and compassionate care. Desp ite mandates for End of Life (EoL) Care education, graduating residents do not consistently feel prepared to provide this care [2,3]. Without formal training in end -of-life care, \"physicians in the United States are less equipped to competently address ser iously ill and dying patients' medical, emotional, and spiritual needs\" [2]. The education of health professionals who provide care to people nearing the end of life has improved in the past two decades. However, \"the number of hospice and palliative care specialists is small, which means the need for palliative care also must be met through primary care and through the other clinical specialties that entail care for significant numbers of people nearing the end of life\"[1]. Methods: The course will be a one-hour session that will be offered every month, longitudinally over three years. The topics that will be discussed include: The Purpose of End of Life Care, Prognostication, Pain Control, Causes and Non -Pain, Nutrition and Hydration, Care Location, Bere avement, Medical Legal Issues, and Ethical and Cultural Concerns. A variety of active learning methods will be utilized including (1) icebreak ers, (2) interactive minilectures, (3) brainstorm exercises, (4) small group discussion (e.g., case discussions, review of videotapes of simulated patient care encounters, (5) reflections on their prior experiences with end of life care and feelings toward death and dying and (6) role play exercises reproducing challenging teaching and practice situations, and (6) opp ortunities for participants to identify both personal goals for improving their skills and comfort level with end of life care. Evaluation Pl an: The curriculum will be evaluated using multiple methods. 1) Tracking of learner participation in sessions and in; 2) Review of leaner reflections using rubrics to guide feedback and assess the overall quality of reflections; 3) Assessment of learner knowledge using brief pre- and post - quizzes; and 4) Final course evaluation questionnaire to gather data on the quality of the overall course (organization, teaching, individual sessions, reflections, assignments/feedback). A follow -up survey will be sent out to graduating Senior residents six months after graduation via email to evaluate ways each learner is utilizing the knowledge, skills and perspectives gained. Potential Impact : If this longitudinal curriculum is successful, it can be shared with other r esidencies. It can also expand to include other specialties, medical students and other Allied Health students who are interested in improving the quality of care they provide to patients at the End of Life. Furthermore, the curriculum can also be converte d into a workshop. References: 1) Institute of Medicine. 2015.

Need /Rationale: The increasing diversity in the U.S. requires a psychiatric workforce that can address the mental health needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds, with a culturally proficient, inclusive, and affirming approach (1). Psychiatric residents who engage in discussions about privilege and identity can be better prepared for culturally inclusive patient interactions (2). Residents' preparedness to provide cross- cultural care has bee n shown to be directly associated with their attitude toward cross -cultural care and their level of exposure to patients from diverse sociocultural backgrounds (3). A Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum can help psychiatry training programs meet the physician competencies as developed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. We plan to develop a DEI curri culum to better prepare residents to provide culturally inclusive care in order to meet the needs of a growing diverse population. Methods: A DEI curriculum is being developed for the 64 (PGY1 -4) residents in the psychiatry training program at UCSF. The 21- hour DEI curriculum will focus on professional development, gaining rele vant knowledge and build skills to enhance interaction with peers, faculty, staff and patients. The curriculum will explore professional identity formation and how residents' own bac kground impacts their values, beliefs and biases using stories and reflect ive exercises; connecting with patients across differences; power, privilege, and allyship; and race and racism in healthcare. As the curriculum continues, additional topics and chal lenges will be addressed including: social and personal identity and inter sectionality; implicit bias and microaggressions; structural and social determinants of health and health disparities; stereotype threat, and communication across differences. The te aching methods were selected to 1) be interactive and inclusive; 2) ensure that residents interact with the content and with each other to enhance learning, and 3) encourage the learners to reflect and commit to incorporating the skills gained into their practice. Methods include use of stories, video clips, brief didactic prese ntations, resident- led small and large group discussions, and reflective writing. Skill -building sessions will use role -play and standardized patients. Reflective writings exercise w ill be used to assess learner \"knowledge\" and commit to act with follow -up will be used to assess behaviors. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: We will track attendance, level of participation in each activity, and completion of reflective writings so that we can modify the plan for next year as needed. Reaction: All sessions wil l be assessed via session evaluation forms completed by learners and presenters. The goal of these evaluations will be to assess the quality, organization, and usefulness of the content. Learning: A written reflection about ones' own personal identities an d pre- and post -surveys of residents' implicit bias using a validated scale will be assessed. Behavior: Residents'' patients will also be surveyed to assess their providers' cultural sensitivity and ability to provide cross -cultural care. Potential Impact : Programs in all specialties are developing social justice -related curricula; if our DEI curriculum is successful, we plan to share it with other programs so they can adapt it to the ir needs. 201References: 1) The Psychiatry Milestones.

Need /Rationale: The importance of resident and fellow physicians to effectively evaluate and manage substance use disorders (SUDs) has become increasingly recognized. Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs need to enhance curricula which incorporates interactive teaching along with didactic components. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires each program to provide instruction and experience in pain management including recognition of the signs of addiction. The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) School of Medicine (SOM) GME Office created a Grand Rounds series to provide equal access to all of the resources and training residents need to effectively treat Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). By collaborating with the Opioid Response Network (ORN) and the Providers Clinical Support System (PCSS), the GME office addressed the need to educate residents on the treatment of addiction by providing instruction through monthly virtual Grand Rounds. This collaboration is one way in which the GME office is able to provide resources t o all its programs to enable meeting this and other common program requirements, allowing each program to focus on other requirements specific to their specialties. Methods: Our mission is to increase resident knowledge and skills in the prevention, ident ification, and treatment of substance use disorders with a focus on OUDs. A workgroup was created including the UTRGV GME office, UTRGV SOM faculty, ORN, and PCSS who met over 2 months to put together a 3 - year curriculum from August 2020 to June 2023 named \"GME Opioid Grand Rounds\". Topics were adopted from the PCSS online modules available to the public created in response to the opioid overdose epidemic to train primary care providers in the evidence -based prevention and treatment of OUD and treatment of chronic pain. Attendees are encouraged to complete PCSS online modules in preparation for the conference in a \"flipped classroom\" format. The monthly grand round series is a two - part event consisting of an expert \"presenter\" from ORN who summarizes the web module in a 30- minute educational session followed by a UTRGV faculty member who acts as a \"facilitator,\" creating a conversation for the remainder of the hour with the speaker and attendees based on primary care perspectives and our patient population in t he South Texas Rio Grande Valley, an area which is predominantly Hispanic and medically underserved. Attendance is taken at each event, and technical support is available for both presenter and facilitator. Flyers are created one month prior to each sess ion and distributed throughout the medical school to students, residents, and faculty. Evaluation Plan: Outcomes data include: Number of GME programs with previous opioid prescribing/pain management curriculum last academic year Content and nature of previously existing curricula Number of participants in new GME Opioid Grand Rounds sessions Number of GME programs participating in this series With our initial 2 sessions (August & September 2020), we have engaged more than 100 participants per conference, including learners from 13 of our 16 GME programs. A survey will be distributed to all program directors in which we will assess their pre- existing curriculum (if any) and how it is implemented in their program including frequency and deli very. A p re and post -survey to attendees evaluating the knowledge, attitudes, and skills they possess before and after participating in the grand rounds series will also be implemented. Questions will include data on physician comfort and knowledge in addressing, identifying, and discussing SUD diagnosis and treatment. 203Potential Impact : Implementation of a SUD curriculum will improve resident knowledge and attitudes as well as their approach to managing addiction. We will enable our learners to battle the opioid epidemic, which is a problem of staggering magnitude in our nation, and improve the quality of the resources we provide through the continuum of medical education.

Need /Rationale: 32% of dentistry's 470 specialty training programs are sponsored by non -dental school institutions such as hospitals and medical schools, military medical centers, and stand -alone programs. Mayo Clinic's Dental Sp ecialties sponsors one fellowship and three residencies who have been created, maintained, and have educated their trainees independent of each other. Interprofessi onal education (IPE) programs have been shown to improve culture, collaborative behavior, an d mental health in trainees of graduate medical education programs,[1] however Wilder at al. (2008) raised a concern that IPE in dentistry is lagging behind their p eers in medicine. A common collaborative curriculum [2] used by all of Mayo Clinic's dental education programs is proposed to facilitate collaborative clinical care amongst residents and fellows during their time as trainees and into their future careers. Learner coaching [3] will engage students through interactive social relationship building between dental and medical colleagues to build a sense of camaraderie, accountability to each other, and commitment to a positive learning environment. Methods: The proposed collaborative curriculum aims to replace a portion of trainee's individual learning by creating larger groups of peer learners, thereby enhancing interprofessional working relationships and increasing resident satisfaction. Participants include t wo fellows in Maxillofacial Prosthetics and Dental Oncology, three residents in Orthodontics , two residents in Periodontics, and two residents in Prosthodontics. The fellowship is a 12 -month program, while each residency is 36 -months in length and each resident is the sole learner in their specialty's post -graduate year. Evaluation of CODA requirements identified 20 topics in Basic Sciences, Dental Knowledge, Medical Knowledge, Social Sciences, and Surgical Knowledge common to each program. The curriculum w ill be presented over a 36-month rotation using a variety of educational interventions inclu ding online modules, classroom and case- based presentations led by experts, grand rounds presentations with audience response systems, peer-guided sessions, team -based competitions, and simulations. To foster faculty -learner relationship building and provide career goal and objective coaching, learners will participate in group and individual lunches with the Vice -Chair of Education. During these sessions, learners w ill have the opportunity to discuss what aspects of their education are important to them and receive guidance on steps to succeed in their goals. Evaluation Plan: Monitoring of the curriculum will be conducted to ensure all components are delivered to the learners with any deviations noted. Resident and fellow reactions will be collected by the completion of a standardized evaluation form at the end of each didactic component. A retrospective pre - and post -assessment will be used to examine changes in learner behavior with respect to well -being, social interactions, knowledge of other dental and medical specialties, referral patterns and habits, and career plans. Comparison of learning between topics that are specific to each specialty against those include d in the common collaborative curriculum will be made by evaluation of specialty-specific versus interdisciplinary questions on yearly in -training examinations and written portions of specialty board examinations. Potential Impact : Investigation into comm on collaborative curriculum implementation in a small academic medical center dental department will provide proof of concept to similar training programs in nursing and pharmacy, as well as to large medical departments who provide multiple small fellowships such as pediatrics or internal medicine. 205References: 1) Al Achkar M, Hanauer M, Colavecchi a C, Seehausen DA.

Need /Rationale: The Accreditation Council for Gra duate Medical Education (ACGME) requires that emergency medicine (EM) residency programs provide 5 hours of weekly didac tic content. Prior to COVID- 19, didactics for EM residencies included a combination of traditional lectures, small group discussions, in -person simulations, hands- on ultrasound education, as well as procedural learning sessions. Significant work has been d evoted to increasing the educational impact of these in -person endeavors [1]. However, to meet recommendations for social distancing dur ing a pandemic, didactic conferences have shifted to virtual platforms. For many programs, the transition to online lear ning has presented significant obstacles, as large portions of curricular content are not directly suitable for digital dissemination. Here we describe the creation and dissemination of didactic content utilizing online live-streaming techniques to maintai n resident engagement, foster a sense of community, and promote hands- on learning opportunities [2,3]. Methods: A total of 14 virtual c onferences over 3 months were live streamed via the Zoom platform within a single emergency medicine residency program. We created a small broadcasting studio, complete with professional cameras, lighting, and microphones, to live -stream each conference. T o control and improve broadcast quality, lecturers were invited to present in -studio. Additionally, multi - camera and point -of-view techniques were employed to improve the quality of traditionally in -person didactics such as ultrasound lectures, procedural demonstrations, and simulation sessions. We also reduced the number of traditional lectures and most presentati ons were limited to 30 minutes or less. We included alternative lecture formats such as game shows and faculty interviews. Attendees were encouraged to ask questions and engage with speakers using the real- time Zoom chat function. A chief resident moderate d this chat function and supplemented the discussion with relevant articles and multimedia. Polls, quizzes, and hyperlinks to Google Forms were a lso distributed in real- time to provide interactive elements for these educational sessions. Lastly, we frequen tly utilized the \"Break Out Room\" feature of Zoom. Residents and attendings were divided into smaller groups where they discussed medical cases, ethical dilemmas, or interpret diagnostic studies such as EKGs or plain films. The smaller groups would return as a larger audience to share their findings. Evaluation Plan: We plan on analyzing attendance as one marker for resident engagement. Attendance will be tracked via a report generated by Zoom and compared to pre -virtual conference attendance. Additionally , resident surveys will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of our interventions and to seek opportunities for improvement within the virtua l didactic curriculum. Each intervention (small broadcasting studio, the Zoom \"Break Out Room\" feature, alterna tive lecture formats, chief resident moderated chat function etc.) will be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Survey questions will include Likert -scales, multiple -choice questions, and free responses. Residents will be asked to evaluate their level of engagement, sense of community, and learning during virtual conference. Potential Impact : Residency programs must be prepared to provi de high quality virtual educational content when in -person conference is not available. Learning to properly manage a virtual conference and creating innovative lecture content that engages participants is a novel but vital skill set for conference curricu lum curators. 207References: 1) Gottlieb, Michael, et al. \"Alternatives to the Conference Status Quo: Addressing the Learning Needs of Emergency Medicine Residents.\" Annals of Emergency Medicine, vol. 68, no. 4, 2016, pp. 423 - 430., doi:10.1016/j.annemergmed.2016.04.003. 2) Rotoli, Jason, et al. \"Emergency Medicine Residency Curricular Innovations: Creating a Virtual Emergency Medicine Didactic Conference.\" AEM Education and Training, vol. 4, no. 3, 2020, pp. 270- 274., doi:10.1002/aet2.10477. 3) Rovai, Alfred P. \"Se nse of Community, Perceived Cognitive Learning, and Persistence in Asynchronous Learning Networks.\" The Internet and Higher Education, vol. 5, no. 4, 2002, pp. 319 - 332., doi:10.1016/s1096- 7516(02)00130- 6. 208Thursday, 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 7: Teaching Methods Poster #079 Using TeleHealth to Foster Medical Education and Enhance Medical School Idea: Residents and faculty will incorporate the use of telehealth into the care of COVID- 19 patients to improve academic exposure to patients on precautions. Need /Rationale: The AMA (American Medical Association) has encouraged medical sc hools and residency programs to integrate telehealth in order to prepare for future demands. During the COVID19 pandemic, medical students around the country were removed from clinical experience due to safety and risk of infection. 3rd and 4th -year medica l students as well as PAs will i nevitably be required to care for these types of patients in their later years of training and in practice. By limiting exposure to these high - risk infectious etiologies, there is both a loss of potential educational exposur e as well as a loss to patient care. Medical students have limited access to infectious patients due to unnecessary risk and exposure. Patients placed on contact or enhanced precautions often have limited contact with providers and are at higher risk of poorer outcomes due to lapses in h istory taking or frequent follow -up. By including telehealth in the care of patients on precautions, medical students can develop relevant history taking, understand socioeconomic limitations of this patient cohort and medical management of these patients, meanwhile also improving quality of care for the patients and increasing proficiency in using telehealth. Methods: The intervention will focus on 3rd and 4th -year medical students, MD and DO, as well as PA students and will take place over 12 months. The intervention will include 1) A census survey to evaluate for use of telehealth in medical education currently and a questionnaire designed to gauge interest in incorporating a patient -centred tele -curriculum. 2) Introductio n to telehealth seminar; Zoom, tele- intensivist platform, and video translation services. 3) Learners will participate in video encounters in a telehealth capacity for in -patient care. This process will be supervised by residents and/or faculty. 3a) Review of proper consent and limitations 3b) History taking via telehealth 3c) Incorporate physical exam skills through coaching of patient -directed actions in order to obtain physical exam findings. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We will track proficiency and performance on telehealth encounters using weekly standardized evaluations. 2) Reaction: Weekly evaluations and feedback sessions from resident and faculty supervisors. 3) Learning: Medical students will complete biweekly questionnaires and assessment s on comfort level and proficiency in telehealth communication. This will be based on relevant ACGME milestones adjusted for each level of training in anticipation of continuing to have to meet similar milestones in residency. 4) Behavior: Interviews will be conducted by faculty with learners monthly in order to individualize action plans. At least 33% of these interviews will be with a behaviorist or psychologist on staff in order to improve patient care and communication. Potential Impact : In order for medical students to be adequately trained to be physicians of the future, we must prepare them to integrate and use the advances in technology to improve patient care and develop communication skills specific to this new medium. If able, they enhance patient care in all settings and incre ase access to medical care for more people. 209References: 1) Jedrek Wosik, Marat Fudim, Blake Cameron, Ziad F Gellad, Alex Cho, Donna Phinney, Simon Curtis, Matthew Roman, Eric G Poon, Jeffrey Ferranti, Jason N Katz, James Tcheng, Telehealth transformation: COVID -19 and the rise of virtual care, Journal of the Amer ican Medical Informatics Association, Volume 27, Issue 6, June 2020, Pages 957 -962, https://doi- org.proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu/10.1093/jamia/ocaa067 2) J.C.

AMA encourages telemedicine training for medical students, residents pm Poster Session 7: Teaching Methods Poster #080 The Case Cover Sheet - A Tool Used for Integration During PBL Tutorial at UNLVSOM. Kalili, Rosalie University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Medicine Problem Statement : Using a tool (case cover sheet) can help PBL Facilitato rs guide their students in deliberate discussion of weekly course topics during a tutorial. Rationale: Problem based learning (PBL)cases utilize several features of adult learning theory; and thus, are best suited for residency training when a learner is developing from pedagogy to andragogy. It helps to retain information and provides an opportunity to apply system -based practice, teamwork and critical thinking (3). In our experience, it also allowed for interaction with other disciplines of medicine. PBL has been extensively used in medical schools and l iterature shows that it is an effective method of learning; it has been used for family medicine clerkship. However, I didn't find much literature on its use for Family Medicine residents. We believe that it is an engaging and versatile tool best used in c ombination with other learning methods (2). Thus, based on evidence in literature and prior faculty experience with PBL, we built a didactic curriculum for Family medicine residents which involves immersio n in family medicine topics using various learning methods including PBL and case -based learning (CBL) along with other methods discussed below. Methods: The preclinical curriculum at University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Medicine (UNLVSOM) includes va rious disciplines of medicine - Emergency response, Population health, Organ system -based basic- science, PBL, Doctoring skills, Integrated medicine, Community outreach, Bioethics, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research. PBL comprises ~20% of the curricu lum, and it's cases are written to reference materi al presented in all courses - thus, the tutorial session serves as an ideal forum for interweaving. PBL Facilitators, who are clinicians in practice, need notification of the students' curricular activities in order to prompt and emphasize discussion that would allow for synthesis and application of concepts learned from the various courses. Thus, a concise graphic case cover sheet was created to summarize the students' weekly course topics. The PBL Facilit ators are encouraged to review the case cover sheet with the students at the start of the tutorial. A 9 -item questionnaire using a 5 -point Likert scale was devised to evaluate the case cover sheet utility. Results: Most PBL Facilitators look at every week ly case cover sheet (4.5), agree that presenting students with opportunities to discuss concepts from various courses allows for application of knowledge that is relevant and meaningful to clinical practice (4.4), agree that being able to prompt discussion that incorporates various course concepts makes th em better at their role as Facilitators (4.0), and agree that having a case cover sheet is valuable (3.9). Potential Impact : The case cover sheet is easy to produce and the template could be used in other disciplines where integration is desired. There are inconsistencies in the faculty Facilitators' use of the content provided, so faculty development on why and how to emphasize certain discussion would be beneficial.

Need /Rationale: In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, most medical schools abruptly suspended students from in -person clinical interactions to protect students from possible e xposure. Simultaneously, clinicians were forced to create and implement new systems for remote patient care to protect both patients and providers from possible exposure. Interestingly, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) found that 42% of U.S. medical schools did not cover telemedicine in their curricula in 2017- 2018. 1 Thus, it is crucial that graduating medical students attain competency and adequate training in this new arena of healthcare. At the same time, the nation is facing a shorta ge of primary care physicians. 2 Many medical schools, including UT -Southwestern, have a capstone course focused on competencies related to the transition to residency, which is a prime opportunity to introduce primary care attitudes and behaviors as well as telemedicine skills. Also, many pediatricians report they lack the confidence to treat adolescent psychosocial and reproductive -related problems 3 , so incorporating material covering the primary care approach to adolescent care would also be beneficial . Methods: This year's transition to residency course, Residency Essentials, is expected to be delivered in a virtual format, which is optimal for learning and practicing telemedicine clinical skills. For asynchronous learning, students will have access t o an online forum where resources related to primary care visits, interviewing adolescents, and telemedicine can be shared by both facilitators and students. Content will include how to set up a telemedicine encounter, virtual communication tips, virtual p hysical exam skills, tips for primary care visits by age. Synchronous learning will include a simulated adolescent sick visit. Students will complete the simulated visit as a team by dividing up tasks such as setting up a telemedicine encounter, create an appropriate virtual visit setting, collect information including history of present illness, review of systems, conduct a pertinent virtual physical exam, and provide counseling. In addition to a simulated patient, a resident or faculty facilitator will also be present for a start/stop -style real-time feedback approach to the simulated visit. Evaluation Plan: We plan to create checklists for the tele -OSCE encounters that include objectives for both the primary care aspect and telemedicine aspect of the encounter. We also plan to validate the checklist through a modified Delphi approach using local experts in primary care and telemedicine best practices. During the tele- OSCE described above, the facilitator will grade the encounter using these checklists. Students will be awarded a pass/fail based on a minimum passing number of checklist requirements for each category (primary care and telemedicine skills). This checklist will then be used as a framework for immediate feedback from both the standardized patient and facilitator. We will gather student perceptions of their abilities to perform primary care visits - specifically sensitive adolescent sick visits - in a virtual setting through pre- and post - course surveys. Additional questions will allow for futur e program improvements. Potential Impact : The current percentage of students selecting careers in primary care will not fulfill the projected demand. This innovative curriculum will allow students interested in pediatrics to begin to build skills needed for both primary care and telemedicine, building the foundation for competency prior to starting their residency in pediatrics. Providing opportunities for students to participate in primary care and increasing telemedicine options are potential solutions to increase access to care. 212References: 1) Association of American Medical Colleges.

Need /Rationale: The move to online learning made necessary by COVID- 19 comes with the loss of collaborative learning that face -to-face offers. There is a need to deliver engaging tutorials that encourage discussion and are efficient in meeting learning outcomes. The flipped classroom allows facilitation of discussion amongst students who, having viewed the pre -tutorial videos and case problems, understand the fundamentals of the topic. There is e vidence that this model results in greater student engagement and significantly improved learning1 but online tutorials are a difficult environment in which to foster discussion. An online learning environment has the potential to be isolating but is enhanced when there are opportunities to collaborate with fellow students [2]. Tutorials can be held on many platforms but we have found Blackboard Collaborate, and particularly the Breakout Room feature, valuable in promoting discussion and improving students understanding of the topic. In our institution, 90% of online tutorials involve a PowerPoint presentation and attempts at questioning the group are largely met with silence. This didactic model fails to compensate for the loss of clinical time faced by ma ny institutions or encourage collaborative learning. Methods: We will focus on 4th -year medical students who will compl ete a 6 -week rotation in Surgery and Critical Care. During this time, they will have 31 tutorials covering topics in Anaesthesia and dif ferent surgical specialities. Of these, only the four Anaesthetic tutorials follow the flipped classroom format. The students are provided with the pre -tutorial materials. These take the form of 10 -20 minute YouTube videos covering the fundamentals of each topic and case problems to work through in advance. The tutorials are held online on the Blackboard Collaborate platform. We expect between 20 -25 students to attend and, using the Breakout Room feature, they are randomly assigned to groups of approximate ly 5 students. They are allocated time to discuss each case problem in small groups before returning to the 'main room' to partake in a larger group discussion that is facilitated by the tutor. We have observed greater participation from the students when they are in the Breakout Rooms with more microphones and cameras being turned on. We promote flexible learning by record ing the tutorials to allow students who are unable to attend or those who wish to reinforce their knowledge to view it in their own time . Evaluation Plan: Accountability: Four tutorials have been delivered using the online platform to the first group of s tudents rotating through Surgery and Critical Care. The tutorials for the second group are underway. Reaction: Our Anaesthetic Department has an established flipped classroom method of teaching and we are the only speciality in this rotation to use this mo del. By means of a questionnaire, we will examine student satisfaction and aim to use the results to encourage surgical specialities to make use of the flipped classroom model. Learning: The questionnaire will examine student satisfaction with the Anaesthetic tutorials and their impression as to their overall improvement in knowledge after a flipped classroom tutorial compared with a tutor ial of a didactic nature. Behaviour: By encouraging learning prior to a tutorial, the students can reinforce their knowl edge during the tutorial and this will ultimately improve the efficiency of their revision prior to an exam. Potential Impact : In the new normal of online learning we must deliver effective and efficient tutorials to our students. Collaboration enhances learning and platforms with features that encourage this, such as Blackboard Collaborate, are tools that are valuable to promoting effect ive online learning. 214References: 1) Brame, C., (2013).

Small Group Research. 2017 Session 7: Teaching Methods Poster #083 Learning to Partner: Medical Facilitation as an Educational Tool Qureshi, Hira; Schirokauer, Oliver Case Western Reserve School of Medicine Idea: Accompanying and supporting patients as they seek care will help early clinical trainees develop relational skills and an affinity for partnership. Need /Rationale: A major aim of healthcare education is the development of compassionate providers who are adept at communicating, responsive to the personal and societal contexts of illness, and reflective about their professional role. The ongoing challenge of fostering empathy in stud ents [1] and the difficulty of engaging students in curricula addressing the impact of systems on health [2] are two indicators that this goal remains unfulfilled. Providing students with clinical exposure early in their training can help by bolstering com munication s kills, sensitivity to patients' circumstances, and the impetus to learn [3]. Such early clinical experience (ECE) typically familiarizes the trainee with the work of the healthcare team. We propose to amplify the benefits of ECE by offering a new type of program that pairs students with seriously ill patients alongside whom they can experience healthcare over an extended period of time. These students will concurrently attend class sessions designed to help them process and participate effectively in this clinical opportunity. We expect that they will leave with a deepened desire and improved capacity to understand what it means to be on the other side of the medical encounter. Methods: Patients who are adjusting to a serious medical condition c an become overwhelmed by the new expectations, unfamiliar routines, vast amounts of information, and unanticipated decisions that they face. Medical facilitation is a service that provides such patients with support related to communication, information pr ocessing, and decision making in order to help them make sense of their circumstances and engage confidently and effectively in their care. The medical facilitation elective is an 8- week course designed for a cohort of students from medicine, nursing, and the physicia n assistant program. Students in the elective will provide medical facilitation services to patients, under faculty supervision. The cornerstone of the work will be to accompany the patients to their medical appointments. Doing so will give students the chance to talk with patients and their loved ones about what it is like to be ill or to care for someone who is ill, to observe the medical encounter from the patient's point of view, and to explore how to provide meaningful support. Additionally , students w ill attend a two- hour class session each week. The first half of each meeting will be devoted to activities related to one or more of the following themes: effective communication, contexts of illness, self -awareness and self -care, compassion a nd partnering, and professional identity. The second half of each session will be dedicated to discussion of the patient cases that the students are involved in. Evaluation Plan: Our evaluation will have two components, a research study looking at the imp act of the course on how students approach patient care and an analysis for program improvement. Students will submit weekly writing assignments in which they reflect on their time with their patients and on the classroom activities. At the end of the course, they will also write about the elective as a whole. These writings will serve as data for an IRB -approved, qualitative investigation designed to identify and describe the ways in which the course has affected how participants think about the dynamics a nd goals of provider -patient interactions and about their own professional role. Program review will focus on eight domains: organization, logistics, clinical experiences, class sessions, assignments, workload, coordination with affiliated programs, and missed opportu nities. Information about these areas will come from the students' writings, a post -course student survey, feedback that will be provided by students at two group meetings, and written comments supplied by course instructors. A team consisting of faculty, a student collaborator, and a consulting clinician, will examine these materials and determine what modifications should be adopted. 216Potential Impact : We expect our elective to show that medical facilitation can be used to foster personal, interpersonal , and professional growth in students. Trainees who take the course will have a deeper understanding of their patients' experiences and be better positioned to care for their patients, and themselves, with compassion and clarity of purpose.

Rationale: As a pediatrician in training, I saw a disparity between the difficult social situations I was prepared for in medical school and those I faced in residency. There was a focus on delivering bad news, an integral skill for all doctors, but not one frequently applicable to a pediatric intern. Instead, as an intern, I was tasked with calming frustrated parents, building trust with families against vaccination, balancing teenage pri vacy against parental conviction, and a h ost of other difficult conversations that come with the unique interplay between doctor, patient, and parent. I believe many pediatric residents share my experience. On review of curricula on Mededportal, with searc h terms \"communication\" and \"medical stud ent\", of the 300 most relevant results only 6.3% involved doctor -patient communication and none had a pediatric focus. The goal of this project is to give students experience with difficult conversations that are di rectly applicable to the intern year of p ediatric residency. Methods: This is a cohort study of fourth -year medical students at the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) who participated in simulation -based communication training. The training used the group objective structured clinical encounter (GOSCE) model. In this model, a group of medical students, together in the same room, take turns interacting with a standardized actor under the supervision of a facilitator. In this case, the actor played the role of a patient's parent in four scenar ios: vaccine hesitancy, lumbar puncture refusal, bronchiolitis worsening overnight, and functional abdominal pain in a teenager. The sessions culminated in dedicated time for peer -to-peer observation, discussion, and feedback. The effectiveness of the inte rvention was assessed via an anonymous five -point Likert scale questionnaire administered immediately before and after the training session. The questionnaire asked students to rate their confidence in the use of non- verbal cues, identifying areas of confl ict, defusing conflict, communicating with a distressed parent, communicating with an angry parent, managing expectations, identifying emotions, articulating empathy, and tailoring communication to the emotional state of the caregiver. Results: Fifteen pe diatric- focused fourth -year medical students have been included in the study thus far, representing the 2020 UTSW graduating class. After the intervention, there was a statistically significant improvement in self -reported confidence across all areas of th e five- point Likert scale questionnaire. Statistical significance was assessed via two -tailed, paired sample t -tests, and the degree of improvement was demonstrated via 95% confidence intervals. The results by s ection include: use of non- verbal cues (95% C I [0.23, 0.97], p = 0.007), identifying areas conflict [0.91, p < with a distressed parent (95% CI [0.75, 1.51], p < 0.0001), communicating with an angry parent (95% CI [0.76, 1.63], p < 0.0001), managing expectations (95% CI [0.67, p = 0.0002), emotions = [0.32, 1.14], p = 0.003), and tailor ing communication to the emotional state of the caregiver (95% CI [0.41, 1.19], p = 0.001). Additionally included on the post - intervention questionnaire was a comments section and the true/false statement: I have gained novel strategies for difficult conve rsations. All participants answered \"True\". C omments were overwhelmingly positive with one student writing: \"This was the first standardized patient exercise in all of medical school that genuinely made an impact on the way I'll practice medicine\". Potential Impact : This study centers on the idea th at communication needs vary across specialty and level of training. It demonstrates the effectiveness of a curriculum specific to the pediatric intern year. We hope this curriculum will prepare students for difficult conversations and model the value of ap plicability in the design of future communication training. 218 References: 1) Wolfe, A., et al.

Need /Rationale: Online learning students face many difficulties during Covid -19, including uncertainty, environmental distractions, and anxiety (Irawan et al., 2020). Teachers must try to decrease students' anxiety levels while still keeping them engaged. Simply removing scheduled assignments may temporarily reduce students' anxiety; however, it ma y also jeopardize students' learning opportunities. In the online asynchronous learning environment, teachers' feedback when grading is the best opp ortunity for students to learn (Luo & Kalman, 2018). The most common method for grading students' work is identifying their mistakes and how they affect their grades. Without the teacher's tone and body language in a text- based setting, the message behind the feedback may sound more like a punishment than a reward; criticism may put students into a defensive mod e and hurt their feelings and self- esteem. Teacher's written comments in isolation are neither effective nor motivational. Methods: Carnegie's fundamental principles include avoiding criticizing, condemning, or complaining about others \u2014and never saying to a student, \"you are wrong.\" He suggests not treating people as creatures of logic, but as creatures of emotion and pride. Teachers s hould treat students the same way \u2014 showing them respect no matter the quality of their submitted assignments. Teachers need to focus on encouraging students and praising even small improvements. Showing respect does not mean the teacher will ignore or misju dge students' problems. For students to happily make changes based on the teacher's suggestions, teacher feedback needs to make students' faults seem easy to correct. Teachers also need to help students save face while pointing out their mistakes; for example, teachers could talk about their challenges with the subject before criticizing students' mistakes. Instead of directly telling students what is wrong, teachers should indirectly call attention to students' mistakes, such as by asking questions to help them reach the answers themselves. Following Carnegie's principles, teachers' comments should always begin positively with praise and honest appreciation. Carnegie suggests people use smiles. In the feedback for text -based online asynchronous courses, teachers could use a smiley emoji. Evaluation Plan: Students taking a text -based online asynchronous course will be randomly divided into two groups taught by two different teachers. The experimental group implements Carnegie's principles, while the control group receives more blunt and direct feedback from the teacher. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. Quantitative data includes students' final grades as retrieved from the students' learning platform and end -of-course evaluation scores collected from a standard survey (with a 5-point Likert scale). The mean scores from the two groups will be compared. Qua litative data include students' evaluation narratives. The central themes of students' experiences from their narrated feedba ck will be generated and compared between the two groups. Potential Impact : When teachers implement Carnegie's principles into tex t-based online asynchronous courses, students may have better learning outcomes, become more engaged, improve relationships with their teachers, have higher motivation toward learning, and develop a more positive emotional outlook overall. 220Reference s: 1) Carnegie, D.

Rationale: Problem based learning (PBL)cases utilize several features of adult learning theory (1). and thus, are best suited for residency training when a learner is developing from pedagogy to andragogy. It helps to retain information and provides opportunity to apply system -based practice, teamwork and critical thinking (3). PBL has been extensively used in medical schools and literature shows that it is an effective method of learning, but it has not been used much in Family Medicine residency program. We believe that it is best used in combination with other learning methods (2). Methods: Ou r didactic curriculum aims at high board exam scores and covering low yi eld topics not covered enough during clinical work, thus preparing our residents to be well rounded family physicians. For academic sessions, we decided to focus on one Family Medicine subject at a time (like community medicine, cardiovascular diseases etc .), during a 4 -week period called a 'section'. The sub -topics are covered using different learning methods to encourage engagement and effective learning with reinforcement of concepts among our residents. We use didactics, PBL, CBL, workshops, games, flip class and jigsaw discussions. PBL, CBL and didactics are more commonly used than other methods. We have 17 PBL cases designed by our faculty covering these different subjects. The PBL case is done over 3 one- hour sessions separated by 1 -2 days gap which provides opportunity for learners to work on some sub-topics on their own and teach their peers when they return. We have nursing and pharmacy colleagues who help with some of the pieces of the case. We add nuances of patient care like psychosocial barriers in these cases as well, which replicates real life patient care experience. Various methods allow for immersion in the topic, engagement and reinforcements of concepts and covering patient care aspects in addition to medical knowledge. Since we modified P BL structure and created cases for our purpose and we use it extensively, we wanted to study its effectiveness. Evaluation Plan: For the initial evaluation of the curriculum, an 8 -item survey comparing PBL, CBL and traditional didactics was sent to faculty (n=11) and residents (n=18). The survey was anonymous, but participants identified themselves as faculty, PGY1, PGY2 or PGY3. Five teaching faculty (45%) and 17 residents (94%) respo nded to the survey. CBL was preferred over PBL for how resident learn best and it being good use of their time (14 versus 6). PBL scored highest for exploration of case related other topics, promoting self -learning and encouraging strong skills in finding and using resources for patient care. Both CBL and PBL scored equa l on active participation. CBL was preferred for applying learning to different cases in practice. Traditional didactic didn't score high on any. Comments section mentioned advantages of PBL as ability to learn how others think of same case, learning broader differential diagnosis, encouraging critical thinking, understanding guidelines and workflows about cases better, and interaction with team. Disadvantages were that it can be slow and it requires self -motivation from participants. We will continue to do timely surveys and monitor attendance and board scores to further evaluate the curriculum. Potential Impact : PBL is best used in conjunction with other methods to cover the vast set of top ics in Family medicine. It is an active, effective method which pr omotes self -learning and improving skills on using resources and guidelines. However, CBL is good alternative method that is fast paced and has better application of learning in different ca ses. 222References: 1) Donner RS, Bickley H.

Adventist Hospitals - White Memorial Family Medicine Residency Program Idea: Empowering the learning and refle ctive process in clinical supervision of family medicine residents who are of multicultural backgrounds. Need /Rationale: According to Cooper, et. al. (2017), reflective practice in supervision is instrumental in assisting the process of those who are prov iding health care to others to practice self -awareness, critical thinking, a greater understanding of how to bring theory and practice to greater conceptualization to enhance patient care and recognize their limitations. Literature on diversity identifies that as the United States continues to have greater representation of cultural backgrounds, that sociocultural factors will have a great impact in the delivery of health care (Weissman, et. al., 2005). In an effort to assist physicians to provide humanisti c care which focuses on exercising respect, awareness, sensitivity, and humility it will be important that the appropriate care, time, and focus be dedicated to seeking to understand the experience of diverse others. Understanding that healthcare environments have continual moving pieces with many responsibilities involved within systems, such as medical residency programs, it is critical that medical environments pause to think about how to more effectively engage learners in important conversations relate d to the experiences of others and themselves. Methods: Reflective practice in clinical supervision of multicultural medical residents is an experience that occurs longitudinally throughout the three -year experience of the family medicine residents academ ic jou rney. Qualitative measures are utilized to obtain live and written feedback of the medical residents' experiences. The Behavioral Science Community Medicine Rotation is composed of six full training days in which they meet with Behavioral Health facu lty an d includes opportunities to engage learnings in exploring their approach to patient care, health care systems, learning/discussing/addressing health disparities, learn about and discuss issues of diversity, implicit/explicit bias, transference and countertransference, and how to manage crisis in primary care. The Behavioral Science Intensive is a comprehensive review of their residency experience to assist in the transition process from residency to graduating for formal academia and into their practi ce in primary care. This rotation is scheduled for three full days during their third and final year in residency. Academic Support is present to provide support for residents in all three cohorts. Reflective practice in academic support also has been pres ented with many experiences related to patient care, teamwork, group dynamics, managing conflict, exploration of professional and cultural identity in a work environment. Evaluation Plan: The evaluation process includes a process of scheduled feedback meetings during the Behavioral Science Community Medicine Rotation, the Behavioral Science Intensive Rotation, and ongoing Academic Support meetings provided by Behavioral Medicine Faculty. Additional methods of evaluation include reflection papers which have briefings and debriefings on their thought process, approach, exercise of critical thinking skills and insight. Other activities of learning include videos, journal article readings, training modules, role play, and co -consultation experience with a pa tient. The Behavioral Science Community Medicine and Behavior Science Intensive Rotations are composed of assigned days of training in which they meet with Behavioral Health faculty and includes opportunities to engage learners in exploring their approach to patient care, health care systems, learning/discussing/addressing health disparities, communication, self -awareness, learn about and discuss issues of diversity, implicit/explicit bias, transference and countertransference, and how to manage crisis in p rimary care. Academic Support experiences are continual and can include any of the above- mentioned rotation topics/experiences. 224Potential Impact : The development of a collaborative working relationship with an approach that seeks to explore the learner s own understanding of their learning process can serve to motivate the learners to actively participate in their training, promote awareness of self and others, develop a positive attitude towards learning, and improve communication skills.

Need /Rationale: In an age of increasing emphasis on operational metrics and efficiency, medical trainees are faced with service demands that encroach upon their opp ortunities for on -shift learning (1). In the emergency department, in particular, documentation and administrative burden has negatively impacted the quality and quantity of education in the clinical environment. Despite the AC GME requirement that residenc y programs prioritize education over service, existing studies suggest that protected opportunities for on -shift learning have declined in frequency (2). On a local level, EM resident responses to multiple annual program evaluations corroborate this widespread belief that service obligations compromise education and reflect a desire for more dedicated teaching in the clinical environment. In an effort to incorporate protected time for formal on -shift learning in our training environment, we plan to implemen t small group, case -based, and interactive teaching sessions led by senior EM residents during shift change. We hope that regular integration of these sessions will not only promote a culture that prioritizes education over ser vice, but will enhance camara derie and a sense of community between senior and junior residents. Methods: All 76 PGY1- PGY4 emergency medicine residents will participate in this year -long educational intervention. The intervention will include the following: 1. Twice -weekly small grou p learning sessions: These ten- minute sessions will be led by an EM senior resident and will be held in the emergency department on Tuesday and Friday mornings at 6:50 AM (just prior to patient sign -out at 7:00 AM). All EM residents working in the five sep arate emergency department pods will be invited to attend the sessions. During this ten- minute period, the clinical areas will be staffed by attendings only to allow for fully protected educational time. Sessions will consist of a five- minute presentation on an interesting case, ECG, image or relevant clinical pearl from the overnight shift. This will be followed by a five -minute period reserved for questions and discussion. We have chosen the format of short, case -based teaching sessions to maximize learner attention and improve retention of the material. Additionally, we will utilize the teaching techniques of small group discussion and progressive disclosure cases to increase learner engagement and interaction. 2. Faculty facilitation and feedback: One as signed faculty member will attend the session to facilitate and enhance the case discussion and provide feedback to the resident \"teacher\" after direct observation. Faculty members will also ensure accountability in ses sion timing and content. Evaluation Plan: 1. Accountability: We will track attendance and participation in these teaching sessions through the use of online surveys via a QR code. QR codes will also be used to keep a log of educational topics that have been previously discussed. Faculty members in attendance will ensure that sessions adhere to the proposed time frame and that educational content is evidence -based. 2. Reaction: Resident and faculty surveys will be performed one month and three months post-implementation of the intervention, an d will assess perceptions about, and feedback on, the utility, format, and structure of the teaching sessions The content of these surveys will be used to guide future iterations or expansion of Code Learn. 3. Le arning: Faculty will provide verbal, real -time feedback to resident presenters on the structure and content of their presentations. Perceived changes in resident learning as a result of this intervention will be gauged through the surveys referenced above. 4. Behavior: A focus group composed of mixed PGY levels will be held 6 months post -intervention to gauge perceived changes in learner behavior and attitudes as a result of the initiative. Potential Impact : In the face of increasing operational demands, C ode Learn offers a simple strategy to allocate protected time for on -shift resident education. If this intervention is effective, it could serve as a model for future interdepartmental or multidisciplinary shift change -based educational innovations. 226 References: 1) Shelley L.

There is little structured time for formal education for residents or faculty. Rationale: Outpatient teaching clinics provide a unique environment for learning about chronic disease management. Despite these opportunities, the clinician -educator fa ces significant challenges in creating meaningful educational experiences. One such barrier for us was the lack of structured time for our residents and preceptors to have interactive discussions and review core ambulatory topics. Most clinic educational moments occur with the case presentation. However, so much depends upon the case -mix of the clinic and resident proficiency in the presentation. There is no structured time fo r peer -to-peer or group formal education. In 2017, I developed the \"clinical huddle\" - a 10 minute resident- led educational medical discussion. One resident from the scheduled clinic session was assigned a focused core ambulatory topic or physical exam ski ll to discuss or demonstrate with the clinical group. Methods: Our internal medic ine primary care clinics are located in three affiliated Federally Qualified Health Care facilities. The nature of these clinic sessions become very hectic given the complexity of our patient panel. Our residency program uses a 6+2 rotation schedule with residents rotating through their ambulatory clinic every 4 blocks. As the site director for the largest of these clinics, I developed a structured didactic session tha t could be done at the start of each clinic day. At the start of each ambulatory block, re sidents were sent clinic updates with assignments for the clinical huddle topics. These ambulatory topics included review of guidelines, medication management, demons trations of key physical exam components, physician communication skills, clinical pearls, and practice changing trials. When possible the topics were chosen to reflect and compliment the topics presented in the formal ambulatory didactic lectures in each respective block. This project was successfully implemented with great acceptance by the residents and subsequently incorporated into the second clinic site in 2019. After three years at the first site and one complete year at the second site, we surveyed the current residents for their perceptions of this didactic innovation. Results: Of 65 r esidents between the two participating clinic sites, 23 completed the survey. Residents were asked to specify their primary clinic site, their post -graduate year leve l this past year, and their general impressions of the project. Of the 23 respondents, 21 (91.3%) learned something new at the clinical huddle, 19 (82.6%) felt this was an important part of their clinic day, 20 (86.9%) felt the activity generated discussion, and 18 (78.2%) felt the activity was high yield. Eight out of 23 residents presented on guidelines and 6 out of 23 demonstrated physical exam skills with the rest divided between the other categories. Eleven (47.8%) of 23 spend less than 20 minutes prep aring for the activity and 11 reported spending more than 20 minutes for the activity but less than 30 minutes, and one skipped this question. Twenty (86.9%) out of 23 reported learning from the preparation for the clinical huddle. Residents were also given an opportunity to free text comments and overwhelmingly looked forward to clinical huddle. Potential Impact : The \"clinical huddle,\" a structured peer -to-peer teaching moment, is a successful didactic method added to a busy academic clinic day. This informal activity is high yield, generates meaningful dialogue and is easily translatable to a ny academic clinic setting. References: 1) Regan -Smith M, Young WW, Keller AM.

Poster Session 7: Teaching Methods Poster #090 A Day in the Life: Simulated Patient Experience to Enhance Provider Knowledge and Empathy Cohen -Cutler, Sally; Sheth -Bhutada, Jessica; Stokke, Jamie Children's Hospital Los Angeles Idea: Develop a simulated experience from the perspective of a patient's family with a new cancer diagnosis for pediatric hematology- oncology fellows. Need /Rationale: Research supports the idea that increased Clinical Empathy - the ability of physicians to understand and relate to the experience of their patients - is a critical cornerstone of effective patient care [1]. How ever, many physicians lack specific exposure to the experiences of their patients, even within the walls of the hospital, damaging the patient -doctor relationship [2]. Further threatening the therapeutic relationship, healthcare providers may be unaware of the education patients have received, and directly contradict it [3]. At Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), families of children with new diagnoses of cancer undergo a life -altering experience, defined by standardized processes and education provided by ancillary team members. However, the CHLA Hematology -Oncology Fellows have poor awareness of this process and its components. Fellows have noted that their lack of direct experience in these logistical elements of patient care (including nuances of medication administration, insurance application, and even admission process) impedes their ability to consistently deliver the best possible care. This research study will aim to 1) increase this knowledge in Fellows and 2) improve augment Fellows' self -report of Clinical Empathy. Methods: The intervention will comprise of a full day of programming and experiential education for Hematology -Oncology F ellows. Each participant will have a description of a patient (considered \"their child\") which will lead them to a telehealth visit with a local pediatrician, who will direct the participant to the Emergency Department (ED) for lab testing. The participant will go through patient intake in the CHLA ED, where the resident on duty will deliver the news that lab s are concerning for leukemia. The participant will be taken to the Oncology inpatient floor, where nursing will orient them to the unit. A pediatric resident will take an abbreviated history and offer counseling regarding reasons for admission. A senior H ematology- Oncology Fellow will obtain consent for necessary procedures, after which the participant will be taken to the different waiting areas, procedure rooms, and recovery areas for such procedures. This will be followed by a conference with an attending and fellow discussing a new diagnosis of leukemia. Several services will then visit the patient room: venous access team to discuss central lines, n ursing to give standard new diagnosis teaching, pharmacy to show commonly prescribed medications, care ma nagers to explain the process of obtaining specialized insurance coverage. Participants will go through the process of hospital discharge and have a si milar standardized experience in the outpatient care centers. Evaluation Plan: Participants will receive a pre- test evaluating their knowledge of what processes are involved with a patient admission, the content of new patient teaching, the process for diagnosis from the patient perspective, and basics of patient care as administered by the parent, including line care and strategies for medication administration in a young child. This will be followed by a self -assessment on measures of empathy using the J efferson Scale of Empathy. Following intervention, the pretest and self- assessment will be repeated immediately, and then at 6 months. Additionally, this intervention will be done during the following year's orientation for new Hematology- Oncology Fellows. These trainees will receive a pre -and post -test, which will be repeated 6 months into the year. This wil l allow for a more balanced comparison of measures of empathy, which may be impacted by factors related to the duration of the training program. Feedba ck will also be solicited, and the intervention may be adjusted based on participant reviews. Potential Impact: This intervention offers physicians a novel perspective on routine care that represents a monumental day for patients and their families. Similar programs could easily be implemented in other training programs and institutions. This has the potenti al to improve patient care, enhance the patient - reported experience, and increase physician empathy. 229 References: 1) Neumann, M., Bensing, J., Mercer, S., Ernstmann, N., Ommen, O., & Pfaff, H.

Rationale: Standardized academic metrics for US medical students begins one year prior to medical school with the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) to test problem solving, critical thinking, written analysis and knowledge of scientific concepts and principles,\u00b9 and concludes one year after graduation with the United States Medical Licensure Examination (USMLE) Step 3 exam which assesses clinical skills, diagnostic acuity, decision -making, guidelines for treatment and follo w-up care.\u00b2 Significant relational measures anchored across the timeline of medical school will provide the internal structure of the MCAT/Step 3 analytical model.\u00b3 The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationships of the MCAT and USMLE Step examin ations across a six- year period for ten graduating classes. Methods: 1,978 medical school graduates completed the MCAT and USMLE Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and Step 3 examinations over ten graduating classes (2010 -2019). Univariate analysis of variance and Cohen's d effe mean scores. Pearson correlations and stepwise multivariate linear regressions were used to predict Step 3 scores from the MCAT, Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores. IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae 24.0 was used for statistical analysis. The study is IRB approved. Results: All normality tests were statistically significant (p<0.001). Skewness/Kurtosis measures are as follows: MCAT (- (- 7.7/4.1); Step 3 ( -0.4/-0.3). There were statistically significant (all p<0.001) increases in mean scores across the ten -year period for each exam: MCAT (d=0.45), Step 1 (d=0.44), Step 2 CK (d=0.75), and Step 3 (d=0.58). Across all ten years, statistically significant (p<0.001) correlations were reported between the MCAT score with: Step 1 (r=0.4), Step 2 CK (r=0.3), and Step 3 (r=0.2). Step 1 was significantly correlated to Step 2 CK (r=0.5), and Step 3 (r=0.3). Step 2 CK and Step 3 were significantly correlated (r=0.4). Linear regression of Step 3 scores (outcome) on Step 1 (beta=0.2), Step 2 CK (beta=0.4), MCAT (beta=0.0) scores was statistically significant (R\u00b2=0.3, p<.001). Removing Step 1 from the model, the MCAT (beta=0.1) became a significant predictor of Step 3 with Step 2K (beta=0.4) present (R\u00b2=0.2, p<.001) or not present (R\u00b2=0.1, p<.001). Potential Impact : The MCAT exam is a singular predictor of the Step 3 exam until replacement three years later by the Step 1 exam. One year later, Step 2 CK serves as the primary predictor of Step 3, but the analytical model i mproves with the addition of the MCAT or Step 1 exam. The MCAT, Step 1, and Step 2 CK cannot all simultaneously act as predictors of Step 3. References: 1) Association of American Medical Colleges. Using MCAT Data in 2019 Medical Student Selection.

No prior study has investigated spaced repetition's utility for teaching anatomy. Rationale: Medical students have previously established study habits that may need to be enhanced to meet the demands of medical education. Medical knowledge learned by preclinical students is often quickly forgotten, and spaced education has been shown to improve retention (Kerfoot et al , 2007). Spaced repetition flashcards are an increasingly popular study method. A limited amount of evidence suggesting that spaced repetition studying is associated with superior medical licensing exam performance suggests it warrants further exploration by educators (Deng, 2015). We created a natural experiment by providing a spaced repetition resource alongside the equivalent schematic material for students learning regional gross anatomy. Self -reported study habits triangulated with performance on unit assessments and longer -term retention of information will shed insight into potential differences in study materials influence on learning outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis was undertaken to examine differences in study methods and learning outc omes for a first -year medic al school cohort. 207 students were provided with opportunities to access different study aids during a six -week head and neck anatomy curriculum: flashcards and schematic material. A set of flashcards were available for download from a school resource lin k alongside \"Mastering Cranial Nerve Anatomy: A Schematic Approach,\" the MedEdPortal on which they are based (Paskin -Flerlage and Eisner, 2015). These flashcards were made with the Image Occlusion Enh anced Anki program addon, then organized by each cranial nerve and pathway components including detailed somatic and autonomic functions, nerve communications, and skull context with foramina. No specific recommendation for either resource was made to the students. Assessments inclu ded a content knowledge pre- test one week prior to the Head Eyes Ear Nose and Throat (HEENT) physical exam lab, a post -test following the lab, a survey on preference for study method, and summative examination performance using q uestions related cranial nerve clinical skills and gross anatomy questions that were abstracted from two exams. The independent variables of study aid (flashcards, schematic), self -reported study habits (frequency of use of either or both resources) will be analyzed in relation to dependent variables (performance on physical exam lab assessment, relevant exam questions). Results: This study is currently in progress. Data were collected from 207 first -year medical students. Preliminary information is provided. Preliminary results of available data found that both study aids were widely used by most of the students. Overall, 81.8% of students utilized the schematic and 64.8% utilized the flashcards prior to exams. 56.6% utilized both reso urces while studying. A relatively small percentage of students indicated a preference for a single study aid: 25.0% used only the schematic, 8.2% used only the flashcards, and 10.2% did not use either resource. 9.7% of students utilized the flashcards dai ly, 15.8% every other day, and 39.3% once per week. Students that utilized flashcards studied on varying platforms; 75.7% on a computer application, 19% on a tablet, 18.4% on a mobile device, 8.1% on a web version, and 17.6% on multiple platforms. Initial analysis did not indicate significant difference s in scores on assessments were associated with the use of either or both resources. More exploration of the data will be undertaken. Further analysis is planned to examine the potential impact of the frequen cy of study to reveal possible patterns. Long -term data will be available from an assessment given 9 months after the initial start of the gross anatomy unit, as the students begin neuroanatomy. Those data will be used to examine potential relationships between study habits and knowledge retention. 232 Potential Impact : Conference attendees will learn how to adapt teaching material into a spaced repetition program. Medical students seek interactive learning resources, widely utilizing this spaced repetition anatomy material for self- directed study. Diffe rent study aid formats may be associated with patterns of study habits and influence student learning outcomes. References: 1) Paskin -Flerlage S, BA, Church PA, Federman DD.

Rationale: Use of a ga me format for teaching is supported by self -determination theory. For example, games can support the learner's sense of competence as they accomplish goals that are accessible to their level of knowledge. Games also foster learner -learner and learner -teacher interactions. This interaction improves motivation to learn and facilitates teaching and near -peer teaching. Tabletop games are likely superior to digital games in promoting interactions between learners. Guidelines are available for many infectious con ditions in pediatrics however adherence to guidelines in practice is variable. A card game, Empiric Pediatric, was developed and used to teach guideline based antibi otic use to medical students and pediatric residents. After successful use locally the goal was to distribute the game widely. Some important information taught in these sessions was not included on the physical cards but was from the facilitators experien ce. To overcome this limitation QR codes were added to the cards with links to teaching poi nts and references online. This abstract describes the real- world use of the QR codes on the copies of the game that have been distributed thus far and plans for further evaluation. Methods: In the game learners manage a hand of antibiotic cards and compete to treat infections that score variable points based on difficulty. The rules of the game reward the use of observation for infections for which antibiotics can b e avoided and reward the use of more narrow antibiotic choices. The content of the game was developed using IDSA, CDC and AAP guidelines with a focus on bacterial infections for which observation without antibiotics is an option. The game is paired with a pre-game podcast episode for medical students and the game is used alone for pediatric residents. Each infection card has a case on the front. The correct treatment is listed on the back along with a brief learning point (15-25 words) and a QR code that links to references, further teaching points and the option to give feedback on the case. QR codes are present on 40 of the cards and use of these codes is tracked with Bitly (New York, USA). The expected frequency of use of QR codes was unknown but intent w as to look both at the overall frequency of use and patterns (e.g. more difficult cases wou ld get more use). The game was made available online for purchase through a print on demand company DriveThru Cards (USA) and also made available to print for free o nline. The game was promoted as an educational tool on Twitter (@EmpiricGame). This study was submitted to the IRB (CHLA -20-00049) and did not meet criteria for human subject's research requiring approval. Evaluation Plan: The game was made available for purchase January 7th of 2020. 155 copies have been purchased as of November 15, 2020 and another 10 copies have been distributed to physicians that assisted in the development of the game. The number of downloaded and printed copies from the webpage is not tracked. From January 2020 through November15th, 2020 QR code use has been limited. QR cod es have been used 67 times (0.4 times per copy of the game). Many (12/40) QR codes were not used at all. The most frequently accessed codes were Neisseria meningitid is post -exposure prophylaxis (7), Lyme disease (7), pelvic inflammatory disease (5), and dog bite (5). Further evaluation of this feature will be done with a survey of users of the initial release of the game. Possible reasons for limited utilization that will be explored include: Games are being purchased but not played. Lack of awareness of the role of the QR codes in this game. Technical challenges or knowledge of how to use QR codes. Integration of smartphone use with a tabletop game is not desired. Fur ther learning points and references not desired. Potential Impact : QR codes may not be a g ood tool to integrate in an educational game. Generally digital integration into tabletop games is rare and it may not be natural for players to use without significant prompting. I hope to explore in more detail if the low utilization is specific to this implementation or if this is generally a method to be avoided. 234References: 1) Rutledge C, Walsh CM, Swinger N, et al.

Need /Rationale: Resident satisfaction with the curriculum is an effective surrogate fo r quality of education. Structured didactics in the form of formal lectures remains the most common teaching st yle in most residency programs. However, the impact of time -based curriculum delivery is questionable, given unpredictable schedules and a decline in resident participation due to interruption of live lectures because of COVID- 19 pandemic [1]. In addition, a steady decline in the ITE performance is observed across different training levels nationally with statistics showing a decline in residency p rograms achieving an 80% 3- year ABIM program pass rate from 96% in 2008 to 75% in 2013 [2]. According to program directors' survey regarding factors affecting the decline, 72.5% and 68.7% cited low ITE scores as a PGY3 and PGY2 respectively as important contributors [3]. In addition, 21% cited low attendance of residents at teaching conferences [3]. ITE is an annua l assessment by the American Board of Internal Medicine that serves as a measure to assess residents' academic progress during the three -year internal medicine residency training. With these statistics, our goal is to improve the ITE performance by startin g an online, asynchronous, targeted curriculum. Methods: Our intervention focuses on all 86 categorical internal medicine residents currently en rolled at our institution. The intervention consists of the following: 1) An initial pre- intervention anonymous survey was conducted to identify residents' scores on the last ITE and their personal formal mode of learning. 2) After noticing that the majori ty of our residents preferred a structured, self -paced mode of training, we have designed and created our own website at www.med- mentor.com as a platform to provide our educational intervention. 3) Firstly, we identified the high- yield topics tested on 201 9-2020 ITE that our residents have performed poorly defined as less than 10 percent correct answer in respectiv e sub- topics of medicine; i.e scored below 40% of the national percentile. 4) Next, we created an 8 -week online curriculum focusing on each subsp ecialty topic every week. 5) We designed brief, 30 -minutes lectures every week, presenting them in various formats identified through resident preferences on the pre - intervention survey such as video lecture, audio podcast, PowerPoint presentation, image c hallenges, etc. The curriculum was faculty- supervised and taught by educators on the clinical educator track 6) At the end of each week, we released a set of questions to test the residents' knowledge and to further consolidate their memory. 7) Lastly, onc e ITE scores of 2020- 2021 will be released, we will be able to compare and contrast the effectiveness of our in tervention. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: We have online plug -ins integrated on the website designed to show us the number of visitors utiliz ing our website and resources. The website thus -far has been shared with only internal medicine residents at our institution. Reaction: A post -intervention anonymous resident survey will be sent out to our residents to assess reflection of their medical kn owledge and confidence and their feedback regarding this mode of an online learning platform will be conducted. Learning: Every week, after our weekly curriculum is launched, we released a set of questions towards the end of that week to test the residents ' knowledge and to further consolidate their memory. Overall improvement in medical knowledge and confidence wi ll be assessed by a post -interventional survey. Lastly, ITE scores of 2020- 2021 will be compared with the ITE scores of 2019- 2020 to assess improvement. Behavior: Residents methodology of learning and ITE performance will be tracked by program leadership i n 6- month evaluations. 236Potential Impact : In the era of COVID -19 pandemic and promotion of e -learning, we aim to create an accessible platform of learning using innovative modes of teaching to help residents master their clinical skills and board prep. T hough it is not entirely possible to replicate traditional classroom teaching, we hope to facilitate off- site learning with reliability. Referen ces: 1) McDonald FS, Zeger SL, Kolars JC.

Factors Associa ted with Declining Residency Program Pass Rates on the ABIM Certification Examination. Am J Med. 2016 Jul;129(7):759- 65. doi:10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.03.020. Epub 2016 Apr 15. PMID: 27086497. 237Thursday, 2/18/2021, 6:30 - 7:30 pm Poster Session 8: Promoting Me dical Knowledge / Potpourri Poster #095 Art in Anatomy: Templates to Facilitate Interactive and Visual Learning With New Technologies Mahata, Sumana; Kingston, Paul; Whitehead, Mark; Brandl, Katharina; Lander, Lina UC San Diego School of Medicine Idea: Students wish to study anatomy in a visual manner, but it is challengi ng to illustrate parts of the body accurately to study. Need /Rationale: Art and medicine have been intertwined with anatomy for the majority of its history. Inherently, learning anatomy is a visual task \u2014understanding the relationship between structures gives insight into their function and facilitates mastery of the subject. Although students may wish to study anatomy visually, it is difficult to illustrate the entire body accurately. Thus, anatomy templates were created using the illustrations in current UC San Diego School of Medicine anatomy lab manuals such that students can draw structures on top of them, annotate, and share with peers. These templates bridge the gap between passive study of anatomy and creation of study aids from scratch, ultimately fostering accessibility, sharing, and communication during the learning process and beyond. In the future, students may incorporate visual materials into their practice, which has been sh own to help patients understand their doctors. Methods: Using the current anatomy lab manuals as a guide, images were generated in the Procreate app. Images are unlabeled and often omit key structures that are investigated in each lab. These images were then exported as .png files and imported into separate Notability notes for each lab manual. Next, the missing structures were drawn and labeled as an example for students. Lastly, a duplicate of the Notability note was created, and the annotations were rem oved. This blank version represented the templates for st udents. iPads and the Notability application were provided to each first -year medical student, all of whom took the Anatomy course. These templates were distributed to students through the Anatomy co urse webpages for download and use. The data obtained for this study will combine objective and subjective measures of value of the proposed template tool. Students will be surveyed after each of the five anatomy exams to ask about their use of the tool on a scale from 1(never) to 5 (frequently). The students will also be asked about how useful the tool was, how it prepared students for anatomy, and whether the tool was used in other classes and applications. Data will be stratified based on the frequency of use of the tool and exam scores will be compared. To me asure the implementation of the tool, the percent of students in each category will be compared longitudinally over five -time points. Evaluation Plan: To evaluate the benefits of the anatomy templat es, students will be surveyed after the five anatomy exam s. By stratifying based on the frequency of use of the tool, we will assess whether using the anatomy templates is associated with higher test scores, greater satisfaction with the course, or less stress with regards to studying. In addition to evaluating test scores, the surveys will include free - response sections for students to discuss whether they used the tool in other classes or applications. The templates have been designed to be versatile; alt hough they are being designed specifically for the anatom y course, it is anticipated that the templates will be repurposed for learning in other classes and small group sessions. All surveys will be administered using Qualtrics software and analyzed in the ir platform. We will include open -ended questions to allow students to elaborate on their experiences with the tool, which will be informative not only for anatomy education, but also for potential developers of electronics- based learning tools. Potential Impact: Incorporating an artistic learning tool into the anatomy curriculum will introduce a novel learning modality It introduces visual learning in a digital, accessible format for all incoming students. Feedback and student evaluation will inform futur e innovative learning tools that take advantage of iPad technology. 238References: 1) Bell, L. T., & Evans, D. J. (2014).

Rationale: The rigor of intern year is designed with the goal that new doctors are exposed to a breadth of conditions before beginning to lead a team of their own. However, internal medicine is by its nature a broad field wherein the ideal depth of knowledge that may be expected of an intern is hard to define and harder still to evaluate. The intern educational experience is largely derived from clinical exposure, which can vary significantly. The purpose of this curriculum was to design an intern -directed curriculum with core learning objectives defined for educators to help delineate expectations for intern le arning. Furthermore, these objectives were used to develop delayed -learning activities to help assess knowledge retention. The structure, location, and procedural execution of these lectures were standardized to further allow for a sustainable and reliable forum for learning which interns would expect as part of their educational experience to supplement their clinical work. Methods: A dedicated intern curriculum was developed by creating a series of lectures determined by core internal medicine faculty. T opics were designed to represent essential inpatient internal medicine concepts as well as frequently encountered interdisciplinary and team -based issues. Topics were then sorted into four \"seasons\" to allow content to be cumulative, progressive, and relev ant to an intern's level of experience throughout the year. The structure, location, and procedural execution were standardized across clinical sites to create a reliable forum for learning. To be of high value, each topic included instructor and learner o bjectives, \"threads\" for longitudinal concepts, and additional material for presenters. To improve accessibility and facilitate learning retention, intern pagers were covered during didactics and weekly \"learning pearls\" were provided in the form of short weekly asse ssments with answer explanations and links to key articles and evidence. To be sustainable, the curriculum included instructions to allow for straightforward reproduction of the curriculum each week and in subsequent years. Furthermore, a leadership team w as identified consisting of two senior residents, a chief resident, and a faculty member. To maintain flexibility and independence, lectures were designed and delivered at the discretion of senior resident presenters. The curriculum was assessed in the form of weekly participation, resident competency surveys, and weekly assessments. Results: The 50 -week curriculum consisted of 46 core topics that were vetted by faculty and 4 topics selected by residents. The curriculum was assessed over a 36 -week span whi ch consisted of 66 separate conferences covering a total of 41 core topics. The average percent of interns who attended a conference and had their pagers covered was 60%. The majority of interns described the curriculum as \"excellent\" or \"outsta nding\" (78.6%). Similarly, the majority indicated the curriculum was \"helpful\" or \"very helpful\" in preparing them for intern year (85.7%) and second -year (64.3%). There were weekly assessments for 15 of the 36 weeks, covering 15 core topics, which were sent to learners 2 to 4 days after each conference. The average number of weekly assessments completed was 16.2 (4.5 who attended, 11.7 who did not attend a conference that week). The overall average weekly assessment performance of questions answered correc tly was 49%. Comparison of those who attended a conference to those who did not revealed average weekly assessment performances of 61% vs. 45%, respectively. Interns who attended conference scored on average 16% higher each week (95% CI 0.06 to 0.28, p=0.006). The odds ratio for answering a question correctly for those who attended conference compared to those who did not was 2.20 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.23, p<0.001). 240Potential Impact : A dedicated intern didactic curriculum can ensure all interns are exposed t o and learn the basic skills required in their training. This paper describes a method to design, implement, and sustain a standardized curriculum of resident -led didactics targeting core topics in inpatient internal medicine for intern -level learners.

Rationale: The Pediatric Overflow Planning Contingency Response Network (POPCoRN) was founded to address concerns as pediatric institutions prepared for assuming adult patient care in the COVID -19 pandemic. One primary focus was to develop and disseminate free open access medical educational materials on the care of adults for pediatricians and other non -adult trained providers; content was generated by healthcare professionals at various levels of training, including medical students. In line with the goals of POPCoRN to distribute educational materials equitably to a large audience, we leveraged three social media (SoMe) platforms -- Facebook, Instagram and Twitter -- to transl ate these materials into digestible content giv en the increasing use of SoMe in education. A team of medical students worked in collaboration with a diverse physician team to distill clinically relevant content both for their own continued education and for the benefit of pediatricians caring for adult s. Methods: The SoMe team identified high -yield topics based on peer -reviewed \"one -pagers\" published on POPCoRNetwork.org. Using this content, the students developed educational tutorials for each topic, tailored to each SoMe platform. On Twitter, \"tweeto rials\" contained a linked series of 280 -character tweets. Facebook posts highlighted clinical pearls through text and summative graphics. Instagram \"Insta- torials\" featured a series of infographics compiled into \"stories\". The tutorials drafted by students were reviewed by physicians, and they were released according to a predetermined schedule. On a specific date, we collected metrics for nine tutorials that had been released for at least five days: admission, discharge, chest pain, syncope, deep vein thro mbosis/pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation, gastrointestinal bleed, stroke, and delirium. Selected metrics demonstrated the number of followers that viewed the content: number of impressions (Twitter) and reac h (Facebook Results: Impressio ns on Twitter described the number of times the first tweet of each \"tweetorial\" appeared on follower timelines, gaining an average of 3215 impressions per tweet. Facebook reach described the number of individuals who viewed the given post, averaging 392 reaches per post. On Instagram, reach was defined as the number of individuals who viewed the first story of each \"Insta - torial\" with an average of 60 reaches per \"Insta -torial\". Potential Impact : These tutorials serve as a valuable means by which learners can ascend to teacher as they approach the highest tier of the Modified Bloom's Taxonomy for SoMe. Through these efforts, medical students will continue to serve as the instructor for not just pediatric ians, but hundreds of non - adult trained clinicians across the country.

Need /Rationale: UNC School of Medicine students have excellent academic records, integrity, and potential to be successful clinicians. Unfortunately, these qualifications do not preclude students from experiencing academic and personal stressors during medical school. We work with students to improve their chances of success, but the ability to track and communicate acro ss support units is difficult. Data scattered among multiple systems along with inconsistent communication and workflows represented a barrier to student support. As the student body and advising and support services have grown at UNC SOM across multiple c ampuses throughout the state of North Carolina, the need for coordinating support of students has intensified. We recognized a need to provide comprehensive support to students from matriculation to graduation, akin to an electronic medical record system. This meant we needed to improve data processes, integrate our student systems, and simplify communication between support units. Methods: At the outset, focus groups w ere conducted with key stakeholders and future users to gather business requirements and identify pain points that would ultimately be addressed by the implementation of the system. Peer institutions were approached as references to discuss their lessons learned from implementing similar systems. Once the implementation began, the initial foc us was on establishing access to the requisite data and applying standardization and validation standards as the ETLs were established. The data review and standardizat ion process was a collaborative effort with the vendor to meet their standards while tar geted improvements were made to the salient internal data flows and workflows. The implementation was phased according to the vendor's established approach and recommen dations, with frequent weekly meetings serving as the forum for collective collaboration and resolution of impediments. The project identified the need for future initiatives related to workflow augmentation and further data automation and centralization that were not considered in scope. There was consistent strong executive and leadership s takeholder support for the project, which helped maintain accountability and engagement from all project team members. Evaluation Plan: Evaluating our student success platform is multifaceted, therefore multiple KPIs were developed. We divided goals between data integrity and student success initiatives. Baseline surveys were conducted to capture user sentiment before implementing the new application. We will ut ilize various forms of tracking, including application analytics, scripted failure reports, and surveys. Data integrity is integral to acceptance and usage rates of staff, faculty, and advisors, who use the platform to follow student performance and commun icate between support offices. One aspect of ensuring data integrity is to evaluate the extent to which data is accurately entered into our student information systems. Inaccurate data entry decreases our performance. Therefore, data standardization measur es have been developed. Relevant student data is pulled daily, formatted for upload and tracked through failure reports. We are evaluating the extent to which we can improve communication of actionable items, regarding student performance, to support staff, including the extent that appointments, appointment summaries, and student cases are utilized, accessed and managed. We will track improvement measures in data integration, communication and reporting. Potential Impact : The student success platform will impact student support, by improving access by staff and faculty to more accurate data, coordin ating the support of students by different divisions, and allowing students to see the leadership's emphasis on care. Students will then take this experience, emulating it when they become clinicians. 243 References: 1) Hill, M. R., Goicochea, S., & Merlo, L. J. (2018).

Nyquist, PhD (1); Maureen Strohm, MD (1); Velyn Wu, MD, FAAFP, CAQSM (2) (1) Keck School of Medicine of USC; (2) University of Florida College of Medicine, Family Medicine Residency Program Workshop Description: The VIA (Values in Action) Character Strengths tool was developed in 2004 and has been taken by more than 8 million people. It is a scientifically validated instrument, that assesses 24 character -strengths aligned with six virtues (wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, jus tice, and transcendence). Extensive research has shown that intentional, appropriate usage of our strengths can promote wellbeing. During this workshop, participants will complete the tool to learn their own signature strengths. Appropriate usage and overuse of each strength with be discussed as each person completes three exercises to explore their own lead strengths. Participants, m eeting in small groups will also discuss potential usage of the tool with medical students, within transition courses/bootcamps, and with residents. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The VIA (Values in Action) Character Strengths tool has been taken by more than 8 million people. It is a scientifically validated instrument, that assesses 24 character -strengths aligned with six virtues (wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, and transcendence). Niemiec (2018) defined character strengths as positive pers onality qualities that reflect personal identity, produce positive outcomes, and contribute to the greater good. Research on the VIA character strengths has demonstrated that intentional and appropriate usage can: promote resilience, positive emotion, meaning and purpose, and positive social relationships. The tool and concepts are integrated into the psychology of wellbeing that has evolved out of Seligman's initial idea in 2000 of positive psychology. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : By the end of the worksh op participants will be better able to: - Utilize own character strengths - Analyze own use and overuse of top VIA character strengt hs - Guide learners in utilizing their own character strengths to enhance performance INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Health professions' faculty at all levels, as well as senior health professions' students. METHODS: This session will utilize a variety of tech niques: 1) completing a tool, VIA Character Strengths Survey; 2) presentation to provide background information and survey results; 3) small group work to complete an exercise to help build skills in examine own use of strengths; 4) storytelling and 5) large group discussion to consider how to use the tools with learners, particularly those in transition (into school, into clinical years, into advanced training or into the workplace. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: The session will be divided into three segments Learning about own strengths and exploring usage and underuse (40 minutes) participants with take the tool, learn about most common and least common strengths, share in small group a deepening exercise that can be used with learners to explore use and overuse of strengths Exploring usage with learners (30 minutes) - using Phil Collins from Groundhog day learners will explore how appropriate usage of strengths can help any learner grow to meet their learning and achievement goals. In small groups learners will discuss a struggling learner, and how he/she can use their own strengths to enhance success. 245Discuss use of the tool with learners in transition (15 minutes) as the group discusses how character strengths can be utilized by learners to help them thrive duri ng the particularly stressful times of transition.

New York, NY: Oxford University Pres s 246Friday, 2/19/2021, 7:30 - 8:45 am Conference Workshop Utilizing Online, Interactive, Adaptive Technology in Healthcare Education Zilola Khashimova, MD Dominican University of California Workshop Description: This workshop will show how interactive online resources can be used by healthcare educators to enhance a classroom course or for distance learning, including self- directed modules and learning activities that could be converted to virtual interactions. I t will showcase the technology that is available and how to incorporate it into existing courses to utilize what research has shown increases student acceptance and learning outcomes. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The COVID- 19 pandemic is affecting health care institutions and is disrupting the training of future healthcare practitioners. It is more impor tant than ever to ensure that the educators and students have access to high- quality educational materials and technologies to ensure trainee preparedness for clinical and global health challenges. To help meet this challenge, online tools have become a viable option with the recent development of information technology. E -learning can be used to enhance a classroom course, or as a stand -alone course. These online tools include online labs, videos, high resolution images (X -ray, CT -scan, histology), cadaver labs and adaptive, interactive technology such as practice exams, virtual patients, and learning games. The problem is that these technologies and tools are available from many different sources (textbook publishers, teachers' associations, non -profit organizations, government agencies, individual universities, etc.) and many different prices. Locating, identifying, determining which ones fit into the course , and budgeting for them and is an over -whelming, time consuming task for educators not familiar wit h the most current technologies. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: The participant in this workshop will learn the latest technologies available for online learning. Tools available, how to choose the most effective ones, how to use them, resources to find the m, and how to effectively incorporate them into a course. Intended participants: This workshop is aimed at healthcare educators, education progr am coordinators and managers who must develop, teach, or manage others who teach online courses for healthcare practitioners.

Facilitators will encourage participants to examine their internalized beliefs about learning, while providing opportunities to reframe failures and challenges as learning opportunities. The sessio n will conclude with the creation of individual action plans aimed at contributing to a 'culture of perseverance' in medical education. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: In medical culture there is low self -compassion rates, high imposter syndrome, difficulty with medical errors, and difficulty receiving feedback. There is a lack of awareness of mindset in medicine and medical leadership. Faculty report high level s of stress and burnout in early career, especially when discussing errors and receiving feedback. Few medical school curricula and faculty development initiatives include concepts of mindset. Fostering a growth mindset early in a medical career may help lessen the burden of stress and rates of burnout. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: By the end of this workshop, participants will be better able to: 1) Differentiate a fixed versus growth mindset in the professional and personal setting. 2) Evaluate challenges and/or triggers in situations in which they manifest a fixed mindset. 3) Develop a strategy in order to reframe situations of fixed mindset into growth mindset. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: All participants at the IME conference who are interested in developin g a growth mindset (faculty, staff or learners) . METHODS: Classroom based interactive workshop utilizing a variety of teaching techniques including a brief formal introduction of concepts, a self -assessment tool, reflection, brainstorming, small and large group discussions with the ultimate goal of reframing our fixed mindsets into growth mindsets. ACTIVITY TIMELINE: 0-5 minutes - Ice Breaker - VIDEO: Watch 5 minute clip from Carol Dweck's to introduce the concept of growth mindset and the power of \"not yet\" 6-10 minutes - Introduction - Introduce instructors and participants; Review objectives and outline for the session 11-19 minutes - Didactic - Introduce 21st century mindset concepts (build context); Expand on growth mindset 20-30 minutes - Quiz in c lass - Mindset quiz/inventory (20 questions; paper copy, self -graded) 31-44 minutes - Growth/Fixed Mindset continuum activity - Ask participants to gather along a \"continuum line\" in class (a line of tape stuck to floor along entire length of class) based on their answers to a series of questions on the malleability of learning; Can use quiz questions learners want to expand upon or learner suggestions or other from list); Explore and discuss individuals stances; give opportunity to change positions 45-65 minutes - Think -Pair-Share (Re- framing activity) - Participants will reflect on 1 personal and 1 professional scenario/situation in which they exhibited or witnessed a fixed mindset (5 minutes); Participants will share these scenarios with a partner (5 min utes); In small group, participants will compare scenarios and discuss possi ble reframing strategies (10 minutes) 249As an example: Fixed mindset case --- discuss how to approach in growth mindset manner (can't open pickle jar) \u2014more than one way to handle any situations 66-80 minutes - Debrief Large group - As large group, each grou p will present at least 1 strategy they discussed to reframe into a growth mindset; Review (and summarize from think -pair-share) reframing strategies for fixed growth mindset; Wr ite down on whiteboard 81-90 minutes - Wrapup/Conclusion, Session eval with commitment- to-Act - Learners will write one \"SMART\" commitment for how they will use one or more concepts from this session TOTAL: 90 minutes TAKE HOME TOOLS: Didactic presentation slides on paper - Handout with references Growth mindset quiz and answer key Commitment to Act (these will be collected and mailed to participants in an envelope at a later date as a reminder and \"check in\") 250Friday, 2/19/2021, 7:30 - 8:45 am Conference Workshop Guided Discovery Learning: Utilizing Large Group Case- Based Heal th Professions Education Virtually Kendra Nordgren, MD; Amy Greminger, MD University of Minnesota Medical School, Duluth Campus Workshop Description: We developed a Guided Discovery Learning (GDL) case format using the framework of Bruner's discovery learning theory to combine the value of Problem -Based Learning and Simulation -Based methods into a single format that is used in large group settings, thr ough a virtual format, with just a few facilitators. Participants will engage in a mock GDL case, utilizi ng small group work and large group simulation activities to explore and engage in discovery learning theory and the GDL process. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: We developed a Guided Discovery Learning (GDL) case format using the framework of Bruner's discovery learning theory in order to combine the value of Problem -Based Learning (PBL) and Simulation -Based (SIM) methods into a single format that can be used in large group settings, through an in- person or virtual format, and with just a few facilitators. PBL and SIM cases are valuable forms of active, experiential learning focused teaching, but are restrictive in their need for an immense amount of faculty time, disconnect between the students who are divided into small groups for these cases, and challenges for scaling to a virtual format. Through GDL, students collectively discover knowledge and create their own scaffolded understanding, with facilit ators serving as a secondary support for this scaffolding, all while working as a large group with students p eriodically distributed to smaller teams for taskwork. Cases are discussed collectively before progressing, students only receive information they request, modeling the mantra of not thought of, not looked for, not found, and information is provided in real time via a simulated patient and an electronic database. Participants in this workshop will engage in a mock GDL case, utilizing small group work and large group simulation activities, in order to explore and engage in discovery learning theory and the virtual GDL process. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: The ultimate goal of this workshop is to enable participants to determine if and where GDL would best compliment their curriculum. To prepare participants, the session will specifically focus on the followi ng objectives: Describe the GDL format, including the critical components for delivery. Explain the difference in GDL learner objectives as com pared to those of Problem -Based Learning; how are these scaffolded differently? Describe how an electronic database for case information can be used between the facilitator(s) and learner(s), and the basis for how to build one. What are some educational advantages to this method of data delivery? Explain how content expert facilitation can guide learners to d evelop mini -mechanisms for case objectives. Describe three benefits of this structure for facilitating case review. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: The target audience for this workshop is all health -professions educators interested in case -based learning for larg e groups, particularly those who seek a framework founded in discovery learning theory and desire a format that is interchangeable between in -person and virtual classrooms.

But how do you build, record, edit, and publish a great ten 10 minute presentation using only the tools you already own and know how to use - your laptop, your cellphone, and (maybe even) your Zoom and Google accounts? In this hands -on workshop, you'll walk you through a template you can use to organize your presentations, learn how to record presentations on both your laptop and cell phone, edit those videos (you'll even learn the magic of zoom cuts), and publish them online. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: TOOLS: REFERENCES: 253Friday, 2/19/2021, 9:00 - 10:15 am Conference Workshop Feedback in Clinical Practice as Part of Culturally Responsive Teaching Marianne Chen, MD; Pedro Tanaka, MD Stanford University Workshop Description: An important aspect of feedback is creating a positive learning environment where feedback can be communicated more effectively. Given the diversity of our trainees, culturally responsive teaching is integral in allowing educators to develop rapport and r espect with their trainees to give targeted feedback about a specified goal/milestone. This session will allow educators to openly discuss creating a positive learning environment and practice new skills in giving culturally responsive feedback. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Despite feedback being introduced into medical education more than 50 years ago, there are still many studies that suggest that trainees report feedback is inadequate. Creating a positive learning environment is essential for feedback to be given effectively. Understanding psychological safety will allow an educator -learner relationship to develop trust that is needed in a positive learning environment. With a diverse group of tra inees and educators, we need to incorporate cult urally responsive teaching into medical education and understand the role it plays for a learner to be fully engaged in feedback. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : 1. Discuss the definition and foundations of feedback in medical education. 2. Describe psychological safety as a construct needed to create a positive learning environment 3. Understand culturally responsive teaching and how our own implicit bias plays a part. 4. Demonstrate and discuss techniques on g iving culturally responsive feedback. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Faculty, Fellows, and Residents . METHODS : Learners will get a short introduction on the foundations of feedback and culturally responsive teaching and then engage in group discussions and role plays through breakout groups.

Gawande said \"coaching done well may be the most effective intervention designed for human performance\". Coaching is successfully used in medical education, faculty development and physician leadership. This interactive workshop will introduce participants to the concept of professional coaching, its relationship to mentoring in academic medicine and equip them with three core coaching skills to add to their mentoring, teaching and leadership toolboxes. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The medical education and leadership literature increasingly recognize coaching as a powerful modality (1,2,3). However despite extensive literature on the merits of coaching in academic medicine, little information exists on HOW to develop coaching skills other than to employ the services of a professional coach. This workshop aims to close that learning gap by teaching three coaching skills in an interactive way to academic physicians. GOAL: This workshop will introduce the concept of professional coac hing and its effectiveness in mentoring, teaching & leadership and provide academic physicians with new skills to use in their professional work. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES: By the end of this s ession participants will be able to: 1- Define coaching and how it relates to academic medicine. 2 -Describe how to set up a safe space for coaching and mentoring. 3 -Identify three core coaching skills relevant to mentoring, teaching & leadership in academic medicine. (a) Creating a level three conversation (b) Expl oring resistance to change (c) Designing next steps & creating accountability. 4-Perform the three core coaching skills. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: Academic faculty who serve as teachers, mentors an d in leadership roles in academic medicine. METHODS : In this 90- minute workshop two physicians who are certified coaches with experience in faculty development and executive leadership coaching will teach three core coaching skills. These skills will enhance participants' teaching, mentoring and leadership activities and their professional development. Coaching skills will be taught in an interactive manner and participants will work in pairs using struct ured worksheets to practice with one another. ACTIVITY TIMELINE (90 mins).

However, they also perceive these practices as somewhat stressful. This workshop aims to provide medical educators with tools to integrate poetry and comics creation into their teaching in ways that preserve ins ight while promoting relaxation and wellbeing. We will pay special attention to overcoming learner resistance, avoiding retraumatization, and generating appropriate feedback. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: The creation of original artistic and literary work is increasingly used in medical education as a way of promoting insight, enhancing empathy, and augmenting wellness. Yet we still do not have an adequate pedagogical framework for how to systematically introduce these activities to ensure the best possible learner outcomes. F urther, while students acknowledge the value of such activities, they sometimes find writing poetry or making comics to be stressful. The purpose of this workshop is to provide medical educators with a specific framework for integrating poetry and comics c reation into their teaching in ways that preserve insight while promoting relaxation and wellbeing. We will pay special attention to techniques that focus on overcoming learner resistance, avoiding retraumatization, and ge nerating appropriate feedback for original creative works. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : At the end of this workshop, participants will have acquired the following skills: 1) Be able to state the benefits to learners of engaging in original poetry writing and comics creation in terms of clarifying professional identity formation, developing professional and personal insight, and promoting wellness. 2) Know how to implement step -by-step progressive strategies for introducing poetry and comics creation activities into the learning environment. 3) Know how to address common barriers that may arise in introducing such activities to standard educational settings, including learner resistance and risk of retraumatization. 4) Be able to provide constructive feedback tailored to review of a creative art form. INTENDED PARTICIPANTS: This workshop is intended for medical educators interested in learning more about how to integrate poetry writing and comics making into their current teaching practices. While targeting primarily medical educators with little or moderate experience in this area, we hope the workshop will include pedagogical nuggets that can enhance the skills of experienced educators as well. METHODS : The workshop will use a combination of teaching methods to impart its content. Zoom sessions tend to be passive, so we intend to utilize short segments interspersed with participant opportunities for interaction and discussion. Our methods will include mini -powerpoints, demonstration roleplay, large group discussion, and actually writing and sharing a poem and create a cartoon.

Tyson School of Medicine Workshop Description : Research i ndicates that medical students endorse Narrative Medicine's core features \u2014attention, representation, and affiliation \u2014as valuable to professional identit y development (1, 2). Through participation in a narrative medicine workshop, medical educators will gain skills to coach learners in their professional development. Close reading/observation and writing activities will offer participants strategies to better support their learners as they integrate their personal and emerging professional identities. Detailed Plan: RATIONALE: Professional identity formation (PIF) is one of the four pillars/goals for educating future physicians outlined in the 2010 Carnegie Foundation's Educating Physicians: A Call for Reform of Medical School and Residency (3). It has been defined as \"the transformative journey through which one integrates the knowledge, skills, values, and behaviors of a competent, humanistic physician with one's own unique identity and core values\" (4). Faculty mentors can coach learners during this developmental process through engagement with the arts and humanities, including the use of narrative medicine's methods. As noted in the recently published Fundamental Role of the Arts and Humanities in Medical Education monograph, \"professional growth and tr ansformation occur when we adopt the perspective of others through acts of sustained attention so we can represent and reflect on what we see, hear, or read, as well as when we develop the ability to think critically and compassionately about human dilemma s\" (5). In this interactive workshop, participants will participate in and reflect on a narrative medicine workshop where the capacities of attenti on, representation, and affiliation are explored. Participants will then consider how narrative medicine meth ods can be leveraged in professional identity formation coaching programs at their home institutions. LEARNER OUTCOME OBJECTIVES : By the conclusi on of this presentation, participants will be able to: 6. Define professional identify formation and describe t he rationale for its incorporation into medical training. 7. Describe the core features of narrative medicine and their value to professional identity formation. 8. Experience close reading/observation and writing activities. 9. Discuss the application of narrativ e medicine methods in coaching learners as they integrate their personal and emerging professional identities. INTENDED PARTI CIPANTS: Medical school and residency program faculty, curriculum deans, program directors, medical students, and residents. METHODS: This workshop is designed to be interactive and engaging. The session will reflect a mix of group discussion, mini -didactic presentations and opportunities to learn and practice aspects of curriculum development.

University of California San Francisco Problem Statement : UME and GME programs must maintain teaching standards despite work hour restrictions, space limitations, and now COVID -19-related disruptions. Rationale: Pre- GME preparation programs may have a role in preparing 4th year students for residency. Immersion experiences, including virtual inter nship preparation programs, may enhance the 4th year curriculum and better prepare medical students for internships, but little is known about their acceptability to medical students. Methods: We developed a \" competency -based immersion experience\" (COBIE) for 4th year medical students entering pediatric fields. By design, the course reconciled gaps between the existing medical school pediatrics curriculum and ACGME expectations. Participating faculty were encou raged to present practical content using case- based, interactive, and/or simulation techniques. The curriculum was deployed in May 2020 by teleconference. Student comfort with session content was assessed pre - and post-training using a 4 -point Likert scale. Results: Of sixteen sessions, 15 (94%) inco rporated interactive teaching methods. Engagement strategies included case discussions (12 sessions), equipment/instrument demonstration (5), simulation (3), small groups/breakout rooms (3), polling software (2), and panel discussion with advice from curre nt interns (1). Significant changes in comfort were observed for resilience (mean Likert 2.6 pre- training v 3.7 post-training, p=0.0002), communication (2.6 v 3.4, p=0.0069), paging etiquette (2.7 v 3.4, 0.0167), first year of life (2.0 v 2.9, <0.0001), respiratory failure (1.7 v 2.8, 0.0001), mental health (2.1 v 2.7, 0.0355), neonatal emergencies (1.6 v 2.7, 0.0003), heart disease (1.4 v 2.7, <0.0001), infectious disease (2.1 v 2.6, 0.0467), pediatric shock (1 .5 v 2.6, 0.0024), abnormal growth (1.6 v 2.3, 0.0032), gastroenterology (1.4 v 2.1, 0.0003), and hematology/oncology (1.6 v 2.0, 0.0331). Narrative comments were favorable. Potential Impact : Our pre- GME preparation pilot improved comfort with common pedi atric skills among 4th year medical students. Additional research is needed to determine the impact of pre GME preparation programs on intern performance. References: 1) Haber RJ, Bardach NS, Vedanthan R, Gillum LA, Haber LA, Dhaliwal GS.

(1); rdano, Drexel University College of Medicine; (2) LeBow Business School Drexel University Problem Statement : What were successes and obstacles in the emergency conversion to on line clinical education and how can this data be used to improve future courses? Rationale: In March 2020, direct patient contact by students was replaced on an emergency basis by an online curriculum for the clinical education of rising third- and fourth -year medical students. This conversion was a strategically important experience for the future of clinical medical education While this was done i n reaction to the COVID pandemic, the insights gained are applicable to other modern situations such as natur al disasters and teaching over multiple sites. Many of the lessons learned during this conversion can enhance clinical medical education during the in-person clinical experience in the areas of pedagogy, learning technologies, and clinical consistency. Methods : Three separate retrospective surveys were sent to clinical faculty and rising third - and fourth - year medical students who experienced the CO VID lockdown during their clinical experience. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were provided. S tudents were surveyed on challenges which interfered with their learning and their perceived engagement with their courses compared to the in-person format. Differences between rising third - and fourth -year students were assessed using a Chi Square test of independence. Faculty were asked about the challenges they encountered in developing and delivering the online curriculum, the time required, and the benefits of clinical medical education. A thematic analysis was conducted on the open -ended items on each survey. Results: Response rates included 153/265 (57%) rising third year students, 122/265 (46%) fourth year students, and 9/9 clinical faculty. A majority of both student cohorts experienced challenges in the online format related to connectivity proble ms (66%) and loss of interaction with their peers and faculty. The majority (60%) of the students felt less engaged by the online curriculum, but i t was not clear how much of this was related to halo effects from the COVID lockdown. Students appreciated fa culty who used breakout rooms and small groups to enhance interactions. The majority of students felt that the on -line reading of lectures was not effective. Faculty indicated that twice as much time was needed to create the curriculum. The faculty also pe rceived that there was less student/faculty engagement. Twenty -two percent of the faculty experienced connectivity issues during the course of the curriculum. Sixty -six percent of faculty plan to incorporate an online component in future clinical education . There were benefits. Students appreciated the flexibility and additional time with online learning. Online learning can be effective clinical edu cation, but the results of this study suggest there are challenges with lack of student engagement, faculty overload, and connectivity problems with technology. Potential Impact : Online learning can be effective, but there are challenges when transferring in-person courses to a remote format quickly. Faculty should structure courses to enhance student engagement with small group discussion and avoiding pre -record lectures. Administrators should consider the faculty workload and enhanced technology support to help students. References: 1) Seymour- Walsh, A. Bell, A., Smith, T. (2020) Rural and Remote Health RRH.org,a u.

Rationale: Scientific conferences are an integral part of academic discourse and knowledge dissemination where the latest medical research and innovation are often presented (1). It provides an opportunity for continuing medical education (CME) while also receiving credits (2). Unfortunately, barriers such as location, travel cost, and logistics can deter prospective attendees especially for international events (1). These barriers have been further com pounded by the COVID -19 pandemic which require strict social gathering protocols (1). Video c onferencing platforms provide a promising solution to these challenges (1). As part of an ongoing partnership, the Armenian Eyecare Project (AECP) and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) have been hosting annual international conferences for 18 years wi th lectures from pediatric researchers and practitioners around the world. Due to the pandemic, the 2020 conference was hosted virtually through Zoom webinars. Her e we present our design and findings from the event. Methods: The AECP- CHLA 2020 conference was held from September 23 -26 and focused on lectures in pediatric health for physicians and healthcare professionals from Armenia and neighboring countries. Participants were provided step -by-step tutorials for creating accounts, registering fo r the webinars, and navigating through Zoom. All participants initially created an account through the CHLA team's custom website (\"https://www.learnwithopen.org/\") which con tained the agenda, Zoom links, and guidelines for participating in the virtual conference. Afterwards, attendees registered for the Zoom webinars and were provided with a link to the conferences. During the webinar, participants watched pre -recorded lectur e videos streamed live by the host. Armenian, Russian, and English translations of the lectures were made available through live translators with the option to switch language channels through a Zoom feature. Additionally, participants were able to ask que stions, answer polls, and communicate via chat. During registration, demographics, professional experience, contact information, and CME credit questions were collected. After the conclusion of the webinar, data on participant attendance and duration was extracted from the Zoom reports. Results: Preliminary data collected after the con ference's conclusion show that (1) 300 webinar participant accounts were created on the OPEN website. (2) 241 participants attended the Zoom webinar on September 23, 217 on the 24th, 218 on the 25th, and 201 on the 26th. (3) Individuals from Armenia, US, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Moldova, Kyrgyz republic, and Tajikistan attended the event. (4) Doctors, researchers, coordinators, and hospital administrators attended the event. (5) 7 0 individuals were interested in receiving CME credits on the 23rd, 71 on the 24th , 75 on the 25th, and 75 on the 26th. To be eligible for CME credits, the attendee must have spent 90% of the conference duration in the Webinar. This calculation will be don e using a mapping of individuals interested in CME credits and the respective duration spent. Potential Impact : Preliminary results from the concluded event show that hosting an international pediatric conference in multiple languages through Zoom is a feasible medium that can overcome geographic, logistical, financial, and pandemic ba rriers. 264References: 1) Weissgerber T, Bediako Y, de Winde CM, et al.

Rationale: As the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) became a global pandemic, medical schools were faced with the challenge of transitioning medical students from the clinical environment to virtual learning. The impetus to integrate students into the COVID -19 response sparked creative educational efforts often relying upon informal learning strategies to supplement virtual learning. Our institution sought to supplement students' education by creating a medical studen t-run COVID -19 patient registry which would suppor t future research queries and improve quality of care. Rather than utilizing quality improvement nurses or coders, we recruited medical students, whose rotations had been suspended, to review records and extract data. The purpose of this study was to devel op a survey instrument to (1) explore the impact of the intervention on student engagement during the suspension of clinical rotations and (2) examine the extent to which the intervention fostered informal learning. Methods: We first developed a 1300- item registry for admitted COVID- 19 positive patients at our institution with data fields determined by resident and attending feedback as well as by preliminary U.S. data. Students completed data entry on over 350 patients from April to July 2020. The survey tool created for this study sought to evaluate medical students' experience working on the COVID -19 Registry. The survey was designed to be completed in five minutes on average. The 23 -question (including demographic information) survey covered four categories (clinical knowledge and skills; documentation and hospital operations; research process; and altruism) and included one item for each of the four components of the Dynamic Model of Informal Learning (e xperience/action, feedback, reflection, and intention to learn.) The survey consisted of six demographic questions, 15 closed ended questions using a 5- point Likert scale format, two open -ended questions, and one check- all-that-apply question. Survey writing was informed by principles of informal learning and gleaned from studies analyzing informal learning in the workplace in order to characterize this novel learning experience using a validated survey tool. Quantitative and qualitative data from this survey was analyzed in order to characterize the impact of registry work on medical students' educational experience while they were unable to participate in clinical clerkships. Results: Survey response rate was 62.7% (32/51). 87.5% of respondents affirmed t hat participation supplemented their medical education. 78% of participants felt they contributed to the COVID -19 response. 68.8% of students endorsed they gained a better understanding of research methodology, and 87.5% intend to pursue independent resear ch from the registry data. Students commo nly reported positive experiences with mentorship, improving their clinical knowledge, teamwork, and sense of altruism through work on the registry. The majority of students felt that participation in the registry increased their overall clinical knowledge , as well as their COVID- 19 specific knowledge. In the realm of 'Experience/action' and 'Feedback,' 59.4% agreed that they look at how others on the team complete data abstraction in order to improve their own workf low. 68.8% developed their own ideas to improve their work. In the category of 'Intent to Learn,' 62.6% of students stated that they independently looked up information in order to better understand or perform well in their role in the registry. In regard to 'Reflection,' 84.4% agreed that they l earned something new through repeating data abstraction on multiple charts. Upon qualitative analysis, four major themes emerged from the open -ended prompt asking students what they enjoyed about working with the registry: mentorship, teamwork, altruism, and education, which encompasses general medical knowledge as well as knowledge about COVID -19 itself. 266Potential Impact : Despite being unable to participate in direct clinical care during the COVID -19 pandemic, medical students reported positive education al, altruistic, and research experiences through their registry work. This mechanism of informal learning can augment education during future surges when traditional in -person clinical experiences are not feasible. References: 1) Boodman, C., Lee, S., & Bullard, J.

We created a Texas virtual internal medicine residency program series. Rationale: Medical students and residency programs must contend with an unprecedented 2020 -2021 application cycle (2). Students will have had limited interactions with residency programs due to canceled conferences, canceled away rotations, and a national mandate for virtual interviews for the cycle. In order to ease some of the anxiety and uncertainty of this application cycle, members of the Texas American College of Physicians (TXACP) medical student council created a student -led statewide internal medicine (I.M.) virtual series. Our goal was to connect students to program directors and chief residents to provide insight into their program -specific values and mission prior to the virtual interview season. We hypothesize that this showcase would mitigate some of the uncertainty and concerns from the applicant's perspective regarding this year's residency application cycle. To our knowledge, this is the first student -led initiative to virtually showcase internal medicine residency programs. Methods: The showcase was designed to host 1 -4 residency programs each week over the course of 3 months to allow each program their own individual webinar on a given day. Each session was designed to be an hour in length via Zoom to allow for efficient pr ogramming while providing time for applicant involvement. The sessions were structured as follows: 1) in the first 5 to 10 minutes, the program director gives a brief presentation about their respective program. 2) We then transition to a 25 -30 m inute question and answer session. 3) The program director then exits the call and we host a similar question and answer format with the chief residents. Questions were sent from participants via private chat to the moderator who then filtered these and as ked them t o the program. We recruited the twenty -eight I.M. residency programs across the state to gauge interest in participating in the showcases with the help of TXACP staff. Once programs chose their specific days, we began to promote the showcases to medical students throughout the state. Members of the TXACP Medical Student Council from various medical schools volunteered to help moderate the sessions. Volunteer roles included moderator, co -moderator, and an auxiliary role to help facilitate the sessions. The individual sessions were structured in the form of a conversation between the host and the program affiliate. After each showcase, a post -call survey was sent out to all registered attendees to assess the level of satisfaction. Results: TXACP promotional e mails for the showcase were sent to 2,276 medical students with registration for sessions ranging from 50 -200 students per session. The medical student registration greatly varied between programs likely reflecting size, location, and no toriety of the program. Of the 28 Internal Medicine Residency programs in Texas, 82% participated in the showcase (n=23). Surveys showed that chapter email (45.9%), faculty (24.3%), and medical student interest groups (21.6%) were the primary sources for students learning ab out the residency showcase. Interestingly, social media was the primary source for only 5.4% of the students. Almost all students were either very satisfied (78%) or somewhat satisfied (19%) with the showcase. 91.8% indicated they felt t heir questions about the program adequately answered. Potential Impact : It is our hope to be able to educate and inform the medical education community about the process of designing and developing an event such as this and to serve as a template of how to successfully recreate a virtual webinar series. With an expected increase in number of applications (3), we hope to mitigate the stress during this unprecedented cycle. 268 References: 1) Rose S. Medical Student Education in the Time of COVID -19.

Need/Rationale: The disproportionate deaths f rom COVID -19 and recent murders of Black lives have brought national attention to the injustices affecting Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), including inequities within medicine. In parti cular, medical education lacks adequate representation of BIPOC within its teaching materials. Skin of color (SOC) images were recently found to be underrepresented in popular USMLE preparatory resources and major dermatology textbooks (1 -2). This lack of diversity contributes to dermatologic health disparities, a s physicians are inadequately trained in recognizing skin conditions on BIPOC patients: for instance, melanoma is more common in white patients, yet presents with more advanced disease among BIPOC (3). Considering this educational deficit, we plan to review photographs from pre -clinical courses at the UUSOM, assess their SOC representation, and propose revisions to better prepare future physicians to serve patients of all skin colors and backgrounds . Methods: The project will focus on evaluating and revisi ng pre- clinical foundational sciences, pathophysiology, and clinical skills content at our medical school. We are first assessing the following 2020 spring courses: Host and Defense (H&D); Clinical Methods Curriculum (CMC); Skin, Muscle, Bone, and Joint (S MBJ). We have collected pre -work, guides, lectures, and assessments from these courses, excluding any outside resources, videos, or literature. Content will be assessed for the total number of educational photographs and the percentage of those images depicting SOC. Furthermore, images will be categorized by skin pigmentation types using the Fitzpatrick phototyping scale\u2014 both in total and based on the associated diagnosis. Two coders will be assigned to each lecture material. After assessing SOC representat ion, we will compile SOC photographs and send them to lecturers to provide suggestions for improving the coursework. To better guide our content development, we have sent a survey to current third - and second- year medical students to assess their expectati ons for appropriate SOC representation. Our suggested lecture revisions will work to compensate for a deficiency in SOC images and ensure the equal presentation of skin pigmentation types for all diagnoses. After completing our work for H&D, CMC, SMBJ, we will apply our methodology to evaluate and revise the remaining pre - clinical coursework. Evaluation Plan: Following the completion of each revised pre -clinical course, medical students will complete a survey assessing their satisfaction with skin color re presentation within the course, along with their comfort in recognizing cutaneous conditions in patients of color. The responses for H&D, CMC, and SMBJ will also be compared with survey respo nses collected from medical students who had taken the courses prior to the revision for better skin color representation. Potential Impact : Successfully increasing SOC representation in our pre -clinical content will strengthen our medical students' abili ty to treat patients of color and provide a model for assessing a nd developing content to better serve the BIPOC community.

Need/Rationale: As an important trait in physicians, empathy is both sought in potential medical school applicants, as well as, actively taught to medical students throughout their education. Despite this, some literature shows that empathy decreases in medical students as they progr ess through their medical education (1). Virtual reality (VR) simulation is a growing field in medical education and has been utilized in the training of practical skills and procedures across several medical and surgical specialties (2). While many method s have been used to increase medical student empathy levels, there is little research on using Virtual Reality simulation as the intervention. The few studies that do exist utilizing VR applications are poorly designed but show promising results via satisfaction surveys (3). This study proposes to utilize a validated widely -accepted instrument to assess the impact of VR simulation on medical students' empathy and compare that impact to a control group. Methods: The VR simulation was developed in collaborat ion with the Kennesaw State University Computer Science Department. The clinical scenario for this simulation centers on a patient with Parkinson's dis ease. The VR application simulates completing multiple activities of daily living in the setting of hand tremors. Activities of daily living are represented by six in -game tasks that vary between the use of gross motor and fine motor skills. Activities inc lude showering, brushing one's teeth, making and eating a sandwich, sorting pills, and dialing a phone number. In -game tasks are set on a time limit such that if any task is not completed in the appropriate amount of time, participants will be directed to the next task. The maximum time limit for the simulation is set at 10 minutes. Subjects are introduced to the controls of the game via a pre -brief and an in- game tutorial. An in- game tutorial allows participants to learn the controls before starting the si mulation. Voice overs are utilized to go over the tutorial and announce the current task objective. The V R simulation will be integrated into the pre -clerkship curriculum geriatrics session. Evaluation Plan: Subjects were recruited from the Medical College of Georgia second -year medical student class. The intervention group for the study used the VR applicat ion, whereas the control group watched two video presentations on patient's daily struggles of living with Parkinson's disease. Videos used were from the Parkinson's 360 website developed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Total time of the video presentati ons is approximately 10 minutes. Half of the students were randomly assigned to the intervention group (VR) and another half were assigned to the control group (video). The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and the UCLA geriatric attitudes assessment were administered before and after the study. The intervention group also received an additional VR satisfaction survey. Amount of time to complete VR simulation tasks were recorded and subjects were given an overall performance score at the end of the simulatio n. Data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed -rank test and ordinal logistic regression. Changes in pre and post -survey scores of the JSE and UC LA geriatrics attitudes assessment were compared between groups. This study was approved by the Augusta Univers ity IRB. Potential Impact : Students were excited to integrate VR into the medical curriculum. Improving medical student empathy through VR simul ation could be a cost -effective method to reach the desired result as little to no proctor involvement or expen sive simulation equipment is needed. Additionally, the VR equipment can be used for other topics in medical education. 272References: 1) Louie AK, Coverdale JH, Balon R, et al. Enhancing Empathy: a Role for Virtual Reality?

Need/Rationale: The emergence of COVID -19 in 2020 instantly changed the medical education landscape, mandating a remote learning environment. This presented challenges for facilitating Team - Based Learning (TBL) session s which we previously delivered as an in -person modality for M1/M2 medical students. To engage learners in a remote TBL environment while maintaining the TBL 4S framework [1], we identified a need to deploy a remote TBL video -based platform that integrated assessments, casework, and facilitation to accommodate 175 students in 36 groups. Platform requirements included integrated remote assessments, effective student interaction with faculty facilitators, video interaction in small breakout groups with seamle ss transitions to a main classroom, instant feedback features for students, and simultaneous casework re port-out options. To avoid additional departmental costs or student technology fees, we developed a platform using existing Microsoft Office 365 and Art iculate 360 software and infrastructure available to the University of Toledo College of Medicine & Life Sciences to host remote and/or hybrid TBLs. Methods: We used Microsoft Office 365 to build the TBL delivery platform for M1/M2 medical students. (1) W e used the Microsoft Teams delivery platform to create 36 permanent breakout video channels for TBL team s and host 175 students in an accompanying Main Session Room channel for class -wide facilitation. (2) Using Microsoft Sharepoint, remote assessments wer e secured by specifying file permissions to prevent group readiness assessment test (GRAT) and case down loads. (3) We utilized Microsoft Forms into the Teams platform to incorporate an instantaneous collection of honor code attestations, GRAT score report outs, GRAT discussion point requests, GRAT appeals, and interactive simultaneous casework report out acr oss TBL groups. Metrics are instantly viewable/downloadable from the Microsoft Forms web -based hub for import into our learning management system (LMS). (4) We developed a series of timers and announcements that were built into breakout channels to direct students back to the Main Session Room for discussion. Finally, (5) using Articulate 360 software, we developed and integrated a virtual instant feedbac k assessment technique (IF -AT) scratch- off card directly into the Teams platform. Our digital IF -AT card is customizable for each assessment, self - archiving, and self -scoring. The final fully integrated platform is suitable for delivering in -person, remote or hybrid TBL and is easily deployed across a curriculum for small group applications with minimal faculty/staff resources. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: The remote TBL platform was deployed in July 2020 for M2 medical students, and in August 2020 for M1 medical students. Reaction: During the initial phase, a group of students were randomly selected, and written feedback was gathered, which allowed us to quickly fine - tune our platform format. Since M2 students have experience with in -person TBL, we are currently qualitatively evaluating student perceptions of value learning in in -person TBL delivery relative to the new remote/hybrid TBL delivery system, as well as the new TBL platform itself. We are currently developing an IRB -approved survey to deploy to M2 students to understand student perceptions, satisfaction and to assess additional oppo rtunities for improvement. The evaluation plan also includes assessing student evaluations from 2019 M2 class for a specific TBL session versus the 2020 M2 remote T BL class session. Quantitative evaluations are planned as the GRAT questions remain unchange d between the 2019 and 2020 session, and will allow us to evaluate whether significant changes in GRAT performance are documented in response to the new remote plat form. This latter analysis will be evaluated for both the M1 and M2 classes for 2020. 274Potential Impact : Students apply foundational knowledge through collaboration and assessment in TBL [1]. Our novel platform is suitable for remote, hybrid or in -person T BL. It is integrated to efficiently facilitate TBL with minimal resources and engages learne rs in small groups to reduce isolation -induced anxiety [2, 3] in the current virtual learning environment.

(2). (1) Neurology, Houston Methodist -Weill Cornel Medical College; (2) Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: A clerkship readiness boot camp to facilitate the transition to clerkship rotations for second -year (MS2) medical students. Need/Rationale: There is currently a gap in the perceived preparedness of medical students for clinical clerkships compared to what is expected by clerkship directors (1). In addit ion, there is a lack of standardized methodology and assessment across pre -clerkship and clerkship curricula, within and between medical schools (1). Evidence supports that clinical skills refreshers, clarification of roles and expectations, and opportunities to apply knowledge to clinical content is important in perceptions of readiness by students and faculty alike (2). Previous studies have looked at different metrics of clinical readiness across measures of professionalism, practice -based learning, and clinical reasoning, yet few have documented highly predictive measures for outcomes of competency, nor is there standardized agreement as to how clinical readiness or competency is defined across medical schools(2). In their article about transitions, Colbert- Getz hypothesized three elements to successful transitions, character, relevant knowledge/skills and the learning environment. The proposed boot camp will address character (e.g. mindset), current m edical knowledge, clinical reasoning skills, and the expectations and goals of students. Methods: The intervention will focus on 34 MS2 in a joint engineering and medicine program. The 2 -day boot camp will occur at the end of the students' pre -clerkship curriculum and before clerkship rotations. Prior to boot camp, students will be assessed on readiness and confidence (e.g. metacognitive skills, mindset). To assess medical knowledge and clinical skills, students will complete online modules and participate in multi- station clinical assessment (history, exa m, clinical reasoning) augmented with faculty teaching at each station on the first morning. To improve confidence and preparedness, a student will then participate in small group (8 -9) and large group (16 -17) progressive disclosure cases with paired shari ng and use of an audience response system (ARS). These sessions will be facilitated by clerkship faculty. On Day 2 the focus will shift to team skills. Learners will take a set of self -knowledge tools and work in teams to examine their strengths and weakne sses. In the final afternoon, they will participate in mock rounds followed by a concluding session. In Mock rounds, learners will review patient data and prepare a case presentation. In groups of six, the y will practice presenting cases (with feedback provided). The final session will discuss the student's expectation and goals and a summary of the boot camp. Students will be surveyed immediately after boot camp and 4 months into clerkships during a brief follow -up session to revisit concepts as requested in the learners. Evaluation Plan: 1) The program will track activities for any modifications; and track learner attendance and completion of all tools and assessments. 2) Learner reaction/satisfaction will be measured using standard session and course eva luation forms. 3) Student learning will be directly assessed in the mock rounds during boot camp, and indirectly through a follow -up repeat of their survey of preparedness and confidence. During boot camp questioning using the ARS during the progressive di sclosure cases will provide evidence of group knowledge and clinical reasoning. 4) Behavior will be evaluated in the second follow -up. Students will complete a written reflection about how they have used their learning from the boot camp and any barriers to their usage or their learning. They will also be asked to note any concepts they would like to revisit (covered in the follow -up session). Quantitative and qualitative analysis will be utilized to examine the impact on perceptions and behavior. Potential Impact : Clerkship readiness of medical students is generalizable to other health professions where students transition from preclinical curriculum to clinically oriented curricula. This pre -clerkship boot camp, if effective, could be submitted to MedEd portal for materials to be accessed by health professions' faculty desiring to set up their own boot camp. 276References: 1) Jarecke, J.L., Taylor, E.W. & Gusic, M.E.

Need/Rationale: Undergraduate and medical students from underrepresented in me dicine (URM) backgrounds have identified poor institutional resources and a lack of access to quality mentorship as barriers to moving forward in their path toward medical school, residency, and careers as physicians [1]. The Diversity and Inclusion Mentor ing Pro gram was created by CHLA Pediatric residents as a pathway for early exposure to Pediatrics and mentorship in academic medicine with the ultimate goal of creating a physician workforce that better mirrors our growing diverse population of patients. U RM students actively seek opportunities for protected time with faculty and coordinated exposure to a career in academic medicine[2]. Our program seeks to work toward the introduction and maintenance of mentoring relationships and consistent opportunities for face- to-face, real -time exposure between URM physicians and URM mentees. We plan to integrate our online mentorship and educational opportunities into a virtual platform, which can be accessed on phones, tablets or computers. This platform would serve as a single consolidated virtual learning platform that is accessible to our mentees and reproducible at additional institutions. Methods: We plan to meet the needs of our URM student mentees by: 1) Forming mentorship \"families;\" and 2) Providing virtual education and shadowing opportunities. Mentorship families will be composed of URM medical students from USC Keck school of medicine, residents, fellows and attendings. This structure has the added benefit of near -peer mentoring to occur between trainees and medi cal students. Residents and fellows will also have the opportunity to not only gain mentoring skills but receive mentoring from faculty. Families will be determined based on the indicated preferences from medical students (racial/ethnic demographics , career interests, etc.). The program will have quarterly large group development sessions for members of the program and mentorship families will meet at least four times throughout the year to debrief shadowing experiences, discuss scholarly projects an d build a sense of community. An initial survey of the families is designed to identify topics to meet the educational needs of mentees. Virtual shadowing opportunities will offer an opportunity for students to engage in learning a variety of topics in ped iatrics , including post -graduate training and pediatric subspecialties. Residents, fellows and attendings will be able to curate patient experiences via interactive experiences via video and teleconferences modalities. Through media platforms such as WebEx, shadowing mentors will offer unique career perspectives with specific learning objectives. Evaluation Plan: We will use the Kirkpatrick evaluation model to measure participant behaviors, learning, and reactions earlier, and give us time to adjust our program to be most effective. The 4 levels the Kirkpatrick Model for our program are the following: Level 1, reaction: What did people think of the program? Did they like it?- pre and post- program surveys; Level 2, learning: Did people obtain new knowledge or belief s as a result of the program? - pre and post surveys for professional development sessions, attitude surveys, mentorship skills surveys; Level 3, behavior: Interest towards pediatrics and academic medicine. Increased knowledge of the various pediat ric subsp ecialties. Mentees and mentors will have an opportunity to provide written, qualitative feedback and provide quantitative data on each other, the program and their overall experience; Level 4, results: We will compare overall data to the outcomes of other mentorship programs in the literature, including: a. The number of URM applicants to Pediatrics and combined Pediatrics residencies; b. The number of URM students that matriculate into Pediatrics and combined Pediatrics residencies; c. The number of URM applicants to the CHLA Pediatric Residency Program. 278Potential Impact : Increased exposure for URM medical students to a pediatric post -graduate experience in a large academic institution in a virtual setting. Improved resident trainee exposure with pediatric subspecialties. Improved mentee confidence based on self -reporting measures. Increased number of URM applicants to Pediatric and combined Pediatric residencies. References: 1) Nimmons, D., Giny, S., & Rosenthal, J. (2019).

Need/Rationale: Becoming a parent during residency can be challenging, as there is no standardized approach to parental leave across GM E programs and Family and Medical Leave Act (F MLA) benefits may not cover residents in their first year of training (1). The AAP recommends that residents who become parents should be guaranteed a minimum of 6 -8 weeks of parental leave with pay after the infant's birth yet fails to discuss implementation strategies (2). Some residency programs have implemented parenting electives to allow their trainees more time at home. In pediatrics, many office visits are for well child care, where topics like nutrition , development and behavior are discussed, maki ng it essential for pediatricians to be trained to provide appropriate health maintenance and anticipatory guidance (3). The creation of a remote newborn elective for pediatric residents who plan to adopt, foster or birth a child during training delivers an innovative opportunity to strengthen anticipatory guidance skills while providing care for their own child at home. In addition, the growing use of telehealth facilitates options for virtual patient care and distance learning. Methods: The newborn elect ive will be a 2 or 4- week experience, available to all pediatric residents, for an estimated 5- 10 residents per year. It will be divided into two -week units, and three units will be available. Residents can complete one or two units of their choice, based on interests and length of their rotation. The first unit focuses on anticipatory guidance and infant feeding and growth patterns. The second unit will emphasize infant and toddler development. The third unit, useful for second - or third -time parents, will cover family dynamics after the birth of a child, including the impact on older siblings. The rotation can be completed from home and requires learner engagement on average 6 hours per day, 5 days per week. Competencies that will be covered encompass practice- based learning and improvement through independent study, medical knowledge and communication skills. The experience will include: 1) Weekly faculty -led discussions on topics from a syllab us, with experience sharing among participants. 2) Continuity c linic one -half day per week, exclusively for telehealth visits. 3) The creation of an information flyer for parents and a video role -playing giving anticipatory guidance. Study topics in the sy llabus will cover breastfeeding, formula familiarity, newborn r ashes and emergencies, safe sleep, car seat safety, post-partum depression, developmental milestones, interpersonal communication skills, care of children with medical needs and toilet training . Evaluation Plan: Faculty members organizing the elective wil l track the number of residents that complete the rotation and the topics that they chose to focus on. They will also precept residents in the continuity clinic and provide direct observation w ith feedback during telehealth encounters. All hand -outs and videos created by residents will be compiled into a shared file and be available for use by the entire residency program. Anticipatory guidance videos can also be played in the continuity clinic waiting room, where they can be viewed by families before their visit. Residents will complete a self -entry log reflecting on their experience, challenges and knowledge acquired throughout the rotation. They will also complete a pre and post participation survey to assess their level of comfort with giving anticipatory guidance to parents (on select topics like breastfeeding, formulas, post -partum depression) before and after the elective. After the rotation, faculty members in the outpatient setting will continue to track the incorporation of anticipatory guidance int o well -child visit when they precept trainees. Potential Impact : Although the creation of a newborn elective does not solve the absence of a standardized parental leave policy in residency pro grams, it creates a rigorous at -home elective useful to parents, that could be transferable to other specialties or health care professions involved in the care of children. 280References: 1) Vassallo, Patricia; Jeremiah, Jennifer; Forman, Leanne; et al.

Keck School of Medicine of USC and Children's Hospital Los Angeles Idea: Helping pedia tric residents develop systems -based practice competencies through a COVID -19 pandemic elective experience. Need/Rationale: The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education has charged training programs with the task of developing resident competency in systems- based practice (SBP) (ACGME 2020). This competency, particularly the focus on systems of care, has proven to be a challenge for programs to both teach and assess [1]. Some have created multimodal, non -clinical experiences while others have focused on quality- improvement (QI) based activities [2,3]. Similarly, our pediatric residency utilizes didactics and online modules coupled with QI project involvement to address the SBP competency but lacks additional experiential training around systems of care, specifically. With the arrival of the COVID -19 pandemic, it has become even more vital that our trainees understand the health systems in which they work. To address this growing need, we propose a \"Pandemic Elective\" in which residents develop co mpetency in systems of care and interdisciplinary approaches to patient safety through the lens of the COVID -19 pandemic by attending high -level hospital leadership meetings, debriefing with experts, and collaborating with nonphysician staff members. Meth ods: The Pandemic Elective is a 2 -week experience available to all pediatric residents, maximum 1 - 2 every 2 weeks, once per month. The elective consists of the following: 1) Reading: residents will develop foundational knowledge of emergency preparedness systems by reading the World Health Organization's Emergency Preparedness Framework and pair this with current informatio n from the Centers for Disease Control and Los Angeles Department of Public Health websites. 2) Meeting attendance: residents will outline how hospital -specific systems fit within local and national systems of care through attendance at our institution's d isaster command center meetings where protocols are developed and updated for COVID -19 prevention, screening, testing, treatment and pat ient cohorting. After meetings, residents have 1 -on-1 debriefing sessions with faculty experts. 3) Resource assessments: residents will analyze how hospital resources inform the development of protocols through visits with central supply services, pharmacy and laboratory services. 4) Information dissemination: residents will grow their interdisciplinary communication skills as part of the information dissemination team, visiting departments that require clarification of new protocols. 5) Systems thinking: r esidents will culminate the experience by reviewing the newest data around COVID -19 prevention, screening, testing, treatment or patient cohorting and proposing a new hospital -based recommendation or affirming a current protocol. Evaluation Plan: Accounta bility: Participants will complete an elective checklist with the above activities. Reaction: Residents will complete an anonymous post -elective survey assessing satisfaction in the experience and likelihood of recommending the experience to others. Learning: 1) Reflective writing will be used to check for depth of understanding. Specifically, following resource assessment activities, participating residents will provide a written reflection on how hospital resources inform current hospital COVID- 19 protoco ls and how these compare to local or national guidelines. Following interdisciplinary information dissemination, residen ts will reflect on how nonphysician perspectives contribute to current hospital COVID- 19 protocols. 2) Resident skills in systems thinking will be assessed by their completed recommendation/affirmation of hospital protocol activity. 3) Completion of standard written evaluation of resident performance. Behavior: hospital -wide committee involvement and QI participation are tracked for all re sidents in their semi -annual meetings, which allow us to compare participants to non- participants. 282Potential Impact : The COVID- 19 pandemic has posed many challenges to medical education. It has also created the opportunity to design an experiential learning elective in SBP that can be adapted by other institutions seeking to help their learners develop competency in this domain and ultimately become more active in the systems in which they work.

Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: Enhancement of remote simulation -based education through the use of a virtual \"resuscitation room\" and a free patient monitor app. Need/Rationale: Medical simulation is a v aluable educational tool that offers learners the opportunity to engage in experiential learning [1]. Unfortunately, social distancing restrictions imposed during the recent pandemic have halted many in- person simulation programs. Educators have begun to e xplore the world of remote, virtual simulation, particularly given recent studies suggesting that learning and satisfaction in trainees are equivalent in standard and telesimulation sessions [2]. Telesimulation has the added benef it of transcending the time, space, and financial barriers associated with conducting in- person simulation [3]. At a time when clinical learning opportunities are limited, it is increasingly important to continue to offer simulation- based education that wi ll allow learners to hone their clinical skills and prepare for high stakes patient encounters. A recent survey conducted at our emergency medicine residency program corroborated this need, with residents suggesting that their clinical training had been co mpromised by the pandemic and requesting increased opportunities for simulation. As such, we plan to utilize a virtual simulation platform that will allow for remote continuation and expansion of our current simulation program. Methods: As part of their l ongitudinal simulation cur riculum, 76 PGY1- PGY4 emergency medicine residents will participate in biweekly remote educational modules conducted over a virtual simulation platform. Simulation modules will occur during protected educational conference time and last 90 minutes in durat ion. During these sessions, case facilitators and learners will contemporaneously engage in a shared virtual simulation space through the use of a video conferencing platform. This virtual \"resuscitation room\" will consist of a mo difiable PowerPoint slide that displays an emergency department patient care room with a case -specific patient lying on a gurney. The PowerPoint slide will also include icons of various medical equipment (i.e. bag -valve- mask, cardiac pacing pads) and medic ations that are commonly used during emergency room patient encounters. As the case evolves and residents perform interventions or administer medications, these icons will be dragged over to the virtual patient to simulate real-time completion of the inter ventions. During the case, residents will also be provided with evolving patient vitals through the use of Simpl, a free patient monitor app. Through this app, case facilitators can send real- time changes in vitals to multiple remote learners using a singl e shared device code. The combination of a virtual \"resuscitation room\" and a dynamic patient monitor contributes to the creation of an easily modifiable learning space that is interactive and collaborative. Evaluation Plan: For the duration of the virtua l simulation curriculum, w e will track resident attendance and maintain a log of the clinical topics addressed in each simulation session. In order to assess participant satisfaction with the virtual platform, we will utilize standard session evaluations and end- of- curriculum focus groups conducted by an external evaluator. Session evaluations will elicit learner satisfaction with, and experience using, the virtual simulation platform, and will allow simulation faculty to modify the platform for a second it eration if desired. A subset of survey questions will also assess the perceived educational value of engaging in remote simulation. The end-of- curriculum focus groups will explore a rich understanding of trainees' lived experience while engaging with the v irtual simulation space. F ocus group interview questions will also investigate any change in learners' clinical skills and comfort as a result of the virtual simulation curriculum. Potential Impact : Virtual simulation is a growing field that has the poten tial to offer a less resource- intensive alternative to standard in -person simulation. If effective, it can not only fill educational gaps created by the current pandemic but can facilitate the use of simulation in low -resource settings. 284References: 1) Okuda Y, Bryson EO, DeMaria S J r, Jacobson L, Quinones J, Shen B, Levine AI.

(1) Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Houston Methodist Hospital; (2) Weill Cornell Medical College Idea: Use of real-time live -stream surgery enables cardiothoracic sur gery faculty to acquire skills using new surgical technology. Need/Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic has dramatically altered the way that medical education and faculty development occur. Previously, practicing physicians who sought to adopt a new technol ogy would visit experienced centers and observe cases to learn best practices. Due to strict visitation and travel limitations, this is no longer possible. The use of video -recorded surgery is an established learning technique1. However, the interactive nature of a real -time live -streamed case greatly enhances t he participation of the learner. Given the recency of COVID -19, there are few studies on this topic. Similar issues have been described during the pandemic as it applies to medical student education. Medical students on surgical rotations during medical sc hool faced the prospect of having severely curtailed operating room exposure. Live -streamed surgery was proposed as a potential solution2,3. Our live - stream capabilities are better equipped to captur e the full breadth and nuance of a complex surgical case compared to previous studies. Our live -stream educational model enables learners to engage in a deliberate practice cycle, accelerating adoption and integration of new surgical technology and techniques during and after the COVID -19 pandemic. Methods: The target learners for our intervention are practicing cardiothoracic surgeons who are already experts in their field, but seeking to integrate an electromagnetic navigational lung nodule localization platform into their practice. Using a secure, HIPAA -compl iant web -based video- conferencing service (Webex), the learner will remotely tune in to live -streamed surgery cases to participate in case observation. Three learners will observe live -streamed surgery cases every two weeks for 3 months. Evaluation Plan: Live-streamed surgical cases provide an opportunity for physicians to engage in learning opportunities despite travel and visitation restrictions due to COVID -19. Using our live- stream surgery model as an educational platform will allow for future learners to remotely learn new techniques and technologies in an interactive and high fidelity setting. We will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention with follow -up at six weeks to see gauge utility for the learners as well as the evolution of their comfort level with the technology. Reaction will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks to survey the audio and visual quality as well as the learner's response to the model. The learners will engage in a written reflection of the impact of the live -stream case their decisio n-making and confidence in the technology to evaluate their learning and changes in behavior. Potential Impact : Our live -stream surgery model can be applied to a wide range of learners, from practicing physicians (surgery, pulmonology and radiology) to trainees (fellows, residents and medical students) in remote locations who otherwise would be unable to experience surgical cases of this type or volume. 286References: 1) McCullough MC, Kulber L, Sammons P, Santos P, Kulber DA.

(1); Jones, Teresa Nyquist, Julie G. (2) (1) University of Colorado School of Medicine; (2) Keck School of Medicine of USC Idea: A proactive 1 -year coaching program aimed at improving well -being and performance in general surgery interns. Need/Rationale: Residents suffering from burnout are less likely to excel in training and more likely to experience adverse outcomes. (1) Residents as a whole are more likely to suffer from burnout then age - matched peers, and general surgery residents tend to be affected at a greater rate than other medical specialties. (2,3) These findings have accentuated th e need for programs to place resident well- being at a higher priority than ever before. While individualized learning plans (ILPs) are now a requirement for all residency programs, rarely are they used as a way to help incorporate well -being practices into daily resident professional life. (4) We seek to develop, implement, and assess the impact of a well -being coaching program in a general surgery internship. The pro posed program has three elements: 1) a set of tools to help learners gain a deeper understa nd of self; 2) an ILP that includes self -care, support structure, and performance items; and 3) a coaching process utilizing a standardized coaching model. The purpo se of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the coaching program on residents' wel l- being and performance. Methods: A one- year coaching program will be incorporated into the curriculum for 32 general surgery interns at University of Colorado School of Medicine. The goal of the program is resident well- being and performance success. The program will include multiple elements. 1) Tools to enhance self -knowledge. First, self- assessment exercises will be offered (VIA Character Strengths Survey, Dweck' s Growth Mindset Scale, the Grit Scale, and the Self -compassion Scale). Interns will then p articipate in a four- hour training session focused on education and self -reflection of 21st century mindset ideas including growth mindset, vulnerability, self -compassion, resiliency and grit. 2) Use of ILPs: ILPs will include reflection on individual supp ort systems, well- being/self -care/flourishing, competing demands, self -disclosure of struggles/accomplishments, and short - and long- term professional goals with a pl an of action. 3) Implementation of a coaching program using a standardized coaching model: Residents will develop their ILP with the help of their faculty coach. Interns will have quarterly check -ins with their faculty coaches throughout the academic year. Coaches have all been trained to utilize techniques recommended in the AMA Coaching Booklets (2017) as well as the principles of positive psychology as reflected in the acronym PERMA (positive emotions, engagement, authentic relationships, meaning, and accomplishment) that have been shown to support flourishing/wellbeing. Evaluation Plan: The evaluation of the intervention will incorporate multiple methods. 1) Tracking of participation in all program elements. 2) A standard questionnaire will be used to gain participants' opinions about the organization, instruction, content, and usefulness of the coaching program. 3) Participants will complete validated self -assessment instruments pre- , post - intervention and at the end of their PGY2 year to gather data on burnout and wellbeing. 4) A 90 min focus group of 10 interns will be used to gather qualitative data related to the tools and the elements of flourishing and will include questions on which tools helped, important accomplishments, and the role of coaching in helping them thrive. Together these methods will allow us to enhance the program for f uture interns as well as to determine its impact on resident well -being. Potential Impact : If proven effective, this program can serve as a model well -being program to equip new residents with a set of skills to be successful and thrive in residency. 288References: 1) Dyrbye L, Shanafelt T.

Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), University of Hawaii at Manoa; (2) School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene, University of Hawaii at Manoa; (3) Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy, University of Hawaii at Hilo Exemplar Description: This is an interprofessional simulation to teach the concepts of Root Cause Analysis and Action Plan (RCA2) to advanced learners. We used the Zoom platform, Google Jamboard and Docs to increase learner engagement and created polls to asse ss learning throughout the didactic portion. Materials were provided in advance to maximize time available for learners to work through analysis of a case study, make a cause map, and create an action plan. Learners/Subjects of the Curriculum: Advanced Tr ainees in a Health Profession (e.g., residency, fellowship level), Interprofessional Education Project: Learners at any level . Need/Rationale: The ACGME Common Program requirements and Milestones state that \"residents must participate as team members in r eal and/or simulated interprofessional clinical patient safety activities such as root cause analyses or other activities that include analysis as well as formulation and implementation of actions.\" We previously had no specific formal curriculum to teach these concepts in an interprofessional manner. We determined that nursing students and pharmacy residents had similar requirements to participate in interprofessional learning during their training. The legal climate in Hawaii precludes widespread trainee participation in root cause analyses. For this reason, the University of Hawaii Interprofessional Education (HIPE) team created this curriculum to ensure that all graduating residents would have participated in at least one patient safety simulation event to include cause mapping. Methods: In partnership with the School of Nursing and the College of Pharmacy, members of the Offic e of the DIO and key hospital leaders met with nursing and simulation educators to develop the curriculum. Originally designed f or in- person simulation over the course of four hours, we shortened the course to 2.5 hours when all instruction moved to distance learning. The planning group discussed goals and objectives, mapped out the agenda, created content and conducted rehearsals. The materials were sent to the learners in advance for pre -work. Each of three sessions included senior residents from the various GME programs, senior nursing students, and pharmacy residents. The facilitators provided brief didactics and the simulation consisted of a safety event that took place in a pathology lab. The Google Jamboard was then used to create a cause map by havin g the learners cite potential causes while a facilitator typed on the sticky notes. A second facilitator prompted the learners w ith a series of questions to reach the root causes. The Action Plan was created on a pre -templated Google doc, and once complete , a debrief was conducted. The learners completed a survey at the end of the session and the facilitators conducted an after act ion review to create improvements with each class. After the first session, it was determined that we needed to assess learning during the class to ensure the concepts were clearly understood. Polls were conducted during the second and third sessions. Results: There were a total of 100 learners across the three disciplines. Quantitative results from the polls and surveys revealed very low knowledge scores in two specific areas after the first session. Based on the feedback from the first session, particula r points of emphasis were made that resulted in improved scores in subsequent sessions. The survey data from all sessions indica ted that the objectives were met based on scores from 4.03 -4.47 on a scale of 1 -5. The scores improved with each iteration of the event. The overall score increased from 3.83 to 4.46 from the first to third session. Qualitative comments demonstrated that learners acknowledged this curriculum increased their ability to \"learn to appreciate everyone's viewpoint\" and \"increased knowledge\" in this competency. Several learners commented that they would feel confident conducting an RCA in their future practice. B ased on the results, the curriculum met the need to conduct an interprofessional simulation of an RCA event. The sessions will b e further modified based on learner feedback. The COVID -19 pandemic forced us to change quickly to an 290abbreviated, fully virtual session. Colleagues in the other health professions schools were not familiar with the different tools that could be deployed t o increase participant engagement. Subsequently, more interprofessional simulations have been conducted virtually and designed f or maximal interaction. This is now considered a best practice for virtual simulations. 291Friday, 2/19/2021, 2:00 - 2:45 pm Curri cular Exemplar Engaging Methods for Teaching Health Policy Amy (1); (3); Campos, Gabriel (4); Crandall, Cameron (2) (1) University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Department of F amily & Community Medicine; (2) University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Department of Emerge ncy Medicine; (3) Albuquerque Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Collaborative, Albuquerque, NM; (4 ) Description: The health effects of intimate partner violence ( IPV) not only include physical injury, but can also manifest as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and others. This case -based tutorial for third - year medical students examines: (1) a clinical encounter with a patient experiencing several complex challenges including IPV and homelessness; (2) the implications of existing policy on the delivery of health care services; and (3) the impact of policies on patient choices. Learners/Subjects of the Curriculum : Third year medical students in their mandatory 8-week family medicine clerkship rotation. Need/Rationale: The prevalence of intimate partner violence is significant and has lasting physical and psychological effects on the victims. Health effects not only include immediate physical injuries but also can manifest as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, sleeplessness, gastroin testinal disturbances, and headaches, among others. In addition, children who witness household violence are at risk for poor health outcomes. A growing body of literature and medical school accreditation bodies report medical students receive inadequate t raining about IPV. Combining this statistic with data in a 2008 AAMC report indicating that health policy content is perceived as boring, irrelevant, presented too theoretically, and having little or no context gave us the idea to address the two in combination. In practice, all specialties will encounter IPV within their patient populations and communities and should therefore receive training on appropriate screening, documentation, and resources. Methods: This session is part of a larger health policy c urriculum. The methods described are for the IPV/health policy session only and as it is taught during COVID which necessitated a move to on -line instruction. 1. Students are random ly assigned to groups of two to three. Each group reads one assigned article and submits a written question to the session faculty in advance of the session. Faculty prepare written responses to all questions. All questions and responses are distributed to the students to share information. 2. Students watch a video of the Family Advocacy Center to \"tour\" the community organization where IPV and Sexual Assault (SA) services are co -located. 3. In a large group setting, students use Meti.com to respond to polling questions asking them to define IPV and SA 4. Students are randomly assigned to one of 5 small groups to work through a clinical case that illustrates a patient who comes to the emergency department for common complaints. The medical issues are relatively simple but with added layers of complexity, including IPV and homelessness. The case weaves in corresponding health policy questions at every step of the patient's care. The case is facilitated by an interprofessional team of community memb ers and health professionals. 5. The session moves back to a larger group to discuss findings and respond to additional polling questions. 6. Students take an on -line quiz after the session based on CDC IPV concepts. Results: The on -line session has not yet be en evaluated. However, prior to on -line, student feedback on the IPV/health policy session has been uniformly positive. Within the course evaluation, students have the opportunity to provide written comments. 1. Praise for the experience: Almost all student s providing comments offered some form of praise to describe the experience. Multiple students indicated that the activity was their \"favorite experience of the block.\" 2922. Exposure to interprofessional knowledge: Comments highlighted an appreciation of the inclusion of interpr ofessional knowledge about IPV. One participant wrote, \"Multiple perspectives from different professionals illustrated the issues with great detail.\" 3. Exposure to nonmedical interventions: Comments captured student feedback about how the experience provided them with exposure to interventions outside of the medical environment. A participant linked exposure to an intervention outside of the medical environment to the effectiveness of the session by commenting, \"Very effective session to be able to see the setting in which IPV is investigated and support offered.\" 4. Expectations for clinical practice improvements: Multiple students wrote that the experience improved their confidence about caring for patients with IPV, with one noting, \"I feel far more equipped to refer and screen patients regarding IPV.\" 293Friday, 2/19/2021, 2:00 - 2:45 pm Curricular Exemplar Sci-Clin-ergy: A Framework for Integration Across Disciplines in Health Professions Education Kim, Rory (1); Haworth, Ian (2); Morningstar -Kywi, Noam (3) (1) USC School of Pharmacy, Department of Clinical Pharmacy; (2) USC School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; (3) USC School of Pharmacy Description: In health professions, education of the foundational sciences provide the basis for clinical reasoning to improve retention and diagnostic accuracy. However, the success of this approach depends on meaningful integration across disciplines. This session will describe a tested framework for integrated teaching of clinical therapeutics. This integrated course has been delivered to international pharmacy students during a summer immersion in both in -person and virtual formats. Learners/Subjects of the Curriculum : Medical Educators Need/Rationale: Curricular integration, includ ing integration of foundational sciences with clinical application, is an important strategy in health professions education. Evidence shows that integrating scientific knowledge with clinical practice leads to more comprehensive understanding, improved retention, and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) promotes integration, as does the academic medicine literature. However, despite work towards integration in medical education for over 60 years, transformational change has not occurred. The University of Southern California School of Pharmacy offers an annual summ er course for international students which focuses on clinical therapeutics. This application -based course delivers an integrated science and clinical ap proach for the management of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this session is to share this tested frame work for successful integration of clinical practice and foundational sciences. Methods: For many years, the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy has offered a residential summer course for international undergraduate pharmacy students. For the past two years, the course was redesigned to deliver a fully integrated science and clinical approach to a single disease state. In 2019 the progra m was delivered in an in -person format, while in 2020 it was adapted to a virtual environment in response to the Covid- 19 pandemic. The course coordinators chose to focus the content around type 2 diabetes based on its prevalence worldwide and the expertise of the instructors. In the first part of the course, diabetes pathophysiology, pharmacology, and therapy were discussed. In the second part of the course, the focus shifted towards drug -drug interactions which includes molecular docking, use of drug info rmation resources, and patient case exploration. There were two team -based projects to promote integration of concepts and transnational collaboration. The course was delivered with a focus on active learning with mini -lectures of 10 -15 minutes followed by facilitated small group discussions for another 10 -15 minutes. This pattern was repeated three times in each clinical or science session. The final hour of each day was spent working on projects in small groups. Response to the program was evaluated with student surveys. Student learning was assessed through performance on the two projects and a final quiz bowl session. Results: The course was well -received by students in both the in -person and virtual formats. Students were surveyed about their overall r esponse, course organization, assignments, project content, and group work and were scored using a 5- point Likert scale. All student respondents in both the in -person (n=15) and virtual (n=15) formats agreed that the program was of value to their education, and 97% of respondents agreed they would recommend the program to a friend. Student respo nses on working in teams were more mixed with 90.6% of all respondents(n=32) indicating that the group work was fun, enhanced learning, helped with practicing speaking English, and helped students to learn about working in teams. With regards to the integration of content, all participants in the virtual program (n=15) agreed that the science and clinical sessions were well -integrated and organized. Student learning w as assessed through performance during the quiz bowl session and on the group presentations . During the quiz bowl session, the average score for the 4 groups was 82% (range 77 -91%), indicating a good level of understanding. The groups projects were designed to assess achievement of learning objectives at Bloom's levels evaluate and create. The f inal products were assessed by faculty to have achieved these 294learning objectives. Examples of the group projects can be viewed on the program website at: https://sites.usc.edu/international summer program. 295Friday, 2/19/2021, 2:00 - 2:45 pm Curricular Exemplar Anti-Racism Training for Medical Education Leaders on a Trip to Alabama Ring, Jeffrey (1); Femi, Isoke (2); Lezak, Michael (2) (1) Independent Consultant; (2) Glide Memorial Church Description: The presenters have designed and twice implemented a 5- day trip to Alabama to study the through- line from slavery and racism to mass incarceration, health inequity, and environmental injustice. Participants were heal th care and medical education leaders who co llected intense and powerful stories and were deeply impacted by what they saw and heard and felt. This workshop will describe the journey, the educational and social objectives, and the voices of participants. Learners/Subjects of the Curriculum : Medical educators at all levels. Need/Rationale: It is imperative that medical learners are prepared to provide equitable, patient - centered, and respectful care to all patients. This has not always been the case as is reflected in the shameful health inequity da ta in the United States. Medical education as a field has great opportunity to grow curricula that teach anti- racism health care practices more effectively and to assist future practitioners in navigating their own biases, stereotypes and comfort zones. Th e question is to what degree medical school faculty are able to weave these core lessons into their teaching and to facilitate difficult and emotional conversations around race. Methods: GLIDE Memorial Church Center for Social Justice in San Francisco has organized and facilitated five- day journeys to Alabama in coordination with the University of Alabama Birmingham School of Medicine. The itinerary consists of tours, conversations and direct interactions toward an immersive understanding of the links betw een slavery, racism, health inequities, environmental injustice, and poverty. Participants are continually challenged to consider how the realities they are witnessing are relevant to their medical teaching in Sa n Francisco and how they intend to change how and what they teach. Results: Approximately forty faculty leaders have participated in the last two trips in 2019 and 2020. They report that the journey was life -changing and deeply impactful in both personal and professional ways. They report a variety of specific and intentional ways that participation in this program has changed how they teach and many have elected to continue to participate in ongoing study of racism and their roles in medical education leadership. 296Friday, 2/19/2021, 3:00 - 4:00 pm Poster Session 9: Quality Improvement, Patient and Community- Based Projects / Potpourri, Poster #102 Qualitative Analysis of the Worldwide Chiropractic Education Response to COVID -19 in Early 2020 Johnson, Claire (1, 2); Green, Bart (1,2,3) (1) National University of Health Sciences; (2) Stanford Health Care; (3) Journal of Chiropractic Education Problem Statement: The purpose of this qualitative report is to describe actions by chiropractic programs during the early stages of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Rationale: The World Health Organization has recommended public health and disease control measures dur ing the COVID -19 pandemic. Higher education has been challenged to continue while keeping faculty and students safe. Health professio ns are navigating changes in both education and health care in the context of urgent and changing governmental restrictions and public health responses. Chiropractors are portal of entry practitioners and as part of the healthcare workforce, they collabora te with other providers to deliver the best care possible to their patients and the public. Therefore, during a pandemic si tuation, the continued training of these health professionals is essential. Currently, it is unknown how chiropractic programs have been responding at this time of physical distancing and stay at home orders. Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative repo rt is to describe actions by chiropractic programs during the early stages of the COVID -19 pandemic. Methods: This is a qualitative, narrative research analysis using chronological, story- oriented reporting to examine chiropractic program response during the COVID -19 pandemic. This was a self -descriptive, retrospective report and not an experimental study. Chiropractic education progra ms were identified worldwide and email invitations were sent to administrators. Each participant was asked to provide descriptions for February through May 2020 and not to include future plans. Responses were collected and collated into a summary report. Themes were collated and organized into a list. They were asked to answer 3 open- ended questions with word limitations. 1) What public health, governmental, or other regulations have influenced how your education program has responded to the COVID -19 pandem ic? 2) Provide a brief synopsis of the problems due to COVID you faced and the actions that your program has taken in respo nse to COVID- 19, between February 2020 to May 2020. 3) What 1 lesson, learning moment, or takeaway point would you like to share rega rding education and your chiropractic program response during COVID -19? Results: Of 48 programs invited, there was a 77% r esponse rate and representation from 16 countries. Observed themes from the responses included in this study were: 1. Quick response to local public health and governmental regulations 2. Keep students, faculty, staff, patients safe 3. Heightened communication frequency and depth 4. Faculty and administration work extra to provide seamless learning environments 5. Students engaged and supportive 6. Team contributions, including learning center and IT staff 7. Creativity to address clinical learning and developing skills 8. Increased application, value for technology and online learning platforms There were similarities across the programs. There was quick uptake of online education showing it was viable to deliver content for some subjects. Although technol ogy was important, the human factor was the primary driver in success. Without willing faculty and staff, there would have been no application or uptake of these learning platforms. Students were the champions. It may be that some students have been yearning for this type of education, so they quickly embraced it when it finally arrived. The students were supportive to the shifts in the education environment, which contributed to their success. Faculty and staff were responsive and resilient. Keeping all participants (faculty, staff, students, patients) aware of the frequent changes and restrictions seemed to help establish a calm and reassuring environment. 297Potential Impact : Throughout the world, chiropractic faculty demonstrated skills of distance teachi ng and assessment methods. Students demonstrated they could take online courses and learned how to implement telehealth. The ca mpuses learned how to pivot quickly to respond to their internal and external constituents.

Need/Rationale: In the United States, nearly half of al l pregnancies are unplanned and a third are within 18 months of a prior pregnancy (3). In our clinic, we have noted multiple patients who have become pregnant prior to postpartum visit. Though the exact number is yet to be determined, it is important to educate our patients about short interval pregnancies. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \"Best Practice\" care guidelines recommend discussion of family planning and contraception during pregnancy to avoid short interval pregnancies, thereby decreasing their risk of adverse outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality (ie. ICU admission, need for transfusion), fetal mortality, IUGR, spontaneous and indicated preterm delivery. Additionally, we aim to implement Level 1B recommendation of avoiding intervals &lt;6 mos between pregnancies. Aside from the medical complications, there are also emotional, psychological, financial risks and burdens associated with short interval pregnancy. Methods: Inpatient, we will the assess barriers to early implementation of postpartum contraception by making inquiries into feasibility of prescription of OCPs or placement of depo provera at time of discharge from the hospital following delivery. We will also stand ardize inquiry regarding postpartum contraception in OB triage admission intake and postpartum documentation. To improve our approach outpatient, we intend on educating and advising our clinic patients through multiple stages of pregnancy: In the prenatal period, we will use multiple approaches to improve education on family planning in both providers and patients. Besides providing providers with education on techniques for discussing and prescribing postpartum contraception, we also made changes to the EM R's prenatal visit template to include prompts to discuss contraception with patients earlier in pregnancy. Furthermore, we will host group classes on family planning (following Tuesday OB clinic). Postpartum, many women do not discuss family planning and contraception until their 6 week postpar tum check. In this period, many become pregnant again, resulting in short interval pregnancies. To move up the timeframe of this discussion, we are implementing a \"contraception checkup\" visit for new mothers at the time of their baby's first newborn check. Additionally, we adjusted the EMR templates to include incorporation of mother's birth control as part of the prompts for well child checks up to the 12 month visit. Evaluation Plan: Our first step to evaluate is to assess the rate/number of short inter val pregnancies by pooling data from women who have opened OB modules (thus including all pregnancies regardless of whether they had vaginal deliveries by Family Care Specialists providers, as some end in miscarriages, C-sections by other providers, or del iveries in other hospitals). We started collecting this data in 7/2020. Will began implementation of this intervention 9/2020 and plan to reassess data at the end of 3/2021. With implementation of this in tervention, our goal is to see an increase of at lea st 10% in women choosing and obtaining birth control in postpartum period as well as a potential reduction in short interval pregnancy by the time the next data reassessment is completed in 6/2020. To assess the efficacy of these interventions within our c linic even further, we also plan to survey patients before and after delivery. We will collect data on which modes of contraception they were interested in before and after delivery as well as what method s of contraception they were aware of/potentially trying prior to becoming pregnant. Potential Impact : Through this initiative, we hope to empower women in underserved communities with more knowledge and choices regarding their reproductive futures. Many women lack the knowledge or access to navigate this area of healthcare, and short interval pregnancies have deleterious effects on their physical health as well as their emotional wellbeing. 299References: 1) Gemmill A, Lindberg LD.

Gamez, Jorge; Flores, Hector Adventist Health White Memorial Medical Center Idea: Create physician awareness of financi al barriers by studying the impact insurance copayments may have on Diabetes Mellitus patient's HgbA1c. Need/Rationale: A large Canadian study involving 27,090 patients determined that household income was strongly and independently associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus prevalence (1). Particularly they found that the prevalence of Dia betes increased as income decreased (1). Another study, with U.S. adult patients (18 years and older), demonstrated that as copayment amounts increased the discontinuation rate for oral diabetic medications increased (2). As the debate for universal health care and \"Medicare For All\" is ongoing in the national spotlight, no study to date has looked on the effect that copayments may have on the control of a Diabetic's HgbA1c . By analyzing the effect of copayments in our clinic's Diabetic patients, we will be able to further educate the Family Medicine Residents that practice in our clinic; adding a deeper understanding on another factor diabetic patients may face. Methods: D iabetic patients that were seen in our clinic between January 2019 and December 2019 will be broken into 2 groups: Copayment and No -Copayment. We will define control of Diabetes as HgbA1c of less than 7. Each population will be directly compared to each other with the primary measure to determine the percentage of patient's controlled in ea ch group. A planned secondary measure, the number of times HgbA1c was measured, will also be analyzed. After data analysis has been done, a PowerPoint will be created wit h the findings and presented to the Family Medicine Residents and Staff during their curriculum time. Prior to the presentation, a small survey will be completed asking the attendees' perception of copayments and diabetic patients. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: Findings of our analysis will be compiled and presented regardless of relationship in our primary and secondary measures. 2) Reaction and Learning: A survey after the presentation will be completed by the Family Medicine Residents/Staff to assess their thoughts on the data presented and what they learned from the data and presentation of our diabetic patients in our Family Medicine clinic. 4) Behavior: The post -presentation survey will also ask attendees what they might do different when talking to and treating our diabetic patients. Potential Impact : Clinician s may better understand how paying for healthcare may affect diabetic patients. Furthermore, the findings can be extrapolated to inform all clinicians, insurance companies, and politician s on how cost affects healthcare.

Need/Rationale: Resident physicians at LAC+USC participate in the clinic of Gynecology Oncology where one of the main tasks is to learn to perform thorough and complete \"no evidence of dise ase\" (NED) exams to assess r ecurrence status of cancer patients in remission. These exams are complex and entail several aspects of patient care, not limited to cancer surveillance, that can impact overall patient well -being. Assessment of medical problems such as radiation side effects, supplementation of cancer preventing vaccinations, and ensuring satisfactory sexual function and quality of life are only a few examples not directly related to cancer surveillance. It is of paramount importance that these exams be consistently documented to reflect the complexity of the visit, especially given that many patients have multiple complex medical issues and do not have other primary care providers. However, there is often variability between providers both in documentation and components i ncluded in the visit. Methods: An initial chart review will take place to assess the completeness of resident documentation based on a standard of care check -list prior to the resident led education intervention. The reviewed notes will be assigned a weighted score based on the number of components of the history and physical exam that are addressed. After the resident education initiative takes place, a random sample of charts will again be assessed and evaluated for a weighted score and co mpared to the scores obtained prior to the intervention. Additionally, a survey will be administered to the residents before and after the presentation to assess subjective comfort, confidence, and ability/knowledge in performing these exams. Evaluation Plan: The outcome assessed will be the difference between the pre and post -intervention objective documentation scores. The pre and post-intervention documentation scores will be compared using a Student T -test. The resident survey results will be analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test. Potential Impact : This intervention will allow for a standardized surveillance exam with improved consistency of care between providers in the LAC+USC gynecology oncology clinic with increased attention to patient psychosocial needs. This protocol could also be generalized to other gynecology oncology clinics for further standardization of care. References: 1) Zakhour M, Li AJ, Walsh CS, Cass I, Karlan BY, Rimel BJ.

Need/Rationale: A patient's level of health literacy is variable and it can be difficult to accurately remember an d organize new medical information presented in an appointment or counseling session. (1) Often, paper handouts are common educational resources provided to patients in outpatient psychiatric clinics. However, most resources are in English, which may not b e inclusive to all patient demographics. The utilization of QR codes can prove to be a nuanced method to improve patient health literacy. Research indicates that QR codes are generally well -received but are rarely utilized for patient education. (2) Inclus ively providing psychiatric p atient health educational content for non -English speakers and/or individuals with impaired vision can prove useful in attaining optimal patient health literacy and health outcomes. Methods: Following QIRB approval, study stan dardized binders with laminated QR coded sheets dedicated to different psychiatric disease states (such as common child psychiatry disorders, adult psychiatry disorders, geriatric psychiatric disorders, and common neurological disorders) will be created and distributed to outpatient p sychiatric clinics and their providers. This nuanced resource will be offered to patients during their appointments or therapy sessions. With any smartphone camera, patients will scan these QR codes and retrieve accurate and im portant health information on several disease states or diagnoses from provider approved resources and websites. Once scanned, the QR codes will open up to internet -based educational materials with the option of either English or Spanish, as well as, large-text options for visually- impaired individuals. Once retrieved, patients will have continued access to any information linked to previously scanned QR codes. Evaluation Plan: Our goal is to improve outpatient psychiatric patient access to and utilization of health information by at least 20% in 6 months. This will be achieved by creating QR codes linked to internet - based educational materials for common psychiatric disease states that patients will be able to have continued access to from any l ocation. Initially, pre- implementation s urveys will be administered to current psychiatry providers regarding opinions on current patient access and utilization of educational materials. After 6 months, providers will be surveyed again regarding perceived improvements in patient access to educational information and the overall role of QR codes in the clinic. The pre - and post - implementation study -created survey data will be assessed in order to gather physician and patient feedback. Based on feedback from providers, changes will be implemented in the next cycle of implementation. Potential Impact : This quality improvement project is particularly unique given its goal of increasing access for primarily Spanish- speaking patients and the visually impaired. Fu rthermore, such innovative and sustainable solutions may also serve to close the health literacy gap and increase patient agency in underserved populations.

BMC Medical Education 2019; 19: 2/19/2021, - 4:00 pm Poster Session 9: Quality Improvement , Patient and Community- Based Projects / Potpourri, Poster #107 Adapting Youth Education Modules in the Age Matt; McFarland, Amy University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine Problem Statement : Due to COVID- 19 we aim to adapt a substance abuse module into an effective virtual learning experience for Northern Nevada high schools. Rationale: A Healthier Nevada: Youth Education Modules is a medical student committee at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine that creates and delivers presentations c entered around current public health issues affecting Washoe County School District ( WCSD). During the 2019 -2020 school year we presented an Addiction and Substance Abuse Module to 682 high school students. One of the main goals of the presentation was to discuss the opioid epidemic and educate students on the use of NARCAN\u00ae. Prescription drug misuse continues to be a common issue in WCSD given that in 2019 17.6% of high school students reported taking prescription pain medication without a prescription (1). Since schools in WCSD have closed their doors to guest presenters, we aim to adapt our current module for online delivery to be presented in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters to uphold our commitment to our community. The efficacy of online vs in -person education will be compared to data collected in 2019 -202. Methods: The Addiction a nd Substance Abuse module was developed after review of public health data collected from the Nevada CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) assessment (1). This module adhered to the health education objectives outlined in the Nevada Revised Statutes with a n additional focus in response to the opioid epidemic. Medical students directly taught in the classroom setting for 1 -2 hours. Classes were encouraged to participate with question and answer sessions, interactive activities, and group discussion. Students who participated completed a pre - and post -test survey using the Likert scale scoring system. All materials were approved by the WCSD and the University of Nevada, Reno IRB. Adaptations to this module in the future will include the use of a virtual presen tation of the same material with interactive tools such as polls, breakout rooms, anonymous questions, and emoticons for feedback. We will maintain the survey we administered last year, and add additional questions that measure student satisfaction with th e online module. Results: During the 2019 -2020 school year the Addiction and Substance Abuse module was presented at three separate schools in Washoe County School District (WCSD), and 682 students completed a survey pertaining to the module goals. One of the main goals of this module was to teach students about NARCAN\u00ae use for opioid overdose. Prior to the module the average Likert scale response to \"How would you r ate your current awareness and understanding of Naloxone (\"Narcan\")?\" was a 2.35 (2 = \"poor\" and 3 = \"average\"). After the presentation, the average response was a 4.15 (4 = \"good\" and 5 = \"great\"). This resulted in an overall 75.6% increase in knowledge. Other survey questions saw a similar response. When asked \"How would you rate your current awareness and understanding of the opioid epidemic currently facing the United States?\" the response average went from a 3.02 to a 4.11, which was a 36.1% increase. We aim to maintain the efficacy of our Addiction and Substance Abuse module by adapting interactive aspects of our module for online delivery as outlined above. We will measure the efficacy of the module by presenting the same survey. We will also measure student satisfaction to access if online modules should be considered after the end of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Potential Impact : There are limited studies evaluating the efficacy of virtual adolescent education, particularly for health (2). This online module will strive to reach similar or greater efficacy than the in - person module taught prior. Ideally, the design of an online module will also enhance accessibility of the curriculum to other school districts. 304References: 1) Anderson, M., Diedrick, M., Lensch, T., Zhang, F., Peek, J., Clements -Nolle, K., Yang, W.

Need/Rationale: In urban areas within the United States, research demonstrates that postpartum women are at a far higher risk for social and environ mental isolation than those that live in more affluent regions. In part of this trend is the s imple fact that postpartum support groups are not as widely accessible within these densely populated, urban areas. It is during this critical postpartum period in which a sense of community and connection to others is of the utmost importance, as changes and adjustments in social identity challenge the normalization of the motherhood experience (Sawers, 2018). During the postpartum timeline, postpartum visits are routinely guideline -based, and screening for anxiety and mental distress may vary due to the fear of stigma surrounding a difficult transition into motherhood. It has been shown that community support plays an instrumental role into wellness, building relationships and provides a platform for reciprocal learning (Bina, 2008). Given such, we plan to implement a postpartum pilot program, led by medical providers in the East Los Angeles region, providing collaborative discussion and group dynamic exercise, aimed at ameliorating the risks involved with the transition into motherhood. Methods: The intervention will focus on postpartum mothers within our Family Care Specialist outpatient clinic, who have been identified and referred from their primary care provid ers. After a referral process, confirmation will be obtained and mothers will be directed to participate in weekly, scheduled appointments on- site at the Family Care Specialist clinic. The pilot program will include: 1) weekly didactic and support group meetings, aimed at peer- discussion and inter -collaboration with one another, as well as with a licensed clinical psychologist; 2) an informal outdoor group activity, incorporating a circuit-training \"mommy and me\" style program, focusing on cardiovascular he alth and whole-body conditioning, led by a lead resident physician, and incorporating the baby to enhance mother- baby bonding in the process. The groups will meet on a weekly basis for approximately two hours of total time. All mothers are encouraged to en gage in discussion and reflect on any social, psychological, medical or personal circumstances, feelings, or ideas during both the weekly didactic meetings, as well as during the informal group dynamic exercise program. Currently, the goal is to implement this pilot program in our outpatient clinic, for our own patients, with hopes of expanding in the future via other avenues to reach a wider postpartum population within the greater Los Angeles region. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We will track the integration of the Stroll and Roll pilot program in the Family Care Specialist clinic thr ough close monitoring of our referral system from both the residency and attending clinics, attendance at weekly didactic and group therapy sessions, monitoring of serial data collection (i.e., surveys where available). 2) Reaction: Weekly meetings will review key points from the prior week, and continue to build on necessary topics; assessment will continue weekly over the course of a 12 -month period in order to gauge initial perceptions, thoughts or topics of interest, and continue throughout the Stroll a nd Roll program. 3) Learning: paper questionnaires and surveys will assess the overall attitudes, perceptions, thought processes in order to help the medical staff directly engage in collaborative discussion; feedback and responses will also guide and direct the course of treatment and preparation throughout the 12 -month period. 4) Behavior: group discussion and surveying will be monitored via in -person review sessions of questionnaires and surveys with the aid of clinical staff to direct areas of social, p sychological, clinical or medical need. Potential Impact : In an effort to minimize the social, environmental and psychological risks associated with isolation, anxiet y and depression in our postpartum mothers, we must provide a platform that promotes wellness, enhances dialogue, and builds community; which can serve as a model for other programs seeking to support postpartum mothers in all urban areas. 306 References: 1) Sawers, M., and G.Wong. \"Pregnancy and Childbirth: Postpartum Anxiety (PPA) and Support for New Mothers.\"Journal of the Motherhood Initiative for Research and Community Involvement, vol. 9, no. 2, 2018, pp. 45 -59. 2) Bina R.

Need/Rationale: Effective patient -physician communication is a key component of clinical encounters and in delivery of healthcare in general [1]. Unfortunately, poor relationship building between the patient and the physician can lead to low patient satisfaction [2] and poor outcomes. Using visual aids is a simple, yet effective, tool to improve patient -physician communication during patient education opportunities [3]. Most physicians and educators do not have expertise or training in drawing yet are often faced with attempting to visually communicate a concept within a short timeframe. Medical illustrators, who are specifically trained to translate complex scientific information into easily understood images, can teach drawing techniques to improve visual confidence and vocabulary. The need is to teach medical students to use drawing during a patient encounter to improve the patient's understanding of topics relevant to their health. Methods: This proposed collaborative pro ject is aimed at integrating patient educati on into the teaching of pre -clerkship medical students as part of their Patient Centered Learning course. The students will encounter a knee pain case through standardized patients with an integrated patient education component. Two -part workshop will include: A) patient education/teaching and learning, and B) approaches to drawing during a patient education encounter. Four steps in the patent education process are 1. A needs assessment to help determine patients' learning abilities, readiness to learn and health literacy leading to individualized teaching. 2. Prioritizing patient questions. 3. Implementing teaching to include shared agenda and matching teaching aids to patient needs. 4. Evaluation of patient educa tion based on the \"teach -back\" method. In the second part, we will be teaching the following process when incorporating drawing into the patient education session: A) identifying the key aspects of a concept to communicate; B) recognizing the importance of context for a drawing; and C) applying draw ing techniques for additional clarity. We propose using different media based on availability to the students (piece of paper, printed template with outline of relevant anatomical structures, or 3D model). Evalu ation Plan: We will collect data from both students and SPs after the SP encounter. The survey was adapted from our medical center outpatient version of the Customer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). All CAHPS surveys have been approv ed by the CAHPS Consortium, which is o verseen by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Three questions related to use of visuals during the patient education encounter were added in the end of the study questionnaire. Three separate sessions will be run on consecutive days due to the large class size (near 200 students so about 60- 65 students a day). We propose to have different interventions on each day. All students will receive the workshop, but they will receive different materials for practic ing teaching their patients. On the first day, students will have a clean sheet of paper and a pen. Students on the second day will receive the printout template of knee anatomy and a pen, and then the students on the third day will receive the workshop an d a 3D model and a marker. All sessions will be recorded and transcribed for the analysis. We will analyze and report on differences between groups using different visual aids. Potential Impact : Students can become quickly frustrated with drawing as they feel their creations do not look \"right\" or that they cannot draw. With some guidance and practice, these barriers can be overcome, and students will be able to communicate successfully with a patient about complex topics using visuals which will lead to i mproved patient health outcomes. 308References: 1) Ha J, Longnecker N.

Rationale: IV cannulation is an important skill for the new doctor and is relevant to many specialities [1]. However, it often presents a significant challenge to several newly -qualified doctors and is an area in which many lack confidence. As a result, ex tra time is spent on multiple cannulation attempts, which presents a problem both in terms of patient experience and staff efficiency. We will take a quality improvement approach as this enables us to iterate small changes with frequent data collection and assessment s of the situation. In this way, we hope to be able to generate a significant benefit to students by repeating the process of small changes with repeated assessments as long as is required. We believe this is a useful approach to take to improvi ng cannulat ion specifically as it is a multi- factorial issue with both person- factors (e.g. confidence in seeking help with a difficult task) and system -factors (e.g. number of opportunities to practice with direct guidance). Methods: This project will ut ilise a quality improvement methodology. We aim to improve cannulation competence and confidence in fourth year medical students during their surgical block. Our measurement will be done using a questionnaire that will be sent to students several times dur ing and after their surgical block, and we will use the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) model of improvement to structure our approach toward achieving our aim.[2] Our planned test is the aforementioned questionnaire which covers the number of cannulation atte mpts undert aken by a student during a set time period, cannulation success rate, confidence levels, how these levels may have changed during the period and ideas for future improvement. We are currently gathering this data pre -intervention. We will then move onto the \"Do\" part of the PDSA cycle where we will implement our changes and gather further data. Following this we will move to the \"Study\" phase and assess our data and any improvement. After this is the \"Act\" part of the PDSA cycle where we will take action based on our results and our analysis in the \"study\" phase, deciding whether to adjust our interventions. Following this we will begin planning the next iteration of the cycle. Our changes will be informed by our initial data gathering but we have some ideas of what may be helpful to future students. They include: a video lesson, increased guidance during procedure practice and more hands -on experience. Results: Preliminary pre -intervention data shows that during a two week portion of the student's surgical block, mean IV cannulation success rates increased by approximately 62% and confidence increased by approximately 63%. On average (median), students only attempted to place two IV cannulas each during the two week period and seven students out of the total of 26 did not attempt to place any IV cannulas. The main themes raised when students were asked what would help improve IV cannulation in the future were: more opportunities to practice, opportunities to watch a doctor place IV cannulas before attempting cannulation themselves, more supervision during practice and asking ward doctors to prioritise students when IV cannulas need placing. We will continue to collect pre -intervention data and will then periodically collect data during and a fter our interventio n. We will use this information to ascertain what, if any, improvement has been made. Data will be collected using a questionnaire which will be sent out three times during each six week block. The number of individual participants, as well as the number o f questionnaire responses, will be recorded and compared to the number of students completing each block to ascertain response rate. We will then draw conclusions based on the data and plan for future improvements. Student feedback rega rding what would be helpful in better teaching cannulation will form part of planning interventions. 310Potential Impact : Improved IV cannulation skills will lead to more efficient doctors and better patient experiences. Moreover, if successful, this proje ct could exemplify t he valuable role the quality improvement methodology has to play in medical education.

Rationale : Neonatal hypoglycemia has potentially devastatin g neurologic consequences. Excessive testing/treatment of hypoglycemia is also not without risk. Using the Olsen growth chart instead of the WHO decreases the amount of hypoglycemia -related interventi on. The Olsen chart was created using over 257,000 demog raphically diverse infants in 33 states. Male and female intrauterine growth curves were created (as opposed to previous growth curves which were unisex). Using the Olsen growth chart to classify infa nts as small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) safely decreases the number of children evaluated for hypoglycemia. The purpose of our study was to decrease misclassification of infants into LGA and SGA categories, and in doing so decrease the number who experienced unnecessary and painful procedures, potentially decreasing anxiety associated with hypoglycemia testing, increase mother and child bonding and breastfeeding rates, and also decrease healthcare costs. Methods: Retrospective analysis from January 2017 to January 2020 at River side University Health System (RUHS) newborn nursery of all infants with a diagnosis of SGA, LGA, IDM and/or prematurity 35 - 36 weeks via the electronic medical record. Inclusion criteria include LGA, SGA, IDM, and/or prematurity 35-36 weeks. Exclusion criteria include diagnosed genetic condition, sepsis or transfer to the NICU for any reason outside of hypoglycemia. Results: Through the utilization of the Olsen Growth curve we found that misc lassification of the infants into SGA and LGA categories was redu ced. It was also demonstrated that isolated SGA or LGA infants without a concomitant diagnosis of Infant of a diabetic mother (IDM) or Prematurity do not need to be evaluated for hypoglycemia if they do not have any additional comorbidities or clinical sym ptoms. Out of the total number of infants with abnormal glucose values 25.4% were LGA, 22% were IDM, 20.3% were SGA, premature, 6.8% were both LGA and IDM, 1.7% were both premature and SGA, and 11.9% had abnormal glucose values with unclear etiology. Through the implementation of the Olsen Growth curve, we did not have any children that were treated for hypoglycemia that would have been labeled LGA/SGA on the WHO growth chart. We al so found that newborns with isolated SGA or LGA based on the Olsen chart (without any other risk factors for hypoglycemia) did not have hypoglycemia that required intervention. This includes no transfers to the NICU for hypoglycemia in patients with isolat ed SGA or LGA. Potential Impact : Use of the Olsen chart resulted in the reduction of infants undergoing unnecessary pokes without an increase in missed hypoglycemia. We found that infants with isolated SGA and LGA don't need any glucose checks. Our work adds to the growing body of research aimed at avoiding overtreatment and over testing for hypoglycemia in neonates. 312References: 1) Lower Traditional Treatment Threshold for Neonatal Hypoglycemia.

Nihan Session 9: Quality Improvement, P atient and Community- Based Projects / Potpourri, Poster #113 Increasing Adherence to Oseltami vir Prescribing Recommendations in a Emergency Department Baker, Matthew; Rosculet, Nicholas; Mody, Ameer Children's Hospital Los Angeles Problem Statement : The effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating influenza is controversial, while the clinical side effects and financial burden can be significant. Rationale: During the influenza season, providers in the ED often prescribe oseltamivir when influenza is suspected to any degree, frequently without a positive confirmatory influenza test (tests are usually costly and slow, resulting in delayed throughput). However, it is difficult to label this practice as evidence - based, given that studies on oseltamivir's impact on influenza symptoms and complications have been ambiguous and controversial. Two of the largest studies to date have shown only a modest decrease in symptom duration (by 17 and 29 hours) and no impact in terms of comp lications or hospitalization rates, other than a decreased rate of otitis media (1,2). In light of this questionable clinical significance of oseltamivir's impact in the outpatient setting, combined with the possibility of significant negative impacts of adverse clinical side effects and financial burden, this project sought to improve adherence to the CDC/AAP guidelines fo r oseltamivir prescriptions (3,4). Methods: This QI project utilized two interventions during the 2019 -2020 study period including educational sessions for target provider groups and an EMR pop -up. Educational sessions for providers included discussion of this project's purpose, the literature on oseltamivir, and the current CDC/AAP guidelines; a questionnaire on current knowledge of prescribing guidelines and personal prescribing habits was administered prior to the session. Also, a pop- up was integrated into the EMR utilized in the ED, set to trigger when prescribing oseltamivir, requiring providers to select the prescribing recommendati on criteria or provide additional reasoning. All 2018- 2019 data were collected via retrospective chart review; data from 2020 were collected prospectively. Numbers of oseltamivir prescriptions were determined by querying all prescriptions written for patients being discharged from the CHLA ED between January and March of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Diagnosis data were collected by querying all primary ICD diagnosis codes for patients seen in the CHLA ED during the same period. The influenza -related diagnoses (ICD -10 code based) included for analysis of patients that might be expected to qualify for oseltamivir prescriptions were determined by consensus opinion amongst the authors. The data were analyzed using R version 4.0.2 (Taking Off Again). For the manual chart review, encounters were selected by block randomization, with equal distribution across weeks and providers. Results: Total number of ED encounters 3174; 2019: 2924; 2020: 2886); however, March 2020 demonstrated a significant decrease in total ED encounters (including those with influenza -associated diagnoses). While the total number of oseltamivir prescriptions decreased by 12.3% in Jan- March 2020 compared with the same time period in 2019 and 2018, there was only a sli ght reduction in the percentage of encounters with an influenza -associated diagnosis where oseltamivir was prescribed (18.1% in 2018- 19 vs 16.7% in 2020). Data from the EMR pop -up demonstrated that the most commonly selected criteria for oseltamivir prescr ibing was symptoms being present for less than 48 hrs: (54.6%), followed by age less than 2 years old (29.7%) and histor y of severe, complicated and/or progressive disease (14.8%). Only 1 of 446 pop -up responses did not select any criteria for oseltamivir prescribing. On chart review of a randomly generated list of encounters with influenza -associated diagnosis, there was a decrease in percentage of encounters where oseltamivir was prescribed without meeting criteria (2019: 13.4% vs 2020: 3.8%). During Marc h 2020, at the onset of the Covid -19 pandemic, there was not only a dramatic decrease in overall ED encounters and encounters with influenza -associated diagnosis, but oseltamivir was prescribed for only 8.0% of encounters with influenza -associated diagnosi s, down from 17.7% during February 2020. 314Potential Impact : This project highlights that educational or technological interventions can increase adherence to treatment recommendations, allowing for higher quality patient care. However, the changes in prescribing rates correlated with the pandemic onset may indicate that the prescribing environment has the largest impact on provider prescribing habits.

Seraj, Siamak (2) (1) Touro University California; (2) San Joaquin General Hospital Problem Statement : Burnout and lack of joy at work among med ical residents can contribute to decreased individual engagement and compromise patient safety. Rationale: Burnout and lack of joy at work among medical residents can contribute to decreased individual engagement, satisfaction, as well as decreased qualit y of care and increased rates of medical errors. There is a new trend towards viewing burnout as a systemic rather than an individual issue. The Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has recently studied determinants of 'joy at work' rather than burn out. We utilized the framework presented by the IHI to assess the poten tial causes of burn out from the perspective of joy at work in Internal Medicine residents. Methods: We surveyed the residents of an Internal Medicine Residency program at a community -based hospital in 2019 using a questionnaire to study the association between 9 categories of Joy reported by IHI white -paper [1] with criteria for burnout in our residency program. The 9 categories of Joy are real - time measurement, wellness and resilience, daily improvement, camaraderie and teamwork, participative management , recognition and rewards, choice and autonomy, meaning and purpose, and physical and psychological safety. We developed 17 questionnaire items that are related to each of the 9 categories of joy in order to gauge which category affected burn out the most. The prevalence of burnout in our residents was measured by which residents said 'yes' to having any of the three criteria of burn out [2]. The three criteria of burnout in our study are Maslach's three dimensions of burnout: reduced accomplishment, depersonalization, and emotional exhaustion. Results: This residency program consists of 24 categorical and 3 preliminary residents. Twenty -one out of the 24 categorical residents responded to this survey. Ten residents out of 21 (48%) responded yes to at least one of the three criteria for being burnt out. Seven out of nine residents (77%) who were uncomfortable with voicing concerns to supervisors answered 'yes' to one of the burnout criteria questions (P=0.01). Five out of six (83%) who did not feel that they are treated with respect were also more potentially burnout (P=0.04). Six out of seven (85%) who did not feel that they have colleague support at work were more potentially burntout (P= 0.01). Potential Impact : This study examines potential factors leadin g to decreased physician joy at work. We showed that in our resident cohort lack of psychological safety, represented by the freedom to voice concerns and being treated with respect, and camaraderie, represented by having colleague support, were associated with a higher chance of burnout.

Need/Rationale: In addressing the role of EM in the future of the US health model, the Macy Foundation Report in 1994 stated: \"every medic al student must acquire the appropriate knowledge and skills to care for emergency patients\" [1]. The emergence of COVID -19 however has severely disrupted medical education efforts and required an extraordinary need to innovate from educators. The need to adequately prepare students in E M has never been more important as it is currently in the wake of a global pandemic. The Denver Health residency in EM has held a long record of providing outstanding student didactics. However, in order to overcome the limi tations of social distancing a n ovel and comprehensive EM experience needed to be designed. We achieved this through frequent, engaging, and resident -led online sessions. For improved effectiveness, we implemented a \"resident -as-teacher\" framework. As 'nea r-to-peer' teachers, residents a re well tuned- in to the educational needs and deficits of students [2]. Additionally, resident teachers have greater job satisfaction, enthusiasm for teaching, and improved wellness. Importantly, resident teaching opportunities improve resident communicati on skills, which in turn is associated with improved patient outcomes [3]. Methods: The initial cohort of virtual students included 21 fourth -year EM bound medical students. Students were invited to participate in the resid ent-led didactic program while o n their EM sub- internships. During two 4- week blocks, there were 10 didactic lectures, 5 lectures per day, lasting 45 minutes each. Prior to the first session, the clerkship director hosted an orientation for EM resident lecturers. During the orientation, the clerkship director suggested various presentation formats, gave a sample virtual lecture and referenced data from evaluations from past sessions. Virtual lecturers chose from the following 10 core topics in emergency med icine: Abdominal Pain; Altered EM; Toxicology; Trauma. Creativity in lecture development was encouraged. A case bank was made available to resident volunteers for use in lecture development. While all on Zoom, presentation formats ranged from PowerPoint to screen -sharing individual ECGs or radiography studies pertaining to the hypothetical cases. Some lectures took the same format as EM oral boards; students were encourag ed to ask for the patient's history, vitals, and physical examination. Student participation with independent interpretation was encouraged. The above methods were applied as a pilot; in the future, we plan to expand the curriculum to all rotating medical students, up to 16 students per block for 7 blocks. Evaluation Plan: An online evaluation was disseminated to the virtual didactic students following each of the ten lectures per block. Students were asked to anonymously rate, using a 1 -5 Likert scale, the resident's knowledge of the chosen topic, relevance/applicability of the content and lecture delivery. There were also two free -text boxes for students to comment on what went well during the sessions and ways to improve. The evaluation in its current fo rm limits our ability to gauge the students' confidence and clinical competence. We will implement a new evaluation process for students for future cohorts that assesses both confidence and knowledge in the ten chosen clinical concepts in a pre and post - assessment. We will then explore the future potential impact of the virtual curriculum on the resident lecturers. Also using pre and post -evaluation forms, we will assess their confidence with educating on a virtual platform, their confidence in the clinical subject matter they have prep ared, and their enthusiasm to participate in the program in the future. Potential Impact : During these uncertain times the wide -spread adoption of virtual teaching will certainly give rise to a 'new -normal' in education. At the Denver Health residency in EM we look forward to the future and building upon a curriculum which advances the foundational knowledge and skills of our students and supports the development of our residents. 317 References: 1) Macy J Jr. The role of emergency medicine in the future of Amer ican medical care.

Rationale: Implicit bias may contribute to health care disparities by influencing physicia n behavior resulting in differences in medical treatment along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender or other characteristics. Unconscious bias also adversely affects faculty recruitment and promo tion and correlates with the persistent underrepresentation o f African Americans and other minorities in medicine (UiM) which further exacerbates racial health care disparities. Unconscious bias has been shown to be malleable and correctable with training. Consequently, strategies to combat unconscious bias are needed in medical education. The objective of this study was to determine if an educational workshop on unconscious bias can increase awareness, perceptions, and knowledge regarding unconscious bias. Methods: From April 2019 -June 2020, 90 -minute educational w orkshops attended by students, residents and faculty; included 1) pre -intervention surveys; 2) interactive unconscious bias presentation; 3) were shown images of 5 individuals and recorded first impressions regarding trustworthiness and likely profession; 4) video using vignettes to demonstrate the impact of unconscious bias in the workplace including strategies to counter unconscious biases; 5) reflective group discussions and 6) post - interventio n surveys. Statistical analysis was performed as indicated. IRB approval was obtained. Results: The surveys were completed by 103 participants which showed significant increases from the pre to the post- intervention assessments for perception scores ( 28. 87 [SEM= versus 32.73 versus 7.22 [0.157], p<0.001). For a white male physician community advocate covered in tattoos; only 2% correctly identified him as a physician, and 60% felt he was untrustworthy. For a smiling African American woman astronaut, only 13% correctly identified her as an astronaut. Of a brooding white male serial killer, 50% found him trustworthy. Potential Impact : An interactive unconscious bias workshop can increase awareness , perceptions, and knowledge in the immediate short term as a n initial step in developing an inclusive learning environment. The findings also confirmed inaccurate first impression stereotypical assumptions based on ethnicity; outward appearances, couture, and media influences.

Rationale: The ACGME states: \"The program, in partnership with its Sponsoring Institution, must engage in practices that focus on mission -driven, ongoing, systematic recruitment and retention of a diverse and inclusive workfor ce of residents, fellows, faculty members, senior administrative staff members, and other relevant members of its academic community.\" Recruiting/retaining physicians of diverse backgrounds is an important strategy to reduce health care disparities. Having a workforce with knowledge, attitudes and beliefs which reflect our patients' backgrounds will e nable physicians to respond and deliver care more effectively. Data also shows that underrepresented minority physicians are more likely to practice primary ca re and work in underserved communities, further decreasing health care disparities by improving t he access and quality of care. Other benefits include improved learning experiences and research due to exposure to diverse perspectives and improved cultural proficiency. Methods: In May 2019, the UC Irvine School of Medicine hosted its first annual \"Res idency Open House,\" inviting 3rd -year medical students from AOA - and LCME- accredited institutions. Participants included the Dean, Associate Vice Chancellor of Diversity and Inclusion, Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education, Residency Program Direct ors and residents. The full- day in- person event included presentations by school leaders, a tour of the facilities, mock interviews, and two -panel discussions with the program directors and residents. Travel stipends were rewarded to selected applicants. I n July 2019, the UC Irvine Resident and Fellow Scholars Academy was established to increase UCI School of Medicine faculty diversity through the retention of u nderrepresented residents and fellows post- graduation. The academy includes a mentorship program (2 mentors:1 mentee ratio), career guidance, activities to promote a sense of community, small group training sessions and stipends to support quality improvem ent projects focused on health care disparities. Results: 2019 Residency Open House: In May 2019, 61 3rd- year medical students attended our in - person conference, representing 30 medical schools (60% female, 38% male, 2% American, American Indian, 2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). 100% strongly agreed with the statement: \"This event has positively affected my interest in applying for residency at UC Irvine.\" 85% applied to UC Irvine residency program, 45% were interviewed by a UCI residency program and 5% matched to a UCI residency program. 2020 Residency Open House: In August 2020, we held our 2nd virtual residency open house, reaching a larger audience with 166 4th- year medical students, rep resenting 92 medical schools (69% female, 31% 94% strongly agreed with the statement: \"This event has positively affected my interest in applying for residency a t UC Irvine.\" Interview and match results are pending. Residents and Fellows Scholars Academy: 19 trainees participated in 2019- 2020. Of the 7 of the trainees who graduated in June 2020 and participated in this program during its inaugural year: 2 were hired as faculty and 1 is staying for a non -ACGME fellowship. 20 trainees will be participating in 2020- 2021. Potential Impact : The UCI Residency Open House effectively led to candidates' sustained or increased interest in UCI and application to UCI residency programs. The UCI Resident and Fellow Scholars Academy successfully retained resident and fellow graduates from diverse backgrounds as UCI faculty. 320References: 1) Wusu M, Tepperberg S, Weinberg J, Saper R.

Need/Rationale: Recent estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 demonstrate that the nation has cont inued to age, with the 65 -and-older population rising by over a third during the past decade. This rapid increase in the older adult population necessitates an increa se in health professionals who carry a well-rounded understanding of the multifaceted soci al and medical challenges that accompany aging. However, recent surveys indicate that medical student attitudes toward older adults, an important predictor of the qua lity of care and likelihood that students enter geriatrics, decline throughout medical school. Additionally, factors contributing to medical students' lack of geriatric training interests included: chronicity and complexity of disease, fears that patients were non -adherent, and lack of clinical exposure to the field and population. With this in mind, our medical school developed a friendly caller program that linked medical students to older adults through weekly phone calls. This program served as a rare opportunity to examine the role of pre -clinical geriatric educational experience for first -year medical students to increase their professional development and geriatric care exposure and competency. Methods: Participants include first -year medical students who enrolled in the Age -Friendly Student Senior Connection (AFSSC). Students were recrui ted using an interest form that was emailed to the class listserv. Upon registering for the program, students were required to watch a geriatric training video and complete a pre -survey. This survey included a series of questions surveying student's level of comfort, knowledge, and expertise in working with adults ages 65 years and older, as well as the likelihood they anticipated working with this population in their future career. They were subsequently paired with an older adult aged 65 or older and engaged in weekly phone calls over the course of 6 weeks. Students were instructed to call for approximately 30 minutes, 3 -4 times a week, and adjustments were made on an individual basis to best accommodate their older adults' schedules. Students also participated in weekly debrief sessions composed of 5- 6 other students, led by a randomly assigned interprofessional health faculty member. Faculty members helped facilitate discussions about students' encounters and provide support and resources for any emergent situations. Students were also provided a resource page with educational resources to provide their seniors, as well as a list of on -call faculty should any emergent concerns arise. After completion of the 6 -week program, students were guided on how to bring closure to the relationship and completed a post -survey. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: Students' attendance to weekly debrief sessions with faculty members and interactions with their seniors will be monitored to ensure students are meeting program requirements. Reaction: Students' reflections will be documented by faculty members during debrief sessions, and further recorded in the required pre and p ost-survey interventions. Learning: Overall changes in students' attitudes, as well as professional and geriatric care competency skills, will be assessed through a mixed- methods design. Comparison of the pre and post -survey data will provide both quantitative and qualitative data. Thematic analysis of notes from weekly debrief sessions will provide further qualitative data. In particular, for the qualitative data, a deductive approach will be utilized to explore themes related to levels of professional ski lls and geriatric care competency. Behavior: Medical students', whose clinical activities were place d on hold due to COVID -19, were paired with older adults and engaged in weekly, longitudinal conversations. Potential Impact : It is critical for medical st udents to develop geriatric care competency skills necessary to better address the psychosocial and medical needs of the aging U.S. population. The AFFSC program provides a novel model for other institutions hoping to provide their medical students with co re competency geriatric skills through service -learning. 322 References: 1) Jordan, J. 65 and Older Popula tion Grows Rapidly as Baby Boomers Age.

However, this practice exacerbates the financial inequities between those who can afford these services and those who are already struggling with the costs incurred from the MCAT, applications, and more (Youngclaus and Roskovensky, 2018). We believe that the medical school admissions proce ss should be based on applicants' merits, character, and passion for medicine, not on their monetary wealth or pre- existing connections. \"Giving a Boost\" was founded by students in February 2020 at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to address this issue by providing free application consulting services to medical school applicants in Pittsburgh and th e surrounding region with a focus on supporting those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or underrepresented minorities. Methods: Medical student volunteers for \"Giving a Boost\" were recruited from all classes at Pitt Med starting in April 2020. Several outlets, such as email and social media, were used to recruit medical students. Applicants from 9 universities in the greater Pittsb urgh area were contacted via pre -med offices, department advisors, masters programs, pre -health student organizations, and social media. Applicants were also informed through a partnership with the Minority Association of Pre -Medical Students programs from Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia. A total of 65 student volunteers were recruited to support 9 7 applicants for our summer essay program. Background information was gathered from each volunteer and applicant on their academic interests, extracurri culars, research involvement, and unique life circumstances. Our aim was to create pairings of similar b ackgrounds such that the medical student could provide support through shared experiences (e.g. reapplicants, nontraditional, under -represented, MD/PhD). Throughout the summer, volunteers were asked to document and inform us of their work to ensure that they provided prompt feedback on each essay. Minor incidents (e.g. lack of response, time commitment issues) were handled on a case -by-case basis. After t he summer, we asked applicants to rate their experiences. We have also expanded our efforts this fall to support more applicants and to offer mock interviews in preparation of upcoming medical school interviews. Evaluation Plan: At the end of the 2020 sum mer, all applicants were surveyed about their experience with the program. They were asked to rate the u sefulness of \"Giving a Boost\" and other resources, such as pre- health advising programs, undergraduate student organizations, friends, and faculty membe rs, on a scale of 1 to 10. Across 72 responses, the average rating applicants gave \"Giving a Boost\" was an 8.68, compared to pre -health advising programs, undergraduate student organizations, faculty members, and friends with ratings of 4.11, 5.25, 6.00, and 7.60, respectively. Our rating was significantly (p &lt;&lt; 0.01) higher than all other categories surveyed. This demonstrates the beneficial impact of our program and highlights the need for such a program to exist at other medical schools to support underprivileged medical school applicants. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our program, we w ill be sending out an additional survey at the end of the 2020 -2021 application cycle to gauge applicant medical school acceptance rates and their specific accepted schools. The aim is to show a higher acceptance rate compared to the national average of ap proximately 41% (AAMC, 2019); we will further stratify this data with medical school rankings to show whether our applicants are also accepted into scho ols with lower acceptance rates. 324Potential Impact : For students who do not have the financial means t o utilize an application service or for those who are the first family member to pursue a medical education, this program helps to reduce disparities based solely on socioeconomic status or familiarity with the process. In this way, diversity and inclusivi ty in the medical field are enhanced. References: 1) Youngclaus, J., & Roskovensky, L. (2018). An updated look at the economic diversity of US medical students.

Rationale: The US healthcare system has struggled to address the rising opioid epidemic. A 5 -fold increase in heroin -related deaths was seen from 2010 -2016 with an increase of 20% from 2015 -2016 alone. Education of medical students about opioid use disorder (OUD) is imperative given 80% of heroin users stated their addiction began with the use of prescription opioids and OUD affects patients in all fields of medicine. Greater emphasi s has been placed on incorporating ethics, safe prescribing practices of opioids, harm reduction techniques, and pain management into medical school. However, there are few curricula designed to address social determinants of health and their impact on pat ient outcomes in OUD. A novel elective course was developed for seco nd-year medical students at a Midwestern tertiary care academic medical center. The curriculum focused on real -world identification of OUD and how social determinants of health influence m anagement and outcomes of these individuals. Methods: The course wa s administered over two half days (4 hours/day) as an elective for second -year medical students. The first day consisted of multidisciplinary guest speaker presentations followed by additional didactics on the second day and student teach -backs. Initial day instruction highlighted real - world identification of opioid use disorder and described how social determinants of health influenced management of these patients. During the teach -back sessions, students selected articles to emphasize the importance of un derstanding how opioid use disorder may be encountered across a wide array of medical specialties. To characterize the impact of the course for learners, a pre -course and post -course survey was developed and administered. The survey was designed to evaluat e students' knowledge and self-reported competency (1=novice; 5=expert) related to OUD and social determinants of health. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained to conduct the st udy and secondary analysis of the data was performed. A series of pa ired samples t -tests were conducted to assess differences in student knowledge and self- reported competency before and after the course. Students also provided written feedback about the c ourse content and instruction techniques. Results: A total of 56 students enrolled and successfully completed the two- day elective course in 2019 and 2020 with 30 students completing the course in 2019 and 26 students enrolled in the course for 2020. In 2019, students demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in knowledge from pre- to post-course with regards to both cumulative (pre -course: 69%, post -course: 85%, t(21)=5.434, -course: 86%, t(21)=6.385, p&lt;.05). Students also displayed a statistically sign ificant improvement in their social determinants of health competency following the course (pre -course: 2.95, post -course 3.44, t(20)=4.489, p&lt;.05). Subjective written responses from st udents were collectively positive, and the content was well received . Data for the 2020 elective offerings was collected in late September and early October with analysis pending. Potential Impact : Early exposure to curricula addressing opioid use disorde r and social determinants of health empowers students to identify and address the clinical needs of patients with substance use disorders and fosters an understanding of the inherent psychosocial challenges these patients face. 326References: 1) Muzyk A, Substance use disorder education in medical schools: a scoping review.

Rationale: The LGBT+ community of people is underserved, especially in healthcare. Trans and gender non-conforming people in particular are at increased risk of lifetime violent treatment, risky sexual behavior, suicide, and substance abuse (ref 1). Sadly , many transgender people experience further victimization through medical care, or the refusal thereof. Due to negative past experiences, patients may be unwilling to seek care altogether. Proper gender- affirming, inclusive medical care can greatly improv e quality of life for these patients, and has a notably positive impact on mental health (ref 2.). Therefore we believe LGBT+ inclusive medicine should be incorporated throughout medical education, with a strong emphasis within primary care settings. Ideal ly all family medicine providers should have access to training to become competent in the principles and practice of the basic treatment of gender dysphoria to properly serve our communities (ref 3). Initiating and monitoring GAHT is well within our scope of practice and makes a huge difference in the lives of transgender patients. Methods: In creating our family medicine residency program's LGBT medicine curriculum, we have developed a weekly gender -affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) clinic in which all re sidents rotate through. The main goals of this rotation are for residents to: 1. learn proper terminology and interview questions which are sensitive to the diverse identities and needs of patients in a GAHT clinic; 2. learn the basics of the proper initiation, titration and maintenance of gender -affirming hormone therapy, and 3. gain exposure to the process of referring patients who desire gender -affirming surgeries. In this clinic, we learn how to provide culturally -sensitive care to tra nsgender patients. Residents care for patients who identify as male -to-female, female -to- male, and non -binary or otherwise gender non -conforming identities who desire gender -affirming medical care. We see patients in any and all points of the transition process. Our GAHT c linic acts also as a bridge to connect our transgender patients to a safe patient -centered medical home that can address their other primary care and preventative health needs under one roof. Areas of future growth: -Expanding list of pro viders for gender -affirming surgeries and establishing rotations to provide direct exposure to gender- affirming surgical care - Locating providers specialized in providing fertility treatment for transgender patients -Incorporate gender affirming care for transgender youth a nd offering puberty - blocking treatment Evaluation Plan: The data we are collecting to evaluate the effectiveness of this project will come from patients and residents. Data collected from clinic patients includes race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, prior experiences seeking care, knowledge of GAHT, feelings regarding the medical system, presence of co-morbid health issues, and satisfaction with care provided at our clinic. We also survey established patients after each visit regarding their care satisfa ction and feedback regarding improvements, for the clinic itself and/or the resident physician who cared for them. So far, the narrative feedback from patients is largely supportive, and we have been seeing an increase in weekly clinic at tendance. We antic ipate that through positive word -of- mouth and continued partnerships with community organizations, this growth will continue. The surveys from residents who rotate through the GAHT clinic are in the early stages of collection. We anticip ate residents will see an objective increase in their knowledge, comfort, and interest in transgender care. Our hope is that through integrating GAHT training within our residency program curriculum, our graduates will be more likely to continue to provide this type of care in their future practice. 328Potential Impact : We hope that our project will help other educators to understand the value and benefits of integrating GAHT services into a primary care residency program. Attendees should be able to adapt strategies to develop a GAHT clinic at the their home institution or integrate transgender care within their residency program's curriculum. References: 1) Grant, J.

Need/Rationale: The underrepresentation of skin of color (SoC) in dermatology and the greater field of medical education is not of novel realization. For decades, it has been known that skin of color is severely lacking in medica l literature. In fact, clinical images depicting SoC, defined as Fitzpatrick t ypes III-VI, encompass 4.5 to 25% of the clinical images displayed in major dermatology and other influential medical textbooks, including the predominant USMLE licensing exam pr eparatory materials (Jones, Adelekun). Thus, medical students must turn to oth er resources to receive this necessary education. As pre-clinical lectures are the root of early medical education, we should analyze the use of clinical images during these formative years to ensure proper representation of diverse skin types, especially SoC. Implicit biases unbeknownst to the educators themselves may be negatively impacting the representation of SoC, thus evaluating clinical imagery can provide a quantifiable as sessment for the cumulative representation of SoC. As we vow to, \"do no harm,\" we must critically evaluate our shortcomings to protect our patients from racial biases and provide diagnostic accuracy to prevent further suffering. Methods: This study will i nvolve collecting medical imagery used in the pre- clinical medical student curriculum. Images will be extracted from provided lecture materials and compiled at random. The images will then be sent to board -certified dermatologists who will qualitatively cl assify the images based on Fitzpatrick type, I- VI. The totals of each Fitzpatr ick type will then be accumulated and assessed for frequency. Light skin includes types I -III, and SoC will be defined as types IV -VI Additional points of evaluation may expand to include classification of disease, such as venereal vs non- venereal, as it is known that skin of color is disproportionately used to demonstrated sexually transmitted disease (Adelekun). Upon completion, reports will be compiled for each institution, dem onstrating their competency in representing diverse skin types. The impact on medical education and consequently patient outcomes, especially for patients with SoC, will be exponentially increased if this intrinsic review can be conducted on a multi -center level. Evaluation Plan: As a multi -center study and reflection, this review will have a significantly larger impact than as a singular center's report. Each report will include information on the percent of each Fitzpatrick type represented by clinical i magery. Additionally, if able to provide an accurate diagnosis of each conditi on, this project can expand to determine what Fitzpatrick types are used in pre -clinical education to represent each disease type. This can be even more broadly defined to demonstrate what categories of disease, such as infectious, sexually transmitted, au toimmune, or urticarial, lack diverse representation in this educational setting. Ultimately, upon receipt of the final compilation, it will be up to each institution to encourage faculty to assess potential inherent biases in selecting clinical imagery so to represent all Fitzpatrick types, especially SoC, in their pre -clinical education. Potential Impact : This goal of this study is to influence medical educators to assess inherent biases in including skin of color in medical imagery. Better representatio n of diverse skin types will ensure a comprehensive medical education and positively impact patient care via diagnostic accuracy and cultural competency. 330References: 1) Jones VA, Clark KA, Shobajo MT, Cordova A, Tsoukas MM, Skin of Color.

Need/Rationale: At Kaiser Permanente San Jose, we were told mid -March that we will be cancelling all in-person appointments and moving to virtual appointments. We had no idea how long this \"virtual\" care would last. Soon there was a shelter -in-place ordinance and at that time we asked ourselves, \"how would we teach community med icine if we can't be in the community safely\"? Then we had an \"ah ha\" moment: COVID- 19 was exposing the massive health disparities we have here in the United States. The Johns Hopkins University and American Community Survey indicated that the death rate f or counties that are a majority black is 6 times higher than predominantly white [1]. Undocumented immigrants were being excluded from federal aid packages and although they could receive free COVID -19 test through The Family First Coronavirus Response Act passed in March, if they were positive and were hospitalized, they would be responsible for the bill as many are uninsured [2]. We decided by looking at our county, our state, our country and even beyond, we could teach about health disparities which per the ACGME is an important component of healthcare quality and hopefully increase competency and inspire our residents during the pandemic. Methods: This intervention will focus on 18 family medicine residents in our program over the next three years. The intervention will include: 1). Modify our current small group sessions - topics included Undocumented immigrants, B lack/African Americans, Domestic Violence Victims, and the Homeless. 2.) Identify a total of 12 topics, research articles, and videos pertaini ng to the topics. 3.) Develop learning objectives for each session. 4.) Develop pre- and post -surveys for each sess ion. 5.) Take assigned homework from each section and compile as a reference (Community Medicine Knowledge Bank) for residents to review durin g community medicine clinic or at any other time. Evaluation Plan: We have had great informal feedback from resid ents about the small group sessions, but it will be important to develop a formal survey and evaluate knowledge and how it has changed their practice. It is difficult to measure if there is a change in \"residency culture\", but possible methods might be monitoring how many times residents have referred to the Community Medicine Knowledge Bank. We can also have face -to-face check -ins during community clinic to see if residents had changed how they provided care in the clinic. After 6 months of the sessions, we could schedule an in- depth focus group with all of the residents together to discuss what changes they made to their practice or if they hav e become more involved in community projects. Potential Impact : In any health care system, it is difficult for re sidents to have exposure to several types of health disparities. Using the pandemic, we can highlight groups that residents may not interact with at this time but will see when they have graduated and are in their own practice.

Need/Rationale: Under- represented minority (URM) physicians, specifically African American, Asian (Filipino, Hmong, Vietnamese), Native American, Hispanic, and/or Pacific Islander, constitute only about 10% of practicing cardiologists. With the growth of many minority populations across the country, diversity in cardiology is increasingly necessary to ensure that the diverse needs of patients are met in an ever- evolving environment. Although cardiology programs may face challenges recruiting under - represented minority applicants, concerted efforts to increase diversity may increase the likelihood of graduating minority cardiologists. Howeve r, there remains uncertainty regarding how best to recruit under- represented minorities and incentivize minority applicants to apply for cardiology fellowship training. The goal of this survey is to ask current cardiology fellowship program directors regar ding their views of diversity and recruitment of URMs. Methods: A questionnaire was developed containing items that assess program characteristics, importance of diversity, under -represented minority presence, methods to increase diversity, and responsibi lity to increase diversity among accredited cardiology fellowship p rograms in the United States. Cardiology programs were grouped based on region, category (community, university, or hybrid), location (rural, suburban, urban), number of years of fellowship , number of fellow positions, percentage of URM (matriculated this year and across each year). Within the survey, the methods that program directors believe to increase diversity within cardiology programs and the methods currently employed to increase URM presence are highly emphasized by asking program directors to asse ss whether outreach to URM residents is employed, if fellowship application review of URM applicants is altered, if URM physicians and fellows are connected via a mentoring program to promo te diversity if URM physicians conduct fellowship program interviews, and whether active measures are put into place in order to increase program diversity. A list of cardiology program directors was abstracted from the FREIDA AMA Residency & Fellowship Da tabase. IRB study approval has been received through USC iSTAR and submission of the survey to current cardiology program directors is pending. The results will then be analyzed using descriptive statistics and standard statistical methods with IBM SPSS. Evaluation Plan: Program regions, categories, and locations will be analyzed based on URM presence and importance allocated to diversity. We will describe which methods were most endorsed by cardiology program directors to increase diversity and which methods were being actively implemented to increase the number of URMs. We will also compare which methods (direct or indirect URM recruitment, altering selection criteria, promoting institutional diversity, and removing sources of racial or ethnic bias) are supported to the methods that are actively implemented using chi -squared tests. We will also analyze which entities were allocated the most responsibility to increase diversity in cardiology fellowship programs. Potential Impact : This study may identify methods to increase URM diversity in cardiology fellowships that offer insight to medical students and resident physicians considering cardiology fellowships. These findings may also inform cardiology program directors of which methods are most supported by their peers and which additional initiatives may be implemented. 333References: 1) Brotherton SE, Etzel SI.

Need/Rationale: Graduate medical education programs now more than ever need to embed health equity curricula into their programs as it has become increasingly evident that physicians need formal training in addressing social determinants of health. Health disparities continue to characterize our health system. While structural reforms are necessary, individual physicians can contribute significantly to improving health outcomes through their work with each individual patient, as well as through leadership, education and scholarly work. Residencies need to contin ually add to and improve their curricula in order to advance the professional goals of mission -aligned residents who are passionate about improving care for underserved communities. Health disparities have taken the center stage again as we grapple with the effects of a pandemic, which is characterized by disproportionate morbidity and mortality in communities of color. We propose a re -imagining of graduate medical education, where health equity is not a specific tra ck, but rather, permeates every aspect of our work so that our workforce is better prepared to face the challenges of the future and finally make progress in the quest to eliminate health disparities. Methods: The Health Equity Series consists of 10 lectu res with different themes. They take plac e once a month during the Residents' protected Friday afternoon didactic sessions. Our program currently has 6 first year Residents. A variety of speakers have been selected for their passion and expertise in the fi eld of health equity. Each is presenting a specific topic with its associated learning objectives. Speakers have been asked to dedicate approximately 45 minutes to sharing content and concepts and to reserve 15 minutes for active participation on the part of the Residents in the form of questions , answers and sharing of thoughts and ideas. Discussion and an opportunity to interact with experienced educators is a crucial component to the development of a cognitive map in the early learner. On the other hand, despite their limited experience, learners can already draw from their own professional or personal experiences to enhance these discussions explore the applicability of the concepts to their daily work in the clinical setting. Evaluation Plan: At the end of the academic year, the program will create a summary of the number of lectures delivered and the number of attendees. Each session will be evaluated by the Residents individually. The Resident will rate the content of the session as well as the speake r. A free text option is included in the evaluation form so that the Resident can comment one take away point that they think they will apply in their practice. We are interested in several outcomes and will be working on how to measure these. For example, we hope to see an increase in the discus sions around SDOH when Residents present their cases in clinic. Our evaluation form for the clinic rotation includes a question regarding whether the Resident addresses SDOH in the care of their patient. We will als o be looking at Resident performance arou nd SDOH and cultural humility via the Milestones on a quarterly basis. Finally, health equity measures will be integrated into the rubric for assessing Resident performance on the OSCE during every year of training. Potential Impact : Graduates from our pr ogram will develop skills to better serve patients in underserved communities and they will be able to model sensitive and respectful care to colleagues and learners, thus increasing the number of activated physicians in our workforce who are equipped to tackle the recalcitrant problem of health disparities in the community. 335References: 1) Noriea AH, Redmond N, Weil RA, Curry WA, Peek ME, Willett LL.

Need/Rationale: Since 1930 the mission of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been to attain optimal physical, mental and social health and well -being for all pediatrics patients. As a founding pillar in the field of pediatrics, the AAP has embedded advocacy as a core value of pediatricians through policy statements detailing society's rapid change and the need to prepare tomorrow's pediatricians for the new chall enges they will face (1). There is increasing recognition of the eco -bio-developmental model and the short- and long- term effects of toxic stress on child health (1 -2). Pediatric residency training programs recognize the importance of advocacy and community health training. As part of a Federally Qualified Health Center, our residents see patients who fac e significant barriers to their health and well- being. There is a need for sustainable advocacy curricula that are integrated into the identity and values of the training program (3). Our longitudinal competency -based curriculum progressively builds on the concept that pediatric healthcare goes beyond the clinic walls and will train pediatricians to provide comprehensive care and address social injustices. Methods: The new community pediatrics curriculum integrates our ambulatory, development and advocacy rotations using updated competencies and teaching methods. It is a 12 -week experience, 4 weeks per year, for a total of 106 residents in 2021 -2022. Residen ts will become skilled clinicians and advocates, both within and outside the care system. In the firs t year, residents will understand the basics of ambulatory pediatrics, normal development and community resources. Second -year residents will apply appropr iate developmental screens and analyze the impact of special health care needs and community on patie nts. Third- year residents will create advocacy materials and evaluate ways to positively affect change for patients and communities. The rotations utilize various teaching modalities which include brief didactic presentation, online training modules, site visits to key organizations with reflections on learning, and participation in community -based programs like Reach Out and Read. PGY1s select a topic of in terest, develop a patient education handout, create a quality improvement question, and deliver a brief talk to educate their co -residents on their topic. PGY2s will gain expertise in developmental screening and advocacy for those with developmental delays. They conduct home safety visits and community strength assessments. PGY3s focus more on local and n ational advocacy and write an op -ed to a local newspaper or a letter to a legislator regarding policy affecting child health. Evaluation Plan: All element s of the 3 -year curriculum will be tracked using a checklist to ensure all plans are carried out and to identify necessary changes. Learner reaction to the new curriculum will be assessed using standard rotation evaluation forms at rotation completion and reviewed by faculty members. Learning will be assessed through faculty review and grading rubrics of rotation deliverables to ensure goals and objectives are met. In order to assess knowledge and skills, we will perform a chart review of electronic medical records to track referrals to appropriate community resources. We will look at utilization rates of patient hand- outs created by PGY1s, selection and use of developmental screening tools by PGY2s, and submission rates of op -eds by PGY3s. Lastly, residents will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the curriculum to ensure objectives are met. We will adapt a previously -published survey on advocacy training to assess attitudes and behaviors at the end of residency and five years after graduation. We aim to show enhanced value of advocacy in practice, increased knowledge of health inequity and social determinants of health, and improved knowledge and skills to identify needs in patients and refer to resources. 337Potential Impact : Our curriculum wil l train residents to provide more effective care to our patients and communities and instill values f or continued advocacy in issues affecting child health that will lead to improved individual and population -level health outcomes. If successful, other spe cialties can adapt our curriculum to improve their own advocacy training.

We sought to describe the implementation and perception of TIC in surgical education. Rationale: TIC is the practice of mindfully approaching a patient b y consciously considering what traumatic experiences are a part of them and tailoring our behavior as medical professionals to be optimally sensitive to their experiences and outward behavior as molded by life- trauma. Symbiotically, TIC requires providers to look within to explore their own traumas and how this c an affect patient interactions. TIC education has garnered traction in non -surgical specialties, however, implementation in surgical education has yet to be described. Trauma -informed care can impro ve rapport with our patients, improve patient/provider satisfaction, and assist care teams in avoiding burnout. Given the advantages of TIC demonstrated in non -surgical specialties we aimed to illustrate our experience with virtual implementation of TIC with a surgical intern class and describe surgical intern perception of TIC before and after the curriculum. Methods: With advice, review, and support of our faculty, second -year general surgery residents implemented a three -session web- based curriculum about TIC to the incoming intern class. We utilized an anonymous crowd- sourcing strategy to optimize learning prior to each session and to garner insights about intern perception prior to each session. These results were then reviewed for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Specifically, we asked: 1) Have you ever heard of TIC and what does TIC mean to you? 2) How have you applied TIC during the first month of internship. 3) Give an example from the last month where you felt like a debriefing session c ould have helped with team dynamics and morale. Results: Out of 48 interns 52.1% answered they do know what TIC is and 47.9% did not. When looking at specific descriptions of what TIC means to them 21 provided an on -track answer while 22 provided an off-track answer. Off -track answers centered around comments ab out care related to physical trauma patients. During the second data -gathering session 27 interns responded describing one way that they had practiced TIC during the first month of internship; all o f these responses were on -par with TIC. During the third s ession, 13 interns responded. Most of these responses centered around patient deaths or complications while a minority of responses centered around difficult team dynamics. Potential Impact : Surgery is notorious for insensitivity among surgeons towards pa tients, and team members. Early intervention with TIC curriculum has the potential to create culture change. Here we have demonstrated that baseline understanding and awareness of TIC is about 50%. A majority of responses at the later sessions demonstrate growth in application of TIC.

Need/Rationale: According to the 2018 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Healthcare disparities Report, even though some disparities have shown a small improvement, disparities persist amongst the vulnerable populations (1). It has been found that physicians play a very important role in eliminating health disparities, specifically by engaging at the community and societal levels (2). Our residents and faculty believe that in order to work on eliminating health disparities we should be able to address social determinants of health both in and outside of clinic. Many of them feel overwhelmed in clinic because the needs of our patients are enormous but the training on how to address these disparities is minimal. There is evidence that longitudinal training, community -based for learning and participation in research are important in a curriculum that aims to address health disparities (3). Our specific intervention will be structured to provide training in different community based interactive learning settings to produce a longitudinal focus on social determinants. Methods: This curriculum is designed for 18 family medicine residents (6 PGY1s, 6 PGY2s, 6 PGY3s) and will span their three years of training. The intervention includes: 1) Didactics: Six dedicated lectures per year on social determinants of health topics with ample time for discussion, in addition to integrating social determinants of health concepts throughout all lectures. 2) Direct Observation: Three community medicine ro tations per y ear (4 weeks per rotation). Each rotation consists of the resident participating in community programs and continuity clinic in a Federally Qualified Health Center. Both community partner staff and clinic faculty will be trained to focus on th e social determinants of health. 3) Each resident to participate in a pipeline program by mentoring one high student for 2 years (2nd and 3rd year of residency): four mentor -mentee interactions a year. The resident will have training in mentoring and commu nications ski lls. 4) Participation in three community/advocacy activities per year. 5) Completion of one scholarly activity that addresses a health disparity or social determinants of health by the end of the 3rd year. 6) Goal setting: Individualized plan for each resi dent to help set goals towards achieving growth in a focus area around social determinants of health. This will help guide scholarly activity, professional and personal goals. This plan will be re -evaluated every quarter for all three years wi th an advisor . Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: Will track didactic lectures, community program sessions, advocacy activities attended, student mentorship interactions and scholarly activities completed. 2) Reaction: Residents will take a pre and post -survey to ass ess perception of importance and usefulness of the curriculum. Didactics presentations will be evaluated to assess satisfaction of the presenter and topic. 3) Learning: Residents will fill out pre and post surveys to assess knowledge. Communit y Programs will also assess resident on knowledge, attitude and skills focused on social determinants of health. Each item on this evaluation of the resident is linked to ACGME Family Medicine Sub -competencies. 4) Behavior: Tracking of individualized plan will be perfo rmed quarterly to assess for progression of goals. This will also include post -graduation career choice. Potential Impact : By training our future family medicine physicians to understand and participate in activities that challenge societal and structural forces that create health disparities, we can improve the social determinants of health in our communities. If successful, this can be a model curriculum to improve social accountability of family medicine physicians.

Rationale: Civil unrest following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor highlighted the need for a more robust institutional response to systemic racism within the medical system, but little exists within the literature on how to do so during the pandemic. Book clubs are a tool for critical examination of beliefs and practices regarding racism and can be used in the professional development of trainees. A virtual book club could accommodate the constraints of the pandemic without compromising the opportunity to engage in urgent discourse about systemic racism. Conversations about racism through a trauma- informed lens can aid in understanding the deeper impacts of the powerful social -political - economic construct of racism, thus, the text Training for Change: Transforming Systems to be Trauma - Informed, Culturally Responsive, and Neuroscientifically Focused was chosen. We sought to provide a space to challenge beliefs about racism through a virtual book club using this text. Methods: This voluntary ser ies is open to all learners and staff across the university. It is a biweekly fi ve- part series that includes an introductory session followed by subsequent sessions exploring chapters focusing on neurodevelopment and the intersection of fear, trauma, and structural racism. Each one -hour session is facilitated by a psychiatry resident or faculty, psychologist, or therapist trained in trauma - informed care. Facilitation guides tailored for each session are created using exercises from the text and trauma- informed principles. Facilitators are given the flexibility to pursue topics of inter est that arise in real-time within the group. Survey responses are collected after each session asking participants to judge their learning and indicate if they plan to apply w hat they learned. Participants are specifically asked to respond yes or no regarding whether the session improved their understanding of the following: how trauma affects the developing brain; cultural responsivity; and the relationship between fear, trauma, and racism. These topics were chosen because they aligned with the objectives of the discussed chapters. The survey also provides participants with space to submit narrative responses for how they may use their learning in their future practice and what they liked and disliked about the session. This feedback is used to plan subseq uent session facilitation guides, allowing for an iterative process to best serve the needs of participants. Results: Four of the five sessions have been completed at the time of this abstract. The number of virtual attendees for sessions one through four were 130, 155, 108, and 105, respectively. 58 participants (11%) completed post- session surveys. Of the respondents, 64% felt their understanding of how trauma affects the developing brain improved, 24% did not, and 12% unsure. 64% felt their understanding of cultural responsivity improved, 22% did not, and 14% unsure. 67% felt their understanding of fear, trauma, and racism improved, 17% did not, and 16% unsure. 88% of respondents felt the sessions had a practical impact on their approach to learning, tea ching, and clinical practice. Qualitatively, respondents reported themes of interconnection, community, cultural humility, need for personal reflection and growth, honesty, and transparency. Most participants felt the sessions provided a safe environment i n which to be vulnerable and share, with one stating, \"...very helpful to hear the different voices...frustration...and hope. It helped relieve me of some of my fatigue and hopelessness.\" Criticisms of the series include the virtual format, large group con text, limited timeframe, and differences among participants in first- hand knowledge and experience. Of note, the feedback around respondents' varying degrees of first -hand experience with racism and trauma, although quite challenging to navigate, was a hig hly valuable source of guidance for continually adapting the series as needed. Potential Impact : Racism has profoundly deleterious impacts on the health of individuals, commun ities, and systems. As healers, we work at the intersection of and live in these systems and have a 342commitment to thoughtfully reduce the harms of this powerful social construct. It is imperative to continue these conversations and should be incorporated m oving forward.

Need/Rationale: Stigma may occur at a structural level through institutional policies, among social groups, and at an individual level with internalized negative thoughts or maladaptive behaviors [1]. Research has shown that health professionals generall y have negative attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders (SUD), while barriers to providing care include perceived manipulation, violence, and lack of motivation [2]. Stigma has been shown to reduce quality of care, contribute to poor patient health outcomes and feelings of disempowerment, as well as lower patient and provider satisfaction [3]. Attitudes of healthcare workers may be influenced by lack of education or training, cultural beliefs, minimal exposure to patients with substance use disorders, and inadequate institutional support. Previous surveys have demonstrated knowledge and attitude deficits that contribute to stigma and biases against patients with substance use disorders. Methods: Conduct a survey of primary care clinic staff members including providers, nurses, pharmacists, and front office workers. The questionnaire will assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs related to caring for patients with substance use disorders. The survey will have specific questions that emphasize stigma, culture, and language. After completion of the pre -survey, our team will create a custom workshop that emp hasizes stigma-reducing patient -centred language in addition to addressing areas for improvement identified from the pre -survey in the d omains of culture and language. With the assistance of our health behavior psychologist, we will lead training sessions that emphasize culturally and linguistically congruent skills. The workshop will include reflective and patient -centered experiential exercises to help encourage providers to examine their own biases that may interfere with assisting patients with substance use disorders. We will also promote screening for substance use disorders and review resources available for patient care. Following t he training, a post- survey will be administered to re-assess staff and providers' knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to caring for SUD patients. Results of the pre -and post -surveys will be analyzed to evaluate for any changes . Evaluation Plan: The evaluation will be a qualitative and quantitative analysis with the primary outcome being the pre and post attitudes and beliefs of the clinic staff and providers. The secondary outcome will be the effectiveness of our workshop that emphasizes how to reduce stigma and biases towards substance use disorder assessment and treatment. Potential Impact : This training will be inc orporated into providers' curriculum and periodically held for clinic staff. Survey results can identify areas for further improvement. Reducing stigma and biases will help create a non -judgmental environment and improve quality of care for patients with s ubstance use disorders at our family medicine clinic.

Rationale: Due to the restrictions on clinical time for UK medical students, there is a need for them to be taught an approach to the assessment of unwell patients through simulation -based education. Many departments are trying to make use of this approach, and at the same time, fewer students may attend each session due to social distancing restrictions, and faculty ability to sanitise equipment betw een uses. To maximise the use of the time in the simulation environment, we used a flipped -classroom approach, providing the students with video materials to watch prior to attending the session. This approach is consistent with Cognitive Load Theory (1), and allows the students to become familiar with the subject in their own time, before coming to the session where time is more limited. However, when making online materials for education, those materials must be of appropriate quality and content for the target learner to be engaged (2). Methods: This session is given to 4th -year medical students at the beginning of their clinical practice blocks in hospital medicine and surgery. They are provided with access to videos, hosted on YouTube for ease of acces s, which explain the ABCDE approach to assessment of a sick patient and a case - based simulation of an anaesthetic to demonstrate airway assessment and management stra tegies. When they attend the session, the information given in these videos is consolidate d and used in multiple simulations so that they have the chance to put the newly learned framework into practice and strengthen their understanding of its use. The fi rst session was run without the pre -session learning materials, and the second session wit h the materials available and the students instructed to review them before attending. The students were surveyed at the end of each session, with scaled responses and free-text questions. We also had a live, anonymous, online forum feedback session with t he students where they were able to share comments and build on one another's responses while interacting in real - time with questions from the tutors. Results: The results of the first session showed that the students found great value in the teaching, bu t found the amount of learning overwhelming. They consistently expressed the desire for the materials to be available before the session to allow them time to absorb and understand the concepts. For the second session, 86.5% of the students found the mater ials useful and only 9.6% did not access them. The general nature of the free -text comments changed as well, with the students in the first session describing a desire to know more about the topic being covered before coming to the session, having a chance to prepare, and wanting more time with the tutors. In the second session, the free -text comments mostly said students would like more sessions of this style in the f uture or notes about running to time. In the online forum session, the students were impre ssed by the professional quality of the videos, found them clear and easy to follow and preferred the case -based style of learning. The students also felt that the vi deos had ongoing value after the COVID -19 pandemic has improved, to allow them to consolidate experienced learning events with these materials. The whiteboard style of responses also allowed students to respond with non -text opinions, such as emojis. Potential Impact : Flipped classroom simulation is a learner -centered, effective method to teach clinical assessment skills and maximise the use of currently limited contact time with tutors. The materials provided have benefit before, during and after the sess ions, and allow the learners to have a self - directed and flexible approach to their own learning. 345References: 1) De Bruin, A.

Rationale: Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, our institution transitioned to a fully remote curriculum for second- year medical students. This posed many challenges for student engagement and for implementation of interactive team -based modalities. Even with our in -person curriculum, students struggled with cardiac embryol ogy and malformations. We sought ways to deliver the information more interactively by integrating many of the topics covered during the cardiovascular subunit. Team -based learning allows for small group -based active learning with a small number of facilitators. TBL has increasingly been incorpo rated in medical school curricula and has been shown to be an effective teaching modality [1][2]. We sought to design a TBL session to cover cardiac embryology and congenital malformations while integrating clinical reasoning, physiology, pathophysiology, imaging, and EKG interpretation. Further, we sought to deliver this novel session fully online as part of the remote curriculum. Methods: This session was developed for 2nd -year medical students who had completed fo ur of six organ system based curricular blocks with the session at the end of the 4 -week cardiovascular subunit. The session contained an Individual/Team Readiness Assessment Test (IRAT/ TRAT) as well as 3 vignette -based clinical cases. A 4th case was released after the session for further pract ice. All content was developed in collaboration between clinical and basic science faculty and clinical year medical students. Cases included additional media including heart sound audio clips, echocardiography videos and images, EKGs. The session was conducted remotely with all facilitators and students participating from home using an online TBL platform and video conferencing software with the ability to facilitate both the whole group as well as smaller subgroups for team- based discussion. The session was conducted for half of the class at a time and the students were split into 16 teams of 5 -7 students per half. A survey was sent prior to the session asking about comfort and confidence with the material. Students were sent the same questions after the s ession as well as questions asking them to provide feedback on the session. All survey data was recorded on a 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) scale. Two -tailed independent T -Tests were used to compare res ponses to the pre and post- session survey. Statistical significance was set to p<0.05. All data were analyzed using SPSS for Mac version 27. Results: 205 students partook in the session. The average score on the IRAT was 64.5% and on the TRAT was 99.5%. 127 and 105 students responded to the pre and post- session survey respectively. There was a statistically significant increase in student reported confidence in and comfort with the material covered from pre to post -session. Students reported an increase fr om 2.2 to 3.9 in their confidence in understanding congenital heart defects, from 2.3 to 3.8 in understanding the hemodynamic implications of congenital heart defects, from 2.1 to 4.0 in their comfort diagnosing congenital heart defects from a vignette, from 2.5 to 3.8 in their comfort interp reting common cardiac imaging, from 2.6 to 3.4 in their comfort diagnosing common abnormalities on EKG, from 2.5 to 3.2 in their comfort identifying murmurs, and from 2.7 to 3.5 in their comfort determining the hemodynamic factors that would change the properties of a murmur. P<0.0001 for all. Students overall found the activity to be helpful (4.5). They reported that it enhanced their education (4.6). They reported that it helped them understand the presentation (4.5), diagnosis (4.5), management (4.2), and complications (4.4) of congenital heart defects. The students overall found the activity engaging (4.5) and recommended that it be included for future classes (4.6). Students felt that the learning objectives for this session were clear (4.3) and that the session met the stated learning objectives (4.4). 347Potential Impact : We successfully developed and implemented a TBL to teach cardiac embryology, pathophysiology, and malformations, integrating many topics covered during the subunit. It received excellen t feedback, demonstrating the power and utility of interactive sessions such as TBL to integrate and teach complex topics even as part of a fully remote curriculum.

Need/Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic has caused disruption not just in healthcare provision but also in the delivery of clinical teaching to medical students. At our medical school in the UK, students were withdrawn from clinical placements during the peak of the pandemic due to the risk of infection. Due to concern over both risks of viral transmission and low worldwide stock levels of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), on their return to clinical placements in August 2020 our medical school advised against students participating in the care of any patients with known or suspected COVID- 19, or in aerosol- generating procedures (AGPs) which at that time were undertaken using enhanced PPE in all patients. Common procedures performed in anaesthesia such as bag -mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation are AGPs. These factors have made exposure to traditional bedside teaching of clinical anaesthesia challenging for medical students. We aimed to devise an innovative way of continuing to meet learning outcomes by delivering educational opportunities in a safe, aerosol -free environment. Methods: In the initial phase of the project, we recorded a video of a patient being anaesthetised for use in small group teaching sessions. Written consent was gained from the patient and the anaesthetic management recorded using two mobile phone cameras from differing angles and a Go -Pro (California, USA) camera mounted on the anaestheti st's forehead. The footage was edited such that the playback pauses at critical points and an explanatory narrative added. Advice was sought from the institution's data protection team regarding any restrictions to use. Next, we investigated establishing a secure livestreaming plat form to address the data protection issues and achieve a more immersive clinical learning experience. We identified a video conference system used for patient care in our ICU which utilised a secure communication protocol. Patient consent was obtained and a test run conducted. One unit of the system was placed in the operating theatre with the camera focusing on the patient and the anaesthetist. The second unit was placed outside of the theatre with an anaesthetic trainee playing the role of a medical stude nt. Both units were connected over secure hospital Wi- Fi network and the anaesthetic management was streamed live from the theatre. The anaesthetic trainee was instructed to ask questions during the livestream and the anaesthetist in theatre was instructed to answer these questions as per normal in order to test real -time communication. Evaluation Plan: Using pre -recorded video of real patient encounters poses serious data protection risks: potential data breach may occur by malic ious attack, loss of storage medium, unsecured cloud storage on remote servers and recording of playback by medical students. To ensure security, our video can only be used in a supervised classroom which limits its utility. In addition, pre -recorded video cannot replicate the valu e of bedside teaching (1). The video conference system allowed us to stream the high - risk AGP phase of anaesthetic management from theatre to a room outside. Verbal communication for commentary, questions and answers was clear wit hout detectable lag time and video quality was high enough to appreciate all important phases of anaesthesia. As this system streams live and does not record, the risk of a data breach is considered low. The value of livestreaming as an educational tool ha s been demonstrated previously (2). Our system enables effective learning for medical students and with minimal risk to patient confidentiality. It allows students to remain meaningfully involved in real patients' perioperative care, as they already partic ipate in the non -AGP processes of pre -operative assessment and post -operative review. Potential Impact : Livestreaming has potential beyond anaesthetic education during the current pandemic: it allows students to observe, and even participate in, the care of COVID- 19 patients and 349AGPs in a wide variety of clinical settings, and enabling interactive learning without physical presence further safeguards clinical teaching against a second wave.

Need/Rationale: Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, second- year medical students at our institution began a remote curriculum for Fall 2020. The cardiovascular subunit, part of the fourth of six organ system based curricular blocks, typically contained significant instruction from clinical faculty members. Students found this interaction to be enriching and crucial to their learning. Due to the remote curriculum, there was less opportunity for students to interact with faculty . There was a need for directed review time in order for students to ensure that they were on track with the material and were able to assess their knowledge and ask questions. In order to de liver targeted and engaging reviews, we designed a series of online gamified weekly review sessions with clinical faculty. Gamified activities have been shown to be an effective teaching modality [1]. The goal was to provide a space for the class to come together as a large group, interact with clinical faculty, and review material from that week. Methods: These sessions were implemented at the end of each week of the cardiovascular subunit. Sessions were 90 minutes long and were scheduled for half of the class at a given time. Sessions were conducted over video confere ncing software with all faculty and students participating remotely. Common to each session was an interactive and fully online, formative, and gamified quiz designed for student self-assessment of the week's material. The quiz grants points based on the correct answers and the time required to answer the question. The students are able to track their progress against other students. The faculty then reviewed the quiz answers and explanati ons. Following the quiz, each session proceeded differently. The post quiz review session was designed to be adaptable to the needs of the students. For two of the four weeks, there was a case -based activity where clinical faculty led the group through a p atient case, discussing presentation, diagnosis, management, and complications. For the remaining two weeks, the time was used as an open question and answer session for discussion of any student questions or concerns. Evaluation Plan: We wish to evaluate this session based on student satisfaction as well as on improvement in medical knowledge. To assess satisfaction, we plan to release a survey at the end of the subunit covering satisfaction of these sessions. We plan to ask if the sessions enhanc ed the student's education, if they found it worthwhile, if it met the stated learning objectives, and if the student feels the sessions should be a part of the curriculum for future classes. To assess improvement in medical knowledge we plan to use a pair of pre and post- session surveys. These surveys will ask students to self assess their confidence and comfort with the material covered in that week's session. This will allow us to assess improvement in these metrics from before to after the session. After the Unit, we plan to comprehensively evaluate the remote curriculum includi ng assessing any change in student performance on summative exams. We hope to see non -inferior performance when compared to past years with the in-person curriculum. While this would not be attributable to any one modality, it would help show us the utility of these weekly review sessions. If successful, these sessions can be implemented into the remainder of the preclinical curriculum. Potential Impact : As medical schools navigat e the COVID -19 pandemic, educators require novel ways of engaging and interacting with their students. These sessions are an interactive, engaging, and educational way to increase interaction between students and faculty and allow for directed review of material in a remote curriculum.

Rationale: Traditionally, Emergency Medicine bound medical students gain valuable personal experience with faculty and residents and improve their ability to practice emergency medicine through sub-internships at various prog rams. However, due to the current global pandemic, a virtual clerkship appears to serve as a potentially valuable substitute. A virtual clerkship could provide the opportunities to further expand core emergency medicine knowledge as well as less commonly t aught nuances in emergency medicine. Topics such as health advocacy, social justice, and health equity are essential components of emergency medicine, but infrequently discussed and not standardized. A virtual clerkship offers the opportunity for students around the country to learn from and interact with a wide range of expert speciali sts who would otherwise be unable to make contact with every rotating student. In the future, a virtual clerkship can serve as a beneficial supplement to an in -person experience. Methods: Medical students from various institutions were invited to particip ate in a two week virtual clerkship. The curriculum consisted of Zoom -based didactics, small group sessions, interactive activities such as \"virtual escape rooms\" and \"teachi ng sessions,\" and daily asynchronous learning. Asynchronous materials included pod casts, free open access medicine (FOAM) blog posts and articles previously identified as high yield for chosen subjects areas. During \"in -person\" sessions over Zoom, days consisted of short didactics to reinforce asynchronous materials or expose students t o professional development topics (introduction to teaching, skill development for interviewing in the Zoom -era, etc.) and future careers in Emergency Medicine (e.g. Toxicology, Administration, Education, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, Ultras ound, etc.). The curriculum also included various \"active learning\" techniques such as small group case based instruction to review medical knowledge topics or social determinants of health topics. Knowledge retention was evaluated using topic specific ROSH review questions in a pre -rotation and post -rotation test. Scores were compared using a paired T -test. Mixed -method surveys were sent to the students daily as well as at th e conclusion of the clerkship to ascertain course feedback. The survey was developed by experienced emergency medicine education faculty and was piloted by residents with additional feedback incorporated into the survey. Results: Medical students (n=26) f rom around the country participated in the virtual clerkship over the course of tw o sessions. Student knowledge was evaluated using topic specific ROSH review questions prior to the start of the clerkship and after the conclusion of the clerkship in a pre -test and post -test format. Pre- test mean scores (n=26) was 71.65% for all students (95% CI [68.25 -75.21]) versus post- test mean scores 76.34% for all students (95% CI [74.68 -78.01]). Students also completed mixed -method surveys to evaluate the r eaction and satisfaction with the virtual learning environment. Responses were str ongly positive: 80% strongly agreed that the virtual clerkship should be repeated in the future, while 15% agreed, and 4% neither agreed or disagreed (n=25). Students also fe lt that the virtual clerkship was valuable beyond the COVID -era. 44% strongly agreed, 40% agreed, and 12% of students neither agree nor disagree that the virtual clerkship should be continued into future calendar years even in a non -COVID era (n=25). One person felt that the virtual clerkship should not be continued beyond the COVID era citing \"it would be more valuable to come together.\" The virtual clerkship was also a valuable networking tool. 92% of students strongly agreed and 8% of students agreed tha t they enjoyed meeting people from across the country during the virtual clerkship (n=25). Potential Impact : A virtual clerkship can be a valuable, effective alternative to the traditional sub - internship, especially when in -person meetings and travel is limited. Additionally, it can serve as a 352curriculum to address less commonly taught , but no less important content such as social determinants of health, career development, and professionalism.

Moore, Charles (1,2); Austin, Jill (1,2); Pitts, Sophie (1) (1) NHS Grampian; (2) University of Aberdeen Idea: To build engagement amongst medical students in online learning by developing modern, highly produced videos in place of traditional PowerPoint. Need/Rationale: The advent of the C OVID- 19 pandemic has necessitated rapid redevelopment of curriculums to suit the online learning platform in keeping with the need for social distancing. Traditi onally developed teaching that works in face to face lecture environments does not translate well to the online environment by default, and prolonged exposure to PowerPoint presentations with voiceover narration, whilst being easier to produce at speed, do es not produce engaging material that leads to effective learning (Guo). Online learning has many advantages including flexibility and control in the rate and style of engagement with learning content as well as the ability to support remote learning, and has been shown to improve overal l academic outcomes (Chapman), but optimising these benefits requires that content is built with the medium in mind. The normalisation of rapid broadband connectivity presents an exciting opportunity to produce a new format of resources accessible across the world, with a solid grounding in educational theory to maximise engagement and learning, enhanced by lessons learned from social media and existing video hosting environments such as YouTube. Methods: Fourth- year medical students in our centre rotate t hrough placements in anaesthetics. A flipped classroom model is in place providing online tutorials in advance of placement, ensuring that underlying conceptual understanding is in place before exposure to the clinical environment. During a period of redevelopment brought to the fore by the C OVID- 19 pandemic, we sought to integrate lessons learned from medical education with those learned from the use of social media to produce content that was relevant to a modern stu dent population who are well used to utilising platforms such as Twitter and YouTube. In place of PowerPoint style presentations, we produced tutorial videos with a presenter and visual cues. Students due to attend placement are directed to these videos be fore attending, and have the opportunit y to explore the concepts in more detail during an online tutorial with a supervisor. Viewers can see the tutor's face throughout the video, enhancing engagement, and handwritten explanations or diagrams are superimposed with video editing software to enha nce the understanding. Diagrams build in real time during the explanation, and videos can be paused or rewound to cover complex concepts multiple times. Seeing the presenter in real time and utilising short duration v ideo with fast speech is known to promo te improved learning, in contrast to the poor viewer retention seen with slides and voice (Guo). YouTube also facilitates caption generating, improving accessibility. Evaluation Plan: Accountability: this development remains in its infancy, with some pres entations yet to be modernised in the newer style. Four of six tutorials have been updated and are hosted on YouTube on an account branded as \"Aberdeen Anaesthesia\", making use of the built- in analytics abilities of t he platform to measure user engagement, viewer retention and interest from out -with our own department. Reaction: data exists from the previous presentations and once development has concluded, both qualitative and quantitative data will be sought to gauge improvement in both accessibility and enjoyment from students alongside an increase in gained understanding of the subject matter through using this modern format of presentation. It is intended that this platform will lead to a large library of short, focussed tutorials which students can watch in their own time, covering key subjects more than once if required to ensure mastery, and the average watch time will be analysed to assess which formats were most successful amongst the videos produced. Ability t o demonstrate understanding in supervisor -led tutorials will then be expected to improve in line with engagement with these videos, in keeping with the flipped classroom model. Potential Impact : This project will improve the quality of education offered t o UoA students in anaesthesia and criti cal care, whilst also promoting a culture of excellence in resource production and 354teaching in our department, represented in the visibility of our productions on a global video hosting platform to share our work with a global network of learners.

Need/Rationale: Due to COVID- 19 restrictions, Student Run Free Clinics (SRFC) such as Cass Clinic at Wayne State University School of Medicine cannot offer in -person volunteering. SRFCs provide medical students with a valuable opportunity to enrich their clinical trainin g while simultaneously being exposed to the needs of medically underserved patients in the community (1). To address this gap, a collaborative virtual Case Studies and Patient Education Materials series was offered to first and second year students. The cases were designed on patients previously served by the SFRC and were structured to reflect AAMC Core Competencies for Entering Re sidencies (2). The virtual session was structured to emulate peer -to-peer learning and teaching dynamics of SRFC student teams. In this way, first year medical students learn essential clinical skills while obtaining immediate, peer feedback on their developing competencies while second year students develop mentorship and self -directed learning in preparing and delivering the session. A patient education component was also added for students to collaborate in exploring cultural and social determinants of h ealth that impact health education and outcomes for the Detroit population served by Cass Clinic. Methods: First- year (M1) and second- year (M2) students at Wayne State University School of Medicine elected to participate from September to December 2020. 1 ) Case studies included a chief complaint, vital signs, physical exam findings, and relevant past histories. M2 students wer e given the cases with probing questions and were responsible for facilitating the virtual session. 2) Two groups of two M2 and three M1 students per week arranged to meet via Zoom to work through a case. With M2 guidance, the M1s asked questions to elicit the medical history, suggest physical exam maneuvers, and consider differential diagnoses for their case. While collaborating to arrive at clinical diagnoses and treatment recommendations for the case, students engaged in practice with targeted feedback. 3) Students then created an infographic based on the identified condition within the case. These infographics will be distributed at Cass Clinic to educate patients with the corresponding condition on behavioral modifications that could improve health outc omes. 4) To evaluate learning and efficacy of the program, pre and post- surveys were completed by students on Google Forms. Survey q uestions were created to assess clinical competencies proposed by the AAMC Core Competencies for Entering Residencies (2). At the completion of the case study series, the survey results will be analyzed to determine if students felt more confident in these core competencies and understanding of the Detroit patient population. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: Students will submit a screenshot of their Zoom session and infographic to the Cass Clinic coordinators to ensure attendance and participation in t he case series program. 2) Reaction: The sessions will be evaluated by analysis of responses to two post -survey questions assessing whether participants felt that the program prepared them to volunteer in a SRFC and skills that they would have liked to practice that the program did not currently offer. 3) Learning: Aggregated responses to post -survey questions regarding students' confidence in meeting select AAMC Core Competencies (2) will be analyzed and compared to confidence levels reported in the pre -survey to assess for improvement in clinical skills. 4) Behavior: Participants are allowed to elaborate on the post-survey question about how the program prepared them for in -person volunteering and rank their comfort with working with the Detroit community. We hope their responses reflect their increased sensitivity to and motivation to work with vulnerable patient populations in Detroit like those served by Cass Clinic. Potential Impact : During the COVID -19 pandemic, medical schools and SRFCs face challenges in providing in -person clinical opportunities for students. A virtual case series program allows students to practice ski lls essential to their development as physicians and create educational materials to empower patients in the Detroit community to manage their own health. 356 References: 1) Gorrindo P, Peltz A, Ladner TR, et al.

Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic created a unique challenge to medical educators who were seasoned in teaching in- person sessions. There was a need to adapt and create distance learning alternatives while still ensuring student engagement. Studies over the past 20 years have shown that gamification can be successfully used in medical education to engage adult trainees and make learning more experiential [1]. Kahoo t!, specifically, is a cost -effective online gaming platform that has been perceived by students as an enjoyable application that engenders motivation by fostering friendly competition [2]. It all ows institutions to create timed quizzes and track players' individual progress. An upgraded educational subscription allows for up to 2,000 players and can be ideal for ranking participants as it provides instantaneous feedback. Methods: We have incorpor ated the Kahoot! platform into our virtual pre -clinical and clinical sessions as follows: 1. We transitioned a once in -person patient safety simulation into a virtual patient safety game for our institution's Transition to Clerkship Week. The session was h eld on Zoom for 180 third -year medical students. Students we re shown a series of standardized patient encounter videos [3] that demonstrated breaches in patient safety. Using kahoot!, we tested the student's awareness of each hazard and the patient safety implications. The students who identified the most patient s afety hazards quickly and accurately were rewarded. 2. After a successful session, student coordinators hosted a faculty development session to discuss ways to implement kahoot! into other aspects of the distance- learning curriculum. To support faculty mem bers with this new initiative, student coordinators provided training on its use, discussed the different gaming -modes available, and explained its use as a means of student evaluation. 3. The sec ond application of this student- faculty initiative took plac e during the cardiology subunit of the second -year medical student curriculum. The subunit faculty leaders worked closely with the student coordinators to develop a post -lecture game to not only e ngage students and test their knowledge of cardiac physiolog y and pathology, but also to provide feedback on teaching methods. Students and Faculty educators were surveyed after each session. Results: One -hundred third- year medical students were surveyed after completing the Virtual Patient Safety game -based session: When asked if the session was interactive, 96% of students strongly agreed. 95% of students believed that the session was useful for their training (80% of students strongly agreed; 15% studen ts agreed), while 95% of students agreed that their knowledg e of patient safety improved as a result of the session (76% strongly agreed; 19 % agreed). Five senior faculty members were surveyed after the kahoot! training session: When asked if the session demonstrated the benefits of integrating kahoot! gaming into medical education, 100% of faculty members agreed. 100% of faculty members believed that the student facilitators were knowledgeable of the kahoot! platform and related content. Overall, 100% of faculty members agreed (60% strongly agreed, 40% agreed) that they were likely to use kahoot! in future medical education sessions. Seventy -five second -year medical students were surveyed after participating in the cardiology post -lecture kahoot! review se ssion: When asked if the session was interactive, 98.7 % of students agreed (90.7% strongly agreed, 8% agreed). Furthermore, when asked if kahoot! is a more engaging way of learning than using traditional teaching materials, 96% of students agreed. In summary, each application of the kahoot! platform into the distance- learning curriculum was met with positive reviews and promise for impacting the curriculum. Potential Impact : Remote learning has become the \"new normal\" of 2020. Some of these changes are here to stay, and it behooves us as student educators to think of \"cool\" ways to engage our peers. We hope that by incorporating gamification into distance -learning, it will serve as an adjunct to online lectures, thereby reinforcing concepts and challenging learners. 358References: 1) Singhal S, Hough J, Cripps D, for gamification into medical education', MedEdPublish, 8, [3], 67, https://doi.org/10.15694/mep.2019.000216.1 2) Ismail MA -A, Mohammad JA -M.

DeGroote School of Medicine, McMaster University Problem Statement : Further research is needed to characterize the differences in educational value between virtual and in- person medical conferences. Rationale: As a result of COVID- 19, many medical conferences and other educational sessions have been moved to a virtual platform, or cancelled altogether. Book2Bedside (B2B) is a student- led Internal Medicine conference, hosted at McMaster University annually for medical students acros s Canada, attracting over 100 attendees each year. In accordance with social distancing mandates, B2B adapted to a virtual platform this year. While other studies have shown that virtual conferences improve accessibility and provide a comparable educational experience, further research is required to investigate the differences between virtual and in- person conferences to characterize their educational value. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, demographic and survey data was compared between attendance perspectives for the in- person conference held in 2019 and the virtual conference held in 2020. Both conferences consisted of a series of didactic lectures in the morning followed by an afternoon of small- group workshops. In the survey, attendees reported their agreement to various statements regarding the conferences on a likert scale of 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). Mann -Whitney Test was used to assess for between -group differences. Results: There were 146 attendees at the in -person conference and 200 attendees at the online conference. 32 and 52 responses were gathered for the in -person conference (22% response rate), and virtual conference (26% response rate), respectively. Mann -Whitney Test revealed that learning objectives were better m et for didactic, large group sessions in person (Median = 7) versus virtually (Median = 6), U = 2069.5, p&lt;.05. There was no significant difference in learning objectives being met when comparing in -person workshops (Median = 7) to virtual workshops (Med ian = 6), U = 2060, p =.698. Survey takers agreed that the virtual nature of the conference made it more accessible for attendance, both geographically and financially (M = 6.32, SD = 1.15), and less susceptible to scheduling conflicts (M = 6 .04, SD = 1.14). Survey takers additionally somewhat agreed that the virtual nature of the conference limited their interaction time with residents, other attendees, and faculty (M = 5.04, SD = 1.43). Potential Impact : Results indicate that the virtual co nference appeared to be more financially and geographically accessible to attendees while providing comparable educational value for small group workshops. For didactic lectures, however, learning objectives were better met in person, possibly owing to the perceived reduction in potential for interaction.

Need/Rationale: Due to emergency circumstances of the COVID -19 pandemic, first -year medical students (MS1s) world -wide have not been able to attend gross anatomy (GA) lab in person (1). There are many challenges in converting the traditional in- person GA lab to a remote learning platform, such as organizing a peer -teaching opportunity. Peer- teaching has been shown to improve student -teacher learning outcomes, and verbalizing anatomical concepts is integral to both learning and assessment in the GA lab (2). Peer -teaching a llows students to practice using anatomic terminology , improve their understanding of gross anatomy, receive feedback from faculty, and practice their communication skills in a stress- free environment. To achieve these goals in a remote setting without cha nging the curriculum calendar, we implemented the Rec orded Dyad Presentation (RDP), which allowed MS1s to showcase their skills in a safe environment and improve professional communication. Methods: The RDP was implemented with 210 MS1s over a 5 -week remote GA curriculum on the musculoskeletal system. Each MS1 attended GA lab over Zoom 1 -3 times per week for three hours at a time. The remote lab included: an ungraded quiz, an interactive lab presentation, collaborative work in breakout rooms, and time for questions. Each online section had 34 -37 students and one GA professor. MS1s were randomly assigned virtual anatomy lab tables of 4 -5 students. The RDP assignment included the following: 1) Sign- up: MS1s were advised in the first lab to select a partner from their lab table and sign up for a specific lab on Google Sheets. 2) Instructions: MS1s were provided with an RDP manual that detailed goals, expectations, presentation requirements, and a guide to recording on Zoom. In addition, MS1s received an instructional video and a sample RDP created by two second -year medical students (MS2s). 3) Due dates: Based on each pair's scheduled lab session, the RDP was due the following Monday by 9am. Each pair of MS1s had at least one weekend between learning the materia l and the due date to complete the assignment. 4) Record and submit: MS1s were encouraged to record their presentations via Zoom and to submit on time, as the assignment would reflect their professionalism. 5) Feedback: GA professors were asked to provide MS1s with prompt feedback, using standardized criteri a based on the in -person peer- teaching evaluation form. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We are gathering information from faculty to find out how many students submitted on time and how many students met expectations for the evaluation criteria. 2) Reaction: One week after the completion of all lab sessions, we will send two surveys, one to the MS1s and one to the GA faculty. We will assess perceptions of the usefulness of the RDP from both a student and professor perspective. 3) Learning: We will review the evaluation forms written by faculty to gauge student learning and review MS1 quiz results from each GA lab session to see if student pairs improved during the week of their assigned RDP. 4) Behavior: When the MS1s transition to in -person GA lab, we will send a second round of surveys to both the MS1s and faculty to assess how the RDP assignment may have prepared them for in -person peer- teaching in the context of in -person progressive lab dissection . All dyad presentation guidelines and materials were suggested and prepared by two MS2s in the Medical Educator Pathway who had recently completed two remote learning GA regional units and GA assessments. Their collaboration was critical to both the RDP a nd lab design. Potential Impact : The RDP can be used as a model to implement peer- teaching in a remote learning or in-person format. Flexible and engaging, the RDP promotes active learning and professional development, which is increasingly at risk of becoming more passive due to the COVID -19 pandemic (3). Current plans are to continue the RDP. 361References: 1) Byrnes KG, Kiely PA, JC. contagion: \"Virtualisation\" of anatomy during COVID -19 [published online print, 2020 Jul 10].

Challenges and Opportunities of Preclinical Medical Education: COVID -19 Crisis and Beyond [published online ahead of pm Session 11: COVID -Inspired: Focus on Teaching Techniques , Poster #142 A Novel Virtual Multimodal Lab Structure Without Cadaveric Dissection the new normal: developing a virtual multimodal anatomy lab without cadave ric dissection to teach new medical students remotely. Need/Rationale: Gross anatomy curricula i n particular faced challenges in the emergency transition to remote learning during the Covid -19 public health challenge [1]. While there have been many innovative changes to anatomy teaching over the past decades, the longstandin g practice of cadaveric di ssection has remained the cornerstone of medical anatomy curricula [2]. Existing lab structures based on cadaver dissection required radical transformation [3]. In developing a novel multimodal anatomy curriculum, we considered th e following objectives: 1) to develop knowledge and skill through online distance learning [2]; 2) to ensure that learning modalities are synergistic and complementary to achieve objectives; 3) to develop an efficient and simple lab structure that faculty could implement with minim al additional technical support, and 4) to create formative assessment opportunities for a new summative exam format. A novel anatomy lab structure was designed for medical students who had never been in a dissection lab. This was achieved with the intense collaboration of medical students who had already been through the first months of emergency remote gross anatomy. Methods: The organization of each virtual lab session was: 1) assessment 2) review and preview 3) collaboration 4 ) discussion. Included in each virtual anatomy lab was a formative quiz on previous lab material; an integrative review of answers and preview of lab via PowerPoint presentation with clinical correlations facilitated by the faculty member; virtual dissecti on in breakout rooms using newly created dissection videos matched to an iBook dissection manual, together with a 3D app and re- assembly in main room to discuss difficult concepts and regions. The incoming MS1 student class of 210 was divided into small gr oups consisting of 35 students with anatomy preceptors. Nine three -hour musculoskeletal anatomy lab sessions were held over five weeks. Three faculty repeated each lab twice. Students were assigned to virtual anatomy lab tables of four or five as in the on -campus labs. Students wer e assessed formatively in three formats: short Google quizzes with immediate review of answers, weekly quizzes integrated with other material from the week and lab dyad presentations evaluated, but not graded, by faculty. Formative quizzes were in the same format as the new summative exam structure. Supplementary material for students included an introductory lecture to virtual anatomy and a virtual anatomy toolbox for reference, both developed through collaboration between second year medical students and faculty. Evaluation Plan: The efficacy of virtual anatomy labs is being evaluated using: facilitator guided student focus groups, qualitative surveys on the virtual labs and their components, end of unit ratings and comments usin g the Likert scale, frequency of resource utilization and student performance on the summative practical. Information will be gathered on the quality of time management of the lab session and the ease of learning with the novel structure. These approaches will be utilized to determ ine the strengths and weaknesses of the lab structure, with a focus on the effectiveness of each modality (lab presentations, dyad presentations, formative assessments, team based virtual dissection in breakout rooms, dissection v ideos, dissection manual, faculty discussion, toolbox) and on the impact of the remote learning on student attitude on the value of cadaver dissection to medical education. While supplementary resources such as the toolbox, anatomy lectures, and atlases we re provided to students for use in lab, the usage and utility of these resources is not well known. A survey will be provided to students with a list of these supplementary with Likert scale scoring for their usage habits and the utility of the resource fo r the student. Potential Impact: The current pandemic is viewed by our anatomy team as a major disruption that triggered a permanent transformation in the way we will teach and assess anatomy. The long term 363effects of a cohort of students likely to go through an entire virtual anatomy course with no cadaver dissection or exposure to prosected specimens must be carefully evaluated.

Need/Rationale: Simulation -based education is a widely used tool in emergency medicine (EM) residency curricula. In a survey from 2008, 85% of EM residency programs reported incorporating simulation into their training. (3) However, increasing demand for simulation -based education has resulted in larger learner group sizes, leading to more passive learners during each session. (1) While studies suggest that learning outcomes do not differ between active simulation team leaders and passive observers, learner satisfaction is improved when observers play a more active role. (1,2) Results from our local needs assessment corroborate these findings, as residents felt their educational investment during a simulation session would be greater i f they were given a more active role a s observers. Unfortunately, time, personnel, and resource limitations make it impossible to grant all learners the opportunity to play the role of simulation team leader. In order to ensure that high quality learning o ccurs for both participants as well as observers, we propose the use of sequential team leaders within cases to increase resident engagement in, and active observation during, simulation sessions. Methods: Due to COVID- 19 and social distancing restrictions, our residency simulation curriculum has been converted to a virtual platform. All seventy -six PGY1 through PGY4 emergency medicine residents will participate as sequential case leaders during biweekly virtual simulation sessions held during protected educational conference time. Each simulation module will include residents of the same training level and will consist of two 10 -minute cases and two case -specific 25 -minute debriefing sessions. At the start of each case, two residents will be randomly desig nated to act as simulation team leader s. The remainder of theresident observers will be informed that a second team of two team leaders will be selected midway through the case scenario and will be expected to manage the case until its conclusion. Given th at resident observers will not know whether they are in the \"hot seat\" or when this transition of leadership will happen, they will be forced to be actively engaged in the simulation scenario in case they are selected as the new team leaders . Both active participants and observers will be included in the case debriefs. The use of sequential team leaders during these virtual simulation sessions will draw upon active learning principles to enhance learner motivation and retention of educational material. Evaluation Plan: We will assess learner reaction through use of online surveys sent to participants following each simulation session. Survey questions will gauge resident reactions to the use of sequential team leaders and elicit their perceptions about any increase in educational value or lear ner engagement as a result of this change in format. Additionally, six months after implementation of the sequential team leader model, we will conduct focus groups of mixed PGY levels to qualitatively explore a richer understanding of the learner experien ce in the role of both team leader and \"hot seat\" observer. Potential Impact : As simulation -based education becomes more integrated into EM residency curricula, we must explore creative ways to increase active engagem ent and enhance learning. If the sequential team leader model is effective, it can transform our approach to in -person and virtual simulation sessions within our hospital and other residency training programs.

Need/Rationale: Our internal medicine residents typically undergo a longitudinal simulation curriculum, which has been shown to be beneficial to long -term learning [1]. A recent systematic review of 21 simulation studies also illuminated its potential role in preventing medical errors [2]. We have a robust simulation center complete with high -fidelity mannequins. In a typical year, we host approximately 10 sessions for internal medicine PGY1's and 25 sessions for combined PGY2/3's. Groups of about 4 residents solve various cases while an instructor and simulation technician take them through clinical scenarios that adapt to their medical decisions in real ti me. Each case is followed by a debriefing session with the simulation instructor who highlights the most pertinent learning points based on the residents' actions. Due to new social distancing guidelines from COVID- 19, our simulation curriculum was halted. As a result, we adapted by moving our simulation sessions completely online starting July 2020. Methods: Each 3- 4 hour session covers 3 cases, which have been specifically designed for the level of learner at the session. They employ Zoom video conferenc ing technology using a recurring meeting link that is sent to the learners before each session. One simulation technician is alone at the simulation center displaying a monitor on Zoom while the learners and instructors are on their computers remo tely. The majority of instructors previously received formal training in simulation instruction and debriefing, but no specific training was done in the use of remote simulation. Each session follows a similar format. First, a brief orientation takes place covering the basic expectations of the session, online meeting etiquette, and the limitations of remote simulation. The cases begin with the case stem that is presented to learners from the simulation technician's screen. After the case stem, the learners interact with the patient asking medical questions, requesting exam findings, work -up, and executing treatment plans. A variety of radiology images, point of care ultrasound, and laboratory data are available upon request. A virtual online defibrillator i s also av ailable with the ability to adjust the settings. The instructor maintains a private chat with the simulation technician to modify the clinical status of the patient based on the actions of the learners. After completing the case, the instructor debriefs wi th the learners online in a similar manner as the in -person version. Evaluation Plan: At the close of each residency simulation session, we request completion of an anonymous evaluation form from all learners. The form contains five questions regarding the content of the course and three questions regarding the instructor. All eight questions are scored on a 5 point Likert scale. Example questions include \"The course content was relevant to my training level or practice\" and \"The instructor was effective i n facilitating my learning.\" During the pandemic, we have transitioned our paper evaluations to an online version that the students complete immediately following their online simulation session. Anecdotally, we have received very positive feedback about o ur online simulation forums. As we are still collecting data, we plan to conduct a quantitative comparison of in -person evaluations from prior years and remote evaluations from the 2020 -2021 academic year to see if there are any significant differences in the usefulness of the session or perceptions of the instructor. Through this evaluation, we seek to better understand the beneficial qualities and limitations of remote simulation learning. Potential Impact : We have continued our simulation curri culum whi le adhering to social distancing guidelines and promoting the safety of our participants. Beyond pandemics, remote simulation could bring cognitively engaging learning opportunities to institutions without access to a simulation center such as sma ll reside ncies or even to UCLA global health partners. 367References: 1) Brim, NM. et al.

Need/Rationale: Clinicians are inundated with text information via EMR systems which are a significant source of clinician burn -out. Traditional medical reference resources typically present information in the form of walls of text that can compound cognitive overload during the middle of a busy shift. High -yield medical infographics can shortcut the information retrieval process via easily digestible diagnostic schemas, management algorithms, checklists, decision aids, differential diagnosis lists, pharmacology tables, visual abstracts and much more. There is a vibrant community of clinic ians sharing such Free Open Access Medical Education (#FOAMed) infographics on twitter and other platforms but there is no centralized resource that provides an evergreen repository for quickly finding and referencing these resources at the bedside. Methods : We developed a free online medical education platform at GrepMed.com that allows medical educators to share high yield medical reference infographics. These infographics come in the form of diagnostic schemas, management algorithms, checklists, decisio n aids, differential diagnosis lists, pharmacology reference tables, visual abstracts and much more. We also developed .mp4 video support to allow crowd- sourcing of Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) and physical exam clips. Creators provide short descriptiv e captions, along with a number hashtags to label their content into categories which make them searchable by topic and subject matter.We developed several mechanisms to ensure high levels of content quali ty. A backend editorial interface allows us to monitor and editorialize all submissions to the website. We developed user voting mechanisms in the form of \"like\" and \"bookmark\" features that allow registered users to implicitly vote on the quality of image s that have been contributed to our site. We have a lso added the ability for registered users to add editorial comments to provide additional commentary or to correct inaccurate or outdated information. A mobile friendly web -interface makes it easy for cli nicians to utilize our platform at the bedside. Sea rch engine optimization techniques are employed to index content with major search engines to ensure widespread global discovery and dissemination. Evaluation Plan: We are measuring impact in terms of gro wing traffic, returning users and infographic dissemination. Since launching GrepMed we have seen website traffic double roughly every 6 months to become one of the most visited Free Open Access Medical Education resources online. We have recently crossed over 800 thousand image impressions per day as measured via Google Search Console, with over 100 million image impressions delivered in the past 6 months. We're used in over 190 countries every month, where many providers cannot afford expensive subscripti on medical reference websites. Providers using Grep Med span across medical specialties and members of the healthcare team. Users include attending physicians, residents, pharmacists, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists and EMS providers. Our content is shared widely over social media platforms, with over 22 thousand followers on Instagram and 12k followers on Twitter. By crowd -sourcing content from medical educator contributors, we have been able to build up the largest on line collection of Point of Care Ultrasound videos as well as a unique collection of searchable physical exam video clips for teaching bedside diagnosis. Potential Impact : GrepMed provides an evergreen platform for medical educators to reach audiences rapidly and at a much larger scale than traditional pu blications and conferences. Crowd -sourcing infographics allows us to democratize the medical reference space, while providing a valuable free resource to clinicians across the globe. 369References: 1) Social Media and Free Open Access Medical Education: The Fut ure of Medical and Nursing Education?

McClenaghan, Rachael Eimear; Moore, Charles; Austin, Jill University of Aberdeen, NHS Grampian Idea: To improve engagement amongst medical students with online lear ning resources by using social media \"influence\". Need/Rationale: COVID has necessitated a rapid revolution in how we teach medicine. Most teaching has moved online, resulting in a deluge of new resources available to our learners. Many of these resource s are reproductions of traditional teaching methods, such as presentations with voiceover narration, that have been successful in traditional learning settings. Unfortunately these methods have not translated well to digital delivery, and have poorer efficacy when compared to resources specifically designed for online education (1). Online learning at its best has many unique advantages, such as learne r flexibility and control, which can lead to improved academic outcomes in engaged students (2). However on line learning at its worst overwhelms learners with resources without providing a learning pathway, causing confusion and disengagement (3). Outside of education influencer marketing has been used as a digital answer to \"word of mouth\" advertising which attaches a premium to the individual product to differentiate them in saturated markets (4). We intend to use similar influencer tactics to signpost ou r medical students to curated learning resources, mitigating the novel burden of learning online and improving engagement with medical education. Methods: In the advent of COVID, our fourth year medical students are gaining exposure to clinical specialties through a flipped classroom model, where students attend online lectures and tutorials before joining cli nical attachments. Prior to their anaesthetic attachment, students are expected to have developed their conceptual understanding through their own online learning and by contributing to facilitated tutorials. As a department we have created several tailor -made videos, to replace traditional lectures, which aim to assist students with their own learning. These videos are freely available on YouTube to increase ease of access for students and to support the Free Open Access Meducation (FOAM) movement (5). The intent is that students watch these videos prior to contributing to tutorials and joining their clinical attachment. We plan to use social media platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter, to signpost videos to our students prior to their anaesthetic placem ent. We have created a social media strategy inspired by professional influencers. Our hope is that using social media strategies that are familiar to our modern students, will improve their engagement with online learning, thereby improving engagement with tutorials and clinical placements. Evaluation Plan: We are currently collecting baseline data on engagement with our YouTube videos (this will last six weeks over one clinical attachment). After baseline data collection is complete, we will launch a social media strategy on Instagram for six weeks, during which we will continue to measure engagement with our YouTube videos. We will also measure additional parameters such as Instagram referrals. Throughout this project we will continue to collect both qua ntitative and qualitative feedback from our students in the form of opinion surveys with Likert scales and open text. Students' ability to demonstrate conceptual understanding will be observed in tutorials and clinical attachments, and will hopefully improve in line with social media engagement. Potential Impact : By transitioning to learning delivery methods and models which lever age the advantages of digital delivery, and engaging students through easily accessible platforms, meaningful engagement with learning content will increase resulting in students being better prepared for placements.

Poster Session 12: O nline Resources / Online Teaching Methods , Poster #148 An Online Faculty Resource: Expanding Illness Scripts to Include Determinants of Equity Kucybala, Karolina; Jackson, Molly Blackley University of Washington Idea: We created an online collection of illness scripts that incorporate determinants of equity and formatted for just -in-time clinica l teaching. Need/Rationale: Clinical teaching is impactful when it occurs at the bedside. At the University of Washington (UW), teaching faculty physicians in t he Colleges program guide junior medical students through their first clinical encounters with volunteer patients on the medical wards. Physician teachers with less experience with hospitalized adult patients expressed a need for a teaching resource to use during these early clinical experiences, especially for common diagnoses seen in the hospital setting. At the same time, the medical school was restructuring its curriculum to directly address inequities in healthcare. We created an easy -to-access online collection of illness scripts to serve as a refresher of common hospital diagnoses, a compilation of clinical pearls, and a reminder of physical exam maneuvers - aimed at the junior medical student. Each illness script includes a section on determinants of equity to facilitate conversations around health inequities in the hospital setting (1,2) . Methods: Fifteen illness scripts were created from October 2019 to January 2020. The presenting author gathered a collection of common diagnoses among hospitalized patients from UW School of Medicine College faculty. From this compiled list, the presenting author created illness scripts using resources found through the University of Washington (UW) Health Sciences Library. As the focus of teaching tool was teaching of junior medical students, less specialized resources were used. Textbooks found through UW eBooks, AccessMedicine, and Clinical Key were often used as references for the illness scripts due to the general overview provided for illnesses in the texts. Pu bMed was used to find primary literature and research about health equity for each of the diagnoses. After the first several illness scripts were produced, select College faculty who had requested a teaching aid were asked for their feedback, and the scripts were revised. Google Sites was chosen as the platform to shar e the completed illness scripts to facilitate mobile use of the teaching tool. After the creation of the website, faculty was again asked for their opinions. The final teaching resource can be found on https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/modifiedillnessscripts/home. IRB exemption was obtained to survey faculty on their experience with the teaching tool. Evaluation Plan: Fifteen online illness scripts were shared with faculty in February 2020. Unfo rtunately, due to the COVID pandemic, in- hospital instruction of medical students was deferred for several months. With the start of the academic year this September 2020, the optional tool was shared with College faculty as well as clerkship directors (to share with faculty teaching students on clerkships). After seve ral months of use, a brief online survey will be sent to teaching faculty in December 2020. The survey gathers demographic data of the educator, how often the tool was used, and faculty member s' perspectives on the ease of use and effectiveness of the tool , particularly for aiding in discussions of determinants of equity on a five -point Likert scale. The survey also has a free response section for any feedback or suggestions of improvement. The responses will be analyzed all together as well as in sub - groups based on specialty and years of teaching experience. Potential Impact : The online tool will allow faculty to provide effective just -in-time teaching for junior medical students on the medic al wards. In addition, incorporating determinants of equity into clinical teaching has the potential to integrate health equity content more seamlessly and effectively into medical education. 373References: 1) Siegel, Jennifer, David L.

Need/Rationale: Throughout medical school, medical students are introduced to a wealt h of medical jargon they have not learned about previously. A study found 70% of medical students relied on Google for looking up unfamiliar biomedical knowledge. Anatomical structure na mes, pathology imaging descriptions, medication names, medical disease s, terminologies, and abbreviations are examples students would come across in online medical knowledge databases, patient charts, or textbooks. Aside from anatomy atlases, medical textb ooks are text- heavy with occasional interspersed images. A study revealed 60% of medical students are multimodal learners via the VARK (Visual, Aural Read/Write, Kinesthetic) instrument assessment. When images are not available in a textbook, searching for images online is beneficial for multimodal learners. Access to E- books also increases the likelihood of directly searching unfamiliar terms on the internet via copy -pasting. Currently, a user would need to 1) highlight the text 2) copy the text 3) open an internet browser 3) click on the search field 4) paste the text 5) pr ess search 6) click on the search engine's \"Images\" link. Cumulatively, these steps are time -consuming and repetitive. Methods: A free, open -source background -running application for Mi crosoft Windows was created to monitor predefined keyboard shortcuts. When Ctrl+; is pressed, any user -highlighted text in the active desktop window (e.g. PDF reader, internet browser, electronic medical record system, or any desktop application) is copied , an internet browser is automatically launched (or a new browser tab is created if the internet browser is already opened), and the text is searched on the search engine. The user immediately reaches the search engine's text results page. When Ctrl+' is p ressed, any text highlighted in the active desktop window is copied an d the user is immediately brought to the search engine's images results page to view images associated with the text highlighted. With the application running in the background, a user w ould only need to 1) highlight the text 2) press Ctrl+; to search for a text definition or Ctrl+' to search for images. Evaluation Plan: Positive feedback was received from students who have downloaded and utilized the application. Cumulative time on sear ching 10 terms for definitions and 10 terms for images using a cold - launch format (internet browser not running) without the application averaged 2 minutes and 49 seconds over 5 trials. Cumulative time of the same test utilizing keyboard shortcuts with the background- running application averaged 43 seconds over 5 trials. Uti lizing the application resulted in 75% decrease in time to search a term. Future analysis of student academic performance, such as using USMLE Step or NBME Shelf scores, against frequenc y in utilization of the keyboard -shortcut monitoring application can be accomplished with informed consent and modification of the current application to track search counts via the application. The author predicts a positive correlation between number of searches and academic performance. Potential Impact : With medical stu dents looking up numerous terms for definitions or images throughout their curriculum, the benefit of utilizing an application that results in a 75% time saving in accomplishing the sear ch task can be realized. All learners, not only limited to medical stu dents, can benefit from this tool that assists users to be more efficient. References: 1) Judd T, et al. Expediency -based practice?

Need/Rationale : Public health concerns during spring 2020 have exposed a need for a barrier -free online medical education delivery system that promotes learner collaboration. Remote teaching was established in a rapid fashion, and theory - and best practice -based, acti ve education - was re- established using discussion boards and other means to promote learner collaboration. However, while institutional learning management systems (LMSs) were available for institutional learners, innovative solutions were needed to discuss educational content independently. We developed the medical education blog eBite to deliver content that is easy to access from anywhere on any device. Contextualized by sociocultural and constructivist theories, a community of learners establishes rapi dly as participants answer content- specific questions and exchange reflections and opinions [2]. Comparable to a discussion -board thread, learners' comments can be moderated as they reply to general questions and each other's views. Furthermore, the educational blog is versatile to support any teaching style and provides content as a standalone collaborative exercise or during a class session for use in, e.g., breakout groups, or as pre -work for a flipped classroom. Methods: eBite will serve the needs of medical education learners. Established at a free Weebly site (https://www.weebly.com/), the site allows administrators to publish blog content using multiple types of media and display options, thereby supporting a variety of learning styles. Comment moder ation is available to review and approve comments, if needed. As opposed to standard discussion board threads in LMSs, an engaging display usin g, e.g., text, videos, or surveys, can stimulate a rich discussion of the content. As an added benefit, the site is open to the public and non -course faculty, and public comments can enhance the discussion through fresh ideas and viewpoints. Comparable to discussion board grading, blog discussion can be graded using rubrics. The effectiveness of this blog will be determined using a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations (mixed- method research). We plan to use a post- event evaluation to inquire about satisfaction, collaboration, exchange of ideas, and ease of use using a 5- point Likert -type survey, wit h the following scale and anchors: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4=Agree, and 5=Strongly Agree. We will also include narrative questions aimed at obtaining additional insights: (1) Please comment on what you experienced as the most effective strategy for collaboration in educational blogs; and (2) Please provide any suggestions for improvement on the experience of using educational blogs for learning. Evaluation Plan: A task- oriented evaluation plan includes (1) evaluation need; (2) evaluation focus; (3) evaluation methodology; (4) presentation of evaluation results; and (5) implementation of evaluation results [3]. The need and focus of the evaluation of the educational blog is twofold and include (1) determining the effectiveness of delivering barrier -free, ease of access educational content; and (2) measuring learner collaboration. A mixed -method resea rch framework will be applied to not only measure the effectiveness of the educational blog but also provide a voice to stu dy participants. We plan to disseminate the evaluation results locally and also report nationally and internationally at medical education conferences. Written feedback from participants will assist the administrators in customizing content to meet user ne eds and improve the overall experience. Evaluation results will be used to determine and implement changes to improve the effectivene ss of the blog. Potential Impact : Medical education learners worldwide will benefit from the innovative and thought - provoking educational blog eBite. Using multimedia display options and blog functionality, learners of all levels can connect with each oth er and participate in a growing community that will expand knowledge and broaden learning experiences. 377References: 1) Musick, D.

Need/Rationale: When patients do not understand their provider's counseling, they are less likely to understand their disease process and treatment plan, which may make them more likely to make suboptimal healthc are decisions (1). Effective physician- patient communication is a key factor in improving health outcomes. Physicians who use figurative language that grounds their counseling in ideas familiar to the patient are rated by patients as better communicators (2). Medical metaphors and analogies, \"mediphors,\" are a pos sible way for providers to explain concepts in a way that is understandable for patients with low health literacy or different world views. However, there is no single mediphor for any medical con cept that ensures a patient's comprehension. As such, mediphors are seldom taught in medical education. Healthcare providers may benefit from having a repertoire of mediphors at their disposal so they may adapt their communication style for different patients. One way to share mediphors between colleagues and to students is through the resource Mediphors: a dynamic, mobile collection of mediphors that physicians and students can contribute to and use to search for ideas to improve their counseling, and for patients to explore health concepts. Methods: We crea ted the instagram account @mediphors to develop, catalogue, and distribute mediphors. Each week we post a mediphor displayed as a visual aid: a written explanation over an image. In the caption, the mediphor is explained further. An example of a posted mediphors reads \"Targeted gene therapies are keys that can turn off the engine of cancer.\" We then administered a survey to physicians (goal n=50) via Zoom or phone in order to assess their use and valuati on of mediphors as a clinical counseling tool. Physici ans were asked about their patient populations, the role of mediphors in their counseling, to produce examples of mediphors they use, and for examples of medical concepts that patients find particularly difficult. Physicians were asked about their likelihood of using a Mediphor resource, if the mediphors they provided could be included, and if they would like attribution. Additionally, we continue to add to and build out the @mediphors instagram using th e mediphors and input provided by the interviewed physicians. Evaluation Plan: The survey results will be described using simple descriptive statistics. Factors that will be described include the proportion of physicians using mediphors, how often they use them, the level to which value them, and how likely physicians are to use the described Mediphors resource. This will provide a sense of how useful mediphors are in clinical counseling and whether or not there is a need or desire for a Mediphors database . Additionally, the bank of mediphors collected during the interviews will be evaluated to determine which areas of medicine are deficient in mediphors. This information combined with the list of concepts that physicians cite as being particularly challeng ing to explain to patients will provide a target for a reas that should be built out during the development of the Mediphors database. Potential Impact : If physicians value mediphors and will engage with the resource, the instagram can transition into a se archable platform for physicians, students, and patien ts to engage with. And this information can be shared with curriculum departments, so metaphorical language can be emphasized during patient encounters in the first years of medical education.

Can metaphors and analogies improve communication with seriously ill patients? J Poster Session 12: Online R esources / Online Teaching Methods , Poster #152 The Online Pediatric Education Network (OPEN) Dickhoner, James; Espinoza, Juan Children's Hospital Los Angeles Idea: Validate continuing medical education courses for clinicians in Armenia by linking a le arning management system with an electronic health records . Need/Rationale: Most physicians and nurses in Armenia have a desire to practice evidence based medicine and use data to guide their practice, but lack the tr aining to apply medical evidence to their practice making it difficult for clinicians to stay up to date (1, 2, 3, 4). This can be at least in part attributed to the Soviet Era Semashko system's approach to medical education (5). A secondary problem is the limited access to electronic health records, which makes it nearly impossible to evaluate the impact of education intervention on patient outcomes. Despite a government led national EHR system, as of 2019, no health- care facility had successfully transiti oned off of paper records (6). This paucity of data inhibits the ability for professional associations, international aid organizations, and institutions of higher learning to target medical education to the areas of greatest need. Armenian physicians have a positive perception of the usefulness and a positive attitude towards EHR technology (6). Given these facts and our early success implementing both an EMR and LMS, we propose to link the two in order to create a practice- and outcomes- driven medical education platform for Armenian providers. Methods: Our project is based on Avetis (EHR) and LearnwithOPEN (LMS system for CMEs) that have been developed as part of the ongoing partnership between Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Armenia. We intend to sta rt this project in 2021 and complete it by 2024. Avetis currently has 22,000 records for children in Armenia. LearnwithOPEN currently has 40 hours of online content with four CME courses under development and 382 registered users. By the launch of this pro ject, we anticipate having over 100,000 records in Avetis. LearnwithOPEN will have approximately 40 certified CME courses for general pediatrics. Study Site: This will take place at a large pediatric clinic in Yerevan that uses Avetis. Phase 1 - Customized learning plans: We will enroll a coh ort of clinicians to generate customized learning plans that recommend six CME courses based on a provider's patient population and relative outcomes data. We will track learner perceptions and likeability of the progra m through qualitative and quantitative methods. Phase 2 - Course Validation: We will investigate if our courses change practice behavior by enrolling a second cohort of clinicians. Based on learnings from phase 1, we will generate modified learning plans f or each enrolled learner. After completing the learning plans, we will spend 12 months tracking each clinicians' practice patterns through the EMR system to determine if they are appropriately applying the guidance from their CME courses. Evaluation Plan: Phase 1: We expect to enroll 10 heal thcare professionals Each learner will complete at least five of the recommended courses within three months. We will utilize the existing analytics from LearnwithOPEN to benchmark and collect statistics around completion percentage, likeability through NPS and other qualitative methods. We expect each learner to take a different set of courses but will be able to compare their assessment outcomes on a particular topic with those of the broader LearnwithOPEN audience. We believe learners who use a customized learning plan, as opposed to other pediatricians who access LearnwithOPEN to complete courses that are more relevant to their patient population. Phase 2: We expect to enroll 15 clinicians in the second cohort who wor k in the same practice environment. We anticipate similar completion numbers to phase 1. After twelve months, we will create an aggregated, anonymized data set of patients' medical records treated by each individual medical professional. We will analyze th at data and use historical records prior to this study as a comparison to determine if learners are applying the guidance from the CME courses. Potential Impact : This project will explore the feasibility of using EHR data to customize continuing medical education. If successful, we will work to automate this approach to make it available for all medical professionals in Armenia. Additionally, both Avetis and LearnwithOPEN are built on open -source platforms to enable others to replicate our approach. 381 References: 1) Aripov T, Aniyozova D, Gorbuno va I.

Rationale: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative retina l disease which affects premature infants and is a leading cause of childhood blindness around the world. In low and middle income countries (LMICs) increasing numbers of newborns are surviving infancy and prematurity due to advances in neonatal care. As more neonates survive, there is an increase in the incidence of ROP and therefore the need for care. Unfortunately, there is a lack of trained special ists to manage ROP in LMICs. Technology has been used successfully to combat workforce shortages and enhanc e training paradigms for screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Knowledge sharing networks and social media have leveraged technology to enhance educat ional discourse, consultation, and collaboration between physicians and care providers, internationally. He re we present our findings for using a Facebook virtual examination room (VER) to train Armenian ophthalmologists to screen, diagnose, and treat ROP. Methods: Armenian ophthalmologists (trainees) are trained by international specialists (preceptors) through case- based consultation on ROP using a VER lasting from November 2012 to December 2018. Cases are presented as posts by trainees accompanied by Re tCam images and information such as gestational age and birthweight. In each post, trainees and preceptors comment on the subject's ROP: stage, zone, plus disease, and treatment. The posts are analyzed quantitatively for group, participant activity, and cl inical metrics. Group utilization metrics are extracted from HTML data using a customized python script for quantifying the number of: posts, likes, comments, views, and participants. Participant utilization metrics for preceptors and trainees are also ext racted using a script to quantify the number of: posts, posts liked, comments, and comments liked. Additionally, data is further analyzed to evaluate how actively involved trainees and preceptors are. Clinical metrics for ROP are analyzed manually for birthweight, gestational age, stage, zone, plus disease, and treatment. Furthermore, comments for each post are analyzed qualitatively for common themes and agreement on clinical findings or recommendations. Results: Preliminary results of group utilization show 221 posts from 2012 to 2018 with an average of 1.4 likes, 2.37 comments, 3.6 views, and 0.72 comments for those with engagement. Participant activity metrics show that trainees made 216 posts with 64 likes on those posts. They also made 65 comments with 25 likes on them. Preceptors made 0 posts with 0 post likes. They also made 93 comments which received 91 likes. 9 remaining posts were made by observers which received 7 likes. Observers also made 65 comments and received 25 likes. Particip ant activity will be evaluated based on the following scenarios per post: 2 preceptors commented, at least 2 trainees co mmented, and at least 2 observers commented. Clinical metrics show that 120 cases were posted. 114 cases included birthweight, with an average of 1229 \u00b1 341 g. Gestational age is available for 115 subjects with an average of 31 \u00b1 5 weeks. Specific breakdow n of stage, zone, plus disease, and treatment opinions will be tallied by parsing through each post and categorizing accordingly. Stage ranges from 1 -5 and zone ranges from 1 -3. Plus disease can be pre- plus, plus, or minus. Treatment options include: Avastin, laser, and other (I/V injections, hemodialysis, vitrectomy). Qualitative analysis of the content includes reviewing each comment for conversation themes. In addition, agreement or disagreement over diagnosis, staging, and treatment recommendations in e ach post will be evaluated by reviewing the comments. Potential Impact : The Virtual Examination Room is a feasible and engaging tool to enhance ROP training. While our focus has been on global health applications, US programs may benefit from similar tools that engage trainees and practicing professionals in more informal, multimedia settings. 383References: 1) Patel SN, Martinez -Castellanos MA, Berrones -Medina D, et al.

(1,3) (1) Harvard Medical School; (2) McMaster University; (3) Massachusetts General Hospital Problem Statement : There is a need to increase online user engagement with medical publication s and research. Rationale: In the digital age of publication and era of social media, there is an increased need for precise and concise reporting of medical manuscripts to educate students, physicians, and other health professionals. 2MinuteMedicine.com has utilized text summaries/abstracts (TAs) since 2012 to provide curated reports for educational purposes and has more recently started utilizing visual abstracts (VAs) as a way of summarizing key study findings in a visual form. Other studies have shown that visual abstracts increase traffic to full -length journal articles when published on social media. However, there is an ongoing question of whether VAs increases user engagements over TAs since both are designed as quick reading material. Methods: In this case -control study, we used Twitter to publish 18 pairs of VAs and TAs in order to investigate the effect of VAs on user engagement. Each VA/TA pair was published on the same day, covered the same content and had the same title on Twitter; posts for TAs had a nondescript control image and link to a text abstract, while VA posts had a partial preview and link to the full VA. The outcomes studied were views, engagement rate, and percent change in engagement rate. An online survey was also sent to users o f 2MinuteMedicine.com to assess self -reported preferences for VAs versus TAs. On the survey, users reported their agreement to various statements about infograhics versus text summaries using a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (stron gly agree). Results: Results from Twitter showed that while there was no difference in the number of views on Twitter (p=0.83), VAs had significantly higher engagement rates (p=0.002), with an average fold change of 2.75 (95% CI 1.83 to 3.67). In terms of the survey, a total of 130 responses were collected. Survey takers reported that they would be more likely to remember information presented to them in an infographic instead of in a text summary (mean 4.05, SD 0.08), that they would be more likely to share infographics than text summaries (mean 3.81, SD 0.10), that they found information presented in an infographic form comparable to that in a text summary (mean 4.11, SD 0.08), and that they would be more likely to open emails containing an infographic or picture (mean 4.00, SD 0.10). Potential Impact : Our results show that Twitter posts containing previews and links to VAs had more user engagement than posts with no visual content and links to TAs, which suggests that VAs are effective tools for promoting engagement with medical content on social media. Our survey results also indicate user preference for information presented in a visual form. References: 1) Ibrahim, Andrew M. MD, MSc*; Lillemoe, Keith D. MD; Klingensmith, Mary E.

To mirror their experience on pediatric wards, we created a table top simulation of inpatient rounds. Need/Rationale: Given the AAMC's recommendation to remove medical students from the clinical arena as the COVID -19 pandemic unfolded, we were put into the unique position of re -imagining the pediatric clerkship to ensure medical student engagement and lea rning. As such, we pulled from table top simulation to allow for fictitious, but near real experience, on the pediatrics wards so as to avoid any significant break in th e trajectory of our learners. Table top simulation is an educational tool that allows learners to apply knowledge and skills through formal discussion of real -life scenarios when hands on training is not practical or available. This methodology has long be en used by emergency management response teams and public health organizations in the preparation of disasters. We query that the outcome of this exercise, in the setting of remote learning, will accurately mirror inpatient rounds, allow for teaching opportunities for faculty and ultimately result in increased confidence of learners when the y re-enter the clinical arena. Methods: We conducted a needs assessment to identify similar curricula in the literature and found none within the databases we searched (PubMed, APPD Shareware House, MedEd Portal). The paucity of published literature demonstrated the need for quick, but thoughtful, development of a robust virtual curriculum given the unknowns surrounding the COVID -19 pandemic. We first chose five clinical scenarios (neonatal jaundice, culture negative sepsis, acute asthma ex acerbation, abdominal pain, foreign body) and created electronic medical records for each patient that included documentation, vital signs, ins and outs, labs and imaging. We also desig ned a sign- out that the medical students would be given the morning of \"rounds\" by the \"night team.\" Finally, an instructor's guide with teaching points and a formal evaluation rubric were created. Medical students were split into groups of five, and the e vening before rounds, they were sent one liners about the cases they would be presenting the following morning, in addition to a link for the virtual platform. Upon \"arriving\" to rounds, medical students were given sign -out and provided 30 minutes to pre -round. After 30 minutes, the attending arrived and the team began rounds, as they would in person. Evaluation Plan: Learners were afforded an opportunity for formal and anonymous feedback via Qualtrics, while faculty were asked to provide real time feedbac k via email. Themes for improvement were identified from faculty emails and informal conversations with participating medical students which informed the second iteration of the activity. Following the second round of this simulated experience, we again requested feedback from both faculty and learners in the same manner as before. As medical students have now returned to the clinical space, we are creating a survey to assess perceived confidence on pediatric inpatient rounds for students who participated i n the virtual rounding curriculum as compared to those who did not. Potential Impact : Primary impact will be in medical students expressing that this experience mirrors rounds. Secondary impact will be that students who participate in this activity percei ve increased confidence when rejoining in person rounds as compared to colleagues who did not participate in this experience.

Poster #157 Virtual Peer to Pe er Teaching Patel, Dipal R.; Goldberg, Tamara Mount Sinai Morningside - Mount Sinai West Hospitals and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Problem Statement : The COVID- 19 pandemic in New York City disrupted the traditional model of in - person academic activities for our graduate medical trainees. Rationale: The COVID- 19 pandemic led many graduate medical education programs to cancel or restructure in -person didactic sessions. While online sessions allow fo r some interactivity and social distancing, their format is typically passive and teacher driven. Technological issues, user discomfort, monotony of structure, and lack of engagement can all contribute to disruption of the learning environment. Alterations in resident and faculty schedules nec essitate new and innovative teaching strategies to reach all learners, regardless of physical location, during their ambulatory rotation. Novel methods of virtual learning are essential to combat these challenges and to better engage trainees as both learners as well as virtual teachers. The solution we sought to utilize is a peer- to-peer virtual teaching strategy. We hope that through taking ownership of a topic and utilizing technology, resident learners will innovatively engage their peers while deliveri ng core ambulatory content. Methods: On day 1 of their ambulatory rotation block, Internal Medicine residents were asked to select a topic from a designated list. Topics were curated by ambulatory faculty with a focus on primary care; they were narrow in scope and capable of being presented in 10 -15 minutes, depending on the platform. They were also provided with a list of potential virtual platforms to choose from with specific examples. Each resident was assigned a faculty mentor for the project. Residents had 1 week to complete a draft of the project and submit for review. After appropriate review and editing by the faculty, the project was considered ready for presentation. Residents are then able to access these projects from the program's education website. After completion of the project, residents were asked to evaluate their experience. Faculty members reviewed each project on creativity and educational content with a focus on pedagogical innovation. Each project can be evaluated by resident peers on creativity and educational content. Results: Over a period of three 2 -week block rotations, a total of 38 residents participated in this curricular activity. While the majority of the residents chose to use slide presentation, there were significant att empts at modifying these with narration and embedded videos for physical exam demonstrations. However, other educational methods were used including podcasts, infographics, tutorials, music videos, and a choose your adventure style medical case. Sixteen ou t of 38 participants also completed the self -evaluation. Overwhelmingly, 13 (81.3%) residents stated they would do the project again and 14 (87.6%) found the activity high yield in learning about an ambulatory topic. There was also an opportunity to provide free text comments and were generally enthusiastic in their desire to continue the project. Potential Impact : This curricular innovation was implemented to fill a void created by the social distancing rules. This project was well received, and many requ ested it to continued. Three residents commented on how learning the technology was difficult for them. Going forward, resident knowledge of the various platforms will be assessed before implementation.

Need/Rationale: Pre-clerkship medical students have limi ted exposure to clinical pediatric experiences. This year, opportunities have been further curtailed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Our medical students interested in pursuing a career in pediatrics d esire earlier exposure to pediatric medicine, and our pediatric residents desire more opportunities to improve their teaching skills. We created the Medical Student Report (MSR), a collaborative effort with the Pediatric Interest Group and pediatric reside ncy program to meet both groups of learners' needs in a v irtual setting. We structured the MSR based on key learning principles to achieve the following goals: 1. Learners' developmental level was central in presentation development to encourage a respectful learning environment 2. Participants shared responsibi lity in creating sessions tailored to their own experience and interests, implementing self - directed learning 3. Active participation was encouraged during each session so that learners collaborated and applied knowledge. During this pandemic, where clinical experiences are restricted, the MSR provides an opportunity for students and residents to increase their pediatric knowledge and teaching skills in a safe environment. Methods: One -hour, weekly M SR sessions take place over Zoom videoconferencing with o ne pre- clerkship medical student presenter, one pediatric resident presenter, and voluntary attendees (medical students and residents of all years). These sessions include: 1) Joint presentation by a pre-clerkship student and resident: This presentation is prepared prior to the session through collaborative efforts between the resident and student. The student is responsible for the basic science material of the presentation while the resident provides a pediatric case that applies these basic science conce pts. 2) Case- based instruction: The case includes all aspects of a clinical encounter (history, exam, diagnostics). Open- ended questions are used to elicit active participation, clinical reasoning, and discussion among attendees. 3) Review: A case summary, highlighting the underlying pathology and science, is provided by the student presenter. This allows the student to foster teaching skills and apply basic science knowledge to a clinical scenario. 4 ) Feedback: At the end of the MSR, the student presenter receives feedback on his/her teaching skills from the resident presenter and MSR attendees. Overall, the MSR format promotes open discussion that is mutually beneficial for medical students and pediatric residents. Students learn the clinical pearls of com mon pediatric cases, and residents review the science and pathophysiology of these cases as they mentor the students. Evaluation Plan: 1) Accountability: We will track the MSR attendance and degree of active participation among attendees at each session. 2) Reaction: MSR will be evaluated on a weekly basis through administration of surveys. Surveys for the presenters will include Likert scales that evaluate their perceived value of creating and presenting a case. Surveys for attendees will include Likert scales that assess how the session impacted their interest in pediatrics, their comfort level with pediatric knowledge, and their feelings of preparedness for pediatric clerkships. 3) Learning: Open -ended questions regarding what attendees learned and what they hope to learn in future sessions will be included in the weekly surveys. Open -ended questions will also be asked to presenters regarding confidence in the session's content and barriers towards creating the presentation. 4) Behavior: Past MSR attendees will receive a follow -up survey halfway through their clerkships to evaluate whether MSR had an effect on their clinical skills when encountering real pediatric cases. Potential Impact : Despite th e current limitations on pre -clerkship clinical exposure, the MSR allows medical students to foster clinical reasoning and self -directed learning through simulated, virtual clinical cases. If successful, these sessions can continue post -pandemic and can serve as a model for other institutions to develop critical -thinking caregivers. 389 References: 1) Held MR.

Implementation Date: FY 15 - 16 Last Revision Date: September 201 5 458 Office of Continuing Medical Education CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY IN CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION POLICY INTRODUCTION: The Accreditation Council of Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) expects accredited providers to operate business and management policies and procedures of their CME program so that their obligations and commitments are met. As part of this accreditation requirement, the ACCME expects that accredited providers located in California will be in compliance with all applicable California state laws regarding continuing medical education delivered in California. CA A .B. 1195 requires that cultural and linguistic competencies are incorporated into the formulation and planning of Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs. The Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California Office of Continuing Medical Education incorporates cultural and linguistic competencies in the formulation and planning of Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses in order to maintain, develop, or increase the knowledge, skills, and professional performance that a physician uses to provide care, or improve the quality of care provided for patients. POLICY: Educational activities should include, but are not limited to, the following criteria: 1. Scientific or clinical content with direct bearing on the quality or cost-effective provision of patient care, community or public health, or preventive medicine; 2. Quality assurance or improvement, risk management, health facility standards, or the legal aspects of clinical medicine; 3. Bioethics or professional ethics; 4. Strategies to improve the physician-patient relationship. A.B. 1195 provides for three ways to comply with the law: 1. Address cultural competency, a set of integrated attitudes, knowledge, and skills that enables a health care professional to care effectively for patients from diverse cultures, groups, and communities. Items to be addressed include linguistic skills, cultural information to establish therapeutic relationships, cultural data in diagnosis and treatment, and cultural and ethnic data applying to the process of clinical care. To comply with the cultural competency requirement, an activity should include one or more of the following: a. applying linguistic skills to communicate effectively with the target population; b. utilizing cultural information to establish therapeutic relationships; c. eliciting and incorporating pertinent cultural data in diagnosis and treatment; d. understanding and applying cultural and ethnic data to the process of clinical care.Implementation Date: FY 15 - 16 Last Revision Date: September 201 5 4592.Address linguistic competency, the ability of a physician to provide patients who do not speak English or who have limited ability to speak English with direct communication in the patient's primary language. To comply with the linguistic competency requirement, an activity may incorporate translation/interpretation resources and/or strategies into activity materials. 3. Provide review and explanation of relevant federal and state laws and regulations regarding linguistic access. EXEMPTION: At the activity site, KSOM OCME will provide supporting documents and resources to the physicians, including, but not limited to, handouts, websites, patient education, and local resources. Continuing medical education activities that are exempt from these requirements include those activities solely dedicated to research and other activities that do not contain patient care components (such as leadership). IMPLEMENTATION / MONITORING: Documentation of compliance will be presented on the application and/or planning form for the CME activity. This policy will be included in the planning packet for activity directors and faculty so that the program and presentations will comply with the law.

It also has an impact on the patient's feelings about being respected (or disrespected) as an individual, a member of a family, and a member of a cultural group. Cultural competence begins with an honest desire not to allow biases to keep us from treatin g every individual with respect. It requires an honest assessment of our positive and negative assumptions about others. An organization can help its health care professionals begin to gain cultural competence through formal training, but for most people c ultural competence takes consistent individual practice over time. http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=4.0.htm&module=provider&language=English&ggroup=& mgroup = Guide to Culturally Competent Health Care Be prepared for the culturally rich and diverse world of healthcare.

This guide, which is based on the panel's findings, provides these resources for educators and researchers an inventory of the research studies that assess the outcomes of cultural competence education and training, four recommended strategies to advance the research and evaluation, a Cultural Competence Assessment Tool Checklist, along with a guide to using the tool, to help educators and research measure facets of cultural competence in published assessment tools and an overview of three evaluation approaches for curriculum development and evaluation . Assessing Change: Evaluating Cultural Competence Education and Training AAMC Tool for Assessing Cultural Competence Training With increasing diversity in the U.S. population and strong evidence of disparities in health care, it is critically important that health care professionals are specifically educated on how their own and their patients' demographic (e.g., gender, income, race and ethnicity, etc.) and cultural (e.g., language, religion, etc.) factors influence health, health care delivery and health behaviors. In 2000, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) introduced two standards about cultural competence that inspired medical schools to introduce cultural competence education into the undergraduate curriculum. TACCT will help in that effort. TACCT is a self-administered assessment tool that can be used by medical schools to examine all components of the entire medical school curriculum. TACCT enables schools to identify gaps and redundancies in their curricula, which will enable schools to make the best use of opportunities and resources. The TACCT can be used for both traditional and problem-based curricula.

Disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender, condition, age and socio -economic status. The American Medical Association provides links for activities to eliminate health disparities, commission to end health care disparities, and research finding and recommendations. As well as an inspirational program for new generation of physicians called Doctors Back to School. http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/public- health/eliminating-health-disparities.page Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care The Institute of Medicine researched the extent of disparities in the types and quality of health services received by U.S. racial and ethnic minorities and non-minorities; explore factors that may contribute to inequities in care; and recommend policies and practices to eliminate these inequities. The report from that study, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, found that a consistent body of research demonstrates significant variation in the rates of medical procedures by race, even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions are comparable. IOM Treatment OMH Minority Population Health Statistics The Office of Minority Health is dedicated to improving the health of racial and ethnic minority populations through the development of health policies and programs that will help eliminate health disparities.
