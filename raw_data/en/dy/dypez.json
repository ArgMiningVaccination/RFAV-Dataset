These guidelines are consistently evaluated and informed by t he guidance of PHA an d the BC government, WSBC/OHSA and the CNPBC. Updates will be communicated through CCNM email communication. Effective prevention measures are in place across campus to prevent communicable diseases including COVID -19 from spreading. During periods of elevated risk where Public Health officials issue guidance, notices, or orders related to our region and industry, CCNM - Boucher Campus will take steps to implement appropriate measures in accordance with the guidance of Public Health. This may mean a reinstatement of any or all requirements we have previously had or implementation of new measures. The CCNM - Boucher Campus Guidelines are intended to provide effective measures to reduce the risk of communicable disease transmission in o ur campus community, and the greater community at large . Preventing the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID -19, influenza, norovirus, and others through direct or indirect transmission relies on everyone doing their part including immunization, self-monitoring , staying home when sick, wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene and physical distancing where possible. As a Post-secondary institution that provides medical training and Naturopathic Medic al care , the changes that were made to comply with the Ministry of Health, Public Health and CNPBC guidelines to provide in person care are still in place. Naturopathic medicine is an essential service in British Columbia and w e will continue to provide in person patient care and Academic i nstruction as is safe to do so. Key Information 1. ID FOB cards should be worn while on campus and used by everyone to enter campus . 2. Face masks are re commended but not required EXCEPT: 2.1. Surgical masks are required for the duration of a cademic practical classes and in all Boucher clinics (campus and external satellite clinics) by faculty, staff, and students. 2.1.1. There are no exemptions for students , faculty or staff who are delivering clinical care or who are participating in practicums. 2.1.1.1. If an accommodation request is submitted to the college, it may involve an extended time period for completion of the naturopathic program, so that activities can be resumed when the mask mandate is no longer in place 2.2. The use of face shields or eye goggles , however, is subject to the supervisor's discretion and is not required. 4 2.3. Clinic patients will continue to be supplied with surgical masks for use for the duration while in the clinic 2.3.1. There are no exceptions for patients to not wear a medical mask. Virtual care is available for patients who are not able to wear a mask. 3. PPE requirements may be superseded by policies and/or formal instruction within any CCNM -BC Satellite clinics where there are more stringent requirements in place . 4. Clinic interns and supervisors will wear disposable gowns at their discretion, except when performing intravenous infusion therapy or phlebotomy. 5. Full COVID -19 Vaccination is mandatory for staff, clinicians, and faculty at CCNM -BC clinics (campus and satellite) as per the provincial government requirement for PSI providing healthcare training . 6. We will continue to offer virtual care for patients as we are able, and restrictions for in person care will be lifted except for patients exhibiting communicable disease sy mptoms, such as those of COVID -19. 7. All clinic supervisors and interns are required to attend their clinical rotations in person or as required if safety measures must be implemented . 7.1. If an intern is in isolation but well enough to see patents virtually, they may do so, with authorization from the Associate Dean of Clinic al Studies (kfairman@ccnm.edu). 8. The duration of self -isolation following a Positive COVID -19 test or symptoms of communicable disease including COVID -19: 8.1.1. For vaccinated persons you can end isolation when all 3 of these conditions are met: 8.1.1.1. At least 5 days have passed since your symptoms started, or from the test date if you did not have symptoms. 8.1.1.2. Fever has resolved without the use of fever -reducing medication, such as acetaminoph en or ibuprofen. 8.1.1.3. Symptoms have improved for a minimum of 48 hrs . 8.1.2. For unvaccinated people you can end isolation when all three of these conditions are met: 8.1.2.1. At least 10 days have passed since your symptoms started, or from the day you tested positive if you did not have symptoms. 8.1.2.2. Fever has resolved without the use of fever -reducing medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. 8.1.2.3. Symptoms have improved for a minimum of 48 hrs . 8.1.3. With a NEGATIVE COVID -19 test but symptomatic, you need to s tay home until symptoms have improved for a minimum of 48 hrs. 8.1.3.1. An image of the negative test result(cassette) with name, date and time must be submitted to the CMO prior to returning to campus. 9. Occupancy limits are at normal usage, however physically distancing is recommended whenever possible. 10. Barriers or partitions will continue to be used in busy client -facing settings. 11. Educational and public spaces will be cleaned routinely. 11.1. Sanitizing wipes will be provided throughout the campus for your convenience to wipe down surfaces before and after you use them 11.2. Hand sanitizer will be provided throughout the campus for your convenience 5 1.General Guidance Regarding Workplace Health and Safety Student Considerations: Academic courses will be delivered in a mixture of hybrid and full in -person f ormat . Cohorts will be expected to attend in -person practicums throughout the semester, with scheduled in -person activity every week. Clinic will continue on-site, and all clinicians and faculty will be expected to attend in -person for patient care at the clinic they are assigned to for rotations wherever the facilities are available as guided by that site and/or the Regional Health Guidelines. Students will be requ ired to isolate if they have communicable disease symptoms or are travelling back to the lower mainland from outside of the province or country and have been instructed to isolate by government officials . Students who would normally attend campus but are required or recommended to self - isolate may request academic or clinic concession due to missed classes or course requirements . Formal requests for accommodation will continue to be managed through the processes outlined in institutional policy. Faculty and Staff Considerations: CCNM engages employees in a very broad range of roles across both campuses. Where feasible, if the nature of the role permits it, flexibility will be offered for the work structure of an individual . This means that there will not be a single standard for the College, but that the various work units will structure in -person/virtual as required to best meet the needs of the department and the College . Decisions regarding in -person attendance will be mainly set at a departmental level. Employees should discuss the requirements with their managers. Faculty and staff who would normally attend campus but are self -isolating should contact their supervisor to report their absence from working on campus and to discuss temporary remote work arrangements, if practical. Sick day policies will apply as appro priate. Formal requests for medical accommodation will be considered based on the individual circumstances and in accordance with collective agreements, legal obligations, and established accommodation review timelines. Mental Health Support Students, faculty, and staff may be anxious or experiencing increased stress about returning to campus or pandemic fatigue. Mental health support will be critical for everyone's health and wellbeing.

General Overview of COVID -19 Case and Contact Management 2.1. CCNM -BC has centralized contact tracing and identification under the direction of the CMO. 2.2. Employees and students use their identifica tion card (IC) upon entry to the college campus, library classroom areas and clinic II. Data may be monitored by the CMO by obtaining the information from Facilities as needed. 2.3. CCNM -BC has prepared the necessary infrastructure to screen for Communicable diseases including COVID -19, allow for multiple exposure tracking incidents, and to monitor employee and student requirements that include COVID -19 testing and self -isolation if ordered by the PHO or other authority. 2.4. CMO maintains a confidenti al log detailing the date/time and description of all correspondence for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID -19 involving the CCNM - BC community. 9 Contact Tracing 2.5. Public health has deemed contact tracing of limited value at this stage of the pandemic and it is only used in high priority settings. 2.6. Our campus will only supply notification of COVID -19 cases if directed to do so by local medical health officials or the BC provincial public health officer. Public health authorities are responsible for determi ning notification processes and requirements. 2.7. For a public health authority to recommend or order closure of a site or facility to prevent infection transmission is a rare step, reserved for circumstances in which direct management of cases and contacts is not sufficient to limit transmission. The public health authority would communicate closely with PSI administrators on any recommended closures related to COVID -19. Reporting on cases 2.8. The CMO will submit a report to the Executive Director of CCNM - BC, De an of CCNM and President of CCNM as requested, maintaining privacy and confidentiality as possible. 2.9. An employee should contact the CMO and Human Resources to report they are isolated with symptoms or have a positive test result for COVID -19. 2.10. The Associate Dean of Academics will be contacted if a student is suspected of having COVID -19 as it relates to class attendance and practical classes or exams. 2.11. The Clinic Manager and Associate De an of Clinical Education will be contacted if the student is a clinical intern as it relates to clinic attendance and rotations. 2.12. Otherwise, Confidentiality will be maintained unless the situation is medically urgent (or emergent), and/or should the local PHA deem it necessary to disclose the name of the employee and/or student to other individuals during their investigation. 3.
