Metal braces can cut the soft tissues of your mouth and collect debris that is difficult to remove. The removable aligners used in the Invisalign system can be snapped in and out of your mouth for easy cleaning and have no sharp edges. Here's how you can make use of Invisalign Cleaning Crystals or alternative methods for cleaning your Invisalign aligners. How to Use Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? Follow these steps to clean your aligner using the Invisalign Cleaning Crystals: - Place your aligner under lukewarm running water and gently rinse it to remove stuck-on food debris. - Fill the Invisalign cleaning tub or a small clean cup with enough lukewarm water to submerge the aligner. - Empty a packet of the Invisalign crystals into the cleaning tub. - Place the aligner in this cleaning solution. It is recommended to soak the aligners for 15 minutes. - Take out the aligner from the cleaning solution and rinse it again with lukewarm water. - Take a soft-bristled toothbrush and saturate its bristles with tap water. Use this toothbrush to gently scrub the aligner on both the sides so that the leftover particles can be removed. - Thoroughly rinse the aligner the final time. They are fresh, clean, and ready to wear. You can also place them into the case after drying them. With Invisalign Cleaning Crystals, you get the deep clean that is needed to keep your aligners looking their best. When you remove your aligners from the cleaning tub, they are fresh, clean, and ready to wear. Invisalign Cleaning Crystals can be used on a regular basis to remove any plaque that starts to collect on your aligners. Using the crystals on a regular basis kills the bacteria that can lead to gingivitis and bad breath. The crystals are easy to use and can clean your aligners in less than 15 minutes. Place the crystals and your aligner in the small tub that's provided and let them do their job. Invisalign Cleaning Alternative Methods There are several ways to clean your aligners, but each kind has its own strengths and drawbacks that may cause you to think twice. Select the one that best suits your requirement. 1. Cleaning with a Toothbrush You can use a soft-bristled toothbrush or other types of abrasive cleansers, but you run the risk of scratching the surface and creating new places for bacteria to hide. Don't use whitening toothpaste for cleaning your aligners. 2. Using Mouthwash to Clean Aligners Many people try to clean their aligners with mouthwash, but even that can pose a problem. Mouthwash may kill the bacteria on your aligner, but it won't do much to get rid of the plaque and debris. It may also discolor your aligners. 3. Homemade Cleaning Solutions You can use homemade soaks to clean your aligners. Using hydrogen peroxide and water, vinegar or bleach mixed with water serve as effective cleaning solutions. Enhance the effectiveness of these solutions by using a vibratory bath. 4. Commercial Cleaning Products There are many commercially prepared products that are available for cleaning the aligners. SonicBrite and Retainer Brite help in removing the stain and killing bacteria and microorganisms. Effervescent cleaning products can also be used to clean Invisalign braces. If you find that the cleaning method you are using is not effective, don't use it and try a different one. Why It Is Important to Keep Your Aligners Clean Over time, your aligners will begin to show plaque and stains in much the same way as your teeth do. It's important that you clean your aligners on a daily basis. This removes the build-up of plaque and any food particles that may find their way into the small nooks and crannies. Cleaning them once a day will prevent bacteria and germs from becoming a problem. Where Can You Buy Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? You can buy the Invisalign cleaning crystals from a local dental supplies store, or you can order one online. Dental supplies store sells these crystals in two packs: a box of 50 individual crystal packets, and another box that also includes an Invisalign cleaning tub. How Often You Should Clean Your Invisalign You should clean your Invisalign regularly. Clean them every morning and evening at the time you brush your teeth. Make sure you clean them every time you remove them for eating or drinking. Ensure they are clean before placing them back in your mouth. What Is the Best Way to Clean Your Invisalign?
