CIR consolidates immunization information and shares it with health care providers, families and agencies concerned with public health. You can [register your practice online](https://immunize.nyc/prod/cir-facility-manager). For instructions on how to register your practice, see the [registration guide](/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cir/facility-registration-guide.pdf) (PDF). If you think you may be registered and have forgotten your facility code, enter your information on the registration page to get your facility code. NYC health care providers report immunizations to the CIR as mandated by New York State Public Health Law and the NYC Health Code. Pediatric providers are required to report all immunizations administered to children aged 0 to 18 years. Reporting of all administered COVID-19 vaccine doses to the CIR is required within 24 hours of administration, as specified by the NYS Department of Health and in the COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Agreement. To enable monitoring of equitable vaccine distribution, it is essential that vaccination providers gather and report accurate data on vaccine recipients' characteristics, including race and ethnicity. Vaccine providers are encouraged to consult best practices for collecting and reporting race and ethnicity to the CIR. The use of the CIR to verify the vaccination status of employees is not authorized under New York State law or the New York City Health Code. Employers with vaccination requirements must ask employees to provide documentation of vaccination. New Yorkers may obtain their vaccination records from the [CIR online](https://myvaccinerecord.cityofnewyork.us/myrecord/home.htm) or from their vaccination provider.
