This guidance document is built around the 5 pillars and 3 enablers described in the PEPFAR 5 -Year Strateg y: Fulfilling America's Promise to End the HIV/AIDS Pandemic by 2030 . Also, this guidance describes improvements to Country Operational Planning (COP) and Regional Operational Planning (ROP) processes to respond to stakeh older input and to make these processes more fit -for-purpose --including transitioning from an annual planning process to 2 - year operational planning. The shift to a 2 -year planning cycle will begin in fiscal year 20 24 (FY24) for COP and in FY25 for ROP.1 The COP/ROP Guidance Document is redesigned as a shorter, more useful resource to support country teams as they work with stakeholders to develop country and/or regional operating plans. Technical Considerations , formerly a section within the COP/ROP22 Guidance, has been moved to an an nex document. The FY24 Technical Considerations , which are based on the COP/ROP22 Guidance , were updated to address important normative technical and policy changes, make corrections, and delete content that was not needed, but they have only been revised where necessary. In the coming months , we plan to work with stakeholders to develop a new approach to PEPFAR Technical Considerations for FY25. Core Standards. In recent years, Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs) have effectively focused attention on global standards PEPFAR considers essential for a successful HIV response. In COP23, MPRs are reframed as Core Standards (See Section 3.3 ) to better reflect PEPFAR's role as a respectful partner supporting the success of national HIV efforts. PEPFAR teams will continue to work with partner governments, other donors, communities, and other stakeholders to e nsure these standards are adopted and accountably implemented at all levels. 1 As a clarification, FY24 aligns with October 2023 -September 2024 October 2024 - September 2025. COP/ROP23 will be a 2 -year plan for COPs and a 1 -year plan for ROPs. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 2 of 220 Executive Summary COP/ROP23 reflects the first planning cycle of the new PEPFAR Strategy . COP/ROP23 also reflects a revised approach to COP/ROP planning that includes an increased commitment to in -country planning, shifting toward a 2 -year COP planning cycle (anticipating a 2 -year ROP cycle starting with ROP24), and utilizing accountability tools that are streamlined and better aligned with current needs, all while remaining committed to an inclusive, data -driven, accountable, and transparent planning process. We are closer to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. During its first 20 years, PEPFAR has worked with partner -country governments and other stakeholders, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (hereafter called \"the Global Fund\") ; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS ); communities ; and other partners to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Thanks to global and local HIV stakeholders, according to UNAIDS, AIDS -related deaths have been cut by 64% since their peak in 2004 , and new infections have been reduced by 42% through the delivery of essential prevention and treatment services. Globally, 73% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) are accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Though the number of new infections is declining, we have not yet reached our global targets. Population -Based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) data from over a dozen high - HIV-burden countries show that at least 73% (.90 x .90 x .90) community viral suppression across age/sex groups is achievable and leads to stabilized, and even decreas ed, HIV -disease burden. These successes were achieved without a vaccine or cure. While some PEPFAR -supported partner countries are still scaling and have not yet reached UNAIDS targets, all PEPFAR programs will benefit by posi tioning COP and ROP planning to align with the 5x3 approach of PEPFAR's Strategy . Pillar 1: Health Equity for Priority Population s As countries approach 95 -95-95, 2 PEPFAR needs to ensure that attention and resources are harnessed to effectively close gaps and address inequities. Data should inform each 2 95-95-95 definition: 95% of all people living with HIV will know their status; 95% of all people diagnosed with HIV infection will receive life-sustaining ART ; 95% of all people on ART will have attain viral suppression. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 3 of 220 country's particular approach to closing gaps to achieve and maintain 95-95-95. Furthermore, approaches should consider that 3 populations (children, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) , and key populations [KPs] ) are PEPFAR global priority populations. In populations with persistently large gaps and high HIV acquisitio n rates , closing gaps requires supporting and empowering community leadership. We must support a strong public health approach with epidemiologically informed testing strategies. We also aim to support innovative, community -led, person -centered approaches to HIV services where seamless, durable connections are made between HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services. Closing gaps also requires the dismantling of structural barriers that may prevent priority populations from accessing HIV services . Pillar 2: Sustaining the Response PEPFAR will work with partner -country government s, communities, and other stakeholders to support a person -centered and sustainable HIV response through political, programmatic, and financial domains that will help end HIV as a public health threat while strengthen ing public health systems. While each national HIV response may differ, long -term, person -centered services and systems are essentia l. Over time, 3 drivers can build momentum to consistently incorporate sustainability into PEPFAR's planning process: ( 1) accelerating integration of HIV services and systems into local public health systems ; (2) increasing capabilities and capacities for partner -country governments, local partners, and communities to lead and manage all aspects of the HIV response; and ( 3) aligning U.S. Government (USG) and other donor investments with national government planning and priorities. During COP /ROP23 planning, operating unit s (OUs) should collaborate with partner -country governments to either help establish or work through pr e-existing g overnment -led bodies/group s that will use a sustainability lens to assess health system gaps and identify efficiencies within existing budget envelopes . COP/ROP23 plans should also support development of a country - led Measurable Sustainability Roadmap during the COP/ROP23 implementation period. Pillar 3: Public Health Systems and Security PEPFAR will continue to strengthen national health systems for HIV and related health security capabilities. This strategic pillar aims to inte ntionally strengthen national and regional COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 4 of 220 public health institutions to promote public health security and responsiveness. To achieve this, countries will need robust national surveillance of HIV /AIDS and other public health threats. Partner countries will also need strong laboratory networks that support timely diagnostic testing and public health responses for HIV and other public health threats. Further, PEPFAR seeks to support systematic approaches that strengthen government health workfor ce investments and improve alignment of PEPFAR investments with partner -country human resources for health (HRH) staffing and other public health system priorities. Supply chains should continue to be modernized and evolve toward people -centered, integr ated, efficient systems that offer data visibility and accountability for all users and stakeholders; strengthen partner government oversight; advance meaningful local private sector partnerships; and support movement toward regional manufacturing. Pillar 4: Transformative Partnerships Transformative partnerships are needed to effectively end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 . Core partnerships with partner -country governments and multilateral organizations must be optimized, and o ther innovative partnerships should be considered to accomplish HIV program goals. We must seek to elevate the role of regional institutions, philanthropic partnerships, relevant American institutions, and global and local private sector partners. Pillar 5: Follow the Science PEPFAR remains committed to evidence -based and data -driven programming. This requires a strong applied epidemiological approach, behavioral, social, and implementation science (IS), surveys, and surveillance activities aligned across multiple Strategic Pillars. This pillar aims to invest in assessments using epidemiology and surveillance and cutting -edge behavioral science and IS to bend the curve on new infections. Across these 5 pillars, 3 strategic enabl ers will fuel an effective and sustainable response and end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. The 3 enablers of PEPFAR's 5-Year Strategy are: (1) community leadership , which includes meaningful engagement in planning, community -led implementation, and community -led monitoring (CLM) ; (2) leading with COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 5 of 220 data--a PEPFAR strength that remains of utmost importance; and ( 3) innovation --from new product innovations to country -led innovations. - - - - - - - The COP/ROP23 planning process reflects several improvements to better align with PEPFAR's Strategy and to respond to stakeholder feedback. The major changes include the introduction of a 2 -year planning cycle, a shortened planning timeline, and updated COP/ROP tools that reduce staff level of effort (LOE) without sacrificing transparency. The function and purpose of COP/ROP remains unchanged. We must maintain an inclusive process, use data for decision -making, maximize partnership and interagency collaboration, and pursue program and policy priorities efficiently for maximum impact. All COP/ROP changes are intended to preserv e accountability, imp act, and transparency, and to redesign or eliminate things no longer fit -for-purpose. Twenty years after PEPFAR 's ince ption , the globe is in a different phase of the HIV /AIDS pandemic . We are now focused on closing remaining gaps to reach all in need and sustaining the HIV response. To accomplish this, i n-country planning is crucial , and all stakeholders \u2014 including the communities most affected by HIV \u2014should meaningfully participate in co -creating the plan. To end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, HIV-response investments and activities must be aligned . For months , the Office of the Secretary/ Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator ( S/GAC ) consulted with COP /ROP tool end users . We listened to P EPFAR teams and stakeholders through COP/ROP After -Action Review surveys and listening sessions and used the feedback to inform revisions of planning process es and tool s. A 2-year COP aims to promote a longer -term planning horizon to facilitate coordination with national plans and Global Fund commitments. PEPFAR is funded through annual appropriations. Consequently, a ny COP/ROP budget planning for which existing appropriated funds are not currently available (i.e., FY24 funds and second year /FY25 budget plan s) are notional and subject to existing or future presidential budget requests for the relevant fiscal year and subject to availability of funds. Any such noti onal fund allocations are strictly for internal planning purposes and , without further S/GAC review and approval , must not be used as a COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 6 of 220 basis for any public, multilateral, or bilateral announcements of intended pledges or other commitments . We will not sac rifice transparency and accountability. At the midpoint of COP/ROP23 (at the end of the fourth quarter [ Q4] of FY24 ), all stakeholders will participate in a comprehensive review of country progress and update the COP, as needed. To improve PEPFAR's suppor t of regional programs' unique needs, S/GAC is establishing an alternating approach where by 2-year ROPs alternate with 2-year COP s. To establish the alternating pattern , ROP23 will be a 1 -year plan . We will then assess possible improvements to the ROP appr oach to inform a 2 -year cycle beginning with ROP24. SECTION 1: PEPFAR BACKGROUND and PRIORITIES 1.1 Background In response to the global AIDS crisis, the U.S. Government launched the PEPFAR in 2003. With strong bipartisan leadership and support, Congress passed the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 ( U.S. Leadership Act ), which became law just 4 months after President George W. Bush issued a call to action in his 2003 State of the Union Address. In the 20 years since its inception, PEPFAR has invested over $100 billion in the global AIDS response --the largest public health effort against a single disease by any country in history. The work this investment fuels has saved more than 20 mil lion lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and placed ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat within reach . 1.2 Mandate and Authorities S/GAC , which is housed within the U.S. State Department under the Secretary of State , oversees PEPFAR. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is a presidentially appointed position (with advice and consent of the Senate) and holds the rank of Ambassador -at-Large. The Global AIDS Coordinator leads S/GAC and provides oversight and coordination of all resources and intern ational activities of the U .S. Government to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic --including the work of USG implementing agencies, which U.S. Chiefs of Mission COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 7 of 220 further oversee. The Coordinator's responsibility spans all USG programs, projects, and activities relating to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Many of these authorities and duties are administered through the COP/ROP process. All operating plans are developed as part of an assessment, planning, budgeting, and monitoring cycle coordinated by S/GAC. This document is designed to guide country and regional teams as they work with national governments and other stakeholders to develop PEPFAR operating plans, in support of their respective national or regional HIV responses. 1.3 PEP FAR's Purpose, Principles, and Values 1.3.1 Purpose Statement As noted in the new PEPFAR Strategy , we will accelerate the response to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 203 0, while sustainably strengthening public health systems. To continue optimizing complementarity, value for money , and impact, PEPFAR 's Strategy implementation will be closely coordinated with the 2023 -2028 Global Fund Strategy and the Glob al AIDS Strategy 2021 -2026 . Implementation will also maximize synergies and bidirectional learnings with the new U.S. National Strategy on HIV/AIDS . Program Goals: 1. Reach global 95 -95-95 treatment targets for all ages, genders, and population groups. 2. Reduce new HIV infections dramatically through effective prevention and treatment, in support of UNAIDS targets. 3. Close equity gaps for priority populations, including adolescent girls and young women, key populations, and children. 4. Transform the PEPFAR p rogram toward long -term HIV response sustainability by strengthening the capabilities of partner -country governments to lead and manage the program, in collaboration with communities, the private sector, and local partners. 5. Sustainabl y and measurably strengthen partner -country public health systems and health security in the areas of prevention, epidemiol ogical data collection , and response COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 8 of 220 capabilities against HIV/AIDS and other public health threats. 1.3.2 PEPFAR Core Principles and Values Respect and Humility: Deep respect, trust, and humility are core values of the PEPFAR program and should live in ev ery interaction we have with our partners and beneficiaries . Equity : Strive for equitable treatment and outcomes , both in the way that we and our partners operate , and for the populations we serve . Accountability and Transparency : Ensure effective use of resources and commit to being open and public with all critical information on our intentions and programmatic results . Impact : Orient our activities to the areas that will lead to the most progress toward ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat , using quality data and evidence -based processes , and strengthening public health systems . Sustained Engagement : Ensure that we are elevating the leadership of our partners, local communities, and partner countries to sustain HIV -response impact . PEPFAR is committed to supporting the global vision of ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. We're also committed to helping countries and communities leverage robust PEPFAR -supported public health, community, and clinical c are platforms to confront other current and future health threats that affect people living with and affected by HIV. The foundation of that support is outlined in PEPFAR's Strategy , which focuses on 5 strategic pillars that support health equity, sustainability, public health systems and security, partnerships, and science ( Figure 1 ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 9 of 220 Figure 1 The 5 Pillars and 3 Enablers of PEPFAR's 5x3 Strategy . 1.4 Code of Conduct Our shared PEPFAR mission is to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthen partner -country public health systems. As we work toward this , we must consider how we engage with each other ; the people we serve ; and people in partner -country governments, community and multilateral organizations, and PEPFAR implementing partners (IPs) as well as people within USG agencies --including teams based in both the United States and PEPFAR -supported countries. In every interaction, we must be humble, respectful, accountable, and trustworthy. One of PEPFAR's unique strengths is bringing together people with different backgrounds, strategic approaches, technical expertise, and implementation strengths who are deeply committed to our shared mission. A core principle for PEPFAR staff is that differences should be discussed respectfully and professionally ---with productive debate value d. Further more, unnecessary interpersonal conflicts should be addressed in a timely manner and resolved appropriately . This code of conduct presents foundational ideals that we intend to uphold, as one PEPFAR team, to ensure our collaboration moves us toward shared excellence. This code of conduct is COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 10 of 220 not exhaustive; rather, it is a framework to guide our interactions. It is also our responsibility to refer to , and abide by , the specific codes of conduct of our respective agencies and U.S. missions. Operationalizing Core Principles and Values The PEPFAR Strategy describes our core principles and values ( See Section 1.3.2 ). As we implement PEPFAR's strategy , all members of the PEPFAR community should act with humility, communicate openly, and give colleagues the benefit of the doubt that they too are operating in good faith . It's also useful to emphasize what is shared while acknowledging differences and committing to finding a path forward. Upholding Ethical and Professional Standards In our PEPFAR/ USG community, we are all bound by applicable USG -wide laws and regulations and supplemental agency regulations and policies, as applicable, to uphold certain ethical and professional standards in the workplace. We expect those standards to be fully implemented. We also emphasize the following (which may be included in the above -mentioned standards): Respect and Courtesy for Others : We must respect all people, re gardless of race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, size, religion, disability, reproductive status, etc. Support for Inclusion and Diversity : We appreciate all people, including those who have different experiences, perspectives, and cultures from our own. Anti-Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying : Under no circumstances is harassment, discrimination, or demeaning or bullying behavior tolerated. Stigma and discrimination have no place in PEPFAR. These should be a ddressed immediately and managed according to applicable personnel policies. As noted in sections 3.1.1.4 and 4.1, PEPFAR seeks to safeguard participants from all forms of discrimination, abuse, unethical behavior, and misconduct in PEPFAR -supported progra mming and has zero tolerance for such actions or failures to address these actions proactively, safely , and in a manner that is respectful to the rights and needs of program participants. Abiding by Core Behaviors As a PEPFAR community, we apply the following behaviors to help resolve our differences and to keep the resolution process productive and professional: COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 11 of 220 We communicate respectfully and transparently. o Communication within and between PEPFAR teams should be honest, timely, consistent, and continuous. We must identify our stakeholders, both within and outside of PEPFAR, and strive to communicate in a way that meets stakeholders' needs for country -led deci sion-making, strategic planning, and sustainability. o Our communication, both verbal and non -verbal, is always respectful. When we disagree, we do so respectfully. We do not accept unprofessional or hostile behaviors. o Feedback is important for team - and tr ust-building. We offer constructive feedback as part of our commitment to our shared mission and accept constructive feedback as important for personal growth. We are mindful of our impact and act in good faith. o We assume the best of one another and appro ach all interaction s with an open mind and willingness to grow through engagement with one another's perspectives. o We recognize that our words and/or actions could sometimes be hurtful -- regardless of our intention. As such, i n our diverse PEPFAR environme nt, we must remain vigilant about our impact, while also giving those who offend us the benefit of the doubt. Constructive feedback helps us to learn about the impact s we make , rectify , and grow. Resolving Differences within PEPFAR Differences of views r elated to the program, when identified and addressed in a healthy manner, can drive us toward excellence in the pursuit of our shared mission. When differences of views emerge within PEPFAR teams or between PEPFAR personnel and outside stakeholders, the PEPFAR team members invol ved should make a good faith effort to apply the above principles, values, standards, and behaviors to keep the dialogue healthy and productive. When the involved parties are unable to resolve their differences, we will: Strive to resolve differences at the lowest unit possible. Conflict resolution should only be escalated when consensus has not been reached despite a good faith effort, and where achieving resolution is necessary for meeting PEPFAR's objectives. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 12 of 220 When in -country/interagency conflict a rises, the PEPFAR Coordination Office should engage with the chief of mission (COM) and/or deputy COM , as necessary . When consensus can not be reached within a PEPFAR OU, or if the conflict is between a PEPFAR OU and U .S.-based PEPFAR staff, the PEPFAR coordinator and any relevant agency point of contact ( POC ) should simultaneously elevate the issue to the OU's S/GAC chair and agency deputy principal s. If the conflict incl udes the S/GAC chair, the issue should be directly elevated to the relevant U.S. agency deputy principals assigned to the OU as well as to the principal deputy global AIDS coordinator. The S/GAC chair and/or deputy principals should make a good faith effor t to resolve the differences in accordance with PEPFAR's core principles and values, reaching consensus wherever possible. If all prior efforts fail to achieve consensus, the S/GAC chair and deputy principals should communicate the issue to the S/GAC deputy coordinator for review. All PEPFAR OUs and other PEPFAR interagency bodies (Deputy Princip als (DPs), Communities of Practice (CoOPs ), and short -term task teams ) are encouraged to develop a code of conduct specific to their context, with rules of en gagement, roles, and responsibilities. OUs are also encouraged to share examples and lessons learned with one another. Conclusion The PEPFAR team is committed to respecting and supporting one another in every interaction, including by sustainable strengthening public health systems, as we work together to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Conflict and d isagreement s are a normal part of business in teractions and should be managed in accordance with PEPFAR's core principles and values and aligned with ethical and professional standards. SECTION 2: PROGRESS TOWARD ENDING HIV/AIDS AS A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT BY 2030 Reaching 95 -95-95 targets across po pulations and inclusive of all ages and sexes is essential for ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. To reach this goal we must achieve UNAIDS 2025 targets --including the 95 -95-95 treatment cascade targets and the 10 -10-10 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 13 of 220 social enabler targe ts within all sub -populations and age groups. Achieving testing and treatment targets (95 -95-95) requires continuous improvement of HIV case finding and treatment programs to meet people's needs. However, global momentum is slowing regarding reaching this goal. Using a granular, data -driven approach that uses real -time data by age and sex, Botswana and Eswatini have demonstrated what is possible in reaching these targets. COP23 two-year plans must help us reach 2025 UNAIDS 95 -95-95 targets --meaning 90% treatment coverage for all people living with HIV.3 Since 2016, new treatment initiations have trended down in PEPFAR -partner countries ( Figure 2). If we do not improve the detection of HIV infections and the linking of people living with HIV to ART, then we jeopardize the goal of having over 23.2 million people living with HIV on treatment across all PEPFAR partner countries by 2025. Figure 2 Progress Made and Gaps Remaining to Reach 95 -95-95 Targets among All People Living with HIV in PEPFAR -Supported Countries by 2025. Though PEPFAR's total treatment cohort has increased over time, 3 The first 95 target relates to 95 % of all people living with HIV knowing their HIV status. The second 95 target aims for at least 95% of those diagnosed as having an HIV infection being linked to sustained ART. The third 95 target aims for 95% of people on ART to achieve viral suppression . Mathematically, if the first 2 targets are met then at least 90% of all people living with HIV will be linked to ART. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 14 of 220 trends in treatment initiation and continuity of treatment for people living with HIV are decreasing. This threatens the global community's ability to achieve 90% treatment coverage for all people living with HIV and may compromise reaching the first and second 95 targets by 2025. Source: PEPFAR Panorama; UNAIDS Estimates 2021. HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services have significantly decreased new infecti ons and all-cause mortality among people living with HIV. The burden of disease is not increasing for most countries \u2014and, over the past decade, HIV incidence and mortality have been halved. This fragile success was achieved through implementation of effect ive programs, without a vaccine or cure. PEPFAR remains committed to reducing HIV incidence and mortality among people living with HIV through evidence -based, person -centered, equitable services. In the \"Status of the Response \" section of FY24 Technical Considerations , we review program performance over the past few years across treatment and prevention services. While services have improved considerably , changes still must be made to provide truly person -centered services that integrate tuberculosis ( TB) care, expand multi -month dispensing (MMD), and broaden access to viral load testing. Comparing prior PHIA data to follow -up PHIA data reveals significant gains toward reaching 95 - 95-95 goals for all sex groups aged 15 years a nd older. Overall, Eswatini achieved phenomenal impact at 94 -97-96. While all populations improved along the treatment cascade since 2016, the biggest gaps remain among 15- to 24-year-old females and 25- to 34-year-old males ( Figure 3 ). Similar progress is seen in Uganda --however, the youth bulge presents a significant challenge for reaching 95-95-95 targets for females and males under 35 years old. To achieve 95 -95-95 goals for these populations, differential programming is needed for youth versus individu als 25 years of age and older ( Figure 4 ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 15 of 220 Figure 3 HIV Impact and Progress toward Health Equity Reaching 95 -95-95 Targets in Eswatini. While HIV prevalence decreased for most age groups from the second PHIA (PHIA2) (2016) to PHIA3 (2021), the prevalence among those 50 -64 years old increased from 32.9% to 36.6% due to an aging population of people living with HIV and successful treatment program ming. Though the estimated 95s are higher for all age and sex groups from PHIA2 to PHIA3, PHIA3 showed the greatest inequity toward reaching UNAIDS 95 -95-95 targets among males 25 -34 years old . With an estimated achievement of 75 - 87-96, this group is falli ng behind the achievements realized for similarly aged females, as well as for older and younger males.

Results from the 2021 second round PHIA in Uganda show HIV prevalence shifting to older age groups, with the greatest burden among 35- to 49-year-olds (10.9%). Females in all age groups show the highest COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 16 of 220 achievement of the UNAIDS 95 -95-95 targets, particula rly among those 35-49 and 50+ years old. As compared to female counterparts , males are still lagging in the cascade ; however, achievement has improved since th e first PHIA in 2017. Source: PHIA1 and PHIA 2, Uganda. Disease burden and prevalence is also changing --shifting to the older population with chronic infections. Services must continue to evolve and expand; in particular, broadening access to health care delivery models that integrate services for older populat ions is critical. As countries work on COP23 analysis and response, evaluating changes in incidence and mortality by age/sex should inform prevention and treatment program improvement. Triangulating this information with CLM data will provide insights ab out the quality and availability of services by population. Understanding these details is necessary to ensure prevention and treatment services are working as intended for positive patient - and population - level outcomes. Progress among Children and Orph ans Since 2010, ART coverage has increased for all. On average, 81% of pregnant women received ART in 2021, however children only had an average of 52% treatment coverage ( Figure 5 ).4 Understanding the unique service delivery needs for children and addre ssing current clinical gaps and needs to improve pediatric case finding, linkage to care, and viral load coverage and testing capacity are essential to address this inequity. Additionally, as communities passed the 2020 90 -90-90 targets in pursuit of 95 -95-95, vulnerability to HIV decreased, leading to stabilized communities, improved quality of life, and fewer children becoming orphans due to AIDS. The age distribution of orphans has also shifted; over half of orphans are over 12 years old. Children 6 -11 years old make up the next largest groups of orphans due to AIDS. Programs that serve orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and adolescents continue to evolve to address age -appropriate needs ; achieve equitable treatment outcomes ; mitigate HIV risk ; and e nsure comprehensive , community -based support to priority sub -populations --including children and adults living with HIV , adolescent girls and 4 World Health Organization, Data on the HIV Response 2021. https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv -aids/data -on-the-hiv-aids-response . for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 17 of 220 young women , and their families --through platforms such as Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS -free, Mentored, and Safe ( DREAMS ).

Progress among Key Populations HIV prevalence among key populations is higher as compared to the general population, progress toward 95 -95-95 remains lower, and an estimated 50 -70% of new HIV infections globally are among key populations and their sexual partners.5,6,7 Impact among key populations is varied and quality surveillance data for key populations is often lacking --more routine survey data are needed to fully address HIV prevention and 5 Stannah J, Dale E, Elmes J, et al.

Based on data from the Kyrgyz Republic and Uganda , the below examples demonstrate these differences. Sex Workers Resul ts from the Crane Survey of Female Sex Workers in Uganda demonstrate similar UNAIDS 95-95-95 findings for female sex workers as seen for the general population (Figure 6 ). PEPFAR Uganda has implemented services for female sex workers since the beginning of the program, and the Crane Survey has provided routine data to direct and refine the program over the years to close 95 -95-95 gaps. Figure 6 Status of UNAIDS 95 -95-95 Goals among Female Sex Workers in Kampala, Uganda.

Men Who Have Sex with Men The 2021 Bio-Behavior al Survey (BBS) among men who have sex with men in the Kyrgyz Republic found only 41% knew their HIV status ( Figure 7 ).

Moving forward Many people living with HIV are successfully receiving prevention and treatment services. Simplified services, including 6 -MMD9 and a single annual clinic visit for viral load testing and clinical assessment, have enhanced the ability of people living with HIV to manage HIV themselves . This has resulted in improved treatment retention and better viral su ppression rates . Despite these gains, inequities remain that jeopardize the entire HIV response. To reach 95-95-95 targets, we must us e granular epidemiologic, program, and site -level data along with information from CLM to find and address inequities and dismantle remaining barriers . Using 9 Multi -month dispensing that spans 6 months COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 20 of 220 person -centered data with population denominators will help programs assess and refine prevention and clinical services for youth and for aging populations. TB treatment and preventi on remain a priority to reduce the morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV. Flexible prevention programming for youth --including voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC ), DREAMS, and simplified services for pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) --is vital. To adapt clinical services for youth, it's important to learn from prevention programs that are successful in reaching younger populations. As people living with HIV age, programs should responsively scale efficient and effective clinical services that address the total health of people over age 50 living with HIV (22% of clients on ART are over 50 years old) --particularly , those with chronic conditions. Aligning case -finding approaches to rapidly identify people with new and undiagnosed long -term HIV infections is essential. It's also important to link older adults who are at risk of infection (e.g., people who are recently widowed, divorced, or experiencing some other life change that could increase risk of HIV exposure) to prevention. Therefore, active public health response approaches, including safe and ethical index testing, remain critical. Inequities in children must also be addressed . Some of the child -specific barriers we need to overcome to succeed in closing gaps for children include addressing policy barrier s (e.g., age limits for accessing HIV testing and treatment, lack of inclusion of children in Differentiated Service Delivery ( DSD ), and MMD), improving the availability of effective and well -tolerated pediatric ART, and confronting other barriers in the general health system. We also need to overcome the data gap for key populations; we need to know where clinical and prevention services for key populations need bolstering. PEPFAR has a track record of identifying gaps and addressing inequities, and toge ther we can rise to the challenge to close remaining inequities and reach 95 -95-95 for all. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 21 of 220 SECTION 3: COP/ROP PRIORITIES \u20145x3 STRATEGY AND ENABLERS 3.1 PEPFAR's 5 Strategic Pillars PEPFAR is committed to supporting the global vision of ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030, and further encouraging countries and communities to leverage the robust PEPFAR -supported public health, community, and clinical care platforms to confront other current and future health threats tha t impact people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. The foundation of PEPFAR's support is outlined in PEPFAR's Strategy , which focuses on 5 strategic pillars: Health Equity for Priority Populations, Sustaining the Response, Public Health Systems and Security, Transformative Partnerships, and Follow the Science. These strategic pillars are supported by 3 cross -cutting enablers --community leadership, innovation, and data. OU teams and all partners engaged in COP/ROP planning are strongly encouraged to use the 5x3 framework to shape and strengthen operational plans. The 5x3 framework aims to move PEPFAR into the next decade --shifting PEPFAR's focus from rapidly scaling toward sustaining scaled services and a long -term HIV response by supporting national capabilities and goal 3.1.1 Pillar 1: Health Equity for Priority Populations Health equity happens when everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. For PEPFAR, health equity reflects our commitment to eliminate unfair, avoidable, or remediable differences in health amo ng groups of people \u2014especially as it relates to the PEPFAR mission. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 22 of 220 Gender equity happens when actions are taken to end and compensate for the historical and social disadvantages that prevent women and girls in all their diversity from operating on a level playing field. While health equality is all individuals being able to access th e same health services, health equity recognizes differences between individual s' circumstances and tailors services and advances policies to achieve optimal health outcomes for all. In other words , a health equity approach would require that unjust polici es and practices be ended and their effects undone , bearing in mind that all sub -populations may not receive the same exact services . An equity lens or equity approach reflects an intentional practice that takes action to tailor services and to eliminate inequities by prioritizing, engaging, and empowering populations who have had historical, contemporary, or cultural injustices. PEPFAR's 5 -year Strategy designates (1) infants and children, ( 2) adolescent girls and young women, and ( 3) key populations as global priority populations. In countries where gaps are evident for these populations, COP/ROP strategy should clearly address them. In add ition, other priority populations (e.g., ethnic minorities, migrant workers , etc. ) may require an equity approach in a national context. For PEPFAR programming, we offer questions to consider when applying an equity approach to programs and policies. What aspects of an individual's identity ( gender , socioeconomic class, age etc.) contribute to being empowered or discriminated against in acc ess to health services in this context? How is your OU reprograming to proactively remedy health inequities? Do your approaches include addressing the underlying social determinants and systemic barriers that are contributing to the inequity? How can the OU improve engagement with and accountab ility to the population that is experiences the inequity in the program planning, implementation, and access to quality services? How is your OU advancing the values of diversity, inclusion, and equity? Which partners (local and global) could be engage d by the OU to reflect commun ity-led solutions to improve HIV outcomes and reduce inequities? COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 23 of 220 How can resources be aligned to close gaps in populations/sub -populations that are experiencing inequities in the first, second, or third 95s? As countries approach UNAIDS 95 -95-95 targets, it becomes especially important to customize our responses to each country's HIV /AIDS epidemic. To do this, we must use the best available data and partner with communities to tailor person -centered approaches t o prevention, care, and treatment. We need to identify populations who have outcomes that consistently fall short of UNAIDS targets. Then, based on each nation's data and circumstances, support efforts to close gaps for these populations. Holistic, Person -Centered Approach: For populations with high HIV incidence, focusing solely on performance of HIV care and treatment activities has not been sufficient. A close look at service delivery and barriers and vulnerabilities of populations serve d can identify opportunities to innovate and provide a more seamless, person -centered approach --where low -barrier testing is combined with seamless connections to prevention services (including PrEP), ART initiation or reengagement, and supportive services . It's also important to emphasize safe and ethical , active, public health approaches to testing (index testing, social network testing, and focused community testing). Dismantling Structural Barriers: Health equity requires that we address causes of ine quities, including stigma, discrimination, viole nce, criminalization, and marginalization. The 5 -year strategy commits that PEPFAR teams will play a leadership role in supporting collaborative efforts to reach the 10 -10-10 goals of the Global UNAIDS Strategy 2021 -2026, including by working with partners to address stigma, punitive laws, and gend er-based violence, and to promote the adoption and implementation of enabling policies for equitable and sustained HIV impact, as articulated in the UNAIDS Global AIDS Strategy. We are also committed to using PEPFAR -supported platforms to stand up against discrimination and violations of human rights and to call out inequities in HIV service access, uptake, and continuity, particularly for children, adolescent girls , and young women and members of key populations ( e.g., men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender persons, and people in prisons) using local data supporting the 95 -95-95 and 10 -10-10 global goals (See Section 3.1.1.4 ). For PEPFAR'S 3 global priority populations, as well as other populations experiencing inequities, an important driver for success is engaging community leadership as a key enabling factor. Community leaders are an invaluable resource for PEPFAR program design, directi on, and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 24 of 220 monitoring, and in cooperative efforts can help dismantle structural barriers to HIV prevention and care. 3.1.1.1 Children Children lack agency and rely on caregivers to represent them who are often themselves disempowered, stigmatized, and margina lized. As a result, they are one of the most underserved populations in the global HIV response. In 2021, the reported viral load suppression for children was 41% whereas for adults it was 70% (UNAIDS estimates). Despite the success of prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs , there were still 160,000 new child infections in 202 1. Of these, 92% were due to either a lack of maternal ART coverage, interruption in maternal treatment, or incident HIV infections during pregnancy or breas tfeeding. In 2021, 76% of adults were on ART whereas o nly 52% of the 1.8 million children living with HIV (CLHIV) were on ART ( For UNAIDS estimates, see Figu re 5). As we move forward, we must recognize and urgently address these inequalities. Striving to do the same things we are doing now but better won't get us to our goal of ending pediatric AIDS by 2030. COP resources must be allocated with an equity approach to support partner -country governments in closing gaps in HIV prevention , testing, and tre atment services for pregnant and breastfeeding women and pediatric HIV care. Data should be reviewed at the sub -national level and by sub -age groups for children and adolescents. PEPFAR programs should support partner governments in identifying models of care that close these gaps among children. To strategically address gaps in PMTCT and pediatrics, COP/ROP23 builds on Accelerating Progress in Pediatric and PMTCT (AP3) --an effort that 7 countries ( the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Mozambique , Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) initiated in COP22 where the greatest gaps in pediatric coverage exist. This 6 -pronged approach focuses on surge efforts for: ( 1) dedicated ( 2) strategic 3) strength ened and evaluation (M&E) efforts ; (4) pediatric CLM; ( 5) socioeconomic support , psychosocial support , and case management; and ( 6) regular review meetings ( Figure 8). These 6 elements increase accountability and improve holistic care for chil dren and for pregnant and breastfeeding women. To expand on COP22 groundwork, in COP/ROP23 we expect all OUs with a PMTCT/ pediatric program to address these 6 elements in their approach to closing gaps for women and children --and for prior AP3 countries to expand upon the groundwork laid COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 25 of 220 in COP22 . In particular, we have seen great progress in the rollout of dolutegravir (DTG) based regimens for young childre n weighing <20 kg ) in most PEPFAR OUs --and hope this can be expanded to all PEPFAR OUs. For additional details on PEPFAR supported programming for children and adolescents, please see FY24 Technical Considerations Sections 6.1, 6.3, and 6.4. Figure 8 Six Elements of AP3 Surge . The surge effor t is at the center supported by: ( 1) dedicated HRH; (2) strategic support, psychosocial support , and case management; and ( 6) regular review meetings. 3.1.1.1.1 Partnerships for Ending AIDS in Children To actively contribute to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat to children and adolescents, PEPFAR is a committed partner of the Global Alliance to end AIDS in Children by 2030. PEPFAR will collab orate with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF ), the World Health Organization ( WHO ), the Global Fund , private and regional partners , networks of people living with HIV , faith-based organizations (FBOs) , and other stakeholders to ensure optimal commodities, capacity building, advocacy, dissemination of best practices , and support for the elimination of mother -to-child transmission as we ll as pediatric/adolescent activities. 3.1.1.1.2 Innovations for Ending AIDS in Children Reducing Vertical Transmission Pregnant and breastfeeding women have a heightened risk of HIV acquisition because of biological (i.e., lowered immunity), and behaviora l (i.e., intimate partner violence) factors during pregnancy and the postpartum period. As part of the strategy to reduce vertical transmission, COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 26 of 220 PEPFAR programs will ensure that evidence -based interventions are available when they are most impactful. As a part of AP3, country programs should scale evidence -based PMTCT prevention methods , such as routinized maternal HIV retesting protocols and PrEP, to quickly identify and link mothers with new HIV infections to treatment . This is essential if we are to prevent new HIV infections during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Innovations should focus on expanding community models, including faith -based models, to engage and access pregnant and breastfeeding women not attending antenatal care ( ANC ), introduce proven interventions to improve treatment continuity, and form strategic partnerships to improve and comprehensively integrate maternal health services into service delivery platforms. Expanding DSD Models for Children and Families Compared to all other people living with HIV, young children living with HIV who experience treatment interruptions have a much higher mortality rate. Many DSD models focus on family - centered care, but additional innovative community interventions are neede d. Models shown to be effective should be scaled with fidelity. While facility care is effective for some families, others benefit more from community -centered care. We encourage OUs to propose holistic community interventions that incorporate all aspects of the HIV cascade (e.g., case finding, ART initiation/management, continuity of treatment, and viral load collection/management), the management of preventable childhood diseases (e.g., TB and malnutrition), and the facilitation of access to socioeconomic support for those who would not be able to attain viral suppression without assistance , guided by the communities and people being served. In addition, clinical and community -based health care workers serving children and families should be appropriately trained in pediatric care. Improving CLHIV Estimate Accuracy to Find the Missing Children PEPFAR will explore innovative approaches to population -based surveys for children, as well as expand use of data from case -based surveillance, electronic medical records, and cohort monitoring. We will investigate ways to improve the quality and accuracy of HIV incidence and ART retention data for pregnant and breastfeeding women to improve global estimates of children living with HIV. Behavioral research to characterize newly diagnosed children aged 5 - 14 years (including audits of children newly testing positive for HIV ) is encouraged to inform new approaches to find the missing children. We will employ innovative strategies to find missing COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 27 of 220 children by improving demand generation linked to clinical services through multiple avenues (e.g., social media). Ending Preventable Deaths in Young Children Living with HIV PEPFAR data reveal that c hildren under 5 years of age who are living with HIV experi ence disproportionately high mortality compared to all other age groups . Even when children under 5 years old who are living with HIV are on ART , they still appear to have an increased risk of death compared to all other people living with HIV who are on ART (PEPFAR program data). Recommend OUs address this by: Collaborating with partner -country governments to support mortality surveillance systems and continuous quality improvement (CQI) death audits that include cause of death ; this will allow for better target -specific mortality prevention efforts. Improving longitudinal monitoring of mother -baby pairs through indiv idual level data -- simultaneously ensuring infants are clinically managed individually. Ensuring malnourished children , especially in the first 6 months of ART initiation , receive nutritional supplementation. De-stigmatizing HIV in primary pediatric health care settings. Implementing the STOP AIDS WHO package of care for all children with advanced HIV disease (AHD) and planning/forecasting with all stakeholders appropriate AHD commodities, especially cotrimoxazole, to ensure availability at no cost for all eligible children. Improving TB prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment for children. Providing intensive case -management services for all children living with HIV and their families who are newly initiating ART; such case management should last until viral suppression is achieved. 3.1.1.2 Adolescent Girls and Young Women Adolescent girls and young women disproportionately suffer from HIV, and their vulnerability is compounded by persistent gaps in knowledge of HIV status and limited understanding of risks associated with pregnancy and parenting. These inequalities have their foundation in social, economic, cultural, and political structures that create and sustain gender inequality and are especially critical in Eastern an d Southern Africa (ESA). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 28 of 220 In this region, 6 out of 7 (85%) new infections in adolescents (aged 15 -19 years) are among girls. Despite representing just 10% of the population, adolescent girls and young women (aged 15 to 24 years) account for 25% of HIV inf ections. Adding to this, the leading causes of death for females aged 15 -49 years are AIDS -related.10 UNAIDS estimates that 250,000 adolescent girls and young women (aged 15 -24 years) acquired HIV in 2021.11 Furthermore, adolescent girls and young women living in ESA are 3 times more likely to acquire HIV than their male counterparts.12 This gender -related disparity is grounded in social determinants such as harmful gender norms, gender -based violence, unequal access to secondary education, and unequal em ployment opportunities. In almost all countries, case - finding gaps for adolescents and youth are disproportionately high. For example, adolescent girls and young women have the highest proportion of new HIV infections , yet they are less likely to be aware of their status as compared to adults (25 years old). One contributing factor is adolescent girls and young women continue to lack equitable access to health care. This is further compounded by the lack of integration of sexual and reproductive health and HIV services. Specifically for adolescent girls, many countries have prohibitive health care consent laws that prevent access to HIV testing. In many countries, the average age of sexual debut occurs during mid -adolescence . However, in many countries with high HIV prevalence, adolescents under 18 years of age are prohibited from consenting to their own health care , including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. And although some countries have lowered age -of-consent laws for certain services, they may still have misalignment of age of consent across HIV and reproductive health services. Data reveal that a lower legal age of consent for independent HIV testing is associated with an increase in testing uptake among adolescents in high -HIV-burden countries. 10 Global commitment, local action. https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/global - commitments -local-action_en.pdf .

COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 29 of 220 3.1.1.2.1 Pregnant, Breast Feeding, and Parenting Adolescent Girls and Young Women -- a Critical Sub -Population Adolescent and young mothers, especially those who are unmarried, are vulnerable to the negative social and economic effects of early pregnancy, such as violence, stigma, and reduced economic and educational opportunities. These vulnerabilities contribute to heightened risk for HIV acquisition. Indeed, 2021 UNAIDS data show that adolesce nt and young mothers (aged 15-24 years) comprised 42% of all pregnant and breastfeeding women who acquired HIV -- even though they represent only 26% of all pregnant and breastfeeding women.13 Adolescent and young mothers are also less likely to engage in AN C for a variety of reasons, including the lack of adolescent -friendly clinical staff and services . This represents missed opportunities to receive HIV combination prevention, treatment, or sexual and reproductive health services. In addition, data show tha t adolescent and young mothers have lower ANC retention rates as well as delayed and reduced treatment adherence . These factors all contribute to increased vertical transmission, especially in high -HIV-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 3.1.1.2.2 PEP FAR's Commitment to a Gender Equity Approach for Adolescent Girls and Young Women The 2021 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS goal is to reduce new HIV infections to less than 370,000 by 2025, including decreasing ne w HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women to below 50,000. PEPFAR recognizes this goal is only achievable if we address the disparities facing adolescent girls and young women. Thus, PEPFAR is committed to a gender -equity approach for HIV pre vention among adolescent girls and young women in all their diversity --meeting their unique needs through DREAMS and other gender transformative programming. This commitment is not only aligned with the Biden/Harris administration's focus on empowering women and girls, but it also aligns with general U.S. foreign policy, national securit y, and development initiatives . Address ing the disparities that adolescent girls and young women face can also help programs reach UNAIDS 10 -10-10 targets that aim to have less than 10% of 13 World Health Organization & United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF) .

How Will PEPFAR Meet This Commitment? PEPFAR's strategic direction reflects a deep commitment to addressing structural drivers of risk as part of comprehensive HIV prevention. Our prevention approach recognizes that funding for structural, behavioral , and biomedi cal interventions is needed to mitigate AGYW risk. To meet our commitment to decreasing inequities among adolescent girls and young women, PEPFAR will continue what is working with an emphasis on scaling up PrEP and identifying and addressing new gaps through both community and facility -based approaches . To secure DREAMS's gains and expand its impact for adolescent girls and young women, 2 of PEPFAR's key priorities for COP/ROP23 are sustainability and partnerships. PEPFAR will begin to assess and explore opportunities to sustain DREAMS' s aims and interventions for the long term while w orking closely with local partners in government, civil society, communities (including faith communities and traditional communities), the private sector, and adolescent gi rls and young women themselves . PEPFAR should work particularly with multilateral , foundation, and private sector donors to partner in the provision of economic and educational opportunities, and with government partners, to incorporate evidence -based interventions into local structures such as schools and with organizations advocating for structural, systemic , and institutional reforms in law and policy regarding sexual, reproductive , and economic rights of women . DREAMS will also seek to help ensure that participants newly diagnosed with HIV promptly receive life-saving antiretroviral treatment. PEPFAR OUs will need to strategically implement HIV -testing strategies to maximize linkage to prevention and treatment services. Innovative solutions are needed to reach undiagnosed adolescent girls and young women and link, initiate, and main tain them on treatment . For example, innovative community -based and differentiated approaches to case finding among adolescent girls and young women , including expanded self -testing , could be impactful . We also must address gender -specific barriers (e.g., Gender -Based Violence (GBV ) and gender norms) to AGYW clinical, psychosocial, and mental health outcomes. In some PEPFAR -partner countries, a dvocacy may be needed to revise guidelines and influence policy change for inclusive service delivery for adolescent girls and young women. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 31 of 220 Because adolescent pregnant or parenting girls have a higher risk for HIV acquisition, and even when diagnosed the y and their children have an elevated risk for poor HIV treatment outcomes, COP/ROP23 efforts must prioritize reaching this population. Frequently ostracized by family and community members, pregnant and/or parenting adolescents are less likely to seek for mal health services. Every encounter --whether it's at a DREAMS safe spaces group, an OVC home visit, or an appointment at a clinic --presents an opportunity to ensure the girl, her partner(s), and her child(ren) are brought into comprehensive care services that span the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. To improve care access, OUs should ensure that referral protocols and mechanisms are routinely monitored across areas (e.g., DREAMS, OVC, clinical care). Adolescent pregnant and parenting girls living w ith HIV should be: ( 1) offered enrollment in OVC programs; ( 2) offered specialized services to meet their needs if they are already enrolled in DREAMS ; (3) assigned a community case manager; and ( 4) tracked through joint clinic - community case conferencing. PEPFAR teams should also work with national programs to reform policies that limit or restrict adolescent and young mothers living with HIV from further schooling and/or accessing HIV, SRH, sexual and gender -based violence, and social protection services. Finally, since adolescent girls and young women do not live in a vacuum, programming aimed at other populations (e.g., male sex partners of AGYW) will also impact AGYW health outcomes. For example, adolescent boys and young adult men living with HIV are less likely to know their HIV status and all their testing options and are therefore less likely to be linked to treatment and virally suppressed. Furthermore, there is evidence that a large proportion of adolescent boys and young adult men at first/new di agnosis do not have recent or new infections, and therefore remain unaware of their status, unsuppressed, and could transmit HIV to others --especially to adolescent girls and young women who are likely to be their sex partners. Furthermore, some adolescent girls and young women are also members of key populations . Therefore , DREAMS and KP prevention programming should be linked to ensure we meet all the unique needs of vulnerable adolescent girls and young women in all their diversity. Finally, the DREAMS platform provides an opportunity to reach beyond the adolescent girls and young women directly involved in DREAMS programming. DREAMS participants have a unique voice and potential influence with their peers and could be engaged to help normalize HIV service uptake among their peers (e.g., encouraging youth in their communities to know the ir HIV status and their testing options ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 32 of 220 Given the far -reaching nature of gender inequities and the devastating impact on adolescent girls and young women, all PEPFAR programming that adolescent girls and young women access will explore how gender consid erations are integrated into services --including considerations related to the implementation of gender transformative programming. This should be done regardless of the specific technical area or platform (DREAMS, OVC, key populations, and clinical servic es). 3.1.1.3 Key Populations \"Key populations\" throughout this guidance refers to sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men , transgender people, people who inject drugs , and people in prisons or other enclosed settings. The Global AIDS Stra tegy (2021 -2026) and subsequent political declaration by member states emphasize the achievement of 95 -95-95 goals in all subpopulations, including and especially key populations, who have traditionally been left behind and face profound stigma, discrimina tion, marginalization, and criminalization.14 COP resources must be allocated with an equity lens to support partner -country governments in closing gaps in HIV prevention, testing, and treatment access and uptake for key populations . To work with partner countries to advance these goals, PEPFAR teams should: 1. Know and Close the Gaps for KP HIV Prevention and Treatment Services Develop specific strategies and goals to reach and provide differentiated prevention and treatment services to un derserved key populations, based on available data, and in alignment with WHO's Consolidated guidelines on HIV, viral hepatitis and STI prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care for key populations.15 See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.5.1 for a differentiated, person -centered menu of HIV prevention, testing , and treatment interventions .

Address Structural Barriers to Scaling Effective KP HIV Responses and Advance Progress Toward the 10 -10-10 Societal Enabler Targets.16 At minimum, PEPFAR programs should: Conduct assessments or review the legal/policy environment (e.g., the Legal Environment Assessment and Global Fund Breaking Down Barriers assessments17, other) where they are not already being performed (see Section 3.1.1.4 ). 16 Fewer than 10% of countries have punitive legal and policy environments that deny or limit access to services. Fewer than 10% of people living with HIV and key populations experience stigma and discrimination. Less than 10% of women, girls, people living w ith HIV and key populations experience gender inequality and violence. See 2025 AIDS TARGETS (unaids.org) 17 The Global Fund.

Overall , PEPFAR teams should work collaboratively with other partners to ensure coordinated, concerted action at the country level to fund and implement recommended, comprehensive programmatic strategies to address stigma, discrimin ation, and violence at scale and promote partner government and community leadership ; ensure technical support and assistance is provided (both to government and civil society) at the country level for the development of funding applications, national plans , and their implementation and monitoring; and identify key gaps and priorities. Recommended Minimum Package to Address Stigma and Discrimination 1. Programs must continuously monitor stigma and discrimination -related indicators. This is essential for understanding and addressing how stigma and discrimination affect the ways people living with HIV and key populations access and use HIV services. Recomm endations include: Implementing the PLHIV Stigma Index 2.0 routinely (i.e., every 3 -5 years) . Supporting ongoing CLM activities . 2. To ensure a comprehensive response to eliminate stigma and discrimination at scale: Support government, community, civil society, and faith leaders and other key stakeholders to triangulate data on stigma and discrimination from the PLHIV Stigma Index 2.0, CLM, BBSs, and Demographic and Health Surveys to inform the development (or updatin g) of comprehensive national plans, including the selection of key interventions by setting (i.e., community, health care, workplace, education, 26 Global Partnership for Action to Eliminate All Forms of HIV -related Stigma and Discrimination. https://www.unaids.org/sites/default /files/media_asset/global -partnership -hiv-stigma - discrimination_en.pdf .

Each PEPFAR implementing agen cy must also identify a POC to carry out the same functions. The training is available for all PEPFAR staff and IPs at PEPFAR Virtual Academy, and at USAID University (for USAID staff). Alternatively, trainers are available to conduct face-to-face training via implementing agencies and other partners , such as HP +. However, resources to facilitate and host GSD in -person trainings must be covered by the OU , in consultation with agency staff. For IPs, especially those IPs serving key populations, it is highly recommended that similar GSD trainings are offered, strengthening commitments to reduce barriers for people accessing services. 7. In addition, once a ye ar, the GSD POC must convene a panel or panels to discuss PEPFAR's GSD engagement and include LGBTQI+ individuals; key populations; people with mental health concerns; and adolescent girls and young women. Panels should also explicitly address the harms as sociated with so -called conversion therapy. Teams should aim to support panels that are as diverse and inclusive as possible.

COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 42 of 220 3.1.1.5 Primary Prevention to Advance Equity While tremendous progress has been made toward achieving the HIV treatment targets of 95 - 95-95, significant unmet need for HIV prevention services persists. If current trends continue, it is expected that, in the year 2025, 1.2 million people will be newly infected with HIV. This is 3 times more than the Global AIDS 2025 target of 370,000. A new collective approach is needed to bend the curve on new infections. Doubling down on what works in prevention; introducing new product and service delivery innovations; and taking a multisectoral approach across all parts of our government and community infrastructure could be useful strategies to reduce new infections . In addition, once the 95's have been achieved, it will b e important to maintain dynamic, person -centered , HIV prevention programming to continue to reduce new infections and preserve the gains. PEPFAR will continue to focus on prevention with an equity lens --especially for adolescent girls and young women , orphans and vulnerable children , key populations, and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Prevention strategies also need to be normalized and broadly available , reaching and address ing the needs of priority populations. These populations experiencing higher incidence require a precision prevention approach and access to holistic, person - centered prevention care --including the full range of prevention options and evidence -based , differentiated service delivery models . One key aspect of reaching priority popul ations is institutionaliz ing an HIV services continuum where, when a higher -risk person is reached, HIV care--prevention or treatment --is tailored to the needs of the person . In this context, when a person engages with HIV services, their goal, whether it be achiev ing and maintain ing viral suppression or stay ing free of HIV, is supported . This care continuum is sometimes described as status -neutral care. Regardless of HIV status, people engaging with HIV services must be supported in optimizing health outcomes. Prevention support that helps someone remain HIV negative includes , but is not limited to, access to biomedical HIV prevention interventions such as PrEP and PEP, as well as access to condoms and lubricants , VMMC, and a host of community -level social behavioral , and structural focused interventions. This is combination HIV prevention and access and knowledge for user - informed choice is key . The most effective prevention method is the method that gets used ; there is no prevention gold standard for all. Moreover, HIV risk and prevention needs may change often --and someone may start/stop interventions such as PrEP multiple times. Having options increases reach, so facilitating targeted access to the full range of prevention options is COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 43 of 220 critical to achieve UNAIDS targets for reducing incidence. To help end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat, PEPFAR programs should prioritize comprehensive person -centered HIV prevention service packages. Today, nearly all PEPFAR partner countries include combination prevention services with oral PrEP in their national guidelines , and access to and uptake of PrEP has increased , especially in sub-Saharan Africa. PEP FAR works toward the adoption of equitable national policies that ensure broad access to and availability of PrEP. To the extent practical, new prevention products should be layered with existing options. Building combination prevention services delivery o n existing service delivery systems and adding/integrating products into essential and related health services delivery platforms will ensure access and opportunity for all people. When considering combination prevention, PEPFAR encourages programs to also consider including structural reform in the legal and policy environment. Offering additional biomedical PrEP choices could increase use of PrEP generally and HIV prevention services overall. A high priority for PEPFAR is to facilitate affordable and eq uitable access to long -acting PrEP and other new promising prevention interventions on the horizon. PEPFAR also encourages programs to develop human -centered prevention programs, leverage social marketing, and pursue diverse communication avenues (e.g., television , radio, and social media) to deliver relevant behavioral and social support . To attain and sustain our goal of ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat, we must expand PrEP access for diverse populations at risk of acquiring HIV and should do so in partnership with these populations and relevant stakeholders. Effective market shaping hastens new product adoption and, in so doing, encourages potential innovators to engage in new product development. Going forward, PEPFAR intends to work with countries and other donors to help countries to open their markets for new products that have demonstrated or emerging clinical evidence that suggests they could substantially impact programmatic outcomes. In the near t erm, support for market shaping may focus on areas like PrEP . However, market shaping is a critical tool across diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention --not just PrEP. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 44 of 220 3.1.1.6 HIV Testing to Close Gaps and Advance Equity As partner countries, sub-national units ( SNUs ), and populations approach the first 95, HTS plans must adjust and adapt to swiftly close known gaps and to support person -centered, differentiated HIV services across geographies and populations. A successful HTS plan will fully and caref ully address testing done as part of a public health response (typically with higher testing positivity), as well as testing modalities that are part of the standard of care for prevention activities ( e.g., ANC, PrEP, VMMC) which typically have lower testing positivity. A holistic approach accelerates progress across national HTS programs and promotes equity. Plans will recognize 3 key purposes of HTS. 1. HTS support HIV diagnosis (case finding) and linkage to treatment for people living with HIV who have not yet been diagnosed. In almost all countries, case finding gaps for children, youth, marginalized populations, and men are disproportionately high.32 HIV case finding must become more effective to reach, test, and identify undiagnosed individuals l iving with HIV. As programs strategically implement case finding approaches to maximize case detection, these strategies should be tailored to the population(s) that must be reached to close first and second 95 gaps. Public Health Response. PEPFAR aims t o make sure that epidemiologically driven testing , as part of a public health response to HIV , is fully supported. This includes offering quality index testing to all who are eligible , as well as social network testing, testing in TB clinics, and epidemi ologically informed community testing. Wherever possible, HTS that support a public health response to HIV should be designed to align with and support local public health institutional capabilities. It's imperative that programs provide safe and ethical HTS in all modalities --including those for which HTS is standard of care for HIV case finding purposes (e.g., index testing services, TB, STI, malnutrition) and allocate resources to optimize the program's testing strategy based on evidence and data. 32 In Danger: UNAIDS Global AIDS Update for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 45 of 220 2. HTS are often an important step in reengagement to HIV treatment services. Aggregate PEPFAR program data indicate that individuals younger than 35 years of age experience high rates of interruption in treatment and low rates of reengagement. Mo reover, emerging modeling estimates and data suggest that the majority (>50%) of individuals testing HIV positive in sub - Saharan Africa have been previously diagnosed.33-34 HIV programs, including HTS delivery sites, are positioned to serve individuals who may use HTS to reengage in HIV treatment services after a treatment interruption, and leveraging HTS is accepted and should be planned for as an essential and effective linkage strategy.35-36 As noted in the Core Standards, PEPFAR should work with partner governments to maintain quality case surveillance, eliminate duplicate records, and correctly distinguish records for people who are new on treatment from people reengaging in care or transferring from one care site to another. 3. HTS are an entry point and key opportunity for linkage to person -centered, high impact prevention programming for individuals who are HIV seronegative. Consistent access to person -centered, evidence -based HIV prevention services is essential to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. HTS directly contribute to HIV prevention outcomes when individuals with a seronegative HIV status are offered appropriate HIV prevention services. Prevention -focused HTS also provide an opportunity for individuals with high , ongoing risk to be diagnosed earlier should HIV seroconversion occur. To this end, offering and provision of safe and ethical HTS should be standard of care within prevention programming (e.g., KP, PMTCT, PrEP, and VMMC services) and testing positivity wi thin prevention programming is expected to 33 Wilkinson L, July 2022.

COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 46 of 220 be very low. Additionally, the uptake of prevention services will likely increase as a result of increased linkages from HTS to combination prevention services. HTS are integral to a status -neutral approach t o HIV services for populations with elevated rates of HIV acquisition. A status -neutral approach means that all people are directly linked to services appropriate to their health needs (notably prevention or ART services) regardless of HIV status.37 Within HTS, this starts with mitigating barriers to testing (including HIV self -testing) and supporting immediate, seamless linkage to treatment and/or prevention services ( Figure 9). Reducing barriers also includes proactive integration with facility -based services that are not conditional upon accepting HTS. Figure 9 An example of a status -neutral approach to HIV services with linkage to PrEP. HTS are centered on supporting in dividuals' needs through timely linkage to person -centered HIV initiation, reengagement, and/or prevention services.38 Operational considerations for implementing HTS within an integrated , status -neutral HIV service setting: 37 Myers JE, Braunstein SL, Xia Q, et al.

PLoS MEDICINE , in press. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 47 of 220 Effort should be given to developing innovative and efficient ways to provide HTS in a manner that leads to detection as soon as possible and include strategic partnerships with communities and populations that PEPFAR serves. HTS metrics for case finding, reengagement, and prevention must evolve to keep pace with programmatic successes and remaining gaps. Therefore, country programs are encouraged to develop and routinely utilize context -specific metrics to ensure programming continues to mitigate HIV trans mission and HIV associated morbidity and mortality. HIV self -testing (HIVST) is a powerful tool for expanding HTS access to individuals who may not otherwise test and to individuals who are at ongoing risk and may benefit from testing more frequ ently (e.g., adolescent girls and young women, key populations, and men). HIVST can be used within different testing entry points as an approach to HTS, both within health facilities and communities. Due to the high sensitivity of HIVST assays, HIVST can b e used as a screening tool at facilities. The recent increased number of WHO prequalified HIVST assays as well as a reduction in average manufacturer unit cost has provide d a new opportunity to maximize HIVST within HTS programs for all populations for whom HIVST has been approved. Additionally, select HIVST assays have been approved for use in individuals 2 years of age, and therefore can help close pediatric case finding g aps when used by a caregiver or trained provider in accordance with national HTS guidelines . People who choose to use HIVST should only do so voluntarily and should never be forced or coerced to utilize HIVST or disclose results. Granular tracking of HIV ST kits outcomes requires substantial resources and potentially negates the benefit of reaching those less likely to present for testing. Bundling information on where to receive treatment or prevention services with the self -test will allow users to acce ss services as needed. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 48 of 220 3.1.2 Pillar 2: Sustaining the Response As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR's establishment, PEPFAR and our partners must take bold action to preserve the legacy and impact of these investments on saving lives. For the last 20 years , PEPFAR has focused on an emergency response, rapidly scaling the HIV progra m to control HIV and reduce AIDS -related mortality. As part of reimagining PEPFAR, all PEPFAR -supported countries must prioritize sustaining the response alongside progress to reaching 95 -95-95 goals across all populations . Both are integral PEPFAR's purpo se, as per the PEPF AR 5-Year Strategy, to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthening public health systems. In fact, achieving long -term sustainability requires a substantial reorientation or transformation of the way P EPFAR and the entire HIV/AIDS ecosystem implements. 3.1.2.1 Sustainability Principles and Framework PEPFAR defines sustainability as a country having and using its enabling environment, capable institutions, functional systems, domestic resources, and div erse capacities within the national system (including the government, community, and FBOs as well as for-profit and non -profit private sector s) to sustain achievement of 95-95-95 goals ; to ensure equity in its HIV response; and to protect against other public health threats. While every national HIV response may look different, PEPFAR has identified common elements that may be needed to sustain the response . These common elements include, but are n ot limited to , (1) a whole -of-market approach that engages all relevant stakeholders, including communities, to equitably reduce new infections, morbidity, and mortality; ( 2) a national government financially supporting essential HIV services through domes tic resource mobilization and prepared to meet emerging needs; ( 3) sufficient functional (e.g., technical , leadership, managerial) capacity within the country 's local institutions to sustain delivery and impact of key HIV programs, services, systems, and r esources; (4) HIV service delivery integrated into broader public and private health systems; (5) a robust public health response to monitor and track HIV, which can also benefit the management of other existing and emerging health thre ats; ( 6) routinized quality assurance (QA) to effectively manage and monitor HIV services; and ( 7) HIV systems and services that promote equity, dignity, and human rights. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 49 of 220 As PEPFAR programs collaborate with partner -country governments and communities to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, PEPFAR will continue to promote equitable services, serve as a safety net for unexpected setbacks, and catalyze, advocate for, and invest in innovations. However, as partner -country governments increase their oversight and management of the HIV response, PEPFAR's role will continue to transform toward supporting the common elements described above. This will be a gradual process; barring unforeseen developments, time is a resource in this transformation. A thoughtful, measured, and most of all, country -led process is critical to this transformation. As such, OU teams , national governments, the Global Fund, and other key stakeholders should consider both the enabling environment and the core HIV progr am that is required to support the HIV response. Political leadership from national governments (at all levels) is essential to ensure the HIV/AIDS pandemic is back in the political spotlight, which will help unlock activities that will ultimately lead to long-term sustainability of the HIV response. Sustainability Framework The PEPFAR sustainability framework is described in greater detail in the FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.9 . As part of that long -term sustainability framework, the enabling environment is composed of the core health system functions required for the HIV response and broader health outcomes. These health system functions cross several domains: political, program matic (includ ing health services and health systems) and financial. Each domain contains numerous elements, such as policies and governance, service delivery, domestic resource mobilization, community led monitoring. In addition, PEPFAR has long made core investments into 5 areas: ( 1) purchase and timely delivery of commodities; ( 2) support of the right mix of trained health workers in the right locations to deliver services; ( 3) strategizing for, delivering, and ensuring the quality of HIV services; ( 4) utilizing data to accurately target the HIV response; and ( 5) leadership and governance. In the long term, the intersection of these enabling environment functions and core investments is where building capacities and capabilities of a sustainable national H IV response should focus. In service of an emergency response , in many cases, PEPFAR directly established these enabling environment functions while making core investments through international IPs. This has been very effective in scaling up the HIV res ponse quickly; however, it has also resulted in COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 50 of 220 an HIV response that often operates in parallel to the national health system. This approach has served its purpose; however, to sustainably strengthen public health systems for the long term, OU teams should support working through national systems (as described in the focus areas below) as opposed to stand -alone systems and processes. Sections 3.1.2.2 -3.1.2.5 describe 4 focus areas in sustaining the HIV response over the long term, as articulated in the PEPFAR 5 -Year Strategy : (1) the development of a Measurable Sustainability Roadmap where country leaders will join with communities and civil society, bilateral and multilateral partners, global and regional bodies essential to the HIV response to define a specific set of milestones to transition country programs toward increasing leadership and management of the HIV response ; (2) accelerating the integration of vertical HIV service delivery and systems into local health and social systems , including sharing some costs across other service delivery functions ; (3) measurably increasing the underlying capacities and capabilities of local and regional institutions to lead and manage the HIV response ; and ( 4) engaging in integrated national planning across donors to ensure resources are allocated strategically and complementarily in support of sustained HIV impact and synergies with global health security goals are maximized. Looking Ahead to the Next 5 Years The path to a sustained HIV response will be long, and PEPFAR will need to make the change in a stepwise manner. The first step should be to use existing government -led groups (or establish such groups if none exist ), dedicated to pla nning and monitoring the program changes needed to sustain a long -term HIV response (also see Section 3.1.2.2 ). Since sustainability will require new investments, OU te ams should focus on understanding gaps and capabilities of health systems. Funding to close those gaps should come from program efficiencies found within budget envelopes. Implementing efficiencies will have the dual effect of saving programming funds and streamlining essential interventions or elements of the HIV response to increase the likelihood that those elements will be sustained. While efforts to responsibly transition leadership and management of services and systems to local entities may initially be modest, OU teams should take steps along this path while there is still sufficient funding to overcome challenges and/or to correct the course of the transition. COP/ROP23 Process Expectations: As in previous years, in the COP/ROP23 planning process, OU teams should inventory the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 51 of 220 status of health systems in -country, review health system gaps, and strategically explore how PEPFAR can align health system investments with national priorities and the PEPFAR 5 -Year Strategy. This assessment should be done in collaboration with key stakeholders , including other donors who also fu nd health systems and civil society and communities. It should systematically assess strengths and weaknesses across all health system elements (laboratory, supply chain, public health response, human resources for health, public financial management , policies, etc.) that are critical to the enabling environment and support the national HIV response. During this assessment, OU teams should consider how current and desired activities complement other donor investments to maximize efficiency in building a sus tainable HIV response. Likewise, PEPFAR will need to critically assess investments to ensure they not only meet the priorities identified by national governments and communities, but also contribute to strengthening an HIV response that can be sustained ov er time. Similarly , OU teams should identify efficiencies and optimize the use of available resources toward sustaining the HIV response and strengthening the capabilities of public health systems. In an increasingly resource -constrained environment with countries facing a multi -crisis situation, PEPFAR and its partners will need to improve efficiencies and identify ways to optimize limited resources. This will require a detailed understanding of financing availability and need s and the costs of a sustainable HIV response. OU teams should leverage available tools, data, and other resources to inform resource planning, allocation, and execution. OU teams should strive to find greater balance between current program area inv estments and public health system investments; identifying and utilizing efficiencies is critical to adequately fund both the delivery of services and sustainably strengthening public health systems. As a result, during COP/ROP23 planning, OU teams shou ld plan to address critical systems gaps and take advantage of any \"low-hanging fruit\" that may have a substantial impact on sustainably strengthening public health systems. OU teams should also allocate any resources required for the development of a Measurable Sustainability Roadmap, a process that will occur during the 2 years of implementation prior to COP/ROP25 ( See Sectio n 3.1.2.2 ). 3.1.2.2 Mea surable Sustainability Roadmap PEPFAR has reached an inflection point where planning for sustainability is an important aspect of responsible programming. Progress toward sustainability requires that PEPFAR structure COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 52 of 220 investments in a way that strengthens t he national systems and the institutions required to sustain, manage, and lead the HIV response into the future. This focus creates a new opportunity for national governments to leverage PEPFAR investments in support of a long -term vision and roadmap for the national HIV response. PEPFAR will support the design and implementation of a Measurable Sustainability Roadmap, where country leaders (e.g., from various ministries, National AIDS commissions, country coordinating mechanisms , etc. ) will come together with global multilateral entities (e.g., UNAIDS, the Global Fund, WHO , etc. ), regional bodies (e.g., African Union / Africa Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion [Africa CDC ], Pan American Health Organization, et c.), civil society, and key bilateral development partners working in health/HIV to define a specific set of milestones to transition country programs toward increasing leadership and management of the HIV response. The Measurable Sustainability Roadmap will provide a unique opportunity to broaden the HIV/AIDS conversation beyond the health sector and engage directly with national HIV/AIDS planning and coordination structures. HIV/AIDS control requires a multi -sectoral approach, with ministries of justice, foreign affairs, social welfare, education, gender, defense, and finance all needing to play a key role in setting inclusive laws and policies that respect human rights, increase domestic financing, and ensure that popu lations in need can be reached equitably. The process to develop and implement this roadmap will bring together representatives from across the relevant government agencies , civil society and community organizations at the country -level and help to galvani ze collective political leadership. Transforming PEPFAR will take time to involve and align all stakeholders. As such, strengthening the systems and enabling the environment required will be a long -term investment. Sustainability requires that PEPFAR mak e investment and programmatic decisions in line with national priorities and vision. A close working relationship among PEPFAR, the Global Fund, multilateral partners, the national government, civil society , and other local stakeholders is central to this effort. In COP23, OU teams should engage with either a pre-existing national government -led body/group or, as appropriate, support national governments as they establish such a group for sustainability discu ssions, including the Measurable Sustainability Roadma p. Sustainability has implications far beyond the ministry of health (MOH); thus, it is important to be inclusive of all sectors and partners that affect the HIV response, as described above. Establishin g such a body/group, if one does not already exist, COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 53 of 220 with appropriate representation and authority may be a long process, depending on the country. That said, OU teams should prioritize this dialogue with partner -country governments ; other donors ; and multi lateral organizations, communities, and local CSOs. Over the next 2 years, in preparation for the COP/ROP25 planning cycle, OU teams should work with the appropriate national government -led sustainability body or group as well as the relevant stakeholder s described above that will develop the Measurable Sustainability Roadmap. Importantly, PEPFAR should play a supporting or facilitative role in the development of this Measurable Sustainability Roadmap. S/GAC will develop and distribute a toolkit to help OU teams thoroughly consider key issues and critical strategic decisions. This toolkit will be distributed during FY23. Once developed, the Measurable Sustainability Roadmap will help guide all stakeholders' investments and activities toward a sustainable n ational HIV response. PEPFAR will use the roadmap to guide strategic investments, so they remain in line with national priorities. While a country -led Measurable Sustainability Roadmap will differ by country, key considerations may include: ( 1) What are the national priorities? ( 2) What program shifts may be needed to ensure an equitable HIV response and to strengthen public health systems? ( 3) What should domestic financing to eventually transition the response look like? How should this be sequenced relative to implementing program shifts? ( 4) How do program needs or priorities vary among SNUs ? (5) What are the timeframes, deliverables, and monitoring mechanisms ? (6) How do PEPFAR, the Global Fund and other investors align to efficiently and effectively leverage resources ? (7) What are the specific plans, prioritization, sequencing, and indicators or milestones for each major health system function (HRH, supply chain, leadership, polici es, etc.) and core investment (commodities, health workforce, service delivery, etc.)? ( 8) To prevent the loss of gains against HIV, how should risk management at the national level look? Many countries already have sustainability plans for elements of the HIV response ( e.g., supply chain or HRH elements ) or overall HIV sustainability plans. In these cases, PEPFAR support should build upon , and not duplicate , these efforts while ensuring all aspects of the HIV response have been incorporated into these types of plans. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 54 of 220 Additional information about using a government -led sustainability group/body and the Measurable Sustainability Roadmap can be found in FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.9.9 . Risk Management Transformation into a sustainable , national HIV response will require that all stakeholders accept some level of risk. As such, this is included above for consideration in the national government -led Measurable Sustainability Roadmap. Simil arly, as PEPFAR further supports increasing national government management and leadership of all aspects of HIV response, there will be a level of programmatic risk that could lead to a rise in new HIV infections or AIDS - related mortality. National governm ents, PEPFAR , and other stakeholders need to manage programmatic, admi nistrative, epidemiological, and financial risks ethically and carefully. To prevent regressi on in our progress against HIV (or at least quickly identify and address slippages), PEPFAR will need a thoughtful risk management and monitoring plan to support the legacy of its investments, ensure the success of the transformation of the HIV response , and sustain HIV impact. 3.1.2.3 Sustaining Impact Through Local and Region al Organization Implementation PEPFAR programs have made admirable progress in sustaining impact through local and regional partners. COP/ROP23 Guidance reiterates the target of passing 70% of programming funds (for direct and/or indirect services) throug h locally owned, led, and operated organizations (e.g., partner governments; faith -based institutions; KP-led, women -led, youth -led organizations; and private -sector entities). This target applies to all OUs and regional programs. Regional institutions can also contribute to the above local partners ' target. Aligning National Capacity Building with the PEPFAR Strategy Localization, now referred to as national capacity building , (at all levels \u2014national, regional/provincial, district) contributes to the first 3 pillars and health systems and security. It also makes sense from a gap -filling perspective because locally led organizations understand their community's needs best. A loca l perspective is useful for tailoring services to close remaining gaps. PEPFAR endorses and supports the new UNAIDS Global AIDS Strategy that calls on new funding commitments for community -led organizations. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 55 of 220 PEPFAR teams should increase planned funding t o locally led organizations. PEPFAR considers KP -led organizations delivering services to their community as an essential strategy. For example, KP -led health services in community settings should be socially contracted by governments or other entities and should collaborate with public facilities for KP competent services. PEPFAR is also committed to truly local organizations being awarded as prime - and subrecipients that do not rely on international organizations for support or additional programming. Whe n international organizations are part of the consortium, they should have a clear mission that local organizations and work plans don't fulfill. In every case, there should be clear plans for how the work will transition to a local group. National capaci ty building presents a unique opportunity to leverage locally led partners to build effective systems and contribute to other health outcomes and global health security. Ultimately, PEPFAR should strengthen local organizations to become trusted partners --not only for PEPFAR, but for other donors, such as multilateral and bilateral agencies and foundations, and most importantly for the partner -country government. Locally owned and led institutions should access multiple fund ing sources to optimize HIV service delivery. This can decrease duplication of effort and produce more effective outcomes for all. As PEPFAR implementing agencies capacitate local group s, they can invite other donors or partner with local governments to join the effo rt and invest in a way that allows the PEPFAR - sponsored organization access to multiple funding streams. PEPFAR has made significant progress toward supporting and accelerating sustainable country ownership of the HIV response by ensuring that 70% of the country -administered funding should be provided to local prime partners. To this end, during COP/ROP23, programs should understand the quality of the local partners through sharing best practices and challenges. Specifically, in COP/ROP23, PEPFAR will work across the PEPFAR implementing agencies and OUs to develop and implement the national capacity -building agenda. Specific activities will include: ( 1) Promoting cross -agency coordination and harmonization as well as facilitating local and regional p artner, institutions and other stakeholder engagement with the national capacity building efforts and activities; ( 2) Supporting development of the OU's Measurable Sustainability Roadmap (See Section 3.1.2.2) and timeline to ensure measurable program COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 56 of 220 achievements during the first year; and ( 3) Assisting with the scal ing-up and operationalization of the national capacity building agenda across PEPFAR OUs. During the C OP/ROP year, PEPFAR will identify organizations that have the potential to produce significant , long-term gains for initial focused investment activities , such as capacity assessments, training, and mentorship opportunities. This clause should not be seen as a limit to countries that may have multiple organizations ready to contribute to long -term gains. Capacity building at all levels --local, regional/pro vincial, and national --is key to long -term sustainability. Partner governments will be increasingly responsible for large portions of the HIV response and local, community -led groups will be essential for a sustained, equitable response. OU teams should work with governments in G2G arrangements so they can gain experience and build systems with PEPFAR support. OU teams should work with governments to raise confidence in vetted , locally led organizations and embed th ese institutions into government - funded HIV services through social contracting and public -private partnership (PPP) arrangements. OU teams should also promote the establishment of local groups and institutions as social enterprises with stable, self -generated, and independent funding sources. A major stumbling block to sustaining local and regional PEPFAR -supported institutions is that the cost structures are unaffordable and not attuned to local market conditions --principally in wage and benefits. OU teams are required to bring all wages in alignment with the established local salary structures to ensure long -term sustainability of programmatic resources and capacity. All new awards must be aligned with prevailing local conditions. In addition , if fringe benefits are assigned to a position, the position must receive nonmonetary benefits , as appropriate. Any savings these actions generate must be reinvested into the organization's and into subrecipients' systems and capabilities to expand program services and benefits. Capacity -building and mentorship efforts for local partners should continue to be prioritized in COP/ROP23 planning. Time -bound benchmarks that are specific and measurable must be identified for the lifetime of the capacity -building efforts , with efforts culminating in a transition to local partner implementation. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 57 of 220 3.1.2.4 Accelerating Integration As referenced in the section on Sustainability Principles and Framework (See Section 3.1.2.1 ), accelerating integration of health services and systems is key to sustaining the HIV response. PEPFAR and others (e.g., WHO, Global Fund, and multilateral organizations), recognize the importance of working closely with national governments and communities to efficiently and effectively int egrate HIV programming into the local health service delivery infrastructure and public health systems . Integrated health services, \"when based on strong primary care and essential public health functions, strengthen people -centered health systems and cont ribute to the best use of resources.\"39 To support such program transformation and integration, PEPFAR envisions: ( 1) sharpening its assistance of health service delivery and ( 2) measuring capabilities and outcomes of the local public health system's abili ty to manage and lead a greater share of the HIV response. Sharpening Assistance of Health Service Delivery Where appropriate --and in collaboration with national governments and other donors --OU teams should support accelerating integration of HIV servic e delivery into existing local health and social service systems (which could include primary care as mentioned above), and incorporation of HIV data collection and monitoring into broader government processes and systems. As expected, integrated services should meet normative WHO or other relevant standards. Undergoing this transition will require transforming the PEPFAR approach to technical assistance (where applicable ) and creating incentives and controls to ensure that IPs are effectively building capabilities of government, and local, civil society, community -led, and KP-led organizations, and have a clear offramp of funding as part of their funding agreements. Measuring Capabilities and Outcomes of the Local Public Healt h System's Ability to Manage and Lead the HIV Response To strengthen the core capacities and capabilities of national governments and their communities to autonomously lead, manage, and monitor all aspects of the HIV response, PEPFAR will work toward empo wering regional institutions and other partners to provide the 39 Integrating health services: Brief. World Health Organization. 2018. https://apps.w ho.int/iris/handle/10665/326459 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 58 of 220 technical assistance needed in quality management, surveillance, data, laboratory, supply chain, workforce, health financing, and program oversight. Such capacities and capabilities include bui lding or strengthening a functional, integrated, and resilient local health system that can better withstand external threats, such as those from HIV outbreaks or challenges to health equity. This could occur in partnership with other donors or multilatera l organizations to avoid duplication and improve effectiveness. Importantly, to track progress and achievements, OU teams should ensure alignment with other donor , multilateral and national efforts to measure and monitor the capabilities and outcomes of local public health systems on the path to increasing oversight of all aspects of the HIV response. Inclusion of such types of measures and milestones are recommended as part of the country -led Measurable Sustainability Roadmap (See Section 3.1.2.2 ), whereby PEPFAR avoids duplication with other national or global measurement efforts or data systems and, instead, works with partner -country governments to support national surveillance and health information system s and address any measurement gaps. Ultimately, PEPFAR contributions to such measurement efforts should help to monitor the local public health system 's assumption of increasing management and leadership of the HIV response . This trajectory will likely var y from country to country depending on several factors, such as: status of health services and health systems integration, policy environments, maturity of structures and processes at the local health system level, etc. 3.1.2.5 Alignment Sustaining the HIV response will require achieving strategic alignment, complementarity, and efficiency across core HIV and broader health resources for maximum resource impact . PEPFAR will work toward strengthening linkages between HIV -program investments and broader publi c health delivery systems including partner -country government health budgets and data systems. As donor resources become increasingly constrained over time, national governments will have to alleviate dependence on donated resources and assume greater financing, oversight , and management of all aspects of the HIV response. Sustainability requires a detailed understanding of the financing landscape and costs of sustainable intervention models, while actively sharing ideas on how to best leverage limited resources. PEPFAR's 5 -Year Strategy focuses on working with partner -country governments and other stakeholders to adv ance country leadership and management of all aspects of the HIV response for sustained and equitable impact across all populations. This includes sharpening coordination and assistance COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 59 of 220 to ensure that partner -country governments and local partners have the capabilities and tools needed to take on the functional and financial aspects of the HIV response. It's important for ministries o f finance to evaluate the case for continued investments in HIV from health, economic, and national health security p erspectives, with a view to sustainability. It's also important to understand the resource planning, allocation, and execution factors needed to support long -term financial sustainability of the HIV response \u2014all of which ultimately enhance health system ca pabilities. As such, PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and UNAIDS are committed to supporting partner -country governments as they optimize current and future funding streams that could strengthen local systems and capabilities necessary to address HIV and broader health outcomes, foster economic development, reduce inequities, and promote national health security goals. Successful implementation of a Measurable Sustainability Roadmap will require timely and routine availability of reliable HIV and related health financing and program data for informed decision -making by key stakeholders, including donors and partner -country governments. This is even more important given the significant fiscal constraints countries are facing. Increased transparency and availability of HIV and related health and social program financing data, alongside other programmatic data streams, will provide a strong evidence base to inform program planning, budgeting, increased efficiency, and programmatic impact. The routine availability of data and analyses is intended to optimize reso urce alignment, complementarity, allocation, and execution of all available resources. Triangulating observed cost of services data with funding landscape data can improve resources needs estimation, budgeting, and program management. The below list pres ents examples of strategies that can promote alignment and coordination among stakeholders: Ensuring improved alignment on the principles and strategic vision to advance financial, programmatic, and political sustainability of the HIV response Leveragin g ongoing data collaborations (e.g., the PEPFAR, Global Fund, and UNAIDS Resource Alignment [RA]) to help inform the national government -led Measurable Sustainability Roadmap process COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 60 of 220 Identifying opportunities and leveraging funding across internal USG an d external donors to enhance efficiency and optimize use of available resources to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthen public health systems Acquiring a shared understanding of potential Global Fund and/or PEPFAR fundi ng changes by country (where feasible) Assessing shared advocacy strategies and actions that could protect the gains of the HIV response \u2014even when faced with other national crises Promoting necessary changes that could sustainably and equitably increase domestic revenues in the long term Enhancing partnerships among stakeholders that will both utilize the private sector for service delivery and identify innovative financing opportunities Streamlining HIV coordination by working with other development par tners that actively participate in the Health Sector Development Partner Coordination platform 3.1.3 Pillar 3: Public Health Systems and Security 3.1.3.1 Regional and National Public Health Institutions PEPFAR's Strategy includes Strategic Pillar 3: Public Health Systems and Security, with a focus on regional public health institutions (RPHIs) and nat ional public health institutes (NPHIs). NPHIs are integral to a country -led epidemiology and public health response. In countries without an NPHI or where one is being established, essential public health functions may still be the domain of (or shared wi th) ministries of health. RPHIs include the Africa CDC Regional Collaborating Centers for east, central, southern, and west Africa, among others (e.g. , Council of Ministers of Health of Central America and the Dominican Republic in Central America). Strengthening RPHIs' and NPHIs' capacities to address HIV will require capacity building in disease surveillance, data collection and management, and labora tory systems. Supporting local capabilities in these areas will not only preserve the gains made against HIV/AIDS, but it will also strengthen local preparedness and responses for other diseases and outbreaks. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 61 of 220 PEPFAR support for RPHIs and NPHIs is aimed at ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthening public health systems. RPHIs and NPHIs are at various stages (e.g., establishing, operationalizing, expanding) in reaching the aforementioned goals. As such, PEPFAR support will ideally meet NPHIs and RPHIs where they are and measurably help them build capacity in the aforementioned areas. COP/ROP23 above -site funding for NPHIs and/or RPHIs should include activities such as: Participation in surveys such as PHIA Laboratory systems strengthening that achieves HIV service delivery targets Supply chain strengthening that achieve HIV service delivery targets Surveillance systems strengthening that achieves desired HIV outcomes Vital statistics systems strengthening and health information systems strengthening that accelerates ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 Emergency operations center support for outbreak response (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID -19]) Public health workforce support (e.g., epidemiology, lab, surveillance, response) Integrating PEPFAR -supported HIV systems with NPHI -led public health systems Other activities that help RPHIs or NPHIs facilitate HIV control RPHIs and NPHIs are closely tied to Health Security ( See Section 3.1.3.7 ). For example, NPHI staff may carry out the National Focal Point duties (e.g., reporting to the WHO) for publi c health emergencies under the International Health Regulations (IHRs). The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) seeks to improve implementation of the IHRs. OU teams should ensure that PEPFAR COP/ROP23 support for NPHIs and/or RPHIs complements GHSA interagency annual work plans in GHSA intensive support countries and in GHSA countries not categorized as intensive support. In each case, OU teams can use State Party Self -Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) data on IHR capacities and Joint External Evaluations (JEE s) of the partner country 's detection and response gaps to identify areas for support. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 62 of 220 Tools and metrics relevant to NPHIs, RPHIs, and COP/ROP23 planning include: State Parties Self -Assessment Annual Reporting Tool (SPAR) --a national self - assessments of IHR implementation Joint External Evaluation to improve outbreak prevention, detection, a nd response National Action Plans for Health Security developed by some countries after a JEE NPHI Staged Development Tool to assess gaps and prioritize areas for capacity building NPHI Peer -to-Peer Evaluation if completed for the NPHI, should inform COP23 plans 3.1.3.2 Human Resources for Health PEPFAR 's long -standing investments in additive health workers enabled rapid scale up of HIV services and adaptatio ns during the COVID -19 pandemic. In 2020, our investments in the health workfor ce totaled over $1.3 billion and supported compensation for more than 340,000 individuals, of whom 270,000 were clinical and ancillary (including community and social welfare) health workers. Although many of those workers supported PEPFAR only part -time, PEPFAR supported an impressive 250,000 full -time equivalent staff. Our priority remains supporting partner countries to capacitate, manage, integrate, and sustain enduring cadres of partner -country public health leadership and health care workers at all levels (national, sub-national , community, and facility) . This includes increased support for an integrated primary health care workforce including nurses and the co mmunity and social health workforce, along with trained epidemiology, laboratory, and digital health data workforce to sustain impact and protect HIV/AIDS response gains. It is now time to focus on strengthening regional and national leadership and ownersh ip of local institutions to plan for, support, and manage the multidisciplinary health workforce required to provide high quality HIV care (and other essential health services ) and respond rapidly to emerging needs. OUs should critically consider their staffing investments, and chart a new path through implementing the following priorities: Assess and work toward greater alignment of PEPFAR HRH staffing investments within regional and country specific financing and health syst em priorities. Teams should coordinate and align PEPFAR HRH investments with partner -country government HRH planning and priorities. The PEPFAR HRH Inventory is a critical tool for transparency around PEPFAR's health worker investments . It should be use d to identify gaps in the health workforce, as well as COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 63 of 220 misalignments. PEPFAR -supported clinical and ancillary health workers should be supported under terms that are aligned with government recognized cadres, pay scales, and qualifications to the maximum e xtent possible. OU teams should advocate for and invest in decent work and fair pay for all health workers, as well as job creation and gender equity . Teams should also invest in efforts to formalize and align with national government guidance the large informal health workforce at the community level, including community health workers, as a critical resource for health and economic security. If efficiencies must be gained in the health workforce, teams should begin by rationalizing above -site support, as nearly 60% of PEPFAR's staffing financial investments are made at the above -site level. Assess and work toward greater alignment of PEPFAR HRH staffing investments with interagency USG health workforce priorities and other donor investments. OUs should align with , and advance , the priorities and principles of the Biden -Harris Administration's Global Health Worker Initiative . Those principl es are : protecting health workers ( See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.7 ); expanding the global health workforce and accelerating economic development; advancing equity and inclusion; and driving an d investing in technological advancements and innovation. Donor coordination and collaboration is critical to realizing the goals of this initiative. Advance integration of HIV services into broader health services through integrated care delivery teams . PEPFAR HRH support for HIV services should be integrated within country systems for primary health care, rather than provided in standalone models, whenever possible. This shift to greater integration of PEPFAR's health workforce support into country sys tems will allow PEPFAR investments to be leveraged toward strengthening partner -country HRH capacity for delivering high quality primary health care services and sustaining the impact of HIV investments. Integrated care delivery teams, task -shifting, an d expansion of community health worker's roles to include wrap -around services for people living with HIV should be considered. Build stronger regional and country institutional capacity for robust routine health workforce planning, management, and fina ncing. OUs should build ministerial health workforce leadership and strengthen cross -sectoral capacity at national and sub -national levels for improved planning, budget allocation and execution for a well -distributed, diverse, and gender equitable health w orkforce. Teams should consider investing in their capacity for facility management and for contracting out , or in, with the private sector. Critical to these investments COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 64 of 220 is PEPFAR's guiding principle of transparency. Teams should develop data governance policies and agreements or arrangements for managing and sharing PEPFAR -supported staffing data with governments, in consultation with S/GAC and with review s by relevant St ate offices. If PEPFAR funds are used for any of the aforementioned activities , the aims must address HIV services/response. Support regional and national preparedness capacity to rapidly mobilize the frontline health workforce in pandemic responses to me et emergency demands and maintain essential services. Teams should work through regional and national technical assistance partners to strengthen preparedness planning and rapid response capabilities and should develop country preparedness capacity to quickly mobilize its frontline health workforce. This can include leveraging the PEPFAR workforce during pandemic responses to maintain high quality essential health care services, including for HIV, and meet emergency demands. Countries may also wish to enter into Mutual Recognition Agreements, whereby jurisdictions authorize each other's health workers to enter and provide surge health services in emergencies to support outbreak response and medical countermeasures when the receiving jurisdiction's health wor kforce is overwhelmed. Support countries to track and use HRH data. It is critical for governments to track national HRH data and ensure availability and use. PEPFAR investments in the Human Resources Information System ( HRIS ) should result in increased ability of PEPFAR teams and country governments to utilize HRH data for decision -making at national, sub -national, facility and community levels. Do not invest in standalone systems. All HRIS must be fully owned and operated by governments and integrated into government systems. Build regional and country capacity and support for health worker protection. Advance protection for the safety and well -being of health workers and elevate their voices as key HIV stakeholders and influencers of person -centered health services. Build supportive and sustainable work environments for health workers , advocate for policies and resources to support the mental health of health workers , and support infection prevention. 3.1.3.3 Quality Management Quality management (QM) systems are crucial for ensuring that health care services and systems meet accepted standards. In COP/ROP23, PEPFAR is emphasizing alignment with COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 65 of 220 national quality management and transition of PEPFAR -focused QA efforts toward integr ation with country systems. QM provides the framework for ensuring that all elements and associated processes that guide the QM in health care and supportive services. QM comprises 3 separate but related elements: quality planning, QA, and quality improv ement ( Figure 10).40 Figure 10 Quality Management Elements . Quality Planning (QP) -Quality of services requires policies, programs, structures, expertise, resources, and stakeholder engagement, including engagement of recipients of care, caregivers, health care workers , and communities, for a health systems approach to enhanced quality of health care. Quality Assurance (QA) -QA assesses that health services are delivered in compliance with international, national, and PEPFAR programmatic standards of quality and that rec ipients of care are satisfied with the services received. PEPFAR's principal QA tool is the Site Improvement through Monitoring System (SIMS).41 Quality Improvement (QI)-Improving quality refers to any systematic action across the different levels of the health system (national, district, facility) to address gaps and challenges related to making health services more effective, safe, and p erson -centered. Quality 40 Handbook for national quality policy and strategy: a practical approach for developing policy and strategy to improve quality of care. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018. License: CC PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 66 of 220 improvement focuses on the processes and systems that affect how health care is delivered by health workers and received by patients.42 There are multiple approaches to QI in a system and a variety of QI tools. The 4 -step Plan -Do-Study -Act cycle, also known as the Deming Cycle, is the most widely used tool for continuous quality improvement (CQI). 3.1.3.3.1 Quality Management Plan PEPFAR programs should include in the SDS a status for Core Standard 12 ( See Section 3.3 ) and a summary of and/or link to the quality managemen t plan (QMP) for the COP/ROP. This should describe processes, QA standards, and activities that address Core Standard 12 (former MPR #11). The QMP will describe the OU/ agencies' approach for implementing CQI, as well as the methods and standards used for QA through SIMS or another comparable QA approach, aiming for alignment with the host country QMP. The full QMP should incorporate elements that ensure services prov ided are efficient, equitable, timely, integrated, safe and effective.43 The QMP may serve as a reference for the inclusion of QA/CQI elements in the IPs' work plans to ensure a coordinated implementation in alignment with national QI guidelines and priori ties. Consider the following elements when preparing a QMP: 1. Quality Planning : OUs will collaborate with ministries of health and multilateral partners to catalyze the large number of HIV workers , across cadres, that have received QA/QI training at national, district and facility levels as facilitated by agencies and PEPFAR -supported IPs. Planning activities will assess that there are policies, work plans, tools , and guidelines in place to support QA/CQI activities. PEPFAR will translate learning from PE PFAR -supported QI projects, laboratory, and commodity CQI systems, and specialized technical expertise into ongoing national technical assistance and within multilateral partner investments. 42 Introducing the WHO Quality Toolkit: supplemental overview. https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240043879 43 Delivering quality health services: a global imperative for universal health coverage.

Quality Assurance (QA) : SIMS tools have been the principal standardized QA tool used across PEPFAR supported sites to assess whether sites meet PEPFAR's quality standards. In COP23, PEPFAR OUs may decide whether to use the SIMS program, an adaptation of the SIMS program, or a com parable alternative program aligned with the national QA approach that assesses standards at the site level. To support sustainability of the program, OU QA tools should be in alignment with the national QM strategy and plans. Recognizing that countries ar e at different stages in the development and implementation of QA activities, flexibility will be required to adapt to the national context while the country moves toward a more mature QA strategy and plan. Agencies operating in the same sites and OUs shou ld therefore coordinate their QA approach to avoid the creation of parallel programs that may generate confusion and make it difficult to report on QA results. Agencies should not develop bespoke data systems to support SIMS functionality. Rather, PEPFAR s hould have a unified QA approach that aligns with partner -country QM strategy and includes standards comparable to SIMS Core Essential Elements ( CEEs ). An S/GAC waiver is not required for OUs/ agencies opting out of SIMS. OU s/agencies that opt to use an ad aptation or comparable alternative to the SIMS approach should notify S/GAC_SIMS @State.gov of their decision and include in their QMP considerations to ensure that the comparable QA process and tools follow ethical considerations , such as the protection o f personally identifiable information and an assessor confidentiality agreement. The QMP should include information on QA/CQI implementation guidelines, QA data management plan, and capacity building to implement the QA/CQI activities among others. OUs/agencies that plan to continue usi ng SIMS for QA, should follow SIMS 4.2 Implementation Guidelines using SIMS 4.2 materials .44 An updated PVA SIM S course has been developed to provide training to USG and non -USG SIMS users . SIMS 4.2 materials and guidelines will be maintained and updated to ensure that they are fully operational to support PEPFAR programs QA/CQI. 44 FY23 SIMS 4.2 Materials - DATIM (zendesk.com) COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 68 of 220 3. Quality Improvement: OUs can use a range of CQI approaches and tools, but the emphasis should be on a multimodal suite of interventions tailored to the local context and aiming to create a culture of quality. CLM is an important strategy for improving service delivery . The development of the QMP should reflect an understanding of the CLM system in the given country ( See Section 3.2.1 ). 3.1.3.3.2 Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) SIMS Data A recent review of PEPFAR data streams (PEPFAR Data Summit, September 2022) recognized that the most important use of SIMS data is at the OU level, where standards can be assessed, analyzed, and a ddressed in a timely manner within the specific country and site context. Specific use cases for PEPFAR -wide reporting of SIMS data are limited. However, during FY23, a concentrated assessment of SIMS 4.2 IPC CEEs will be requested by the interagency group s on quality management and site safety. Given investments and concerns around COVID -19 and other health threats, we want to assess PEPFAR sites preparedness in IPC practices and to provide aggregated data that will inform decision -making and program gu idance. SIMS 4.2 IPC data can help assess the impact of IPC investments and programs. IPC SIMS data will be obtained through Concentrated SIMS 4.2 assessments (only IPC CEEs) or as part of a SIMS Comprehensive assessment. IPC assessments can be fully rem ote and will be conducted within a designated sample size of PEPFAR supported sites in all OUs. IPC assessment guidelines will describe sample size and algorithm for prioritization of sites. IPC SIMS data will be reported through agency specific systems an d agencies will report IPC CEE data to S/GAC through Data for Accountability, Transparency , and Impact Monitoring (DATIM ) (Figure 11). IPC SIMS assessments scoring red/yellow will receive a follow -up assessment within 6 months as per the SIMS 4.2 Implementation Guide . A new IPC Dossier in Panorama will provide analysis and visuals. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 69 of 220 Figure 11 SIMS 4.2 Infection Prevention and Control Data Report . 3.1.3.4 Supply Chain PEPFAR will continue to evolve supply chain s for HIV . The goal is to have an integrated health care commodity supply chain system that is people -centered, responsive, efficient, adaptable to outbreaks and emergencies, transparent , and sustainable . Strengthening partner government oversight, developing meaningful local private -sector partnerships , and ensuring effective regulatory authority systems are in pla ce can promote supply chain sustainability. Regional Manufacturing PEPFAR's core strategic goals for commodities sourcing and procurement are to improve regional self -reliance and ensure a sustainable HIV commodity supply. Establishing regional manufacturing reduce s HIV program dependence on imported commoditie s and creates better access to essential commodities. It also shortens the supply pipeline thereby reduc ing supply chain disruption vulnerabilities. At the U.S. -African Leaders Summit on December 13, 2022, Ambassador Dr. John Nkengasong announced PEPFAR's target of procuring 15 million HIV tests produced by African manufacturers in 2025 at an estimated cost of $20 million, alongside those purchased by other donors and partners. For antiretroviral treatments, by 2030, PEPFAR aims to work alongside COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 70 of 220 other partners and buyers to shift at lea st 2 million clients on first -line antiretroviral ( ARV) treatments to use African -made products. NextGen Supply Chain Design As of this document's drafting, PEPFAR is in the process of procuring the NextGen supply chain suite of mechanisms . The core principles of the suite will require product and supply chain segmentation to create more effective client -centered supply chains --leaning on private sector logistics partners may also promote efficiency and drive economic growth. The implementation of end -to-end supply chain visibility using global standards (GS -1) will strengthen supply chain security and ideally reduce risk . COP23 will be a transition year for central supply chain mechanisms (Next Gen). Budgeting for central supply chain mechanisms should not change in COP23. Current Supply Chain Interventions Supply chain interventions will continue to support people -cente red HIV services to improve client convenience and to maximize product availability, quality, and affordability.45 With this goal in mind, PEPFAR will continue to focus on extending the supply chain to support ARV optimization, validating testing algorithms, facilitat ing testing for priority populations including children , continuing MMD, and decentraliz ing drug distribution (DDD) . Engaging community health workers, community partners, private sector partnerships, and innovative re -supply solutions can help modernize supply chains and make them sustainable.46-47 Ultimately, a resilient supply chain landscape requires that supply chain strategies and operations are geared toward meeting evolving and future programmatic needs. 45 Coulter, A., & Oldham, J.

The PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 71 of 220 Supply Chain Modernization Adopting innovative distribution models can help countries modernize supply chains. Examples of innovative mechanisms that optimize commodity and sample management and improve supply chain performance and sustainability include new DDD models, Diagnostic Network Optimizations (DNOs), and vendor managed inventory models ( See Section 3.1.3.5 ). Decentralized distribution approaches can help ensure supply chains work for patients. Examples of decentralized distribution approaches to scale include home deliveries, use of community or private pharmacies, and increasing pharmacy in a box or automated locker use. DNOs (See Section 3.1.3.5 ) can a lso inform laboratory supply chain refinements and contribute to commodities forecasting and all -inclusive pricing agreements. DNOs that take all stakeholders into consideration can achieve greater viral load coverage and reduce turnaround time for clinici ans and patients, while reducing waste. Supply Planning, Strategic Sourcing, and Procurement Conduct ing an accurate and complete forecast that captures the total country needs for national programs --inclusive of PEPFAR, the Global Fund, the partner government, and other funders' objectives --can help programs correctly estimate commodity requirements. Forecasts should include considerations that support optimized testing and treatment. Th e obtained information should then inform supply pla n updates . Teams should consult commodities experts in Washington , D.C. for any technical assistance needed with commodity and supply chain programming. OUs should facilitate submission of their updated supply plan such that it can be used to auto- popula te the Supply Plan Tool (SPT). Updating the SPT and the Funding Allocation to Strategy Tool ( FAST ) Commodities Tab E remains a COP requirement . However, updating the in -country supply plan should occur more regularly, at a minimum quarterly, but ideally mo nthly --and data must be available within the interagency space. Supply chain planning should include mitigating strategies that prevent delayed deliver ies, avoid overstocking , prevent stock outs and shortages, facilitate s ubstituting products/formulation s where necessary , provide appropriate buffer stock, and address budgetary considerations to account for high and variable freight costs. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 72 of 220 Once the COP is finalized, address ing budgeting increases for commodity procurement or reallocation of excess funds w ithin the commodities budget may require submission of an Operational Plan Update ( OPU ) or OPU lite (email pepfarcommoditiesteam@usaid.gov with questions) . The revised commodities SPT, FAST commodities tab, and an OPU submission will be required at the beginning of FY24 and FY25 Q3 period . Commodity procurement planning and national targets must align to provide the requisite commodities and ensure an appropriate level of buffer stock . Strategic sourcing allows PEPFAR to leverage lower -access prices negotiated for ARVs, HIV test kits, and all -inclusive pricing for lab tests . This increases efficiencies --including cost savings --and improve s commodity availability. Country teams should confirm their country's eligibility for lower -access price procurement of HIV commodities. Commodity procurement is based on data -driven forecasting and supply planning and should be aligned to the planned interventions and activities for reducing HIV burden. All ARVs quantified for should be on the PEPFAR Tiered ARV list --ideally, within Tier One. Procurement of Tier Two ARVs will receive greater scrutiny than those in Tier One. To obtain a tier list and/or to obtain more guidance, please contact the OU's Supply Chain backstop, who is also the SPT reviewer . Country teams should continue to collaborate with in -country stakeholders to harmonize national guidelines (to include tenofovir -lamivudine -dolutegravir , new PrEP products, and optimized ARV regimens for all patients living with HIV) with WHO best practices. Teams must ensure that the 18 -month ARV supply plans are comprehensive and reflect: DTG -base d treatment transition Product registration Consideration for OU minimum and maximum stock levels (considering buffer stock) Stakeholder engagement Descriptions of facility level implementation, monitoring, and uptake Pediatric ARV optimization MMD and DDD scale up COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 73 of 220 Data Visibility and Reporting To improve transparency and accountability , PEPFAR needs increased visibility into the availability of HIV commodities across all levels (and stakeholders) of the supply chain (i.e., central, regional [sub -national], and site [facility] level). Access to data should also include current and future orders across all procurement by the partner -country government and donors (PEPFAR, the Global Fund, etc.). PEPFAR expects more granular -level reporting of sup ply chain data to ensure effective use of funding for commodities. Facility partners will be asked to report on the quantities of ARVs dispensed ( Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting [ MER ] SC_ARVDISP) as well as the quantity of stock available on the shelf (MER's SC_CURR) for select ARVs at the end of the reporting period. These data should be routinely reported through the country's Logistics Management Information System. Countries are en couraged to monitor their supply chain performance using standardized metrics, focusing on continuous quality improvement. PEPFAR will enhance supply chain visibility through implementation of several activities: The Procurement Planning & Monitoring Report (PPMR -HIV), supported by Global Health Supply Chain -Procurement and Supply Management (GHSC -PSM) , will capture data inpu t by MOH or a designated Partner(s) in each country for central and sub-national level stock and anticipated shipment data (contact GHSC -PSM to start reporting) including, but not limited to, ARV, HIV RTK, and TPT commodities. Data -driven commodity quanti fications as they exist in Microsoft Excel, PipeLine, the Quantification Analytic Tool , or other software. Continue to coordinate resource alignment with the Global Fund. Openly sharing s upply chain and commodity data can help ensure data informs supply plans -- collaborative, data -informed work can also mitigate stock risk s. Where possible, programs are encouraged to discuss formal data usage agreements with stakeholders , including MOH officials and other donor s. As a part of these discussions, programs should work to understand if additional activities are necessary to ease country concerns over data use and to secure data storage. Programs should also harmoniz e and regular ly update master product lists and master facility lists; doing so in collaboration with the appropriate stakeholders can p romote master data COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 74 of 220 management. To ensure list consistency , it is important to harmonize with global programs such as PEPFAR's Master Facility List and the partner governmen t's MOH Master Facility List. Reach out to Supply Chain as often as needed to help guide the adoption and us e of supply chain data standards. Other Supply Chain Considerations Responsive and adaptable supply chains are not only appropriately stocked , but they also have local leadership, effective regulatory authorities, and well -documented processes in place. Building supply chain capability to engage in symbiotic partnerships with public and private sector entities can help system s adopt innovative approaches . Ideally, par tner-country governments will also continue to grow supply chain oversight and monitoring capacity . Ideally, s upply chain strategy and operations would: Optimize collection, management, and use of supply chai n-related data to improve processes and ensure timely, transparent, and accountable commodity ordering, distribution, and final -mile delivery. Establish reliable and consistent data systems (paper to digital) that enable evidence - based decision -making at a ll health -system levels --as appropriate to each program 's context and across technical areas. Reduce long-term dependence on donor funding and refocus technical assistance to increase local oversight of public health supply chain s. Accelerate the utilizati on of private sector capabilities and infrastructure, where appropriate. Outsourcing certain supply chain elements, such as warehousing and distribution, may improve efficiency and effectiveness.48 Manage and mitigate procurement and supply chain related risk through routine performance data analysis using standardized metrics.49 Support third -party monitoring for assessment and oversight of local partners and supply chain programs . Monitoring strategies should mitigate and manage the following: performance, commodity leakage, warehousing, distribution, and fair pricing . Effective 48 GHSC -PSM. (2014, May 1). Technical Report: Logistics Outsourcing and Control Management in Public Health All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 75 of 220 monitoring can foster open procurement processes, increase transparency , continuous ly improve process es, and help avoid conflict s of interest. Provide multilateral coo rdination to monitor shipments from all sources, while sharing data to promote transparency and avoid over or understock situations. Foster c ollaborat ions with donors and other stakeholders to receive the most competitive prices for commodities and requir ed logistics. Such collaboratio ns should include market -shaping initiatives that can drive down prices and thereby help programs use existing resources to address more needs . Proactively share knowledge and data between interagency supply chain and clinica l IPs through appropriate channels . Ideally, a group that includes representatives fr om the partner country 's MOH, the Global Fund , and interagency IPs would routinely meet and discuss -in-country commodities availability, upcoming shipments, requests for stock distributions, and technical working group recommendations to shift provider prescribing patterns to mitigate stock -out risks. Increase supply chain literacy and fluency across partners and HRH . Short courses, \"Brown Bags, \" and other training opportunities can support this goal.

This was demonstrated during the COVID -19 pandemic where country public health laboratory systems were levera ged to support SARS -CoV-2 diagnostics, while sustaining past HIV and TB gains. As the global community integrates diagnostic approaches that support global health security, PEPFAR must review and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 76 of 220 broaden its strategy to continue strengthening partner -count ry public health systems. These system -strengthening initiatives, coupled with community -led efforts, are required to sustain long-term impact on the HIV /AIDS epidemic, and they can be leveraged to respond to other infectious disease outbreaks. This per spective aligns with PEPFAR Strategic Pillar 3 (Public Health Systems and Security). It is helpful to visualize laboratory services and systems as cross -cutting where strengthened systems support services needed to achieve person -centered care, clinical -laboratory interface, effective outbreak response, and other public health practices. Hence, both laboratory services and systems must be strengthened together (Figure 12 ). Figure 12 Laboratory Systems and Services are Linked and Cross -Cutting. These link ed components must be simultaneously strengthened to ensure impactful person -centered and greater public health outcomes. Source: Modified from Nkengasong et al, 2010 .50 Laboratory Quality Management Systems (QMS) and Accreditation 50 Nkengasong JN, Nsubuga P, Nwanyanwu O, et al. Laboratory systems and services are critical in global health: time to end the Page 77 of 220 PEPFAR's focus on Laboratory QMS should be directed toward continuous quality improvement and achieving international accreditation of testing laboratories. HIV rapid testing remains critical to the PEPFAR response. Several recently published and unpublished program results indicate that poor quality HIV tests, national testing algorithm limitations, and errors in the HIV testing process can all lead to HIV status misdiagnosis.51 To ensure reliable HIV testing results, programs should continue to use the WHO/PEPFAR supported HIV Rapid Testing Continuous Quality Improvement Initiative and point -of-care testing (POCT) site CQI using the Stepwise Process for Improving the Quality of HIV -Related Point -of-Care Testing checklist . 52 Additionally, the WHO recommends that people newl y diagnosed as HIV infected should be retested before initiating ART.53 The Strengthening Laboratory Management Towards Accreditation (SLMTA) training tool, together with the WHO Regional Office for Africa African Society for Laboratory Medicine Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation, and other relevant checklists are helpful for monitoring laboratory quality improvement and preparing for accreditation.54 Ideally, each country would have a QA program to promote and support a laboratory's QMS. Where this is lacking, strong policies should be developed to support national integrated quality systems strengthening for HIV and other diseases. Integrated Sample Transport System Efficient sample transport systems are critical to ensure timely delivery of samples and test results --this is an especially important consideration for remote areas that rely on central laboratories for testing. Over the years, some countries have continue d to operate silo sample transport systems, which tend to be inefficient and not cost effective. And while there may be historical reasons for employing silo transport, the recommended move toward diagnostic integration and multi -disease testing means we n eed to better leverage generic integrated sample transport system. Prioritizing people -centered approaches and collaborating with 51 Johnson CC, Fonner V, Sands A, et al. To err is human, to correct is public health: a systematic review examining poor quality testing and misdia gnosis of HIV status. J Int AIDS Soc . 2017;20(Suppl 6):21755. doi:10.7448/IAS.20.7.21755 52 20, 2022 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 78 of 220 community leadership helps build capacity for community sample collection and transportation - -and thereby decrease turnaround time for test results. Hub and Spoke models, when applied within national sample transport systems, could facilitate more community centered POCT and dried blood spot (DBS) or dried plasma spot (DPS) sample collection. We encourage PEPFAR programs to explore this innovative strategy. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Having diagnostic integrated data systems that incorporate LIMS linked to (or integrated with) facility data systems improve test -result turnaround time and mini mize errors associated with manual data entry. As such, development and deployment of LIMS should remain a top priority for all PEPFAR programs. Furthermore, this priority aligns with general data guidance in Section 3.2. Not only do integrated systems hasten test result communications, but they can improve inventory processes and thereby reduce the likelihood of stockouts. It's also important for programs to establish electronic i ntegrated national and regional surveillance and laboratory networks response systems for real -time disease reporting. Real -time reporting supports global health security because it improves disease surveillance, supports agile outbreak responses, helps us to track antimicrobial resistance, bolsters noncommunicable disease (NCD) surveillance, and facilitates coordinated pandemic responses. Diagnostic Network Optimization (DNO) Sustainable outcomes require efficient laboratory operations. DNO t hat increases access to testing and network efficiencies, decreases total cost per test, and improves specimen -to- clinical action turnaround time will ultimately, improve laboratory efficiency.55 Countries that have completed baseline network assessments and s upported additional investments in comprehensive DNO modeling exercise but are also supporting implementation of recommendations and continued diagnostic network CQI activities are better prepared to respond to pandemics --this was exemplified during the CO VID-19 pandemic. We should use evidence -informed and person -centered strategies to both centralized and POC instruments complementarily. PEPFAR supported countries planning to update their networks (or programs 55 Nichols et al. (2021) https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11010022 Acc essed October 20, 2022 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 79 of 220 transitioning to new platforms --conventional or POC), should consider how their DNO can better support appropriate selection, placement, and integration of POC and conventional instruments in the context of the national tiered public health laboratory network. Diagnostic Integration and Multi -Disease Testing As countries move to strengthen global health security, pandemic preparedness, and responses to outbreaks, there have been strong recommendations to shift from silo testing to integrated diagnostics and multi-disease use of platforms. Several technologies, including laboratory - based and near -POC and POC assays, can be used to diagnose and monitor multiple diseases (e.g., HIV, TB, COVID -19, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus (HPV), etc.).56,57 Multi -disease testing has many potential advantages: ( 1) it provides diagnosis in a one -stop shop; ( 2) it helps programs respond to global co -infection crises; ( 3) it improves test efficiency and turnaround time (4) it lowers testing costs; and ( 5) it provides an opportunity to diagnose and monitor treatment for patients with advanced HIV disease. When disease -specific priorities are accounted for and implemented appropriately, this approach enables differentiated diagn osis, which can lead to improved acces s and service delivery.58 For example, PEPFAR programmatic data show that during the COVID -19 pandemic, multi -disease and integrated diagnostic approaches in some countries led to quicker testing/result turnaround time, safe and secure specimen referral and transport, and rapid expansion of COVID -19 testing ( Figure 13). Furthermore, a multi -disease HIV and TB testing evaluation in Zimbabwe and Malawi led to increased instrument utilization and faster and improved rates of clinical action for HIV+ infants and viremic people living with HIV on ART without negatively impacting TB testing and treatment services.59-60 Considering the many benefits of integrated diagnostics and multi - disease testing options, we recommend that PEPFAR supported programs incorporate these tools to address HIV testing inequities, and to fill other global health security diagnostic gaps. 56 UNITAID (2018) 2022 57 Alemnji G, Peter T, Vojnov L, et al.

During COVID -19, South Sudan was able to multi -disease use the GeneXpert platform for early i nfant diagnosis (EID) of HIV and to test for TB, COVID -19, and HIV viral load (VL). This case -in-point example illustrates the impact of diagnostic integration and multi -disease testing during routine and outbreak responses. Biosafety and Waste Management Laboratory safety programs are necessary to: Ensure quality operations and dependable test results, Prevent employee exposure/occupationally acquired infections, Minimize the risk of hazardous/ infectious agents making their way into the environment, and Protect biological agents from loss, theft, or misuse (biosec urity). Diagnostic laboratories generate waste in different categories (e.g., chemical, infectious, radioactive, controlled substances, pharmaceutical, multi -hazardous, sharps, non -hazardous, etc.).61 Each waste category has its own management and removal requirements. PEPFAR has traditionally worked closely with partner -government MOH officials and other stakeholders to ensure safe laboratory waste disposal. Efforts have included the assessment of waste volumes ; 61 CDC (2020) https://www.cdc.gov/labs/pdf/CDC -Biosa fetyMicrobiologicalBiomedicalLaboratories -2020 - P.pdf Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 81 of 220 the development of novel hazardous waste mit igation procedures ; training on waste management provision of incinerators ; the procurement of disposal containers ; the development of training centers for biosafety cabinet certification and ancillary laboratory equipment calibration ; and the provision of necessary protective materials/equipment , such as personal protective equipment . We encourage programs to continue these collaborative efforts. Laboratory Workforce Laboratory testing staff, managers, and supervisors can benefit from ongoing training opportunities that position them to effectively lead in the prevention, detection, and control of diseases. QMS -focused laboratory trainings , such as Strengthening Laboratory Management toward Accreditation , and targeted mentorship training, including the WHO Global Laboratory Leadership Programme, are some options to consider.62 Many field epidemiology training programs (FETP s) lack the \"L\" component that incorporates training laboratory staff. Including laboratory staff in field epidemiolog y laboratory training programs (FELTP s) will ensure they can fully partner with country national public health responses during outbreaks. Laboratory Institutions and Policies Achieving and sustaining community engaged, person -centered health outcomes will require bolstering laboratory services and systems. Key policy issues to consider include: DNO, use of POC testing platforms, all -inclusive pricing approaches and integrated diagnostics and multi - disease testing. Expanding th e core capabilities of local partners and laboratory related institutes is also necessary for sustainability. Laboratory systems of national and regional public health institutes should be strengthened to ensure sufficient capacity for downstream support o f other laboratories within the countries and regions --particularly regarding outbreak investigation, pandemic preparedness, and response . PEPFAR's laboratory activities within the Integrated Diagnostic Consortium , and collaborations with individual instit utions (e.g., MOHs, Africa CDC, WHO, GF, Unitaid, UNICEF, the Clinton Health Access Initiative , etc.) have helped align resources and approaches. For example , during the COVID -19 pandemic , these partnerships accelerated a coordinated response. PEPFAR encourages PPPs to help to avoid siloed, duplicative, and inefficient capacity building efforts and the ineffective use of resources. 62 WHO (2021) https://www.who.int/initiatives/global -laboratory -leadership -programme ? Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 82 of 220 3.1.3.6 Person -Centered Services to Reduce Mortality and Address Co - morbidities In PEPFAR's Strategy , reducing mortality is a critical component of sustaining the HIV response. Maintainin g treatment continuity and achieving virologic suppression reduces HIV related mortality. Unfortunately, certain populations --including those with advanced HIV disease, adults over 50 years, and children under 5 years --still suffer high mortality. To reduc e mortality and improve quality of life, these individuals would benefit from person - or family - centered services. Individuals with advanced HIV disease should receive the WHO package of care, which has been demonstrated to reduce morbidity and mortality ( See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.4.2 ). To end preventable deaths, children under 5 --particularly within the first 6 -months of initiating ART --should receive interventions described in Section 3.1.1.1 .2. Tuberculosis Of the 660,000 annual deaths among people living with HIV, 28 .7% are attributable to TB. Approximately 190,000 TB/HIV deaths each year can be prevented with adequate care. The negative impact of COVID -19 on TB case finding and treatment is expected to result in an additional 550,000 deaths attributable to TB globally by 20 25 (Figure 14 ), and a substantial proportion of these deaths will be among people living with HIV. Of the estimated 703,000 new TB cases annually among people living with HIV, 330,000 (47%) remain undiagnosed and untreated. Despite the scal ing up of TB pre ventive treatment (TPT) among people living with HIV, global TPT coverage among people living with HIV is only 42%. Targeted and intensive implementation of a comprehensive package of HIV/TB interventions is needed to reduce TB -associated deaths among pe ople living with HIV. ( 1) universal early ART; ( 2) TB case finding using sensitive TB screening and diagnostic tools; and (3) completion of TB preventive treatment for all people living with HIV. Relying solely on poorly sensitive TB sympto m screening among people living with HIV is substandard HIV care which leads to underdiagnosis and undertreatment and contributes to TB -related mortality. Implementation of more sensitive TB screening and diagnostic methods (such as chest X -ray with comput er-aided detection, C -reactive protein, lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF - LAM) antigen testing, molecular WHO -recommended rapid molecular diagnostic tests, and use of non -sputum specimens for children) can improve TB diagnosis and treatment and ther eby COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 83 of 220 reduce TB -related mortality. TPT also saves lives and universal TPT coverage will complement other interventions. All PEPFAR OUs should build upon successes to date and achieve 90% TPT coverage. Also, concerted efforts are needed to improve TB screenin g, diagnosis, and treatment among people living with HIV. Figure 14 TB Treatment and Notification were Lower in 2020 Versus 2019. (A) COVID -19 led to some lost ground in the fight against TB in HIV patients. Fewer people received TB treatment in 2020 versus 2019; and (B) In 2020 , TB notifications were lower than in 2019 --and although some gains were made in 2021, TB notification levels were still not as high as they were in 2019. Source: WHO publicly available data.39 Advanced HIV disease Newly diagnosed people living with HI V presenting with AHD (those with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 as well as all children under 5 years old), individuals re -engaging in care after a 1 year or more interruption, and those with persistent viremia of a year's duration or greater should be offered the WHO package of care outlined in Section 6.4.2 of the FY24 Technical Considerations . This package of care can be offered to others if clinically indicated . Initiation of ART, except when there is an active intracranial infection, is emphas ized, and there are new recommendations for the treatment of cryptococcal disease an important cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Linking hospital and outpatient services is helpful in caring for this vulnerable population. Health systems should be adequately resourced and capacitated to ensure a higher -level acuity of care can be provided. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 84 of 220 Older Adults Older adults (people 50 years -of-age or older), represent a growing HIV treatment cohort. It's estimated that by 2025, over a third of the population that PEPFAR serves will be over age 50.40 PEPFAR data support the notion that once established on treatment, older adults have low er rates of treatment interruption and achieve virological suppression.41 Person -centered care focuses on reducing mortality and improving the \"health span\" --the period of life spent in good health, free of chronic diseases and aging -related disabilities.42 A growing body of evidence identifies hypertension (HTN) , dysglycemia, renal insufficiency, and obesity as common comorbidities that can complicate HIV treatment.43 Person -centered care for older adults facilitates treating multiple conditions at onc e, which can reduce unnecessary visits --potentially shortening facility waiting times. This care model also aligns PEPFAR priorities with MOH priorities for primary care and noncommunicable diseases. Preliminary data suggest clients and health care workers consider integrating HTN screening for older adults on ART feasible and acceptable. HTN management in this model seems comparable to what NCD clinics are achieving --but with the added benefit of identifying HTN in previously undiagnosed patients and linki ng them with care.44 Today, approximately 25 million people living with HIV reside in sub -Saharan Africa, and about 6 million (25%) are estimated to also have HTN, of whom evidence suggests that <25% are treated. This represents a lost opportunity to avoid at least 100,000 cardiovascular diseases (CVD ) events and 50,000 CVD deaths over the next 5 years by treating people living with HIV for HTN. In alignment with PEPFAR's strategic pillar of sustaining the response and recognition of the life -threatening unmet need of uncontrolled HTN among adults living with HIV, countries designated in the COP23 Planning Level Letters ( PLLs), in which there is a high burden of HIV and people living with HIV with HTN, are encouraged to implement high -quality services for the management of HTN among people living with HIV . These high -quality services includ e: (1) screen ing for HTN among all adult people living wi th HIV at least annually; ( 2) implement ing standard HTN treatment protocols in primary care; ( 3) ensur ing access to essential HTN medicines for people living with HIV; and ( 4) track ing patient outcomes and program performance using an information system. S uch integrated programs will advance PEPFAR's goal of utilizing its platform to improve public health for people living with HIV. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 85 of 220 Behavioral Health Person -centered care for people who engage with HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services must recogn ize and address critical challenges that cause barriers to success, as well as key facilitators. Behavioral health issues, including mental illness and addiction, are recognized to negatively impact treatment success. Also, the ability of service providers to provide psychosocial support to help persons in their care manage stressors and address social, emotional, spiritual, and environmental wellbeing can be vital for successful prevention, testing, and treatment . See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.5 for additional information. Teams should prioritize behavioral health interventions when they demonstrate a substantial impact on overall program success, and support interventions that are evidence -based. While psychosocial support interventions are commonly integrated into the work of PEPFAR supported staff, specialized mental health or addiction services are not. Integration with national plans and programs is important, and where possible, collaboration and co ordination with behavioral health programs and services supported by other funders is encouraged. 3.1.3.7 Health Security --Leveraging PEPFAR to Address COVID -19 and Other Health Threats PEPFAR's 5 -Year Strategy includes Strategic Pillar 3: Public Health Systems and Security, with a focus on leveraging PEPFAR assets for health security. Health security requires strong health systems. Across 55 countrie s, through more than $1 billion in annual health systems strengthening assistance, PEPFAR supports networked programs at more than 70,000 facility and community health clinics linked to 3,000 laboratories, nearly 300,000 health care workers, expansive supp ly chains for health care commodities, infection prevention and control, and strong systems for health data collection and use.These capacities have been vital in advancing HIV gains and responding to COVID -19, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. OU te ams should increase support for partner countries to leverage and integrate existing public health systems to strengthen preparedness and response, through disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, lab testing, local epidemiology driven public health decision -making, and emergency response. As the COVID -19 pandemic and other outbreaks have made clear, COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 86 of 220 strengthening public health systems is essential for people living with HIV and for partner countries. Military health systems also play an import ant role in ensuring health security and should be strengthened as needed (e.g., laboratories, information systems, surveys, and surveillance). PEPFAR has also helped partner countries to adapt service delivery platforms for people living with HIV and o thers in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, such as by increasing the use of decentralized service delivery for diagnostics, treatment, and vaccin ation . PEPFAR should also strengthen health service delivery platforms in COP/ROP23, supporting partner govern ment capabilities in service delivery for HIV, other health conditions, and outbreak response. COP/ROP23 health security activities should leverage existing global health security efforts. IHRs provide a globally agreed -upon framework for the notificati on of and response to potential and actual Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC). SARS and other listed diseases must be reported to the WHO as a potential PHEIC . The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA 2024) supports implementation of the IHRs, to improve partner countries' capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. As stated in the GHSA 2020 Annual Repor t, \"more than 70 countries as well as international organizations, non -governmental organizations (NGOs) , and private sector entities are united in a common goal of measurably strengthening global health security --with t he target of strengthening country capacities by 2024 for 100 countries in at least 5 specific technical areas.\" OU teams should provide support for partner governments' public health and service delivery platforms in line with GHSA 2024 targets for imp roved global health security. See Section 3.1.3.1 on Regional and National Public Health Institutions for helpful links (e.g., partner -country SPAR reporting for IHRs, JEE reports measuring partner countries' health security capabilities, and National Action Plans for H ealth Security developed by partner countries). 3.1.4 Pillar 4: Transformative Partnerships The successful implementation of PEPFAR programs relies on many actors. Multilateral organizations play a significant role in the scalability and sustainability of HIV programs. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 87 of 220 Partnerships with the private sector and academic institutions are equally as important in ensuring PEPFAR's success. Collaboration with partners who share the same vision as PEPFAR enable us to amplify broader health and development outcomes for the populations that PEPFAR serves. An important measure of PEPFAR's success continues to be building partnerships with a diverse set of private sector stakeholders, including private for -profit institutions, social enterprises, foundations, and private sector health delivery systems. Transformational partnerships are 1 of PEPFAR 's 5 strategic pillars. By working with multilateral organizations and private sector entities, PEPFAR can create connections with complementary programs. These partnerships help align strategies, programs, and operations amongst entities by working together to pool procurement /fund shared goals . This can reduce costs by a voiding duplication of efforts and can help countries shape their markets for new innovations while improving the coordination of health systems and security investments. Regional manufacturing, digital health, health workforce, person -centered care and priority populations are areas we are actively seeking to expand. Combining efforts to address priority areas enables PEPFAR to strategically place itself on the path to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030. Private sect or engagement (PSE) strategies, PPPs , and academic partnerships all engage expertise, core competencies, skill sets , and/or encourage coordination of resource investments (in-kind, cash, or other) to help to achieve global targets . PPP and PSE at the count ry level extends to service delivery contracts and access to preventive products/commodities through private sector partners such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. In many cases , these outlets may be more accessible to individuals needing information, commodities, and referral for care. OU teams should engage with private sector partners and potential stakeholders (in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations) early and often to identify opportunities for innovation and potential solutions to programmatic needs, interests, and challenges. PEPFAR defines formal PPPs as collaborative endeavors that coordinate technical expertise and contributions from the public sector with specialized skill sets and contributions from the private sector (financial or in -kind) to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthen health s ystems. It is essential to align PPPs with programmatic goals, challenges, or gaps and work collaboratively with other technical areas to accelerate outcomes and results. PPPs can be used to advance PEPFAR's goals and programmatic approaches in a COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 88 of 220 more effi cient and effective way. Partnerships can also be used to bridge the gap between innovation and scale. In this model of partnership, a partner invests in a proof of concept to create a new evidence base, while PEPFAR supports the transition from innovation to sustainable, scaled implementation. PSE and PPPs also help PEPFAR programs and services adapt a people -centric approach. As the needs of beneficiaries evolve, so should programming. Using private sector expertise such as behavioral science, user -cente red design, or market segmentation, PPPs can help drive programming in a way that maximizes impact for global targets . For example, in DREAMS and MenStar, user -centered design work implemented by the private sector provided insights into how country progra mming can be adopted to be more people -centric and effective in reaching targets. This same methodology holds true for Faith and Communities Initiatives. When a potential PPP includes the State Department, S/GAC must be consulted to ensure appropriate St ate Department approval . For further information on U.S. Department of State approval policies regarding PPPs, see 2 FAM 970.64 . USG implementing agencies should also consult internally to ensure their policies and procedures on PPPs and PSE are being foll owed. Partnerships should be in line with national policies and regulations set by country governments. Accountability for PEPFAR's participation in PPPs is essential and integrated within the routinized processes for reporting of results for PEPFAR prog rams. Entering a non -binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a critical tool in which all partners are expected to outline expected roles and procedures for addressing ongoing PPP activities throughout the life cycle of the partnership. When an MOU in volves the U.S. State Department (in addition to, or instead of, another USG implementing agency), then S/GAC and other State Department offices have additional oversight responsibilities for the PPP. Therefore, S/GAC must be consulted on all such proposed PPPs (including any proposed MOUs) to ensure appropriate State Department approval . USG implementing agencies also should consult internally to ensure their policies and procedures are being followed. The PPP toolkit provides USG OU teams additional detail to help with PSE and PPP development during the COP. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 89 of 220 3.1.4.1 Multilateral Organizations No single government or entity can address the HIV /AIDS epidemic alone. Success relies on building meaningful partnerships with both private and multilateral organizations to include community and FBOs . Scalability and sustainability of programs is more likely to be achieved with support of and collaboration w ith partners who share the same vision as PEPFAR: Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat . Aligning national priorities and achieving efficiencies in programmatic work remains a PEPFAR priority. We will continue to partner with organizations who share a common vision to PEPFAR: That the health of all people is instrumental to our overall global health security, to overcoming health inequities and for building resilient healthy systems around the world. Multilateral partners, including the Gl obal Fund, UNAIDS, WHO, UNICEF , and the World Bank, play a critical role in supporting our mutual goal of ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat . Often, they have core competencies that differ from PEPFAR and other donors and can play a significant role in influencing partner government policy and program decisions, addressing implementation challenges, and coordinating and aligning efforts across partners. OU teams must proactively engage multilateral stakeholders from the earliest phase of COP plann ing. The U.S. Government contributes up to a third of all Global Fund dollars . PEPFAR teams should support partner governments to ensure PEPFAR, partner -country , and Global Fund resources strategically align to maximize impact. In September 2022, the Global Fund held its seventh Replenishment conference, receiving $14.25 billion of its $18 billion goal covering the 2023 -2025 period, which aligns with implementat ion in 2024 -2026. This new cycle coincides with the COP23 planning cycle. The overlap in COP23 and Global Fund planning provides an opportunity for countries to consider all resources at one time and plan holistically using shared epidemiologic data, progr am results, outlays, and planning levels. Portfolio optimization \u2014the process by which more Global Fund monies can be added by the Global Fund to an existing Global Fund grant that has an intervention registered in the Unmet Quality Demand register \u2014 offers a n opportunity to recipient countries to access additional Global Fund resources to further support the national response. UNAIDS is another critical partner of PEPFAR. PEPFAR OU teams along with UNAIDS and its 11 UN agency co -sponsors must collaborate early and throughout the COP process to solicit each other's input and support. UNAIDS, including its Secretariat at the global and country COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 90 of 220 levels and co -sponsoring agencies, is an effective partner in working with countries to advance the shared goal of a chieving global targets , reaching 95 -95-95 by 2025 . The Global AIDS Strategy 2021 -2026 developed by UNAIDS is focused on the intersecting inequalities that continue to drive the epidemic and provides a framework to get the response back on track to reach its goals by 2025. UNAIDS and its 11 UN agency co -sponsors are instrumental in buil ding support for global data, PEPFAR's approaches and its alignment and harmonization with programs supported by partner -country governments, the Global Fund, and others. In countries where no Country Coordinating Mechanism ( CCM ) or National AIDS Comm issions (NAC) exist, OUs should engage with existing UN joint working groups (in particular UNAIDS Joint Working Groups) that includes government representatives, civil society, and embassy focal points in order to improve the national HIV/AIDS response. Multilateral stakeholders must be invited to participate throughout the in -country COP preparation process, including the COP2 3 Meetings . PEPFAR teams must work with multilateral organizations to identify in -country representatives to participate in the COP2 3 Meeting s. PEPFAR OU teams must also engage multilateral partners at other stages in the PEPFAR operating model, including before and after quarterly program reviews , during site visits, and when external technical assistance visits occur, as a re appropriate for country context given the overlay of the COVID -19 pandemic constraints. Transformational partnerships are 1 of PEPFAR's 5 strategic pillars. By working with multilateral organizations, PEPFAR can create connections with complementary pr ograms to amplify broader health and development outcomes. These partnerships align strategies, programs , and operations amongst all entities by working together to pool procurement to reduce costs and shape the market for new innovations while improving the coordination of health systems and security investments. Regional manufacturing, digital health, health workforce, person -centered care, and priority populations are areas we are actively seeking to expand. Combining efforts on priority areas enables PEPFAR to strategically place itself on the path to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030. 3.1.4.2 Partner -Country Governments PEPFAR is committed to strengthening its partnership with country governments to ensure alignment between PEPFAR support and national priorities and investments. Collaborative COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 91 of 220 planning between PEPFAR and pa rtner-country governments is critical to ensuring that prioritized interventions are scaled, geographic priorities are shared, and that all available resources for HIV/AIDS in the country are optimally utilized. Every year, OU teams \u2014in close collabor ation with partner countries and multilateral organizations, including the Global Fund \u2014 will continue to ensure that HIV dollars strategically align to address gaps and solutions for impact while maximizing transparency, efficiency, QA, and accountability o f resources. OU teams must regularly consult and communicate with all levels of the MOH , the national AIDS control authority (or its equivalent), the ministry of finance, other relevant ministries (e.g., defense, education), and government leaders (e.g., office of the president and/or prime minister) . This engagement is critical in ensuring PEPFAR's role in the national response is clearly understood. Shifting leadership of the HIV response to local stakeholders is an essential theme of the PEPFAR Core Standards and the UNAIDS 2021 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS. Increasing the domestic financial responsibility to sustain HIV impact takes time to achieve. Howeve r, some of these obligations can be met through the co -financing requirements under Global Fund grants, which need strong transparent and accountability measures. Outside of the co-financing requirements, teams can also contribute to achieving the relevant Core Standards by providing evidence -based advocacy and communication on increasing domestic expenditures in the HIV response with various country government entities. This will e nhance political will and increase government financial commitment to HIV where and when possible. Partner -country governments may also serve as key PEPFAR IPs through government -to- government (G2G) agreements. This direct funding of the partner -count ry government can provide opportunities to improve the coordination of PEPFAR programs with the national response, it can also strengthen technical, management, and financial systems in the long term for sustained epidemic control. USAID's G2G Risk Management and Implementation Guide provides a good starting point when identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and threats that teams should consult. Agencies should also consult other relevant agency guidance. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 92 of 220 3.1.5 Pillar 5: Follow the Science PEPFAR remains committed to evidence -based and data -driven programming. An advanced, applied epidemiologic approach, behavioral science and IS, surveys, and surveillance activities align across several of PEPFAR's Strategic Pillars. Pillar 5 , \"follow the s cience ,\" aims to invest in cutting -edge behavioral science and IS to bend the curve on new infections. Building disease surveillance systems that form a foundation for local health systems and security (Pillar 3) is particularly important to sustaining the response (Pillar 2). PEPFAR funds these activities to underst and and address countries' epidemics, translate efficacious interventions tested in controlled environments to real -world contexts where resources are more limited, complement routine program data, and provide the evidence basis for decision -making and pub lic health action. To further support a national HIV response, OU teams should align PEPFAR -supported s urvey/surveillance/research/evaluation ( SRE) activities with the partner -country's national HIV survey -surveillance, research, and evaluation strat egic plan(s). Ideally national SRE related strategic plans would be developed by a technical working group, led by the MOH, in partnership with IPs and key stakeholders such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund country coordinating mechanism. PEPFAR teams are enc ouraged to promote regular meetings among partner -country SRE counterparts to collaborate in implementing the national plan and update the plan as new priorities and developments emerge. In countries where a national plan does not already exist, PEPFAR teams should work to facilitate development of a strategic plan with host government counterparts. In some cases, a plan might be a module within a larger national HIV control strategy or framework. Though PEPFAR has a powerful legacy of using science to advance programs and reduce disease and its related burden worldwide, mainstreaming behavioral and social science into HIV programming will be challenging. COP23 restates the necessity to use science and evidence to modernize and transform the HIV landsca pe and to support reaching and maintaining 95 -95-95 and bend the curve on new infections. The following sections will help OUs to define and identify activities that complement routine monitoring and to provide information on gaps and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 93 of 220 other qualitative mea sures that will help to improve programming access and efficiency and strengthen health outcomes. 3.1.5.1 Behavioral and Social Science and Implementation Science WHO describes behavioral science as the investigation of \" cognitive, social, and environmental drivers and barriers that influence health -related behaviors.\" PEPFAR seeks to accelerate progress toward achieving or exceeding countries' 95 -95-95 targets and stemming new HIV infections for all ages, genders, and pop ulation groups by promoting a comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment strategy that simultaneously addresses the biological, behavioral, social, and structural determinants of the global AIDS pandemic. In doing so, PEPFAR will support the integration of innovative, evidence -based, and cost -effective behavioral and social science (BSS) interventions to improve and sustain changes in behaviors, norms, and the enabling environment of the HIV response particularly for priority populations. BSS is fundamenta l to good public health practice, especially when access to HIV care and prevention services is not distributed equally among social groups and misinformation and stigma abound. BSS can include social and behavior change communication (SBCC) ; marketing ; advocacy ; behavioral economics ; or human -centered design, pr evention , and treatment literacy. By m ainstreaming BSS in HIV programming, PEPFAR can better understand and address how certain behaviors and social inequalities concretely affect HIV outcomes. Inequalities are not simply ideas and beliefs that manifest in humans' behavior to ward each other ; they are structured and institutionalized in ways that make them core determinants of HIV. While PEPFAR has previously supported a host of BSS interventions a cross its partner countries, innovative and scalable efforts are needed to support health equity, close gaps, sustain the gains, and end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Working to intentionally identify and scale -up innovative, evidence -backe d interventions in behavioral and social science, especially those aimed at persistent challenges in the program, such as risk perception, treatment and prevention adherence, or stigma reduction to encourage care-seeking behavior, has the potential to be transformational and is a PEPFAR priority . These efforts often benefit from incorporating capabilities that are more often utilized in the private sector --such as marketing, consumer insights, human centered design, and behavioral economics. Work in this ar ea should also explore the use of social protection and economic COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 94 of 220 interventions for closing the gaps for highly vulnerable populations. This will be especially critical for priority populations, as health systems may not always be designed to support their needs. Leveraging existing knowledge \u2014which may include surveys, qualitative work, and policy analysis \u2014is critical for developing a BSS approach. For example, KP-focused surveys \u2014such as integrated biological and behavioral surveillance surveys (IBBS s) (See Section 3.1.1.3 )\u2014 may include specific questions related to norms, behaviors, and societal impacts that are barriers to accessing quality services and may provide insights t hat may then be used to inform behavioral interventions. BSS can be a critical and highly impactful contributor to today's PEPFAR --where ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat is a reality or in reach for many countries. Like BSS, a fresh take on IS that can rapidly and rigorously address priority implementation questions, especially persistent gaps and \"last mile\" interventions is needed. Implementation science (IS) is the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence -based practices (including BSSs) into routine practice, and to improve the quality and effectiveness of health service and bring interventions to s cale, in part through the study of influences on health care professionals and organizational behavior. An ongoing issue for PEPFAR program implementation h as been the timely translation of high - impact and efficacious interventions to real -world contexts w here personnel, financial, and other resources are more constrained and variable. Rigorous implementation science can help to identify those delivery models and systems that are fitting for a country's HIV response. IS interacts with the following study approaches: (1) Operations research \u2014the scientific approach to decision -making about how to design, operate, and improve programs and systems, usually under conditions requiring the allocation of scarce or finite reso urces ; (2) Impact evaluations --the scientific approach to measuring the change in a development outcome that is attributable to a defined intervention, while controlling for external factors through rigorously defined counterfactuals ; and (3) Mathematica l modeling --the scientific application of mathematical and statistical models to generate size estimates, cost estimates, and demand generation predictions to inform programmatic design and decision -making. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 95 of 220 OUs should work directly with country government partners from inception to completion, from design to operation, and in line with potential policy needs, to identify and execute scalable and high-impact BSS and IS efforts. As part of a co -developed vision, OUs are encouraged to engage with country, global, nongovernmental, and academic partners and , most importantly, communities to guide approach es and investments that will improve programming and support country priorities. Activities proposed should embed community voices at all levels and actively center community leaders and organizations from populations benefitting from the intervention while empowering the next generation of community leaders . PEPFAR will primarily support the following specific types of BSS and IS activities in COP/ROP23. All PEPFAR -supported science should be targeted to advance knowledge and reach new conclusions in a timely and scalable context. These activities should b e proposed in the SRE Tool. More information on the tool can be found in Section 8.3 . Identify and a ddress existing gaps in programming and provide the evidence and rationale to determine these gaps. Identify solutions to challenges that limit program quality, efficiency, and effectiveness, or to determine which alternative service delivery approach es and strategies would yield the best outcomes, especially to scale -up cutting -edge innovations that support reaching and maintaining 95 -95-95, bend the curve on new HIV infections and reduce HIV -related mortality. Prioritize investments that address existing programmatic gaps and to provide the evidence and rationale to determine these gaps. Investigate activities that reduce the time for program adoptions, reduce cost for program implementations, and allow for some risk -taking for new approaches to cultivate a culture that provides an enabling environment for partners. Address the real -world performance of BSS evidence -based interventions in new geographic settings. Address key forward -looking impleme ntation questions such as best methods to manage the aging population of people living with HIV and related comorbidity management with other diseases. 3.1.5.2 Applied Epidemiology and Surveillance A key part of Strategic Pillar 5 is to develop and advanc e an applied epidemiology and surveillance approach to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat and strengthen health systems COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 96 of 220 and enable holistic public health surveillance and detection approaches. This will involve sharpening and supporting a range of HIV surveillance approaches including case surveillance, recent infection surveillance, ARV drug resistance, viral load, and mortality monitoring --in conjunction with other public health surveillance and detection approaches to monitor the impact of HIV and ot her public health programs, and to identify program gaps, new cases, clusters, and outbreaks. These approaches should be integrated with HTS (See Section 3.1.1.6 ), while also safeguarding human rights and protecting vulnerable populations. As countries approach and attain the 95 -95-95 goals, it is important to adapt from a program focused on rapid scaling of ART coverage to a program that consistently and effectivel y supports continuity of treatment and person -centered services for all people living with HIV as well as the prevention of new HIV infections. This will require a public health approach to identify and specifically support populations not yet experiencing equitable epidemic control, populations experiencing treatment interruptions, or populations where new transmission is occurring by utilizing public health systems aligned with national or sub -national public health entities for case surveillance and recent infection surveillance. Working with stakeholders and partners, OU teams need to support partner -country governments to build and support a coherent public health response to HIV, based on strong systems and partnerships in a united national effort that is also flexible and resilient enough to address additional, unexpected health threats. The MOH, NPHIs, an d sub -national public health entities should lead the assessment, policy development, assurance, and implementation ( See, Section 3.2.3.1 ), with PEPFAR support. Yet a larger public health system should include other parts of government, community organizations, civil society, public and private clinical providers, and a variety of other actors to lead, shape, and support public health efforts in a multi -sector, multifaceted, sustain ed effort under MOH and NPHI leadership. PEPFAR should work to ensure that these efforts include key populations and that stigma and discrimination do not exclude any people living with HIV or those at risk of HIV from this applied , epidemiological approach. Within PEPFAR's context, population surveys differ from surveillance only in that they are performed at 1 time point , whereas surveillance involves ongoing monitoring over time. Results from PEPFAR -funded survey and surveillanc e activities inform programmatic planning to ensure resources are allocated to populations with the greatest burden. Surveillance and survey work and plans should include leveraging existing FETP s as well as NPHI, which will help ensure that PEPFAR's actio ns are supporting enduring public health systems and capabilities to serve both COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 97 of 220 PEPFAR's mission, as well as develop resilient public health assets for a long -term public health response to HIV, which can also be adapted for responses to other public healt h threats and emergencies. Investing in a sustainable public health response requires interoperable health systems focused on case surveillance and client -centered approaches. While there has been great progress in this effort, PEPFAR needs to ensure that its digital investments are used to build flexible, agile systems with interoperable data to improve data use ; reduce data entry burden ; and ensure all stakeholders that all clients are receiving quality, client -focused services that reduce treatment inter ruptions, progress toward global targets , and can be leveraged or expanded to combat other diseases. These critical systems enable public health officials to identify program gaps, new cases, clusters , and outbreaks ( See Section 3.2.3 ). Survey and surveillance strategic plans are key to creating an enabling environment for applied public health response, by creating a deliberate long -term plan to regularly update the understanding of HIV /AIDS , as well as other epidemics. Thus, OU teams should support partner countries to develop survey and surveillance strategic plans or similar component of National HIV plans ( See Section 8.3 and FY24 Technical Consideration s Section 6.8), which are informed by the needs of as well as leveraged by an applied public health approach. The who, what, why, where, and when should be informed by recent infection surveillance, populations where new infections are high, and other programmatic gaps. Public health responses to outbreaks and clusters should use recent survey and surveillance results to inform targeted activitie s. Recent public health investigations, alerts, and concerns should inform survey and surveillance strategic plans. Aligned with HIV prevention, testing, care, and treatment efforts, PEPFAR OUs should support partner governments to build and develop capac ity to conduct public health surveillance for new infections, investigate and target case finding, prevention, and treatment resources for outbreaks of recent infections, and to track individual treatment outcomes. Thus, PEPFAR supports the efforts of partner -country MOHs to develop national protocols for nimble responses to new infections, in partnership with national and sub -national public health officials, community, and civil society. Recent infection surveillance ( See Section 8.3 ) should be incorporated and triangulated with case surveillance, recent survey data, and other program data to inform detection of new infections. Based on the PEPFAR Scientific Advisory Board 's recommendations on recency infection surveillance, for COP23 PEPFAR is issuing detailed COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 98 of 220 guidance to countries on how to take a measured and focused approach to the implementation of recency surveillance ( See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.8. 4 and 6.6.8.5 ), to produce recency surveillance data of the highest quality. PEPFAR is also dedicating time and resources to address knowledge gaps in the recency space and clearly demonstrate how high - quality recency data is being used to inform effective public health responses and bring countries closer to reaching 95 -95-95. MOH s are encouraged to develop and advance , with PEPFAR support, their capacity to respond in real time to emerging needs arising from new infections . This capacity can later be leveraged for other disease responses . Public health investigation should use safe and ethical index testing and other testing strategies, including targeted community outreach and testing, and social network strategies. Facilitating routine monitoring of inputs for signals embedded within the metrics can create an early warning system to promote awareness and responsive actions. Responding to signals can involve data verification, and in the case of a potential cluster or outbreak, would involve levera ge safe and ethical index testing, as well as other testing and outreach, in concert with community consultation and mobilization. Public health investigations should develop and maintain status -neutral protocols, which link people living with HIV to tr eatment and those at risk of HIV in these same clusters to prevention services \u2014 particularly , PrEP. Establishing such applied , epidemiological approaches will be critical to sustaining HIV program impact and reaching hard -to-reach populations. 3.2 PEPFAR's 3 Strategic Enablers 3.2.1 Enabler 1: Community Leadership The full participation of community stakeholders and civil society in every stage of PEPFAR \u2014 planning, development, implementation, and monitoring \u2014is critical to the success and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 99 of 220 sustainability of PEPFAR's efforts and the global HIV response.63 Civil society has been a leading force in the response to HIV since the beginning of the epidemic, providing expertise and relationships with local communities that non -indigenous organizations often struggle to achieve. Civil society provides an understanding of the p olitical and cultural environment, and should inform the development of service delivery models, and actively participate in planning, delivering, and monitoring such services. CSOs provide services crucial to realizing impact on the epidemic: advocating o n behalf of beneficiary populations; holding governments accountable; promoting human rights to combat stigma and discrimination against key populations, people living with HIV, and other vulnerable groups; advancing inclusion for people with disabilities; identifying challenges to, and gaps in, health care delivery; supporting data collection and innovation; providing independent views of programming and processes; and promoting transparency. In alignment wit h The Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV (GIPA) and PEPFAR's focus on equity, efforts to strengthen community leadership in PEPFAR should center on people living with HIV as well as those most vulnerable to inequitable HIV outcomes, including adolescent girls and young women, children, and key populations. Civil society organizations include: traditional health practitioners, c ommunity elders, and leaders; local and international NGOs ; faith -based groups; religious leaders living with HIV groups; professional associations; organizations representing people living with HIV; activist and advocacy groups, including those representi ng key and priority populations; human rights groups; women's rights groups; men's health groups; youth organizations; religious leaders living with HIV groups ; access to justice and rule of law groups; groups representing other populations highly affected by the epidemic, such as people with disabilities, women, and girls; PEPFAR program beneficiaries or end users; community associations; champions of data -driven decision -making; and not -for-profit organizations at national, district, and local levels (e.g ., Rotary, Lions Clubs, and other global and local groups). 63 UNAIDS & Stop AIDS Alliance.

These facilitated discussions should occur during community and partner engagement meetings on at least an annual basis , beginning FY23 and for COP23 . PEPFAR unequivocally opposes so -called conversion therapy, which is not evidence -based, has been discredited, and is not aligned with PEPFAR's vision of person - centered, non -discriminatory services that promote equity and reduce inequality. Annual communit y engagement meetings are just one opportunity to reaffirm PEPFAR's position on so - called conversion therapy with stakeholders and increase awareness and sensitization around these abusive practices. 3.2.1.1 Community Leadership in Planning and Developmen t Table 1 outlines actions and milestones for stakeholder participation in COP/ROP23. As in years past, the participation of civil society organizations in the PEPFAR COP/ROP planning process is required, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and reg ulations. Community leadership is essential to PEPFAR planning, and it encourages partner governments to promote civil society engagement and participation. Meaningful engagement with PEPFAR will help local CSOs meet this challenge, better preparing them to play a leadership role with partner -country governments. OUs are expected to support civil society and community participation throughout the COP/ROP planning process as follows: 1. Follow GIPA principles and center equity: The community stakeholders and CSOs engaged in the COP/ROP process must reflect the HIV disease burden of the country and the full range of populations aff ected by HIV in the country, including people living with HIV, key and priority populations, and other vulnerable populations including youth, women, young girls, gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender persons, prisoners and other people in enclosed settings, and people who inject drugs. 64 The White House.

Include a diverse range of CSOs in consultations, considering that this process requires proactive outreach to ensure all affected populations are represented. 3. Include organizations from outs ide the capital and urban areas to ensure a range of interests are represented. 4. Engage with and leverage the leadership of FBOs and communities as these are key opinion leaders who can create effective partnerships with affected groups .65 5.

Community -led organizations will deliver 30% of testing and treatment services. 2. Community -, KP- and women -led organizations will deliver 80% of HIV prevention program services for key populations and women. 3. Community -led organizations will deliver 60% of the programs supporting achievements of societal enablers. Peer - and community -led approaches are linked to a range of beneficial outcomes in HIV response, well -positioned to support person -centered HIV servi ces, and mitigate the profound inequities, stigma, and discrimination that impede achievement of our goals.67 In support of the Global AIDS Strategy and in tandem with PEPFAR's local partner goals (see Section 3.1.2.3 ) and strategy, OUs should: Continue to promote organizations that effectively and sustainably reflect the communities that they serve, including those led by people living with HIV, key populations, women, and yo uth. Support capacity -building, mentorship, and financial sustainability efforts of community - led organizations, identifying specific, measurable, and timebound benchmarks 66 Progress Report of the Multistakeholder Task Team on Community -Led AIDS Responses https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media _asset/Report_Task_Team_Community_led_AIDS_Re sponses_EN.pdf 67 Ayala G, Sprague L, van der Merwe LLA, et al.

Utilize the PEPFAR small grants program to address structural barriers to HIV services (e.g., stigma, discrimination , violence, poverty, educational attainment), democracy and governance (as related to the national HIV response), HIV preventi on, care and support, or capacity building. Illustrative examples of community -led responses include: Zvandiri: a peer -counseling approach to support adolescent HIV care and support in Zimbabwe.68 KPLHS: a model established in Thailand in which health ser vices are delivered by lay, KP peers.69 Patient Education and Empowerment Project : a nationwide health and human rights literacy education program in Nigeria that operates in collaboration with national partners, PEPFAR, and UNAIDS. Faith and Traditional Community Leadership: PEPFAR recognizes the important partnerships and contributions of faith organizations and traditional leaders to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. Considerations for harnessing faith and traditional community leadership e fforts in the HIV response include: Recognizing the role and influence of communities, including faith -based and traditional communities and FBOs . Considering implementation of 1 or more replicable and data -driven faith -engaged programs ( See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.4 ). Support for faith and traditional community steering committee s (SC) to promote dialogue and help disseminate fact -based messages about HIV prevention, testing, and treatment should continue. A noteworthy SC strengt h is rapid and extensive national -to- local community mobilization as key PEPFAR partners, to disseminate information for HIV and other health security issues. 68 https://www.pepfarsolutions.org/adolescents/2018/1/13/zvandiri -peer-counseling -to-improve - adolescent -hiv-care-and-support?rq=zvandiri 69 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282496/ COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 107 of 220 Engaging in south -to-south learning , such as PEPFAR's South -to-South Faith Community and FBO webinar platform, New Foundations of Hope , to build skills in preventing and controlling HIV , ending stigma, tackling pandemics, and addressing co - morbidities and mental health. Faith Community and FBO partners are welcome in these webinars (See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.4 ). https://www.faithandcommunityinitiative.org/_files/ugd/38bdff_e265f1f60fd84391845d08 efbd36c486.pd f Health Systems and Health Security : PEPFAR's South -to-South Faith Community and FBO webinar platform, New Foundations of Hope , extends health system e ngagement and protects health security by holistically building skills in HIV prevention and control, ending stigma, tackling pandemics, and addressing co -morbidities and mental health. Faith Community and FBO partners should prioritize participation in th ese webinars (See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.4 ). 3.2.1.3 Community Leadership in Monitoring CLM remains a PEPFAR requirement, and a component of PEPFAR's strategy . PEPFAR requires all OUs to fund the development and implementation of CLM activities. CLM is a process initiated, led, and implemented by local , community -based organizations and other civil society groups ; networks of key populations ; people living with HIV ; and other affected groups or community entities. These entities gather quantitative and qualitative data about HIV services and dev elop and advocate for solutions to the gaps identified during data collection, in collaboration with service providers and health care leadership. Using quantitative and qualitative indicators, CLM initiatives monitor a wide range of issues associated with accessible, available, equitable, effective, and high -quality HIV service delivery. CLM obtains input from a variety of respondents , including recipients of HIV services (including key populations and underserved groups), as well as clinic management and health care providers. CLM implementers obtain this input in a routine and systematic manner that will translate into action and change, building trusting and sustainable relationships with health care leadership and other stakeholders. CLM is central to P EPFAR's person -centered approach because it puts communities, their needs, and their voices at the center of the HIV response. The process map depicted in Figure 15 illustrates the 6 steps that a CLM process should consider throughout the design and imple mentation phases. Each step should be allocated the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 108 of 220 time and resources necessary for their completion or routinization. Figure 15 CLM Process Map . The list below describes what CLM is not and distinguishes CLM from other methods of obtaining client feedback or input, and is partially inspired by a presentation from the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition:70 CLM : Is not simply adding some c ommunity - or client -focused indicators to already established government monitoring systems. This approach does not permit community leadership in design and implementation. Is not the same as patient satisfaction surveys. Patient satisfaction surveys may be very useful to improve the quality of services and the client's experience of care, and there may be some overlap with CLM, but they are distinct from CLM. Patient satisfaction surveys are usually driven by health care providers, tend to focus on the effectiveness of services, and may not focus on the elements prioritized by communities. 70 Community -Led Monitoring Brief. https://itpcglobal.org/wp -content/uploads/2020/02/Community -Led- Monitoring -Brief_full.pdf. 2022. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 109 of 220 Is not a survey or study conducted to understand what communities experience. This type of assessment may be useful, but it is not community -led, nor is it routinized to drive change and ensure accountability. Core Principles and Considerations for PEPFAR CLM Design: The collective objective of CLM is to develop a shared understanding of the enablers and barriers to quality HIV services in a manner that is community -driven and collaborative, productive, respectful, and solutions -oriented. CLM should be developed and i mplemented in collaborative spirit with appropriate service sites and should not be organized as a supervisory and/or punitive mechanism to blame or conduct a finger -pointing exercise on issues and responsible parties. CLM should advance equity and support improvement in programs, especially for populations that have experienced inequitabl e HIV outcomes such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and children . o Since COP22, OUs have been required to ensure their CLM activities include an explicit focus on k ey populations, where not already the case. This does not mean key populations are the only focus of CLM activities, but rather must be included. There can be multiple ways of meeting this requiremen t: Key populations should be engaged in all aspects of CL M project planning, implementation , and assessment. Importantly, direct funding should be considered for KP -led initiatives that wouldn't ordinarily access funding due to regressive national policies; KP -specific modules in monitoring tools should be an ar ea of focus . Importantly , inclusion of a focus on key populations in CLM should not be limited to KP -specific sites or programs (which CLM may wish to monitor as well). Rather, key populations mostly access health services through general population clinics, and these are frequen tly sites where KP issues are least well understood and key populations may experience the most discrimination and stigmatization when trying to access health care services. CLM should gather data on KP service delivery in these sites as a priority , while also gathering data from KP -specific sites. CLM must be conducted by independent and local civil society organizations. CLM should be led by community organizations, not government institutions or multilateral bodies. Of note, PEPFAR IPs (including thos e that may be civil society organizations themselves) currently working on service delivery at the site level generally do not meet this requirement for CLM; this includes IPs who subcontract/sub -grant to local civil COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 110 of 220 society organizations. This helps maint ain the objectivity and independence of CLM. OUs should consider the level of trust CSOs have among key communities and stakeholders when developing or refining CLM activities. However, in specific circumstances, a PEPFAR IP or sub-grantee that performs site-level service delivery may be included as a CLM partner if the organization meets the other requirements of a strong CLM partner, such as being led by a community or key population , and is not monitoring its own sites. Whenever possible , a coordinated structure at country level should implement CLM projects to facilitate sharing and coordination of monitoring, conveying findings, and shaping follow -on activities across multiple sites . PEPFAR OUs are encouraged to consider and select the funding mechanism most conducive to ensuring community leadership throughout each phase of the design, planning, implementation, and evaluation of the CLM activities. OUs should also consider partnership and award -management structures that meet the requir ement and principles of objectivity, independence, and maximizing direct funding to community organizations. OUs may propose funding for additional staff support to oversee this CLM portfolio if they did not do so in prior COPs. OUs should also consider an d support the capacity building needs of implementing CSOs in health service monitoring, data collection and analysis, and evidence -based advocacy. This should include leveraging support from other multilateral organizations or others also supporting CLM efforts in -country. The scope and scale of CLM should be determined by community members in each OU (in consultation with PEPFAR in -country staff) but should be based on need. For example, focusing on a geographic area, a li mited number of sites, or access to treatment services among men within a specific community, etc. CLM has emerged as a solution to challenges with ART continuity and preventing interruptions in treatment; at a minimum, PEPFAR CLM should focus on these asp ects of HIV service delivery, and communities may also prioritize other components of HIV services , such as the availability o f HIV prevention services and commodities. CLM is a routine, cyclical process. One -off assessments are not sufficient and must be routinized to ensure follow -up and continuous improvement. Core Principles and Considerations of CLM Metrics and Analysis: PEPFAR teams must ensure a process that allows for community leadership of the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 111 of 220 specific metrics, measures, or tools to be used for CLM, with consultation and input from partner -country governments and PEPFAR teams. Metrics or measures should be tailored to a given context and address the needs and concerns of community members. Monitoring data should be additive and not duplicate data already available to PEPFAR through MER. Additional monitoring data includes information from beneficiaries about their experience with the health facility or site ; about barriers and enablers to access and sustained engagement in services; related to quality of services; related to the quality of interactions between clients and health workers (including ensuring stigma -free and confidential service delivery); verification of the implementation of national level policies (e.g., elimination of user fee s) at the facility level, etc. CLM activities can utilize SIMS tools as desired or deemed useful, though there is no expectation to use them, or that data from CLM activities will be reported to S/GAC in DATIM. CLM mechanisms must be action oriented. It is n ot enough to simply collect patient reports or descriptions of experiences (i.e., client satisfaction surveys) , but there must be an associated follow -up process with relevant stakeholders as identified by the CLM program (typically , this includes the health facility, governm ent, PEPFAR, and other donors, where safe) and community advocacy to improve service outcomes. USG staff and IPs must participate in feedback meetings and commit to corrective public health action. At minimum, community organizations should present CLM res ults and findings to in - country PEPFAR teams on a routine (preferred quarterly) basis (through a presentation or report , followed by constructive discussion) in an environment that foster s the honest and genuine discussion of results, including negative ou tcomes. At a minimum, PEPFAR staff should share these findings with IPs on a quarterly basis. Community members may share findings directly with service delivery partners and partner governments, where safe. PEPFAR teams are responsible for ensuring necessary follow -up actions and oversight of IPs to strengthen the quality -of-service provision . It's important to share CLM results with the partner -country government. This sharing could be achieved in a direct manner through CLM (ideally and where safe) or from PEPFAR to the partner government . CLM results and community recommendations should be routinely shared by CSOs at the level of collection where safe (e.g., health facility and district) to al low for timely action at the local level by local leaders and IPs. Where issues are identified that require immediate action (such as human rights COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 112 of 220 violations or current ARV stock -outs), results should be shared immediately with the necessary stakeholders f or urgent remediation. PEPFAR teams should triangulate CLM findings with other PEPFAR data sources, including MER results and SIMS scores, and use these data to both foster site -level improvements, and as part of their partner management approach ( See Section 4 ). Other Key Principles and Considerations for CLM Implementation and Management: OU country teams should ensure coordination of CLM activities with other organizations enga ged in CLM (e.g., the Global Fund) to facilitate information sharing and ensure efficient use of resources. CLM in COP/ROP23 should ultimately build upon CLM activities carried out in previous COPs; and the same should be ensured for subsequent COPs. The intention should be to build a CLM program that is sustainable and contributes continually and tangibly to program improvement. CLM systems should establish and articulate the routinized process for collecting, analyzing, and sharing of CLM data at the country level among all stakeholders. As part of a commitment to transparency and accountability, CLM findings should be made as accessible as possible for use by all stakeholders while ensuring client safety and confidentiality. PEPFAR's data governance guidance on public release of site -level MER data is meant to prevent deductive disclosure of client identity, which is generally not an issue for CLM data. However, the PEPFAR data governance guidance may serve as a useful example framework for CLM as key components address general policy for data management, including access, roles and responsibilities, data security, and other considerations such as deductive disclosure risk mitigation. PEPFAR teams should ensure with community CLM implementers there is a clear governance structure to address these elements, for example, that there are clear processes governing public release of CLM findings . COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 113 of 220 3.2.2 Enabler 2: Innovation Innovation at PEPFAR --The Power to Reimagine and Transform Since its inception in 2003, PEPFAR has invested over $100 billion, primarily using traditional USG grant capital, which has translated into remarkable progress toward global targets , saving many millions of lives. However, as the program has helped our partner countries increase HIV impact, the task becomes much harder. Maintaining the treatment coverage while ( 1) finding and serving the most difficult to reach last mile (which may require extra i nvestments); ( 2) trimming increasingly difficult to find cost inefficiencies ; and ( 3) sustainably transitioning to government and community ownership, is a near -impossible task with a business -as-usual mindset. Reimagining PEPFAR to address these interco nnected challenges will require bold innovation and partnership agenda at all levels of the program as recognized in the 5x3 strategic priorities. Innovation is a longstanding foundational bedrock of PEPFAR's achievements -- including highly impactful adapti ve practices and solutions implemented at the country as well as community levels. Catalyzing innovation requires the continuous strengthening of systematic and coordinated approaches to widely identify, cultivate, implement, scale, or sustain locally driven innovations. Defining Innovation within PEPFAR Innovation can manifest itself in many ways within PEPFAR programs: Adoption of a new technology that transforms how health care is provided Incorporation of a new partner management or performance incentive model that dramatically improves the efficiency of services delivered Introduction of a new national, sub -national, or community -level enabling policy that permits both public and private providers to access and distribute essential medicines and evidence -based prevention programming Formation of a new partnership with an organization that has complementary capabilities to the PEPFAR program and enables a different way of working to advance strategic priorities COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 114 of 220 OU teams must determine the types of innovation they need \u2014incremental or breakthrough --to reimagine and transform their impact. Incremental: Opportunities that are tweaks (small changes) and are low -risk, yet high - impact . Incremental opportunities have v alue that is easily measurable because the impact variables are well known . Breakthrough: Opportunities that are new to the OU or the community and push beyond existing program design and/or policy boundaries, producing significant growth and impact aligne d with the 5x3 strategy . The variables measuring success are new and therefore may be more difficult to quantify . 3.2.3 Enabler 3: Leading with Data Data highlight the who, when, and where of the program -, provider -, and patient -level interventions needed to equitably deliver HIV services. Leading with data emphasizes the importance of analyzing and using data to inform all aspects of public health responses. T he COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated that public health data , when appropriately shared , can facilitate multi -sector partnerships that strengthen the response . As such, data infrastructures (which include data systems as well as the associated workforce ) are strategic global health security investments. The many available data source s can be grouped into 2 broad categories: ( 1) data needed to plan and monitor PEPFAR programs ; and ( 2) data needed to inform partner -country responses to HIV and other public health concerns , including patient and beneficiary care. Data, such as MER indicator results and SIMS assessments ( See Section 3.1.3.3 ), monitor PEPFAR programming and should be byproducts of data so urced from service delivery and of efforts to advance the capacity of national health information systems (HIS ). Periodic population data collections ( See Section 3.1.5) conducted in partnership with country ministries, augment programmatic data. These col lections actively monitor person, program, and population inputs, outputs, and outcomes, as well as impacts of HIV programming . These data can also provide insights to help PEPFAR programs reach people living with HIV and others participating in behaviors that put them at risk for HIV infection. Data also inform the partnerships PEPFAR COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 115 of 220 should pursue to optimize its investments t o ensure maximum benefit regarding lives saved and prepar edness for future public health challenges. HIS and data management inve stments are essential to sustain the HIV response . These investments advanc e country -level data systems and expand their capacity to manage, analyze , and use data to facilitate appropriate patient management, inform public health response, and guide progra mmatic decisions for HIV and other public health concerns . They also help us monitor PEPFAR investment impacts . As partner -country governments assume more oversight of and responsibility for the HIV response, the data acquisition and management process will also necessarily shift. For example, district or national health surveillance/M&E officers might assume responsibility for weekl y generating reports identifying patients who have interrupted HIV treatment, especially where individual level data is deduplicated across site s. Once shared, district and national health officers could then use this information to reconnect the patients to HIV care . For many years, PEPFAR information systems investments have focused on digitizing patient and other beneficiary data at the service delivery level. Data from these service -level systems are aggregated and analyzed to meet partner -government, PEPFAR, and other donor reporting requirements; they are also used to evaluate, monitor, and improve HIV programming. However, the varying demands for program reporting across stakeholders ha ve introduced separate parallel data collection and r eporting processes that can produce different results due to competing M&E data flows. Further more, data aggregation for reporting at the point of service delivery can mask progress and performance . For example, silent transfers --depending on their treatme nt schedule --may be double counted across multiple sites and thereby artificially inflate treatment interruption counts. Also, KP individuals often self-identify into multiple subcategories (sex worker, transgender, people who use drugs, men who have sex w ith men , and people in closed settings) that hide true counts . Recognizing these limitations, in July 2022, the WHO released guidance for person -centric HIV strategic information, emphasizing the need for granular, longitudinal data integrated across COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 116 of 220 data sources.71 This approach enables stakeholders to integrate clinical, community health, vital statistics, social welfare, wellness, and prevention data to better understand the totality of care and support provided to target populations such as adolescent girls and young women, orphans and vulnerable children, key populations , and other demographic group s. It provides greater insight into the impact on the lives of individuals, allowing a more direct link between investments and those benefiting and inequit ies that must be overcome. It's essential that all process es related to data respect the dignity and diversity of all people. There must also be strict information security controls on individual level data to protect privacy and ensure no harm. For COP23 and beyond, PEPFAR plans to increase reliance on partner -country health informa tion ecosystem s. This will require unify ing existing PEPFAR digital health portfolio investments with broader sector -wide partner government health information systems ( See Section 3.1.3.7 ). This process will need to advance robust national integrated, longitudinal, person -level data repositories to supply the accurate and precise public health data needed to inform a sustainable HIV response and to address future health threats. Partnerships and collaboration across PEPFAR and other disease programs are needed to ac complish this . For example, the PE PFAR Malawi team is working closely with Malawi Ministry of Health colleagues to institute such a national data repository. Both groups are collaborating with the Malawi National Registration Bureau and other donors supporting vital statistics to integrate mortality data into the national data repository . Furthermore, the PEPFAR team in Malawi and the Malawi Ministry of Health use data from the national electronic medical record ( EMR ) for reporting -- and the Global Fund extended this EMR to include a TB modu le that will eventually also be integrated into the national data repository . Importantly, t o rely on national systems, PEPFAR IPs must redirect efforts from maintaining parallel systems to improving the national systems and provide justification when this is not feasible. Data capture and quality reviews should strengthen the national system, and data for reporting requirements should be pulled from that system. As we seek to increasingly employ country longitudinal, person -based, n ational -level data 71 Person -Centered HIV Strategic Information accessed November 9, 2022: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240055315 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 117 of 220 systems , PEPFAR plans to review MER indicators and new data needs as part of PEPFAR's data roadmap (and potentially MER 3.0 ). The process will classify indicators and data needs by those applicable only at service delivery, those applica ble only at the national level, and those applicable at both levels. The proposed process will further consider potential advantages of focused accessible data sets hosted by countries to meet new data needs. The following sections further describe the COP23 country -level strategic information investments, which should advance:72 Bringing together longitudinal person -level data across service delivery points and types of data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, community, etc.) nationally Relying on national data systems as a common source of truth for all uses Integrating information systems to ensure data points are recorded once and available for all needs Sharing focused data sets at appropriate levels of information security with all stakeholders 3.2.3.1 Smart Data The concept of smart data considers what is valuable and actionable for existing and future data needs . A key message from the September 2022 PEPFAR Data Summit was that as the HIV/AIDS pandemic and global \"healthscapes\" evolve, data nee ds also evolve. For example, adherence to lifesaving ART has shifted HIV care and treatment from an acute infectious disease model to a chronic infectious disease model . This means people living with HIV, over time, will experience non-HIV comorbidities \u2014including con ditions like HTN, which are typically associated with aging. Smart data systems need the flexibility to adjust to change to ensure service delivery sites are equipped to deliver the right care for the right patient at the right time. This is a chievable when person -level systems are structured to receive data as used by the service delivery provider. For example, national individual -level systems , integrated across sites, that include data elements for patient regimens can improve awareness about commodity quantity and location 72 For more information, refer to FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.8 . COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 118 of 220 (such as the amount and location of life-saving ART drugs ), and manage distribution based on where patients are seeking care. This can help program s avoid stock outs and thereby help HIV patients receive appropriate ARVs when needed. Furthermore, smart data systems can help national -level program managers efficiently identify individuals experiencing treatment interruptions that could result in losing viral suppression . Importantly, identifying these patients can occur without the expense of finding individuals lost to follow -up at one site but receiving ongoing care at another site. In addition , smart data systems integrate multiple data types and facilitate data crosswalks to verify or complement findings. For example, integrating laboratory management information systems into national data repositories and site -level systems can provide a supplemental view into \"silent transfers \" by identifying t he individual's test orders from another site. Without a smart data system, such patients may be inaccurately recorded as \"lost to follow up.\" Smart data systems can also provide insight from test result data as to where individuals are testing and help pr ograms track timeliness of patients learning their results . Another example would be integration of individual -level data from DREAMS databases with clinical service delivery databases, permitting a quantification of HIV seroconversion rates among DREAMS beneficiaries. Such data are critical for assessing the impact of prevention services. OU teams are encouraged to support existing partner -government health data digitization efforts . Ideally, such efforts will establish smart data systems that, with minimal additional effort, provide actionable data to inform and monitor national HIV program strateg ic priorities for COP/ROP23 and beyond. Strategic information investments for COP/ROP23 should reflect collaboration with partner governments and bring data together nationally across sites and across data sources (e.g., clinical, laboratory, community, et c.). Having longitudinal data that are integrated across multiple levels can improve program progress assessment, enhance how programs identify cost efficiencies, highlight epidemiological trends, and measure innovation impact (See FY24 Technical Considera tions Section 6.6.8 ). 3.2.3.2 Integration Smart data are maximized when underlying information systems are integrated to facilitate recording data once and then ensuring availability wherever needed. Integration enhances capacity to unify existing PEPFAR digital health portfolio investments with b roader sector -wide partner government health information systems ( See Section 3.1.3.7 ) and to increase reliance COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 119 of 220 on the partner country's health data ecosystem to i nform HIV prevention, patient care and treatment, program management , and program planning. Integration occurs in 2 overarching ways: (1) across data sources (to ensure they are collected once and available in all the places needed ); and (2) across areas o f public health concern. Data collected at service delivery meet the needs of more than service delivery providers . Consequently, OU teams must work toward exchanging relevant data across information systems. For example, countries with digitized site -level data and a laboratory information system would electronically exchange information about laboratory test orders and results. Similarly, digitized site -level data wo uld be electronically exchanged with community systems (circle 1 of Figure 16 ). The data then flow to national data repositories (circles 2 and 3 of Figure 16) and are available for analysis (circle 4 of Figure 16 ). These form the health dat a ecosystem. Figure 16 PEPFAR National Information System Investments . The data structures needed for the HIV response resemble those needed to address other public health concerns. Consequently, cost -effective development can accommodate multiple disease information systems without significant impact or cost. For example, a system that collects HIV viral load data using separate d ata elements for test type, test date, test result, and test result type could be expanded to respond to other health concerns like COVID -19 by updating the metadata f or test type (e.g., value set) and test result type (e.g., numeric versus coded). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 120 of 220 As da ta integration is shaped, it's worth noting that digital systems at service delivery that capture clinic and outreach data that provider s may use (e.g., quantitative viral load results ) rather than interpretative data program managers may use (e.g., binary qualitative indicator that the patient is or is not virally suppressed ), are more readily extensible. Furthermore, a standards -based approach using common data element names and coded values across systems for the same concepts further facilitates data integration and makes systems easier to broaden for multi -condition use. PEPFAR, through both technical assistance and direct funding, will work with partner governments to ensure HIS investments reflect this approach \u2014flexible designs that are easily configurable to extend functionality to address other public health concerns. PEPFAR will also collaborate with partner -governments to ensure systems planning follows industry standard requirements \u2014gathering processes that include all stakeholders . As OU teams , in collaboration with country governments, consider their strategic information system portfolio, designs for new development or enhancements to existing systems should reflect this flexible approach to support wider public health needs. In addition, existing systems should be assessed to determin e the feasibility and LOE needed to retrofit th em to accommodate this flexible approach. It is essential to have national data governance policies that address information security controls to ensure data confidentiality and protect individuals' privacy . See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.8.2 for more on this topic . Robust country -level information systems require a skilled workforce to accurately record information at the service delivery level, to integrate th e data across sites and sources , and to make data available for analysis and use. National, person -level data repositories rely on staff who understand the supporting information technology and infrastructure, as well as individuals who know how to review the data for potential issues and to monitor the processes that make the data available. This skilled workforce is essential to a sustainable HIV response and for helping nations address other public health threats. To this end, OU teams are encouraged to work with educational institutions in partner -countries to update existing curricula and/or develop new curricula to train this skilled wo rkforce. PEPFAR remains committed to strengthening this COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 121 of 220 workforce, as well as supporting the establishment or bolstering of national public health institute s, to ensure digital health data investments are institutionalized. 3.2.3.3 Transparency The COVID -19 pandemic highlighted the need for public health data to be a global public good. This applies to data resulting from caring for and treating people living with HIV and tracking and intervening in the HIV /AIDS pandemic. Making information in national pe rson-based data repositories available to all stakeholders, at an appropriate level of access, ensures its maximum benefit and greatest use for health management, disease surveillance, and data - driven decisions at all levels, as shown in Figure 17 . This in cludes secure access to de - identified, individual -level data sets curated for directed analyses, as well as preformatted dashboards and customizable report interfaces for routine situational awareness to detect, respond, and control HIV and future outbreak s of public health concern. This transparency also facilitates electronically satisfying monitoring requirements. Figure 17 Individual -Level Data Support Multiple Uses . Reliable, timely data of known quality, selected and organized for specific uses, should also be presented as publicly available data sets and dashboards with relevant notations. This can help ensure the data are accessible to CSOs and other stakeholders working to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 . This incl udes accommodation for unintended identification resulting from data groupings having small numbers of people, such as when only 1 person in a community has a particular characteristic (e.g., 1 person in a village who is female aged between 15 and 16 years ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 122 of 220 Data governance policies are critical to define information security controls and to define the appropriate access for stakeholders to de -identified data sets. Data governance policies are also necessary to ensure access to de -identified data sets se curely limits data access based on a need -to-know basis and only to the appropriate level of disaggregation. For example, one SNU may have access to individual level data for its area, while its neighboring SNU only has aggregate level access to the same data. In COP23, PEPFAR supports investments in staffing and information technology solutions to make sure data is of known quali ty, to ensure ongoing --at least weekly --data quality review across the unified health data ecosystem, including national person -level repositories, and to support resolution of potential concerns at the source system. This corrected data then follows the routine flow of data from the source to the national integrated, longitudinal person -level data repository. This ensures that data are continually of known quality --meaning curated data sets and dashboards include transparency about the data's limitations a nd considerations (e.g., notes indicating that only 80% of sites feed into that data set). Daily or weekly data quality checks and issue follow -up are needed to optimize this. Further, institutionalization of robust unified digital health data ecosystems requires input and engagement from all stakeholders during the requirements gathering, iterative design, and user acceptance processes . OU teams should ensure their participation , as appropriate , in these activities. This includes representatives from affected community organizations to safeguard systems from unintentionally increasing stigma and discrimination. Broad stakeholder engagement ensures that the individual systems within the national ecosystem benefit those at the servic e delivery level . It also ensures systems apply consistent rules for curated data sets used by those at the various levels to monitor progress, manage the program, and inform strategic direction. Broader stakeholder engagement also increases the likelihood that the developed system will appropriately integrate with the national unified ecosystem and could avoid unnecessary new development when extending or enhancing an existing system would suffice. 3.3 Core Standards Core program standards, systems, and e nabling policies are vital to the long -term success of PEPFAR -supported HIV programs. In recent years, PEPFAR's MPR s helped to focus attention COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 123 of 220 on these key standards. For COP/ROP23 we have changed the name Core Standards and the focus to supporting the nat ional HIV response, PEPFAR teams should work with country governments, donors, and stakeholders to implement, assess, and regularly report on these standards at the national, sub -national, organizational, and site levels. PEPFAR COP/ROP plans will address these elements within the context of the national HIV response. 1. Offer safe and ethical index testing to all eligible people and expand access to self-testing . Ensure that all HTS are aligned with WHO's 5 Cs. Index testing services should include assessment of and appropriate follow -up for intimate partner violence. Offer HIV testing to every child under age 19 years with a biological parent or biological sibling living with HIV. 2. Fully implement \"test-and-start\" policies . Across all age, sex, and risk groups, over 95% of people newly identified with HIV infection should experience direct and immediate linkage from testing to uninterrupted treatment 3. Directly and immediately offer HIV-prevention services to people at higher risk. People at a higher risk of acquiring HIV must be directly and immediately linked with prevention services aimed at keeping them HIV -free, including PrEP and post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP). 4. Provide OVC and their families with case management and access to socioeconomic interventions in support of HIV prevention and treatment outcomes . Provide evidence -based sexual violence and HIV prevention interventions to young adolescents (aged 10 -14). 5. Ensure HIV service s at PEPFAR -supported sites are fr ee to the public . Access to HIV services, medications, and related services (e.g., ART, cotrimoxazole, ANC, TB, cervical cancer, PrEP and routine clinical services for HIV testing and treatment and prevention) must not have any formal or informal user fees in the public se ctor. 6. Eliminate harmful laws, policies, and practices that fuel stigma and discrimination and make consistent progress toward equity . Programs must consistently advance equity, repudiate stigma and discrimination, and promote human rights to improve HIV prevention and treatment outcomes for key populations, adolescent girls and young women, children, and other vulnerable groups. This progress must be evidence -based, documented, and included in program evaluation reports. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 124 of 220 7. Optimize and standardize ART regimen s. Offer DTG -based regimens to all people living with HIV (including adolescents, women of childbearing potential, and children) 4 weeks of age and older . 8. Offer differentiated service delivery models . All people with HIV must have access to differentiated service delivery models to simplify HIV care, including 6 -month MMD, DDD, and services designed to improve ART coverage and continuity for different demographic and risk groups and to integrate with national health systems and services. 9. Integrate TB care. Routinely screen all people living with HIV for TB disease. Standardized symptom screen alone is not sufficient for TB screening among people living with HIV and should be complemented with more -sensitive and setting -specific, WHO -recommended screeni ng tools. Ensure all people living with HIV who screen positive for TB receive molecular WHO -recommended diagnostic and drug susceptibility testing, all those diagnosed with TB disease complete appropriate TB treatment, and all those who screen negative fo r TB complete TB Preventive Treatment. 10. Diagnose and treat people with advanced HIV disease (AHD). People starting treatment, re -engaging in treatment after an interruption of > 1 year, or virally unsuppressed for >1 year should be evaluated for AHD and hav e CD4 T cells measured. All children <5 years old who are not stable on effective ART are considered to have advanced HIV disease. The WHO -recommended and PEPFAR -adopted package of diagnostics and treatment should be offered to all individuals with advance d disease. 11. Optimize diagnostic networks for VL/EID, TB, and other coinfections . In Coordination with other Donors and National TB Programs, complete diagnostic network optimization (DNO) and transition to integrated diagnostics and multiplex testing to address multiple diseases. Ensure 100% EID and VL testing coverage and return of results within stipulated turn -around time. 12. Integrate effective quality assurance (QA) and CQI practices into site and program management . Program management must apply ongoing program and site standards assessment \u2014including the consistent evaluation of site safety standards and monitoring infection prevention and control practices . PEPFAR -supported activities, including IP agreements and wo rk plans should align with national policy in support of QA/CQI. 13. Offer treatment and viral-load literacy . HIV programs should offer activities that help people understand the facts about HIV infection, treatment, and viral load. Undetectable=Untransmittabl e messaging and other messaging that reduces stigma and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 125 of 220 encourages HIV testing, prevention, and treatment should reach the general population and health care providers. 14. Enhance local capacity for a sustainable HIV response . There should be progress toward program leadership by local organizations, including governments, public health institutions, and NGOs . Programs should advance direct funding of local partners and increase funding of organizations led by members of affected communities, including KP-led and women -led organizations. 15. Increase partner government leadership . A sustainable HIV response requires coordinated efforts that enable governments to take on increasing leadership and management of all aspects of the HIV response \u2014including political commitment, building program capacities and capabilities, and financial planning and expenditure. 16. Monitor morbidity and mortality outcome . Aligned with national policies and systems, collect and use data on infectious and non -infectious causes of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV to improve national HIV prog rams and public health response. 17. Adopt and institutionalize best practices for public health case surveillance . Transfer/deduplication processes and a secure person -based record should be in place for all people served across all sites. Unique identifiers should also be in place, or a plan and firm, agreed -upon timeline for scale -up to completion should be established. SECTION 4: PARTNER PERFORMANCE AND MANAGEMENT 4.1 Principles and Expectations PEPFAR's historic achievements would not have been possible without USG agencies supporting groundbreaking work done by a wide range of IPs. As PEPFAR continues to advance sustainability, foster innovation, promote equity, and strengthen partnerships to advance national capacity building , performance and resource management remain essential for accountability to ensure the programmatic impact of all U.S. taxpayer dollars. Key principles include: COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 126 of 220 Global policies are clearly communicated by S/GAC and align with WHO guidelines and policies for optimal programming that support country -led national plans. Periodic updates on guidance to mitigate the impact of COVID -19, or other external threats, and leverage PEPFAR investments in support of emerging global heal th security priorities will be disseminated when needed. Implementing agencies should propose strategies with targets for the COP/ROP that are achievable and verifiable, ensuring budget resources are aligned to expected accomplishments for sustainably end ing HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. The OU team is responsible for seeking to ensure IPs implement the approved COP and provide solutions to issues raised during the COP planning process, as appropriate. USG agencies are responsible for impl ementing the PEPFAR funds S/GAC has allocated and transferred to them. Monitoring and Supporting Optimal Performance: Moving beyond monitoring to management for change requires understanding what is being implemented , how it is being implemented, plus the scale , quality , and cost of that implementation. Quarterly interagency and headquarters touch points, coinciding with result reporting in DATIM, foster transparency, generate collaborative solutions for priority program topics, and allow for agencies to share aspects of in -depth integrated analysis of partner performance and trends toward strategic objectives in sustaining the HIV response with quality and impact. Between quarterly reviews, program performance results for p riority technical areas should be reviewed regularly between the IP and the USG management team, and more frequently when partner performance is of concern. Additionally: In-country agency teams should monitor program performance trends and data quality across MER indicators and other relevant data such as CLM and CQI, along with progress attained through above -site, HRH and other health systems strengthening investments, in relation to financial data (semi -annual outlays and IP expenditures) to determine s ignificant areas of underperformance for management action. Expenditure reporting remains a priority to help assure fidelity in how a planned budget is being or has been executed. USG management teams should use financial data to inform programmatic decis ion-making, help identify successful innovation, seek efficiencies, ensure IP spending is commensurate with results, and develop a remediation plan where necessary to avoid over -outlaying. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 127 of 220 When an IP is underperforming, the agency should take rapid action to review performance and expenditure data, identify internal and external barriers to achievement, and put in place specific interventions based on timing and level of underperformance, ensuring the IP's work plan incorporates management actions to facilitate improved results. For example, achievement less than 80% for OVC_SERV_Comprehensive at Q2, or less than 98% for TX_CURR (depending on OU's context) indicators also warrants intensive follow up with the IP. Clinical partners should actively monitor and use data to ensure individuals on treatment are retained and are virally suppressed. USG agencies should implement a documented Performance Improvement Plan or Corrective Action Plan (CAP) in accordance with agency policy if an IP consistently underperfor ms, including indicators that reflect the core issue. Implementing agencies and partners should work to address performance barriers with and through local government authorities and the OU team , updating the S/GAC chair and PEPFAR Program Manager (PPM ) on progress as needed. This may include options from strengthening local organizations, through a potential shift to new partners if underperformance persists. When considering performance in the context of emergencies, such as extraordinary pandemic or d isaster responses, agencies should continue to foster innovation and document how partners have adapted programs . In addition, agencies must ensure they have managed budget pipelines within the parameters of PEPFAR guidance to recover progress as safely an d swiftly as possible. PEPFAR Participant Safeguards : In the context of PEPFAR implementation, PEPFAR teams are committed to seeking to protect participants from all forms of discrimination, abuse, unethical behavior, and misconduct (i.e., sexual, physical, emotional, and financial abuse, discrimination, coercion, exploitation, and neglect) in PEPFAR -supported programming and has zero tolerance for such actions or failures to address these actions proactively, safely and in a manner respectful to the rights and needs of program participants. For details on prevention and response to gender -based violence and violence against children (See FY24 Technical Considerations S ection 6.6.2.1 ). For more about prevention and response to unethical behavior, misconduct, and coercion in index testing (See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.3.1.5 ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 128 of 220 For specific approaches to ensure programs for key populations are voluntary, confidential, non -judgmental, non -coercive, and non -discriminatory (See FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.5 ). Accountability must be enforced at the individual and institutional levels, and agencies ensure that safeguarding policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and monitoring tools are actively used by agency personnel and IPs to protect all participants and respond appropriately when allegations or incidents occur ( See Section 1.4 ). Partner Work Plans: IPs should work with their USG funding agency, partner governments and other stakeholders in preparing actionable work plans with indicators relevant to funded interventions and aligned with the strategic direction, targets and budget approved in COP23 to assess performance and demonstrate impact. Relationships between the indicators must be clearly established (i.e., along the clinical cascade for treatment) and CQI methodology with opportunities to advance national capacity building and sustainability integrated where appropriate. Budgets should be arrayed, and expenditures tracked according to the PEPFAR financial classification of interventions and cost catego ries. Over the past few years, through the use of granular data and partner management, we have found instances of fraudulent activities involving incentive -based mechanisms. Risk management should be discussed between the IP and funding agency about effec tive funding approaches that safeguard against fraud, waste, and abuse. 4.2 Oversight and Accountability We must hold ourselves, USG agencies, in -country teams , and IPs accountable for the outcomes and impact of PEPFAR funds and work to ensure there is no fraud, waste, or abuse of these funds. Toward this end, several agencies' Offices of Inspectors General (OIG s) continue to develop coordinated annual plans for oversight activity in each fiscal year.73 Agencies also should ensure funding mechanisms and partner management plans include appropriate actions to prevent, identify, report, and respond to programmatic and financial fraud, waste, and management. PEPFAR programs often operate in a larger environment of fraud risk, and agencies use a variety of t ools and approaches to ensure accountability for PEPFAR funds and accuracy of reported accomplishments. Along with performance 73 Foreign Assistance to Combat HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Fiscal Year 2023 Inspectors General Coordinated Oversight Plan, August 2022, https://www.stateoig.gov/report -248 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 129 of 220 monitoring, strategies may include trainings for in -country staff and partners, organizational risk assessments to help improve I Ps' internal controls and key management practices, proactive and responsive data quality assessments at multiple levels, and following guidance from respective OIGs to document and/or facilitate a response to fraud warning signs, allegations, or findings, among other actions. Further, agencies should ensure non -discrimination policies or statements are in place in funding mechanisms that support PEPFAR's priority of non - discriminatory services, plus respond to and investigate immediately allegations of discriminatory behavior by IPs. Data should be reported with integrity in a timely manner, and greater investigation, increased oversight, and corrective action and mitigation are needed when there are indications such as: (1) lack of concurrence between numbers of people identified as HIV positive and number of people initiated on treatment; ( 2) lack of alignment between program results (such as number of people on treatment) and results from large population -based surveys of HIV, like the PHIAs; (3) lack of alignment between data showing complete utilization of commodities budgets without achievement of related treatment and viral load coverage targets; or ( 4) lack of concurrence between program performance data and data on stockouts of commoditie s. All valid, reliable, and available data sources should be used to reconcile results and ensure any claims or statements of achievement are being met. SECTION 5: COP BASICS 5.1 Changes to the COP/ROP Process for 2023 COP/ROP23 reflects several changes to better align with PEPFAR's strategy and to respond to stakeholder feedback. As highlighted in the Executive Summary , the major changes include introduction of 2 -year planning c ycles (to begin with COP23 and ROP24), a shortened yet inclusive planning timeline, and COP/ROP tools that are updated to reduce the LOE required by staff without sacrificing detail needed for planning and accountability. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 130 of 220 The function and purpose of COP/ROP remains unchanged. We need to create an inclusive process, use data for decision -making, maximize partnership and interagency collaboration, and pursue program and policy priorities for maximum impact. All COP changes are undertaken with the intent to preserve accountability, impact, and transparency, and to redesign or eliminate things that are no longer fit for purpose. A 2-year COP/ROP aims to promote a longer -term planning horizon to facilitate coordination with national plans and Glob al Fund commitments. PEPFAR is funded 1 year at a time, so the second year (FY25) budget is notional, subject to availability of funds. Programming will continue with vigilance, transparency, and accountability. At the midpoint of COP23 (at the end of FY24 Q4, after September 31, 2024) all stakeholders will participate in a comprehensive review of country progress and updates of the COP will be made as needed. Also, at the end of FY24Q4, ROP24 planning will be conducted, anticipating a similar 2 -year cycle g oing forward, but on alternate years from COP. 5.2 What is a COP/ROP? The COP/ROP is a written plan and set of accountability tools that documents USG - planned investments linked to specific results in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The purpose of COP/R OP is to ensure that every U.S. dollar is maximally focused and traceable for impact. It is the basis for approval of USG bilateral HIV/AIDS funding in most partner countries. The COP/ROP also serves as a tool for allocation and tracking of budget and targ ets, an implementation plan for the PEPFAR Strategy to guide USG -funded global HIV/AIDS activities, and an important point of coordination, alignment and joint planning with the national government, the Global Fund, and other stakeholders and investors to ensure maximum impact, efficiency, and accountability, and to eliminate duplication. Data from the COP are essential to complying with PEPFAR's commitment to transparency and accountability to all stakeholders, and the process for developing COP/ROP must r eflect our core principles and values ( See Section 1.3 ). 5.3 Which Programs Prepare a COP? PEPFAR utilizes 2 organizational structures related to specific planning processes: Bi lateral programs with individual partner countries (COP) and regional platforms (ROP). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 131 of 220 Bilateral Programs are required to complete COP23 using the planning and submission process described in this guidance document. These countries include: Angola, Bots wana, Burundi, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Dominican Republic, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Ukraine, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. COP23 will reflect a 2 -year plan covering FY24 and FY25, with notional budgets and provisional plans for FY25. At the end of FY24, a mid -point assessment of progress will be performed in collaboration with all stakeholders. Regional Platforms are an organizational structure in PEPFAR using a hub -and-spoke or distributed assets model to plan PEPFAR financial and technical resources as ROPs. Regional Platforms required to complete ROP23 include: Asia: Burma, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Laos, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of Tajikistan, Thailand Western Hemisphere: Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Trinidad, and Tobago West Africa: Benin, Burkina Fa so, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo ROP23 will reflect a 1 -year plan covering FY24. We will perform a thorough assessment and propose improvements for PEPFAR's ROP strategy, which will inform plans for ROP24. We aim for ROP24 to be a 2-year ROP so that ROP planning and COP planning will occur in alternate years going forward. 5.4 COP/ROP23 Timeline The complete operational planning process will occur over approximately 10 weeks . It will begin mid-February with the release of COP/ROP23 Guidance, FY24 Technical Considerations, PLLs, and related tools. All stakeholders will receive ample communication about the changes to COP/ROP23 Guidance, FY24 Technical Considerations, tools, and process es--including COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 132 of 220 simplificat ion of the budget and target tools before they are released. The combination of a global, in -person co-planning meeting early in the planning period and a hybrid meeting of all stakeholders as the plan reaches finalization will provide OU teams and stakeho lders with meaningful and substantive input and dialogue to inform COP /ROP plans. While continuous stakeholder engagement is important throughout planning and implementation, COP /ROP planning requires engagement of PEPFAR OU teams with the partner -countr y government, the national HIV program, local CSOs, local multilaterals (including the Global Fund ), interagency headquarters (HQ) representatives , as well as the S/GAC chair and PPM . Global CSOs should participate and engage meaningfully in planning, while maintaining careful engagement and communication with local CSOs. Wherever possible, external stakeholder engagements should be designed as a hybrid meeting to allow for more participation from governments, global and local civil society, and other stakeholders. Interpretation services should be secured as needed. Highlights of the 10 -week timeline are described below. Table 2 includes milestone dates for OUs by group (either group 1 or 2). Group 1: Angola, Malawi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Burundi, Namibia, Eswatini, South Africa, Tanzania, South Sudan, Vietnam, and Haiti Group 2: Ukraine, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Uganda, West Africa Region, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo Week 1: Initial Strategy Conversations USG teams will meet as needed to discuss initial strategy around COP /ROP 23 in anticipation of the Jo hannesburg meeting. Weeks 2 -3: Co-Planning Meeting with Stakeholders in Johannesburg The goal for the PEPFAR COP/ROP23 co -planning meetings is for all attendees to develop a common understanding of the newly released PEPFAR 5 -Year Strategy , to assure a shared understanding of the PEPFAR 5x3 approach, and to launch development of the 2-year COP23 plan. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 133 of 220 The objectives of the co -planning meetings are: ( 1) Partner -country governments understand the PEPFAR program under the new PEPFAR 5 -Year Strategy and how it aligns with their country priorities. (2) Civil society organizations and stakeholders will have ample opportunity to provide valuable input into the PEPFAR COP/ROP23 planning process ; and (3) Agreement on a blueprint for COP/ROP23 plan. By the end of the co -planning week, it is expected that : (1) The partner -government national plans and the PEPFAR strategy have pro gressed toward and are on the path to alignment; (2) Civil society leaders and stakeholders have had full opportunity to contribute to the planning process; (3) The conversations and outcomes supported by participants at COP/ROP23 will be documented and shared, and fully reflected in the final 2 -year COP and 1 -year ROP; and (4) Participants will leave the co -planning meeting with a plan to complete the COP/ROP by th e end of the 10-week planning period. To prepare for the COP/ROP23 co -planning meetings, participants are encouraged in advance to: (1) Review the PEPFAR 5 -Year Strategy ; (2) Review this document (the COP /ROP23 Guidance ) and FY24 Technical Considerations ; (3) Partner governments and other stakeholders carry out analysis of alignment to 5x3 Strategy and a ny needed gaps/shifts. At the meeting, participants should be prepared to discuss the following: Programmatic shifts that respond to the 5x3 Strategy Financing , particularly commodities, and shifts in responsibility Proposed impact and topline targets Tradeoffs and efficiencies Plans for sustaining the response and how the U .S. Government can assist Plan to finish all elements by the end of the COP/ROP planning period The co -planning meeting will be structured in a 5-day format. Day 1 will be a plenar y convening during which partner -country governments, civil society , and multilateral organizations will share their perspectives. Days 2 -4 will be OU-specific discussions to further a strategic dialogue among all stakeholders, in line with the goals, objectives and outcomes described above. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 134 of 220 o Day 2 will include setting the stage, introductions , protocol, status of the epidemic /gaps, hearing stakeholder s' priorities, agreement in principle on gaps, and charting out a plan for days 3 and 4. o Days 3 and 4 will include: (1) Deep dive s into programs using PEPFAR 5x3-- discuss ing joint priorities, tradeoffs , and efficiencies --beginning with health equity populatio ns (e.g., key population s, adolescent girls and young women , children , etc.); (2) Discussion of core health systems for sustainability ( e.g., HRH, lab, data, service delivery , etc. ), commodities (procurement and supply chain), and financial systems; and (3) Addressing the need for new partnerships, behavioral/social science g aps, and enablers ( e.g., data, community engagement, innovation , etc. ). Day 5 will include additional conversations as needed and a plenary report -out of the results of the meeting. Week s 3-4: In-Country Planning and Tool Development Each OU team will work in country to continue discussions (with national and global stakeholders) on high -level outcomes from Johannesburg meeting, refine strategies, and work to incorporate widely supported strategies into tools. Week s 5-6: Draft 1 Tool Submission and Strateg y and Initial Tool Checkpoint Prior to the USG -only strategy and tool checkpoint, OU teams will submit draft 1 of COP/ROP tools to S/GAC. S/GAC will generate a \"flatpack\" version of tools and strategy summary slides that will be disseminated to CSOs, government stakeholders, and multilateral stakeholders for feedback. CSO/multilateral/government feedback will be discussed at the in -country stakeholder meeting. USG HQ and external stakeholders w ill review to validate that OU teams are looking at the total 2 -year COP plan from a 2 -year strategic standpoint and are proposing budgets and targets that represent that strategy. The checkpoint meeting is U .S. Government only. Weeks 6 -7: In-Country Stakeholder Meeting and Strategy Update. Reconvene (either virtually or in country with virtual access) the full delegation from the co -planning meeting to enable OU teams to discuss and incorporate feedback from USG HQ and external stakeholders (including CSOs) and to refine strategy, targets, and activities. OU teams will c ontinue to edit and refine tools based on outcomes from this meeting . COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 135 of 220 Week s 8-9: Draft 2 Tool Submission and Final Tool Checkpoint . Prior to the USG -only final tool checkpoint, OU team will submit draft 2 of COP/ROP tools to S/GAC. S/GAC will generate a \"flatpack\" version of tools and summary slides that will be disseminated to CSOs, government stakeholders, and multilateral stakeholders for confirmation. OU teams, external stakeholders, and USG HQ will verify that tools reflect outcomes and decisions from in-country stakeholder meetings and ensure tools are on track for finalization at the end of April. Week 9: Finalize and Complete COP /ROP Plan and Tools. Each OU team will work with S/GAC to finalize SDS and tools and all other COP/ROP elements. Week 10: Virtual Approval Meetings. Meeting of all stakeholders with OU team, chair, PPM, headquarters support team (HQST), and Ambassador review and approval of COP/ROP23 -- including targets and budgets.

PEPFAR Chair: PEPFAR leadership appoints the PEPFAR chair a s an OU's most senior PEPFAR HQ representative. The S/GAC chair, alongside the country PEPFAR Coordinating Office, coordinates the OU's high -level HIV programmatic strategy and guides technical, financial, and operational matters. COP/ROP planning responsi bilities include: Helping country teams plan to achieve program priorities Guiding a program's strategic direction and business processes Maintaining productive working relationships with key USG and non -USG stakeholders engaged in the PEPFAR country program (e.g., an OU's U.S. embassy staff, national government representatives, National AIDS Council representatives, multilateral partners, c ommunity leadership, civil -society representatives, and PEPFAR staff) Working with the PEPFAR Coordination Office (PCO), to enhance interagency collaboration Prioritizing fair and objective conflict de -escalation Facilitating decision -making processes PPM: As an OU's routine POC at the agency , PPMs work with the S/GAC chair and PEPFAR coordinator on an OU's programmatic strategies. COP/ROP planning responsibilities include: Closely coordinating with the S/GAC chair and PEPFAR coordinator Managing, coord inating, and providing direct support to implement the OU's PEPFAR business processes Convening staff internal and external to S/GAC (e.g., PEPFAR Coordinating Office staff, S/GAC chair, financial/budget staff, data and SI staff, agency POCs, agency techni cal subject matter experts ( SMEs ), and others engaged in OU -specific programming) Supporting the S/GAC chair to establish and maintain ongoing, productive working relationships with the key USG and non -USG stakeholders engaged in the PEPFAR program S/GAC Liaisons: These liaisons provide support to country teams , PPMs, and S/GAC chairs. S/GAC liaisons must maintain basic knowledge of overall budget cycle, processes, tools, and terminology. There are several liaison categories with respective COP/RO P planning responsibilities: Data Use for Impact (DUIT) Liaisons provide data analysis to inform programming. They COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 139 of 220 understand each assigned program's national and sub -national HIV epidemiology, reporting processes, digital health investments, funded agenci es, and IPs. For COP/ROP planning purposes, the DUIT liaison is the primary POC for target -setting support. They also provide specific guidance on reporting (or reporting issues). Management and Budget (M&B) Liaisons respond to budget -specific questions a nd are responsible for communicating planning level controls (e.g., \"initiative controls\" and \"programmatic controls\") to a wide range of stakeholders. They also support successful completion of COP/ROP planning from data entry in the FAST to final approva l. Program Efficiency Team (PET) Liaisons support country teams via crosscutting data collection, management, and analysis throughout PEPFAR's business cycle. They also serve as financial data advisors and support COP/ROP planning tool reviews and the delivery of materials to external stakeholders. S/GAC Technical A dvisors: These SMEs directly coordinate and guide technical and overarching program priorities. They ensure PEPFAR's programming is aligned with standards. COP/ROP planning responsibilities include: Providing agency -neutral, program - and country -centered g uidance that shapes and promotes practical strategies, and data utilization to optimize resource utilization and maximize program outcomes Leading and coordinating multidisciplinary, multi -agency SMEs to develop PEPFAR guidance, and to facilitate efficient and accountable implementation of interventions at scales that result in measurable impact Closely collaborating with respective PCOs, chairs, PPMs, S/GAC technical advisors, and agency SMEs for all OU -level engagement and support 5.7 PEPFAR Country Coordination Office Roles Led by the PEPFAR coordinator, the PCO is delegated by the U .S. Embass y COM to carry out the day -to-day coordination of the PEPFAR program, unifying the U.S. Government's response to HIV/AIDS in alignment with host -country plans and priorities. As the focal point of S/GAC in - country, the PCO works with implementing agenci es to ensure accountability for PEPFAR results to the host government, S/GAC, and ultimately Congress. The PCO works with agency and technical chairs to prepare the Country Operational Plan COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 140 of 220 (COP) and facilitate quarterly program review calls with S/GAC. T hrough the quarterly program review process, the PCO will provide guidance and oversight of the in -country analysis of programmatic and financial performance of PEPFAR programs. The PCO liaises with agreed -upon host -country government structures, depa rtments, and offices to promote collaboration between government -led HIV programs and those planned and implemented by USG agencies at national, provincial, district, and facility levels. Additionally, the PCO liaises with health donor partners through the Health Partners Forum, civil society and the private sector, and bilateral and multilateral stakeholders with activities in HIV programming. To ensure the PEPFAR interagency team upholds and maintains proper communication protocols, the PCO should serve as the communication conduit from the team to S/GAC. Additionally, if a PEPFAR staff member inadvertently receives a communication or request from S/GAC, their agency lead will share that communication/request with the PEPFAR coordinator. Alternatively, al l communication coming from S/GAC should be communicated to all implementing agencies through agency leadership. The aim is to ensure maximum transparency among agencies as well as to facilitate thoroughly vetted content coming from the agency or S/GAC. PEPFAR Coordinators The PEPFAR coordinator is delegated by the COM to carry out the daily operations of the PEPFAR program in -country and is an extension of S/GAC. Each PEPFAR OU has an in - country PEPFAR coordinator or designated POC who oversees all coordi nation efforts. PEPFAR programs are planned and implemented in -country, thus the COM leads that respective country's plan. The PEPFAR coordinator is a liaison among embassy sections, including in -country USG implementing agency staff. This role also commun icates directly with the PPM and PEPFAR chair and facilitates interagency planning, reporting, and other external engagement. This ensures optimal complementarity of PEPFAR investments - with other programs, donors, and national stakeholders, to include cou ntry governments, civil society, and multilateral institutions such as the Global Fund. As the official liaison between S/GAC and the OU, the PEPFAR coordinator will ensure timely, streamlined, transparent, and consistent communication with all USG agencie s involved in COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 141 of 220 PEPFAR. When conflict arises, the PEPFAR coordinator 's role is to facilitate prompt de - escalation and the resolution. The S/GAC chair and the embassy front office (FO) are also resources to the PEPFAR coordinator, in instances where conflict needs to be managed, deescalated, and/or resolved completely. SECTION 6: BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Leadership Act Mandatory Budget Earmarks Mandatory budget earmarks under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 are legislatively required funding allocations that are directed toward a specific programming purpose within the PEPFAR program. PEPFAR -specific earmarks include OVC and Care and Treatment. Planning for mandatory earmarks should be fully integrated i nto the COP planning process. This funding should complement and enhance the country program, reflect sound and effective allocations to partners with high outlay/expenditure rates and associated results. Ultimately, implementation of mandatory budget earm arks allow s PEPFAR to meet legislative requirements and congressional expectations. Any changes to earmark amounts designated in the Planning Level Letter must be approved by the S/GAC M&B team, in consultation with the Global AIDS Coordinator (GAC), and r ecorded in the Foreign Award and Component Tracking System ( FACTS ) Info. 6.1.1 Orphans and Vulnerable Children The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 directs that 10% of funds appropriated to carry out the provisions of section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (which includes Global Health Program funds appropr iated for funds appropriated for PEPFAR purposes be used for OVC programming. OVC are defined as \"children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live in areas of high HIV prevalence and may be vulner able to the disease or its socioeconomic effects.\" OVC funding serves the dual purpose of mitigating the impact of HIV and AIDS on children and adolescents as well as the prevention of HIV - and AIDS -related morbidity and mortality. Funds used to meet th e OVC programming requirement will comprise funding for the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 142 of 220 comprehensive OVC program ; the primary prevention of HIV and sexual violence among 10- to 14-year-olds; and DREAMS activities that reflect the objectives of mitigation and prevention and serve \"chi ldren orphaned by, affected by, or vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.\" A description of the purpose and illustrative activities for each is contained in FY24 Technical Considerations Section s 6.2.3 and 6.6.3 . The following will not be included for purposes of meeting the 10% OVC programming earmark requirement: funding for drugs, HTS, or diagnostics such as: pediatric and adult OI and ART drugs, PEP or PrEP, medical procedures, medical diagnostics, or lab services. The OVC earmark during COP planning will be based on the OVC beneficiary group and the DREAMS initiative, and will subtract out commodities, testing and some care and treatment. The OVC earmark is calculated according to the following formula: The Orphans and Vulnerable Children earmark is calculat ed according to the following formula: 85% DREAMS initiative funding EXCLUDING : o Commodities planned under DREAMS o Any HTS interventions planned under DREAMS o Any C&T interventions planned under DREAMS 100% of interventions for OVC Beneficiaries EXCLUDING : o Commodities planned under any initiative for OVC beneficiaries o Any HTS interventions planned for OVC beneficiaries Proportional Program Management (Proportional Program Management will vary by mechanism and will be determined by calculating the proportion of the mechanism's non -program management work that counts towards the OVC earmark, and applying that proportion to the program management cost) 6.1.2 Care and Treatment Budgetary Requirements and Considerations The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 directs that at least 50% of funds appropriated to carry out the provisions of section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (which includes Global Health Program PEPF AR funds appropriated to State and USAID) in a given fiscal year must be dedicated to care and treatment for people living with HIV. To reach this global requirement, each country or region will be notified of their specific care and treatment requirement within the COP23 country or regional -specific planning COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 143 of 220 level letter. The care and treatment earmark is calculated by summing the planned funding for several care and treatment -related interventions. The care and treatment (C&T) earmark is calculated accor ding to the following formula: 100% C&T Program Areas 50% Testing (HTS) Program Areas 100% Above Site Program: Laboratory Systems Strengthening 70% Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women Beneficiary Group 100% Above Site Program: Procurement and Supply Chain Man agement Proportion % Program Management (Determined by calculating the proportion of the mechanism's non -program management interventions that count toward the C&T earmark and applying that proportion to the mechanism's Program Management budget ; Proportio nal Program Management will vary by mechanism) If upon submission of the COP/ROP, the allocation resulting from the above formula is not greater than or equal to the OU care and treatment requirement, further discussion will be required to reach this earm ark or request a control change. 6.2 Other Budgetary Controls and Considerations Our partners in Congress may also include directives in appropriations legislation or related reports that cut across multiple accounts at State and USAID, and which S/GAC ma y be responsible for partially fulfilling based on direction from the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources. Two examples of such cross -cutting directives are GBV and Water directives. If any new provisions or language are included in any applicable full year appropriations act that becomes relevant to COP23 funding, S/GAC and the implementing agencies will communicate any changing or new expectations or requirements for teams to incorporate these provisions in their planning processes. Additionally, S/GAC may set discretionary programmatic controls to ensure that certain activities are emphasized in COP programming. Any such changes in amounts designated in the Planning Level Letter must be approved by the S/GAC (M&B) team, in consultation with the GA C, and recorded in FACTS Info. 6.2.1 Water and Gender -Based Violence COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 144 of 220 For COP23 submissions, PEPFAR will assign control levels for water and GBV based on final COP22 attributions, adjusted for any changes in the total budget envelope provided for the OU as appropriate. An OU may program more than the control amounts but should not program less than the control amount. Exact required investment levels will be reflected in the COP23 planning level letter. Exceptions to these requirements require approval by the M&B team, in consultation with the GAC, and will be recorded in FACTS Info. 6.2.2 Discretionary Budget Controls The Global AIDS Coordinator may impose discretionary minimum, maximum, or exact budget requirements, in addition to the specific budget req uirements listed in this guidance. These budget controls ensure that programming meets specific requirements. These requirements will be communicated either in Planning Level Letters or supplemental guidance as well as suggested methods for meeting the req uirement. Examples include budgeting for cervical cancer, CLM, DREAMS, USAID condoms funding, and VMMC. Exceptions to these requirements require approval by the M&B team, in consultation with the GAC, and be recorded in FACTS Info. 6.3 Abstinence, Be Fait hful/Youth Reporting Requirement Primary prevention (AB) activities are evidence -based, primary prevention of sexual violence and HIV activities. These activities, for example, seek to prevent any form of coercive, forced, and/or non-consensual sex, and to prevent early sexual debut. Primary prevention , which includes programming to support healthy decisions, helps communities and families provide these youth with support and education and should be integrated with OVC programs and DREAMS (for younger adolescent girls) . Abstinence, Be Faithful/Youth (AB/Y) programming is now captured by using a combination of prevention program areas and beneficiaries, identified below . The numerator captures interventions that are AB/Y programming , and the denominator approximates all sexual prevention activities. Dividing the numerator by the denominator gives the proportion of AB/Y programming out of all sexual prevention activities . COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 145 of 220 NUMERATOR --Add the Following: Prevention: Non -Biomedical HI V Prevention for OVC, Children, and AGYW + Prevention: Violence Prevention and Response for OVC, Children, and AGYW DENOMINATOR --Add the Following : Prevention: Non -Biomedical HIV Prevention for all Beneficiaries + Prevention: Violence Prevention and Respo nse for all Beneficiaries + 50% Prevention: Not Disaggregated for all Beneficiaries For any country with a generalized epidemic: S/GAC is required to report to Congressional committees if AB/Y -programmed activities are less than 50% of all sexual prevention funding, as calculated by the above formula. In such cases, teams should provide brief justifications and explain the rationale for prevention programming decisions given the epidemiologic context, contributions of other donors, and other releva nt factors. The written justifications should be uploaded as 'Budgetary Requirements Justification' to the document library of FACTS Info. 6.4 Cross -Cutting Climate Attributions For COP23, there are 3 new cross -cutting attributions related to climate. OUs should consider where programming planned for an HIV purpose meets 1 of the 3 cross -cutting attributions listed below and attribute funding appropr iately. OUs should also consider where incorporating climate -related elements listed in the cross -cutting attributions below into existing programs would help to progress toward global targets and allow for attribution of funding to a cross - cutting climate attribution. In no case should climate related activ ities that are not linked to HIV/AIDS epidemic control or prevention be undertaken. Please direct any specific questions on these attributions to your OU's S/GAC M&B reviewer . Avoiding Multiple Attributions: Please note that a given dollar can only be attributed to 1 of the 3 climate cross -cutting attributions. For example , if funds are attributed to the Adaptation Indirect Cross -Cutting Attribution, they may not also be attributed to the Clean Energy Indirect or Sustainable COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 146 of 220 Landscapes Indirect Cross -Cutting Attribution to comply with international reporting requirements and avoid double counting. However, a given activity may attribute specific portions of its funding to separate key issues. Adaptation Indire ct Cross -Cutting Attribution: Programs that enhance resilience and reduce vulnerability of people, places or livelihoods to climate variability and change, and related extreme weather events should attribute funding to the Adaptation Indirect Key Issue. Fu nding attributed to the Adaptation Indirect Key Issue may include activities from a broad array of program areas, including but not limited to national and sub-national adaptation planning, agriculture, food security, nutrition, natural resource management , infrastructure, health, water, disaster preparedness and recovery, disaster risk finance, governance, economic growth, education, urban resilience, coastal management, and conflict prevention. Programs or activities that attribute funding to the Adaptati on Indirect Cross - Cutting Attribution seek to address or mainstream climate change adaptation in their programming. NOTE: Funding related to multi -month dispensing of ARVs should not be included in this cross -cutting attribution. S/GAC will report centrall y on MMD funding that contributes to this attribution. In general adaptation mainstreaming and scaling activities achieve 1 or more of the following results: Deepen global understanding of climate risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation solutions while sup porting expanded development, innovation, use, and delivery of climate information services, decision support tools, and early warning systems. Support formal and informal governance and management processes to address climate -related risks, including acti vities that improve the capacity of national, sub - national and municipal level governments to assess and embed climate risks into their budgets, plans, policies, and operations; Support locally led adaptation that enables climate -vulnerable communities and people to meaningfully participate in and lead adaptation -related decisions; Support actions that increase resilience to weather - and climate -related risks. This may include actions that were taken as a result of the climate risk management process if those actions help the activity adapt to the impacts of climate change; Support and accelerate financing of adaptation measures by contributing to and shaping new and existing multilateral and bilateral adaptation funds, supporting multiple climate COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 147 of 220 risk finan ce strategies, strengthening capacity to access finance for adaptation and develop bankable investments, and striving to mobilize private capital. Clean Energy Indirect Cross -Cutting Attribution: Clean Energy programs and activities can enable reliable, e fficient, sustainable, and secure energy systems by promoting and enabling the production, procurement, and use of zero - carbon and clean energy technologies; carbon -intensive energy engagements, which would not qualify as clean energy programs, are detaile d in the administration's Interim International Energy Guidance (detailed below; \"Guidance\") which specifies a threshold for lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Clean Energy programs also may include other climate mitigation activities that do not fully fi t into the Sustainable Landscapes category and that significantly reduce and/or avoid greenhouse gas and other climate -warming emissions while improving livelihoods. Clean energy activities include, but are not limited to, the following: Direct expenditure s on the promotion, deployment, and management of renewable energy in all end -use sectors. Work on enabling technologies and activities, including but not limited to energy storage, smart grids, and the deployment and management of energy efficiency and de mand -side management measures (including efficient appliances and machinery, efficient building designs, and consumer behavior change) designed to reduce energy intensity and moderate demand is also permitted. End -use energy efficiency and flexible demand are essential to scaling up renewable energy, including in areas such as transportation, industry, and building systems, because they enhance system operations to manage renewable energy intermittency, improve the affordability of distributed renewable energy systems, reduce the cost of supply, and improve utility performance. Policies and projects that reduce methane emissions in the solid waste and wastewater sectors across the entire waste value chain, including but not limited to, waste reduction, organ ics diversion from the waste stream, solid waste management, landfill gas capture, and wastewater management improvements . Sustainable Landscapes Indirect Cross -Cutting Attribution: Sustainable Landscapes programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land by promoting sustainable land use practices that reduce emissions or increase carbon sequestration. These programs support the implementation of natural climate solutions, which redu ce net greenhouse gas emissions through the conservation, management, and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 148 of 220 restoration of forests, mangroves, and other ecosystems, as well as low emissions practices in agriculture and other production systems, while supporting economic growth, resilience, and other co -benefits. Sustainable Landscapes programs help countries achieve their international climate commitments such as Nationally Determined Contributions and Sustainable Development Goals. Activities must focus on reducing emissions, and can incl ude: low emissions land use planning; Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation; improved data and analytical tools; monitoring, reporting, and verification systems; enabling laws and policies; effective implementing institutions; social and environmental safeguards; access to finance; mobilizing finance; work with banks, financial institutions, and participants in commodity supply chains; technical assistance, promotion of rule -of-law, governance, transparency, and programs to counter co rruption; promoting enabling environments, including for engagement in market mechanisms and results -based finance; assistance with national policy; economic incentives; and low emissions agriculture. Sustainable Landscapes work should ultimately contribut e to a coherent approach to reduce emissions at scale. The primary intent of indirect programs need not be to reduce emissions or enhance sequestration . But as a co -benefit of program interventions , indirect programs should have a reasonable expectation o f reducing emissions from land use or enhancing sequestration or improving the policy or other enabling conditions that will lead to emission reduction or sequestration from land use. Illustrative Examples Supporting a biodiversity conservation project th at leads to reduced deforestation and associated emissions; Creati ng or effective ly manag ing of protected areas where there is a risk of illegal deforestation, degradation or land conversion that would result in increased emissions; Improving land tenure s ystems that result in communities incentivized to manage and restore forested areas, resulting in increased carbon sequestration in tree biomass; COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 149 of 220 Land tenure reform or improv ing land use planning for agriculture that results in reducing the conversion of h igh carbon natural habitats and associated emissions; Restoring wetlands to increase fisheries production that also returns wetland carbon storage potential, thus increasing carbon sequestration; Supporting an agricultural activity that promotes the incorp oration of agricultural residue, leading to lower use of nitrogen fertilizers and associated emissions; Working on pasture management to implement improved grazing techniques and fire reduction methods, resulting in improved grassland health and greater ca rbon sequestration in the soil; Increasing tree cover on the landscape through practices such as living fences, shelterbelts and windbreaks, boundary trees and alley cropping, resulting in increased carbon sequestration; Developing economic incentives or a lternative livelihoods to reduce the conversion of ecosystems to protect biodiversity, watersheds, or other ecosystem services that also will result in reduced emissions. 6.5 Budget Execution Throughout the budget cycle, beginning with the COP planning pro cess and continuing through full implementation of programming, PEPFAR operating unit interagency teams are responsible for ensuring the planning and implementation of each COP is consistent with the budget approved by the S/GAC and documented in FACTS Inf o with details at the IP level and USG CODB level. The approved COP budget levels reflect the total resources that a country or region is approved to outlay for COP23 activities during the 12 -month , year 1 implementation period (October 1, 2023 , through September 30, 2024). These resources include both newly appropriated funds and pipeline (funds appropriated in prior fiscal year appropriations acts) applied to the COP23 year 1 implementation cycle. All IPs to which the US G funding agency expects to outlay funding during the implementation period must be recorded in FACTS Info, including anticipated outlays of prior year funding if unliquidated, and outlays as part of closing out an award. In a change from previous years, f unds may be outlaid in excess of the approved COP23 year 1 envelope to the extent that outlays of unliquidated obligations (ULOs) are needed to pay for services and goods provided in previous COPs. The total amount of ULOs available for such outlays will b e documented within FACTS Info. Agencies may not outlay in excess of the COP23 year 1 envelope for services provided in COP23 year 1. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 150 of 220 Outlays are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as payments to liquidate an obligation. Consequently, within the COP process, outlays are cash drawdowns initiated by the IP, regardless of whether the funds have actually been spent by the partner. Expenditures refer to the IP's use of funds. The sign ed COP Approval Memo constitutes the final approval, which locks in the partner and CODB budget levels in FACTS Info. From this point, each PEPFAR implementing agency is accountable for outlaying funds to its IPs at no more than the approved level. Outlays cannot exceed the approved COP budget, unless the S/GAC authorizes it in advance. Agencies should work closely with IPs to initiate cash drawdowns within the approved COP budget to the greatest degree possible. As indicated above, agencies may outlay fund s from ULOs from previous COP years for services that have been provided in prior COP years. An IP that is not documented in FACTS Info at the time of the approval should not carry out activities and should not spend associated funds, unless the IP is doin g so with prior S/GAC authorization. Critically, agencies should routinely monitor site -level results against partner expenditures and ensure low-performing partners spend funds appropriately . If during program implementation, an interagency team identif ies a need to outlay to an IP an amount that exceeds the approved level or a need to rectify an error or omission in the original COP23 submission, then the agency must work with the PEPFAR coordinator or POC to submit a request for an OPU to gain approval for the new budget level and to ensure correct documentation of revised funding levels. An OPU and approval is required regardless of whether the intent is to increase outlays using pipeline or new funds. The OPU must include a table that documents fundin g shift (i.e., where funding is decreased so that the increase can be accommodated while staying within the overall budget control for the OU). This must be transparent to all in -country PEPFAR agencies as it impacts the whole program. An OPU is not requir ed to outlay ULOs from prior COP cycles to pay for services provided in prior COP cycles. Agencies should fully utilize their expiring appropriations before obligating or expending newer funds, to the extent it is consistent with legal requirements and restrictions, including congressional notification procedure s. Due to this budgetary approach, the appropriation year of funds that are outlaid in support of an approved COP activity may not match the distribution of new and applied pipeli ne funds, as documented in FACTS Info. This is acceptable, as long as: COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 151 of 220 (1) the use of the pipeline funds is consistent with any legal and policy restrictions and applicable procedures for use of those funds; ( 2) total outlays at the end of the fiscal year are equal to or less than the total approved funding level for each individual partner or CODB category; and (3) IPs are not allowed to accumulate pipeline greater than their award. A mechanism's overhead should reflect all indirect and other program ma nagement costs, unless during closeout. The level and proportion of program management budget compared to the overall budget may influence decisions to approve a mechanism during COP planning as part of analyzing efficiency in implementing for results \u2014exce pt for the Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA ) costs, which cannot change , and allowable indirect costs for on local partner cooperative agreements. Expected overhead may vary depending on the intent of the mechanism, for example capacity -build ing and technical assistance mechanisms have higher program management costs than other types of mechanisms. An IP must never expend funds for the sake of decreasing pipeline , rather than accomplishing program goals. Doing so would make the partner appea r more costly, which would jeopardize future funding and consideration for that partner. All partner expenditures must be in accordance with the approved COP level . Awards may have a multiyear life cycle. Total award budgets must consider all anticipated start- up (when implementation costs may be less) and close -out costs (when implementation may be winding down) . Starting in COP23, it is no longer required that agencies budget for closeout costs within their yearly outlay ceiling for costs that are tied to a country office or program closure approved in a previous COP. Once a project has ended in a given country, adjustments to NICRA charges, audits, and other actions that are legally required to close out a government contract/agreement may still pr oceed long after the country -level work is completed. Those costs are typically funded in the existing obligation and may be charged to the U.S. Government. Since those costs are budgeted for in previous years of program management, OUs do not need to budg et for them again. The only exception might be when additional obligations and outlays are required above what is already in an unliquidated balance. The IP should continue to charge for those allowable (and sometimes legally required) costs and agencies a llow the payments to proceed outside of the yearly COP envelope. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 152 of 220 PEPFAR equipment purchased with USG funding should be transferred from closing mechanisms to new mechanisms , where appropriate, to decrease start -up and close -out costs. The final year of a mechanism's implementation (including cases in which a PEPFAR OU is buying into a broader agency mechanism for the last time, even if the agency mechanism itself is not closing) may have a budget with few or no targets (in order to account for close -out costs and NICRA). When one implementing mechanism ( IM) closes and another opens, both may be active in the same geographic location, during the transition period. The IPs' work plans should reflect this geographic overlap in transition ; however, ther e should be no interruption in service delivery of prevention, treatment, or other services. If this occurs, these programs will be moved to another partner to manage. Financial analysis plays an indispensable role in performance monitoring (e.g., achie ving MER targets, achieving above -site benchmarks, and achieving SIMS standards of program quality). PPMs must fully understand whether the program is reaching its anticipated MER targets, achieving its programmatic strategy, and complying with quality and sustainability standards. They must also analyze financial performance, including outlays by the USG funding agency, and expenditure by the IP at the mechanism level. Such financial analysis will help PPMs arrive at a more comprehensive view of an IM's ov erall performance. Hence, PPMs should include financial analysis in quarterly program review discussions and other partner management conversations. PEPFAR recognizes the need for a standardized, program -wide approach. Chairs and PPMs should understand and compare contextualized IM expenditures for IPs that carry out similar interventions so that they can identify best practices, correct potential inefficiencies, and/or adjust funding. Planning discussions for COP23 begin from a review of COP21 implement ation, both in terms of interventions and budgets. Existing contracts and work plans can provide relevant financial information for such a review. Sharing the results across the full interagency group is imperative to inform robust conversations and analys is to determine the COP23 directions and priorities . COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 153 of 220 PART B: GUIDE TO COUNTRY OPERATIONAL PLAN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION SECTION 7: USING DATA TO INFORM COP PLANNING PEPFAR programs are expected to use key data sources to assess the quality, impact, and efficiency of the current program and align resources to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat and sustainably strengthen public health systems. This section is design ed to demonstrate the importance of utilizing differential data to optimize resource allocation for sustained HIV impact with COP/ROP23 funding. Modular Planning Steps The COP/ROP23 planning steps utilize a flexible, modular planning approach that emphasi zes the importance of integrated data analysis to refine programming, set targets and budgets, and ensure quality partner performance. In collaboration with key stakeholders, teams should identify resources to fund systems, programs, and services that will maintain successes, close remaining gaps, and plan for the sustainability of the HIV response within the teams' funding envelope s. OU teams are required to engage civil society, partner -country governments, and communities, inclu ding key populations , in an iterative and meaningful way when planning and developing COP/ROP23 proposals. Planning Step 1: Take a holistic approach . Understand progress, needs, and gaps for sustaining HIV impact across the 5x3 and national priorities . In this step, cost -effective priority activities for an equitable and sustained HIV response that aligns with national priorities will be identified. This is an exercise in allocative efficiency, which seeks to identify t he right activities and interventions to maximize impact and achieve the desired health outcomes. OU teams and key stakeholders can collectively use data and findings from PEPFAR and partner -country data streams, discussions on national priorities and sustainability with key stakeholders , and quarterly and end -of-year reviews to analyze and interrogate what is needed for sustained HIV impact. This holistic approach ensures that OU COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 154 of 220 teams and stakeh olders have a common understanding of the current progress, needs, and gaps for an equitable and sustained HIV response across program and health systems investments. COP/ROP23 planning discussions must expand beyond closing the final gaps in clinical and prevention programming and plan for sustaining HIV impact . As such, all OU teams should assess programs from a sustainability lens whereby the long -term goal is to transition management and leadership of all aspects of the HIV response to national gover nments. By the end of this step, teams should be able to describe activities that need to be ended, continued, modified, started, or scaled up. Consider the following: Health Equity for Priority Populations : What gaps remain among age, gender, and popul ation groups that are either infected with HIV or at risk of HIV infection (i.e., progress and gaps along the 95 -95-95 and prevention)? Sustaining the Response and Health Systems and Security : What new or existing systems -level investments are needed to s trengthen the capabilities and outcomes of local public health systems for HIV, other diseases, and outbreaks (data sources include Planning Activities for Systems Investment Tool ( PASIT ) or former Table 6, SID 2021, and Responsibility Matrix 2021)? What is the current progress on the path to sustainability and increased national government management and leadership of all aspects of the HIV response? What new or existing HRH investments are needed to address health inequities and strengthen health sy stems and security in a sustainable manner? Which health information systems are not integrated within the national digital health landscape? Transformative Partnerships : What new or existing partnerships are needed to sustain and advance HIV impact and co ntribute additional resources and capabilities toward HIV priorities? Follow the Science: What additional information is needed for sustained HIV impact \u2014 in particular , surveys (e.g., IBBS ) and surveillance plans \u2014to better understand people living with HIV who have not yet been served? How can we utilize behavioral science and IS to drive the adoption of new, more efficient technology and delivery modalities? Planning Step 2: Identify efficiencies and prioritize programs to maximize impact and results . In Planning Step 2, teams will use data to ensure that technical efficiency is achieved by interrogating program costs and minimizing the amount of input or funding required to achieve COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 155 of 220 the desired outcome or quality of service. In this step, expenditure, work plan, HRH, Activity Based Costing data ( ABC/M ) and other costing, and program data are used to examine costs to find technical efficiencies within program activities. Where efficiencies are found, in collaborati on with all stakeholders, funds should be redirected to the priority activities identified in Step 1 that currently have funding gaps. The technical efficiency analysis should include the following approaches: Non-service delivery costs that support site -level work \u2014especially , non-service delivery personnel and training \u2014are a major source of program spending and should be interrogated in detail. For every non -commodity dollar spent on providing service delivery at sites, the PEPFAR program spends roughly $0.40 in site -level non -service delivery support costs and another $0.43 on program management support costs. This does not include non -service delivery costs that are misclassified and reported under service delivery interventions, which will be a ddressed later in this section. It also does not include above -site program costs. In total in FY23, non -commodity site -level non -service delivery costs totaled $664 million in all of PEPFAR, and program management totaled $713 million. While the correct l evel of non -service delivery spending required to support and manage an effective service delivery program can vary and depend on several factors, it is important that OU teams attempt to identify the correct and minimum acceptable level of non-service delivery support required for their service delivery programs by engaging national counterparts, PEPFAR HQ SMEs and technical and program area experts. For example, if funding is being spent on a training, OU teams and HQ SMEs should ask the following t ypes of questions : Is the training needed for where the program is now or is it a continuation of training needs from years past? Are enough training sessions being held, or could the number be reduced? Can the training be done on the job instead of requir ing additional costs like travel and per diem? Similar questions can be asked of other non - service delivery costs as well, including non -service delivery staff, especially keeping in mind their relative cost when compared to service delivery staff. Once th e correct level of non-service delivery input is determined, the COP/ROP23 budget for that partner or program should be determined using those inputs plus other service delivery expenses, and any efficiencies that are identified when comparing to the curre nt budget should be redirected to service delivery, above site, or other priority activities. It is also important for OU teams to understand the relative levels of non -service delivery support among partners working in the same program areas in an OU a s inefficiencies COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 156 of 220 can be brought to light when viewed in a comparative context. A comparative analysis of expenditures is a useful tool for this analysis. This type of analysis requires OU teams to compare overall non -service delivery site -level and program management expenditures by PEPFAR IP and program area (or intervention) as well as unit expenditures (expenditure per MER result) \u2014ideally over an extended period of performance \u2014to identify PEP FAR IPs with higher expenditures or cost inputs per result over time and , thus, those with potential efficiency opportunities. Higher non -service delivery costs may be justified if an IP is working in unusually challenging conditions or if a corresponding higher level of performance is observed. Absent these factors, high non -service delivery costs may represent opportunities for efficiency. Finally, OU teams must remember every dollar spent on non -service delivery is a dollar th at could have been spent on service delivery. Thus, in a context in which essential service delivery expenses like health care workers and commodities are in short supply or service delivery could be expanded if non -service delivery costs were redirected to service delivery, non -service delivery costs should be especially scrutinized and minimized to the greatest extent possible. It is next worth interrogating those costs that are reported as service delivery but are either potentially misclassified as service delivery or not esse ntial to effective service delivery. The HRH inventory suggests that a number of non -service delivery roles are incorrectly reported as service delivery, and certain cost categories, like trainings, are sometimes reported under service delivery , which is u sually not accurate. The essential costs of service delivery are health care workers and commodities. Some other cost types, like financial services to beneficiaries, domestic travel and health equipment , can also be important components of service deliver y. However, a number of cost categories are planned as service delivery but require interrogation to understand exactly what was purchased, whether the costs were potentially misclassified and are in fact non -service delivery, and whether the costs would b e better redirected to other priority activities. Some examples of the cost categories reported in service delivery that require this type of interrogation are personnel -other staff, international travel, other contracts, other -other, supplies -other, train ing, and equipment -non-health pharmaceutical. After interrogating the above cost categories, teams should look next at efficiencies that can be found within health care worker and commodity costs. Though health care worker costs and commodit y costs are am ong the most essential costs for an effective epidemic response, as described above, efficiencies can potentially be found in these categories, though this would not include cuts or reductions to the quantities purchased. First, OU COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 157 of 220 teams must ensure that salaries for health care workers are aligned with government - recognized cadres, pay scales , and qualifications, as per COP/ROP guidance. Salaries for other HRH supporting priority activities should be reviewed and aligned to FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.6.7 . For commodities, OU teams must ensure the commodity prices used in the COP budget are aligned to reference prices and take advantage of pooled procurement and all - inclusive pricing mechanisms to access best -available pricing. Finally, all priority interventions, including site-level, above -site, service delivery , and non- service delivery, should be costed at the activity level when possible, to understand the input mix used by different partners to achieve desired health outcomes. Both cost and number of inputs to core activities sh ould be identified and understood . In addition, for service delivery activities, non -service delivery activities that support service delivery should be identified and costed. Costs deemed non -essential should be redirected. OU teams are encouraged to u se ABC/M to assist in this analysis. Planning Step 3 : Putting it all together . Writing a data -driven COP/ROP that responds to needs and optimizes resources for sustained HIV impact . At this point, OU teams should be ready to identify high -level targets, milestones, and benchmarks and demonstrate how PEPFAR aligns with and contributes to strengthening the national HIV response in a sustainable manner. The COP/ROP elements below should reflect decisions from the data -driven approach to developing key strategies and appropriate targets and/or milestones: High-Level Strategy: SDS should capture key 2 -year strategies and decisions for COP /ROP23 implementation . Target Setting Tool: High -level and geography/age/sex /population group targets, allocated to IMs. Budget: FAST budget allocation tool should strategically align the activity budgets with the overall OU program strategy using findings determined from the cost and expenditure analysis and MER targets. Above -Site: PASIT should reflect above site activities and investments (with benchmarks) that align with national priorities and the PEPFAR 5-Year Strategy . Funding Landscape across Donors: OU teams can use the RA profile to help inform how donor and national g overnment investments can be maximized to prevent duplication and help drive sustained HIV impact. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 158 of 220 Commodities: SPT captures supply chain information for all HIV -related commodities , regardless of procuring agent, including initial stocks, forecasted cons umption rates, and procurements. Bilateral OUs should strategically plan commodities purchases in alignment with MER targets and the FAST budget allocation tool. SRE Tool: Proposed SRE activities should help understand and address countries' gaps and need s or translate efficacious interventions where efficiencies should exist. Additionally, SRE activities should complement routine program data or provide an additional evidence base for issues identified in this analysis where routine program data cannot. By the end of this step, OU teams should have a clear understanding of progress toward 95 -95- 95 and prevention benchmarks, needs and gaps for both programs and systems to sustain the response, what activities (or types of activities) will address th ese gaps, how these activities are contr ibuting to national and PEPFAR priorities, high -level targets and/or milestones , and the corresponding budgets, with relevant justifications. SECTION 8: COP ELEMENTS 8.1 Strategic Direction Summary In COP/ROP23, the SDS is a template for OU teams to describe their strategic plan for the 2 - year implementation period for bilateral OUs and 1 -year implementation period for regional OUs allowing flexibility for teams to add visuals that support narratives as needed. In short, the SDS should focus on how c hanges between the current and future plans align with national priorities and PEPFAR's 5x3 strategy; this includes key priorities to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, the sustainabl e strengthening of health systems , and how progress will be monitored. The COP23 SDS is a supplemental document submitted in FACTS Info and a template is available on the PEPFAR SharePoint COP23 website for OU teams . Descriptions in the SDS should address COP23 obstacles to implementati on and plans to address them. The SDS must also contain the corrective actions currently being implemented or planned to address the issues identified in the planning level letter (if any). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 159 of 220 In this streamlined SDS, PEPFAR teams should use the guiding ques tions and adhere to the required tables and figures to successfully submit their document, though teams may add supplemental visualizations or information useful in clarifying the COP23 vision. Note: The COP/ROP23 SDS is a public document to be shared wi th stakeholders during development and prior to submission and published on www.state.gov/pepfar upon approval. All data tables, graphics, figures, and language contained in the S DS should be drafted with this knowledge. If sensitive information must be included in the SDS to provide for robust planning and discussion, it will be reviewed collaborative ly with HQ and OU teams to identify any sensitivity prior to being distributed outside of PEPFAR implementing agencies/partners and released into the public domain. Elements that may be useful for internal program planning but have not yet been cleared by external owners (e.g., unpublished data provided by partner - country government s) will be redacted if approval is not granted. Data that are likely to put certain populations at risk if published (e.g., geographic data on key populations) will also be redacted. 8.2 Funding Allocation to Strategy Tool The COP23 Funding Allocation to Strategy Tool (FAST ) will be significantly streamlined and modified to address feedback on the COP22 tool, especially feedback from OU teams . The COP23 FAST will also enable budgeting for a 2 -year period. Modifications to the FAST will foc us on improving the performance and integration of the tool while reducing the LOE required to complete the tool . However, the changes will not reduce the level of detail collected in the budget; we will simply shorten the process for entering the data. PE PFAR Financial Classifications \u2014 including program area, beneficiary, initiatives, cross -cutting attributes, and other compliance indicators \u2014will continue to be collected in the COP23 tool. To improve the experience of completing the FAST, the COP23 FAST wi ll enable a multi -user data entry approach by storing the tool on SharePoint Online and requiring users to edit directly into SharePoint Online. This will help address the challenges of having a singular FAST file that only one user can work in at a time, as well as address concerns related to version control by allowing all users and reviewers access to a designated location where the latest tool is stored. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 160 of 220 To address challenges related to the interaction between the FAST and its related tools, in COP23, the FAST will be combined with PASIT and the SRE Tool, such that all 3 tools will be housed in 1 Excel document that will be stored on a SharePoint Online website that is accessible to all users and editable by designated financial and other POCs. Finally, the COP23 FAST will enable budgeting for a 2 -year period, with some automation done for the second year to reduce the data-entry burden. This approach to 2 -year budgeting will align with COP improvement strategies to extend COP to a 2 -year period to enable long -term strategic planning and to reduce the COP LOE required in the second year. While the COP23 FAST tool will serve primarily to docume nt the COP budget, the COP budgeting process is much longer and requires strategic budgeting approaches that happen outside of the FAST tool. In COP23, strategic budgeting should incorporate the following efficiency activities: 1. A rigorous assessment of p rogram costs , including HRH costs, with the aim of improving cost effectiveness of ongoing interventions and finding efficiencies such that funding can be optimized and redirected away from activities that are being phased out in favor of activities to sup port key sustainability goals ; 2. An assessment of OU -wide commodities needs and gaps and a strategic negotiation to determine how gaps will be closed or targets will be adjusted to enable a fully funded commodity procurement plan that leverages pooled procu rement mechanisms and all -inclusive pricing agreements to access best - available pricing; 3. An activity -based approach to budgeting that starts by identifying priority activities for the implementation of the 5x3 strategy in the COP23 cycle (see Section 7 for additional details) \u2014including costing those priority activities \u2014and then moves to a reassessment of ongoing/sustaining interventions and their costs to ensure cost effectiveness and alignment with sustainability roadmaps and priorities. Priority activities will vary by country but may include commodities ; health systems strengthening ; HRH activities ; agency CODB s; or other key , strategic initiatives related to the 5x 3 strategy. Countries not yet at or near global targets may have different priority activities that will need to be costed and optimized. The level of COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 161 of 220 funding set aside for priority activities, as determined through strategic COP plann ing, should be rigoro usly vetted through expenditure, HRH, work -plan cost data, and ABC /M, if available. Once determined, ongoing activity costing should be done using the same data sources, with an eye toward finding efficiencies. These 3 strategic budgeting activities are critical to achieving an efficient , high-impact COP. They should take place as part of ongoing conversations , and the decisions and outcomes of each should be shared with chairs/PPMs and other key stakeholders. 8.3 Above -Site: Planning Activities for Syste ms Investment Tool (PASIT) and Surveys -Surveillance, Research, and Evaluation (SRE) Tool Note: Both the PASIT and SRE are integrated into the FAST in COP/ROP23. 8.3.1 Planning Activities for Systems Investments Tool (PASIT) In COP/ROP23, PASIT is the up dated and optimized tool formerly known as Table 6. PASIT is designed to facilitate 2 -year COP/ROP23 planning and budgeting of non -service delivery above - site activities for systems investments that are critical to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthening health systems. Like other COP/ROP23 tools, PASIT accounts for 2 -year planning for all bilateral OUs completing a COP, and 1 -year planning for regional OUs completing a ROP. As in previous years with Tab le 6, OU teams can use PASIT as needed as part of their health system gap analysis to ensure planned or ongoing activities are aligned with identified health systems gaps, National Strategic Plans , or other national priorities ' appropriate benchmarks to monitor progress and to ensure outcomes are documented . OU teams can also use PASIT to ensure activities are appropriately budgeted. OU teams can refer to the PASIT User Guide, posted on PEPFAR SharePoint, for more information on required fields and how to complete the PASIT within the FAST. Like other COP/ROP tools, prior to COP/ROP23 finalization, the PASIT must be disseminated to national stakeholders. 8.3.2 Survey, Surveillance Research and Evaluation Activities (SRE) Tool The SRE Tool should draw on PASIT and the previous year's SRE planning. Teams should use the tool to propose new SRE activities \u2014defined and described in the sections that follow \u2014and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 162 of 220 provide updates on ongoing activities. All proposed, newly commencing, ong oing, completed, not implemented , and discontinued SRE activities that are partially or fully funded by the COP and Headquarters Operational Plan ( HOP ) must be submitted in the COP and approved by S/GAC prior to planning or funding. Information provided in the SRE Tool will be used at the COP23 meetings to provide a view of countries' past SRE activities and assist in determining SRE activities needed for COP23. While there are many completed PEPFAR -funded studies and excellent routine data sour ces to consider and draw on when faced with a priority question and before assuming the need for primary data collection/new SRE , there are instances when evidence and data are not available, accessible , or of adequate quality to answer priority questions. These are the instances in which advocating for new SREs is appropriate and essential. PEPFAR recommends using all available data assets and systems and a combination of analytic, evaluation, and research methods and designs to enhance PEPFAR program con tributions to country progress toward averting new infections and reaching and maintaining 95 -95-95 goals (See the SRE Decision Tree in FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.8 , which can help Ous determine the best approach ). The SRE Tool documents proposed SRE activities and elaborates on previously funded SRE activities that need to be extended. SRE activities should align with PLL requirements. To the extent possible, distribute SRE activities across time to avoid excessive strain on resources in a single year. The activities should align with the strategic plan discussed in Section 3.1.5 and should also inform out -year budget -relevant activities. Surveys -Surveilla nce Activities PEPFAR defines surveys -surveillance as the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data to describe and monitor health events . Surveillance activities should be entered in the SRE Tool (including KP BBSs) (See Section 3.1.5.2 ). Research Activities PEPFAR supports 2 types of research \u2014IS and Operational Research (OR) \u2014to establish facts, advance knowledge, and reach new conclusions. Countries can use IS and OR to identify solutions to problems that limit program quality, efficiency, and effectiveness and the ability of programs to increase in scale . Countries can also use IS and OR to determine which alternative service delivery strategy would yield the best outcomes (See Section 3.1.5.1 for more information ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 163 of 220 Research activities, regardless of type, should be submitted in the SRE Tool ; however, routine monitoring of clinical and service outcomes should not be included in the SRE Tool as research. This includes cohort studies, barring those that have been previously appr oved or that are funded for enhanced data collection, which should both be included in the SRE Tool. Instead, most cohort studies should be approached as part of routine program implementation. Evaluation Activities PEPFAR defines evaluation as the systematic collection and analysis of information about the characteristics and outcomes of a program, including projects conducted under such a program, as a basis for making judgments about the program, improving program effectiveness, and informing decisions about current and future programming.3 PEPFAR supports 4 types of evaluation activities: process, outcome, impact, economic. Full definitions of these evaluation types can be found in the Evaluation Standards of Pract ice (E soP), Version 3.1.2 (available on DATIM Support) . Further details on planning impact evaluations , in particular , along with other evaluations , are in the FY24 Technical Considerations Section 6.8 . EsoP 3.1.2 contains the 11 standards to which all PEP FAR evaluations must adhere to improve evaluation, planning, implementation, oversight, and quality across PEPFAR programs. The E soP responds to recommendations by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), as well as s tipulations within the congressional reauthorization and requirements established under the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act (FATAA) of 2016, to expand the utility of evaluation processes and data across PEPFAR programming for greater accoun tability and transparency. PEPFAR ensures compliance with FATAA through alignment of M&E activities with PEPFAR strategies and objectives. The M&E information is used to generate evidence that informs decisions related to program design while taking into consideration time and budget constraints. All PEPFAR -funded evaluation activities must be included in the COP23 SRE Tool with budgets. Teams should be prepared to justify the need for all proposed activities, with a greater emphasis on Impact Evaluations j ustification if any are proposed. 8.4 Commodities Supply Planning Tool The PEPFAR Commodities SPT is an Excel-based, interactive tool that is intended to provide insight into the commodity procurement plan for the total OU and to ensure that adequate commodity procurement is planned to meet program targets. This tool includes a gap analysis COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 164 of 220 tool, which identi fies any commodity areas that are underfunded or where planned procurements are not sufficient to meet targets. In COP23, the SPT will be required of all O us where PEPFAR procures a significant portion of the OU's total commodities (as determined by the S/ GAC chair ). PEPFAR coordinators should share this tool with their respective ministry of health and PEPFAR commodities planners. The SPT should be completed with visibility and information on all commodities, regardless of whether purchased or planned to b e purchased by PEPFAR (i.e., it needs to consider commodities sourced by the partner -country government, the Global Fund, or other entities). The SPT enables countries to project the next 27 or more months (dependent on data availability) of all HIV -related commodities procured for the country's HIV /AIDS epidemic response. The COP23 tool has been modified to extend the forecasting period to meet the new 2-year COP planning initiative, though year 2 in the SPT will be forecasted at a higher level and not require full data entry. The COP23 SPT will require countries to report current stock on - hand, planned shipments, and needed shipments for the following major commodity categories: ARVs, condoms and lubricant, laboratory products, rapid test kit, TB comm odities, and VMMC products. The tool will populate forecasted inventory through the projection of orders and consumption of these products regardless of procurement agent (PEPFAR, Global Fund, partner -country government, etc.) with a goal to avoid under - or overstocks of any product. The tool will also require countries to enter data regarding new commodities that will be introduced and used for HIV/AIDS, PrEP, and KP programs, such as: larger pack sizes for ARVs to promote multi -month dispensing, or new product introductions like cabotegravir. In COP23 , the tool will continue to allow for the auto -population of supply plan data and enable a country supply team to request the inclusion of additional commodities in the drop -down lists built into the tool i f they are not currently listed. Manual population is also available for countries that do not use pipeline. A user guide will also be available along with the tool on PEPFAR SharePoint. Members from USAID/ Supply Chain Health and S/GAC will be available to support countries in completing this tool. The SPT should be completed before completing the FAST commodit y tabs. Upon completion of the SPT, the information contained within the tool should be transferred to the FAST Commodities -P Tab, and then supplemental information should be provided in the FAST Commodities -E Tab. These documents should be aligned to avail able budget, planned targets for the OU, and strategic directions for the COP23 implementation period. Moreover, the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 165 of 220 visualizations produced by the SPT and the gap analysis should be included in COP commodity discussions to identify risks and ensu re that all stakeholders are aware of th e commodity risks. 8.5 Target Setting Tool PEPFAR MER indicator targets are set to measure impact, ensure accountability and transparency, and indicate programmatic intent with enough detail to establish mutual understanding of populations and geographies served and to ensure health equity. For COP23, we have done our best to streamline the former Data Pack Tool (now Target Setting Tool) and reduce the LOE, while maintaining impact, accountability, and transparency. Setting COP/ROP23 targets should be a collaborative process, with input from all agencies, technical working groups ( TWGs ), and stakeholders informed by the process laid out in Section 7. The Microsoft Excel Target Setting Tool is a template and analysis tool to assist OU teams in working together to fulfill the requirements for successful SNU - and IM -level target -setting in COP/ROP23 for FY24. For bilateral count ries, PEPFAR targets at the national level will also be specified by age/sex and KP targets for FY25. The Target Setting Tool will help reviewers understand how teams set their COP/ROP23 targets and minimize the need for extensive verbal or written clarifi cation around targets. For COP/ROP23 , the Target Setting Tool has been split into 2 files to reduce file size and improve ease of sharing and manipulation: 1 file with main tabs for developing targets by geography and population and 1 file to allocate targ ets to Ims. Please consult the Target Setting Tool User's Guide for detailed guidance on how to use the tool and an overview of how to link the target -setting and budgeting processes. The Target Setting Tool can be downloaded from each OU's PEPFAR SharePoint HQ Collaboration page. After successful COP/ROP approval, the Target Setting Tool is submitted into FACTS Info as a supplemental document 8.6 Resource Alignment RA is a collaboration among PEPFAR, the Global Fund , and UNAIDS that aims to provide a harmonized, routine, and detailed HIV financing landscape across all funding sources (i.e., PEPFAR, Global Fund, domestic government , and other funders) for a country's national HIV response. This initiative tracks HIV resources across all countries that currently have PEPFAR - COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 166 of 220 and Global Fund -funded programs and includes budgets, expenditures , and select epidemiolog ical and macro -economic data. This collaboration is not meant to replace existing HIV resource tracking efforts. Instead, it leverages existing processes to harmonize data and provide routine, timely , and granular data on HIV financing to program planners and decision - makers. This information is key to efforts of the PEPFAR, Global Fund, U NAIDS , and partner - country government teams to make strategically aligned resource allocation decisions , avoid duplication , drive efficiencies, improve cost analysis and resource need estimations , advance greater domestic leadership , and ensure a financially sustainable HIV response. HIV RA country profiles will be available to country teams to inform strategic planning, coordination, and alignment and enable the validation of information. Count ry teams should include HIV RA country profiles in their SDS Investment Profile section . On February 15 , 2023, each OU team will receive 2 files: (1) a pre -populated RA data verification template ( Excel format ) and ( 2) an RA Country Profile (PDF format ). The RA data verification template will be pre -populated only with \"Domestic Government\" and \"other Funders\" data. The RA Country Profile will include data from all sources of funding. OU teams should request that nat ional government counterparts verify/update ONLY the \"Domestic Government\" and \"Other Funders\" data in the excel template by March 8, 2023 . If these data are not available or there are no revisions, OU teams can simply respond \"there is no update/revisi on\" or \"data are not available to verify\" to SGAC_Sustainability@state.gov by March 8, 2023. If the RA data Excel template, verification process is completed by the de adline , OU teams will receive an updated RA Country Profile no later than March 17 , 2023 . Importantly, regardless of a n OU team 's ability to complete the verification process, each OU team will have access to their RA Country Profile, where they can readily obtain the HIV investment profile tables to insert into their COP/ROP23 SDS and other relevant documents. Note : OU teams will not need to verify or validate PEPFAR and Global Fund dat a in RA Country Profiles because the data will be retrieved from the donors' financial systems . 8.7 Implementing Mechanism Information Please refer to the FAST User Guide on PEPFAR SharePoint for details on IM entry in FACTS Info. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 167 of 220 As in COP22, new mechanisms were created for each implementing agency in each of the OUs. These placeholder mechanism IDs will be included in the prepopulated COP23 tools and OU teams will assign the new mechanisms to placeholders as needed. Placeholder IMs may be TBDs, or the mechanism name and partner may already be known. These placeholder mechanism IDs are to facilitate the automated imports into FACTS Info and DATIM. Mechanism details should be entered into FACTS Info for all placeholder IMs that have any budget (new or applied pipeline) and/or targets for COP23. If additional new mechanisms are needed beyond the allocated placeholders, they should first be created in FACTS Info , and a new mechanism ID should be created prior to an allocated budget or targets in the FAST or the Target Setting Tool, respectively. Upon the creation of a new mechanism in FACTS Info, the New Mechanism tick box wi ll be checked automatically. Placeholder MECH IDs can be used for TBDs in both FY24 and FY25. Please ensure that if adding a TBD for FY24 that also has anticipated activities in FY25 to use the same MECH ID for both FY24 and FY25 . Local Partners Local partners have an essential role in establishing sustainable and efficient HIV prevention and treatment programs. PEPFAR programs should substantially increase the role of local partners in direct service delivery and/or providing above -site or non -service delivery, site - level support. Maximizing Efficiencies/Reducing Costs To maximize efficiencies in administrative costs, countries should have no shared prime IPs with multiple agency agreements, including with partner governments. To avoid duplication in program implementation by partner, agency, program area , and geography, OU teams are not allowed to fund the same partners that are working in the same program area in the same facilities or geographic locale , regardless of whether the teams are currently funded by 1 agency or multiple ones . The following is allowed, however: o Differen t partners; same program area; same agency; different geographic locales o Different partners; same program area; different agency; different geographic locales o Different partners; different program area; different agency; same geographic locale o Partners wo rking in multiple geographic areas on technical assistance only COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 168 of 220 If an OU needs an exception to the scenarios listed above, the OU will be expected to submit a request for a waiver of this requirement to the S/GAC chair and PPM. Any waiver must be discusse d in the interagency space, submitted by the PEPFAR coordinator, and approval granted by S/GAC before the final COP approval. 8.7.1 Construction and Renovation If funding is requested during COP planning for a construction or renovation project, the count ry team must fill out the form on FACTS Info. Construction : Refers to projects that build new facilities or expand the footprint of an already existing facility (i.e., adding a new structure or expanding the outside walls). Renovation : Refers to projects that are intended to accommodate a change in use, square footage, technical capacity, and/or other infrastructure improvements to an existing facility. Significant renovation of properties not owned by the U.S. Government may be an ineffe ctive use of PEPFAR resources, and costs for such projects will be closely scrutinized. For instructions on data entry, please refer to \"How to Create and Edit a Construction Renovation Record\" in the Quick Reference Guides (in the menu at the top left of FACTS Info). All fields on the Construction/Renovation Project Plan form must be filled out. All projects, regardless of amount, need to be submitted for approval. Cross -cutting attributions for construction and renovation for each IM should match the tot al of all IM project plans. For laboratory construction or renovation projects, supplemental information is required on biosafety level (BSL) -3 and BSL -2 enhanced. This information must also be entered into the form on FACTS Info. 8.7.2 Motor Vehicles, In cluding All Transport Vehicles If funding is requested during COP planning for leasing or purchasing motor vehicles, the country team must fill out the form on FACTS Info in the Mechanisms tab. For instructions, please refer to \"How to Create and Edit a Motor Vehicle Record\" in the Quick Reference Guides (in the menu at the top left of FACTS Info). Any vehicles that are being funded out of the applied pipeline should be listed as zero -funded. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 169 of 220 8.7.3 Funding Sources / Accounts and Initiatives As noted elsewhere, please ensure that you are coordinating as a USG team in determining funding decisions and that all USG HIV/AIDS funding is being programmed as an interagency OU team . Please also ensure that your programming is consistent with your budget controls to ensure a smooth submission. New resources consist of funds that have not previously been transferred to a gencies. New resources may consist of funds appropriated in FY23 or prior fiscal years. OU teams will be provided with control levels for new resources, broken down by the year of appropriation. New resources may come with specific programmatic requirem ents, including the requirement that they be used for mandatory earmarks or other directives as indicated below, in the planning level letter, or as communicated by S/GAC. COP23 Funding Sources Funding sources and accounts for IM records by IM f or COP22 funding will be entered into FACTS Info and imported into the FAST. OU teams are encouraged to think about the new planned COP23 resources and available pipeline funding as a single funding envelope for the mechanism. A strong COP submission will reflect a strategic application of pipeline and allocation of new funds. For new COP23 funds, there are as many as 3 accounts \u2014Global Health Program State (GHP - State ), GHP -USAID, and Global AIDS P rogram (GAP )\u2014available to OU teams for programming. FACTS Info will be programmed with the available budgets for these 3 accounts. Not all OUs will have all accounts available to them . The GHP -USAID account is the account appropriated directly to USAID and is available for USAID activitie s only, not USAID/W orking Capital Fund (WCF) . The GAP account is applicable for HHS/CDC activities only. Note: Only GHP -State and GHP -USAID count toward the earmarks (Care and Treatment, OVC, GBV, and Water). Applied pipeline, GAP, and central fundin g will not count toward earmarks unless otherwise indicated. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 170 of 220 Applied Pipeline Resources: Applied Pipeline funding amounts are determined during the End of Fiscal Year (EOFY) process at the agency level. They consist of amounts programmed for implementatio n that will not be outlaid during the originally expected time period. OU teams must enter the amount of \" Applied Pipeline Funding ,\" that each mechanism will utilize in COP23 in addition to new resources. All \"Applied Pipeline Funding\" may only be used to the extent consistent with applicable legal restrictions and procedures on the fiscal year funds at issue, including any relevant or required Congressional Notifications. This applied pipeline data will reflect the amount of PEPFAR pipeline funding, fro m all years, that will be applied to the mechanism for COP23 implementation. The FAST will auto -sum the applied pipeline with the new COP23 funding requested, by funding account, to indicate the total funding (new + applied pipeline) allocated to each mech anism. Centrally Funded Initiatives All funding that is programmed to be outlaid during the period of COP implementation will be entered in FACTS Info from an import of the FAST. This includes bilateral COP23 funding, funding from the WCF (for commodity procurement), and funding for any centrally funded initiatives. Capturing centrally funded initiatives in the FAST and FACTS Info will increase the visibility of the totality of PEPFAR investment across IPs. The information required for a centrally funded initiative, or the WCF, is the same as for the main, bilaterally funded initiative (i.e., funding source allocation, intervention allocations, cross -cutting allocations, and construction and renovation and motor vehicles, as applicable). Note: The FAST allows for budget to be entered for any initiatives currently opened for planning and with planned funding for the COP23 implementation period. The initiatives and benchmarks that are planned for COP23 may vary by OU and will be indicated in the planning levels. OUs may not plan funding to an initiative/benchmark not indicated for that OU. Other Budget Technical Requirements State International Cooperative Administrative Suppo rt Services (ICASS ) and limited noncareer appointment ( LNA) costs may only be drawn from new GHP -State funding, not Applied Pipeline . State funding for ICASS and LNA should be designated to \"State,\" not regional bureaus (State/AF, etc.). State ICASS amount s should be an exact match to the amount indicated in the PLL. LNA amounts should be broken out into 3 cost types: State LNA Staff Salaries and COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 171 of 220 Benefits, State LNA Start -up/Recurring Costs, State LNA Other Miscellaneous Benefits. 8.7.4 Government -to-Gover nment Partnerships PEPFAR remains committed to supporting countries to sustain control of their HIV /AIDS epidemics. Government -to-Government (G2G) partnerships are critical to advance the long - term success and sustainable implementation of comprehensive national HIV programs in the public sector in countries. As such, G2G partnerships with a number of ministries --including health, finance, education, social welfare, youth and sports, and gender \u2014are critical to ensure comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment programming ( e.g., treatment, OVC, DREAMS, etc.) is strengthened within the public sector to ensure its sustainability into the future. Direct G2G assistance includes \"Funding which is provided to a partner -country government ministry or agency (including parastatal organizations and public health institutions) for the expenditure and disbursement of those funds by that government entity.\" Direct G2G assistance can provide opportunities to improve coordination of PEPFAR programs with the national response, and it can also strengthen technical, management, and financial systems in the long term for sustained epidemic control. It can also pose unique challenges and risks that must be considered in the COP planning process \u2014especially , in cases of instability or conflict or cases that may involve human rights concerns. USAID's G2G Risk Management and Implementation Guide , which applies to USAID agreements, provides a good starting point when identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and threats that teams should consult as such direct G2G assistance is considered .74 Other agencies should review their own internal guidance for the formal G2G requirements applicable to their agency. Pending the completion of the COP planning process, agencies with approved funding for G2G assistance mechanisms will provide S/GAC with the information necessary to notify funds for G2G assistance programming , including amounts and recipients of such funds. 74 United States Agency for International Development. G2G Risk Management and Implementation Guide . 2021. 220sar_011321. Accessed 29, 2022. https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/220sar.pdf COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 172 of 220 The U.S. Department of State cable released September 5, 2012 , by Secretary Clinton and Ambassador Goosby (MRN 12 STATE 90475) continues to be relevant and serves as the guidance document to be followed when establishing and executing new G2G awards in COP23 . The cable is posted on the COP23 section of the PEPFAR SharePoint site. We continue to encoura ge all agencies to enter into and utilize agreements with ministries, as appropriate, and to expand and strengthen agreements with Ministries of Social Welfare, Women and Girls, Youth and Sports as well as Gender. 8.7.5 Public -Private Partnerships PEPFAR defines a PPP as a collaborative endeavor that coordinates technical expertise and contributions from the public sector \u2014with expertise, skill sets, and contributions from the private sector \u2014to achieve global targets . Global: Global PP Ps are initiated and managed at the central ( HQ) level. They may be funded on the USG side by central funds, although they can also be funded through country funds. These PPPs typically span multiple countries with multiple partners and overall coordinatio n and strategy are set at the central ( HQ) level. Country -Based: Country -based PPPs are initiated and managed at the country level. They are funded on the USG side by the OU teams through the COP process. Countries are responsible for reporting on thes e programs in the COP and during regular reporting cycles. A PPP can be a program by itself, but it may also be added to an existing program or can be designed as part of a larger program to fill gaps as necessary. Beyond the development and launch of a partnership, it is essential to systematically document and provide timely information updates across all PPPs within the OUs portfolio. When reporting information , please attempt to submit as much information as possible \u2014even if the information is incomplet e. For any of the above types of PPPs that involve the State Department, S/GAC must be consulted to ensure appropriate State Department approval. This includes conducting due diligence on prospective partners before an OU team forms or joins a partnership. For general information on U.S. Department of State policies regardin g PPPs, see 2 FAM 970. Other implementing agencies should also consult internally to ensure respective requirements are followed. As other interagency partners on the country team often work with the private sector, COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 173 of 220 OUs should also meet with country Eco nomic, Public Diplomacy, and Foreign Commercial Service Officers to find opportunities to expand and further leverage these partnerships to achieve PEPFAR goals. OU teams should consider opportunities to leverage private sector expertise in topic areas such as supply chain, strategic marketing, market segmentation, communications, economic empowerment, digital health, and data analytics, among others, when exploring how th e private sector can help increase the impact and efficiency of PEPFAR country programs. Private Partnership Toolkit To help improve process development and knowledge management for PPPs, a Community of Practice Toolkit has been developed to identify, c reate, and strengthen PPPs. It is important to remember that sharing best practices is an integral component of driving quality of partnerships within PEPFAR. We encourage OU teams to use the Public -Private Partnership Toolkit that S/GAC developed to assist PPP practitioners with engaging with the private sector, idea generation, formalization, management, and reporting of PPPs. The PPP toolkit, in coordination with targeted technical assistance, can support OU teams as they work through the various stages of PPP development process within their portfolios. For all PPPs that involve the State Department, S/GAC must be consulted to ensure appropriate State Department approval. Please contact the PSE team, as well as the State Department COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 174 of 220 Office of Global Partnerships for additional information.75 Please see Table 4 for information on the Community of Practice Toolkit.

Interagency PPP Funding Opportunities Guide (Intentionally Blank) In addition to the Community of Practice Toolkit, the following key steps are recommended for developing PPPs and fostering meaningful priv ate sector stakeholder engagement: 75 Office of Global Partnerships - United States Department of State. U.S. Department of 2022. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 175 of 220 Step 1 -Situational Gap Analysis: Use HQST processes and quarterly program review data to identify key programmatic and technical gaps that are ripe for partnership. Leverage data analytics platforms such as DATIM and Pan orama to conduct analyses that assess performance (especially against targets) to identify the greatest gaps/needs/priorities within country programs. Step 2 -Private Sector Landscape Assessment: Conduct or review existing local and regional private stakeholder landscape analysis/assessment of companies and foundations likely to strategically align wit h the gaps identified. Assess key areas such as geographic priorities, technical priorities, busi ness interests, and ease of outreach (i.e., are there existing relationships to leverage?); categorize private sector partners into tiers in terms of alignment with country program priorities. (See Illustrative AGYW Landscape Analysis ). Step 3 -Approach an d Convene: Approach private sector with the partnership opportunity and host convenings involving public, private, philanthropic, multilateral, civil society, and affected populations to advance partnership dialog. Ensure the most suitable/appropriate POCs are chosen to engage (i.e., if the program needs strategic marketing expertise, ensure marketing contacts at private sector organizations are engaged). (See Sample PSE Meeting ). Preparation Guide. Step 4 -Conceptualize and Plan: Ensure dialogue occurs with a clear vision/goal of what PEPFAR is hoping to accomplish through the partnership and what value the private sector can add. In addition, be sure to articulate the benefits of engaging to the private sector (i.e., what's in it for them?). Develop a \"pitch deck\" that articulates these benefits of partnership with PEPFAR (See Illustrative Pitch Deck ). Step 5 -Alignment and Formalization: Identify partnership goals and common objectives as the basis for a n MOU. Each partner should outline their respective roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability. This includes in -kind and/or financial commitments. It is also important to determine and articulate an appropriate governance structure to ensure accountability, improve decisi on-making, and achieve stated goals and objectives. This structure may be in the form of an Advisory Council, Steering Committee, or independent entity and should be clear on decision -making processes and authorities. All elements should be clearly articul ated in the COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 176 of 220 MOU, although other formalization tools may also be used such as a n LOI (See MOU & LOI template ). Step 6 -Approval: SS/GAC should be consulted on all such proposed PPPs (including any proposed MOUs and due diligence requests of prospective partners) involving the Department of State to ensure appropriate State Department approval. Step 7 -Launch: Announce partnership through a press release and/or public signing to generate greater interest. Enhance the announcement through social -media engagement. Step 8 -Implementation: Operationalize the partnership, generally through program implementation. Partnership oversight may incl ude a committee comprised of partner representatives to discuss ongoing partnership operations and management issues. This committee will convene quarterly or biannually to discuss reporting progress and to coordinate and strategize on partnership implemen tation. Note, this committee may be the same as or different than the aforementioned governance structure . Step 9 -Reporting: It is essential to identify key performance metrics \u2014using MER indicators, if possible \u2014to accurately track the results of the part nership activities against the goals of the PPP and systematically document and provide timely updates across all PPPs within the OU 's portfolio through the COP and other reporting cycles. Various data analytics platforms , including DATIM and Panorama, can be used to measure progress (See Illustrative PPP M&E Tool ). SECTION 9: COP PLANNING LEVELS AND APPLIED PIPELINE 9.1 COP23 Planning Countries or regions should fund their program based on the COP23 planning level letter, finalizing the notional S/GAC -provided budget level of final budgets and earmark requirements. COP23 should be planned to the stated level in the letter, which equals the sum of new COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 177 of 220 resources (FY23 and prior fiscal year funds) and prior year available pipeline applied in support of COP23 activities. The pipeline available for implementation in COP23 has been provided and validated by each of your agencies. PEPFAR will continue to meet previously stipulated congressional earmarks and fulfill the expectations around other key prior ity areas. S/GAC continues to communicate with Congress about their expectations and will make teams aware of any shifts for programmatic focus. Earmarks for care and treatment and OVC as well as the GBV and Water directives can only be satisfied via the programming of new resources ; the amounts will be provided in the official planning letter. Other budgetary control considerations can be satisfied through a combination of new and/or applied pipeline and will be stipulated in the official planning letter. 9.1.1 COP Planning Levels The COP23 planning level represents the total resources (regardless of whether they are new resources or prior -year pipeline resources) that a country or region plans to outlay during the 12-month COP23 implementation period in FY24 for COP23 activities. The COP planning level is the sum of new resources and pipeline applied to COP23 implementation (COP Planning Level = New Funding + Total Applied Pipeline). All outlays anticipated to occur during the COP23 implementation perio d for COP23 activities must be included within the COP23 planning level. This includes outlays for all mechanisms: new, continuing, and closing. The COP23 planning level does not include planned outlays from ULOs for activities conducted and services provi ded in prior COP periods. Agencies are allowed to outlay, without an OPU on top of the COP23 envelope from ULOs from prior COPs for services that have previously been provided, but for which all payments have not yet been reconciled. Agencies must ensure t hat any outlays on top of the COP23 envelope are for services provided in previous COP years and are not an addition to COP23 activities. Any additions to the COP23 envelope must go through the normal OPU process. Applied pipeline and new funding levels i ncluded within the planning level letter will be reflected in the FACTS Info system as each OU's budget control figures. A COP cannot be submitted if the total new and pipeline funds programmed are not equal to the budget control figures. Any COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 178 of 220 changes to ne w funding or applied pipeline amounts must be requested by an S/GAC chair or PPM, approved by S/GAC M&B in consultation with agencies and the GAC, and updated in the FACTS Info system. COP submission in FACTS Info is not possible unless these updates are made at S/GAC. OU teams must track quarterly and annual outlays by fiscal years and funding accounts to ensure PEPFAR funds are appropriately tracked and not overspent. If partners underperform and outlay all of their funds, performance of that partner should be scrutini zed to ensure that the outlays are explainable and justified given the specific context of the country and partner. The funding type field within COP23 is categorized as applied pipeline or new funding. The new funding account categories are GHP -State, GHP -USAID, and GAP. The sum of these funding sources will equal the total resources expected to be outlaid by an individual mechanism (or CODB category) during the 12 -month COP23 implementation period for COP23 activities. When all mechanism funding sources a nd all M&O funding sources are added together, this total is equal to the requested outlay level for COP23 (i.e., to the COP23 planning level). Applied pipeline will be tracked in both the FAST and FACTS Info at the IM, initiative, and intervention level. 9.1.2 Applied Pipeline The EOFY tool provides critical input into the determination of applied pipeline for future planning cycles. Pipeline resources deemed \"excess pipeline\" during the EOFY process will be reflected as applied pipeline and available for implementation within COP23 to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulations. The applied pipeline should include any prior year COP funding that will continue to be implemented and expended during the COP22 cycle (i.e., construction funding programmed in a previous year that continues to outlay during COP23), as well as the application of prior year funding deemed in \"excess\" as further explained below . All agencies within all countries or regions must monitor, analyze, and manage their pipel ine throughout the year and ensure that its use is consistent with applicable law and regulations. Every PEPFAR OU program is allowed a certain amount of buffer pipeline to ensure there is no disruption to services due to possible funding delays or other unanticipated issues. Three months' worth of outlays are considered an acceptable amount of buffer pipeline for all PEPFAR COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 179 of 220 OUs, except the 3 Regional Programs: Asia Regional Program, West Africa Regional Program , and Western Hemisphere Regional Program. Th e Regional Programs may maintain 4 months of outlays as buffer pipeline. Additionally, agencies are able to designate some funding as \"Untouchable ULOs\" (the untouchable pipeline consists of ULOs for goods or services rendered prior to the start of the COP period being planned ). Pipeline above the acceptable level of buffer and approved \"untouchable ULO\" amount is considered \"excess\" and will be applied to the following COP. OUs will not receive additional funding if on -hand resources fall short of the all owable pipeline. Funding for Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) and Peace Corps Response Volunteers (PCRVs) must cover the full period of their service, including approved extensions. Thus, Peace Corps programs in countries with PEPFAR -funded volunteers must retain resources fo r costs outside of the current COP year in the pipeline. Any pipeline in excess of these costs outside of the COP year will be made available to apply in pipeline to the future COP. Note: Agencies should generally follow a \"first -in, first -out\" approach to budget execution, requiring the full utilization of expiring funds and older funds before any new FY23 funds are obligated and expended. For the purposes of implementing this approach thi s should be based on when the resources were originally appropriated, rather than when they expire (i.e., x -year resources should be spent first). Due to this budget execution approach, the actual fiscal year of funds that are outlaid in support of an appr oved COP23 activity may not match the approved COP23 applied/new funding breakdown. Agencies should carefully budget and program to ensure IPs only receive needed funds and there are minimal or no funds remaining in expiring grants and cooperative agreemen ts. Agencies should also carefully ensure that their execution of resources under this approach does not result in a net decrease to any mandatory earmark levels. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 180 of 220 SECTION 10: U.S. GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS (M&O) Beginning with COP23, agenc ies should budget for CODB based on the amount of obligations required to support CODB needs in FY24. S/GAC will no longer assess CODB based on outlays within a fiscal year . 10.1 Interagency M&O As with prior years, all staff fully or partially funded by PEPFAR should be included as individual entries. Non -PEPFAR -funded staff who work more than 30% on PEPFAR activities should also be included as individual entries. In COP23, interagency M&O requirements include a short narrative in the SDS to su mmarize the team's staffing and organizational analysis and an itemized list of the personnel implementing the OU program in FACTS Info. Proposed CODB funding levels are captured in the FAST. COP23 M&O Submission List: M&O narrative in the SDS Staffing da ta in FACTS Info Up-to-date functional staff chart uploaded to FACTS Info Document Librar y Agency management charts (1 per agency) uploaded to FACTS Info Document Library 10.1.1 PEPFAR Staffing Footprint and Organizational Structure Analysis, Expectations, and Recommendations The focus of the staffing and organizational structure review should be how PEPFAR staff are organized and funded to meet key tasks and core functions and deliver results, aligned to the PEPFAR strategy and sustaining the HIV response. While OU footprints should follow rightsizing and good position management principles, the emphasis is not simply on the number of staff or vacancies vis -\u00e0-vis the overall footprint. The focus should be on ensuring a balance of staff across interagency business process and coordination demands, agency partner COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 181 of 220 management and accountability, and external engagement (and across countries, for regional and country -pair programs). Further, the expectation is that staff fully or partially funded by PEPFAR are available and assigned to meet key interagency and intra -agency tasks throughout various PEPFAR business cycles (e.g., COP, quarterly reporting , and quarterly program reviews ). First, teams should consider the core competencies and functions needed to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat and sustainably strengthen public health systems. A first step will be to outline various PEPFAR -required (interagency and intra -agency) and a gency -required (intra - agency) processes (e.g., COP, quarterly reporting, quarterly program reviews) and then use staffing data to measure and ensure coverage of tasks and functions. The L OE Workload Management Indicators were introduced in 2017 to facilita te teams' assessments. Organizational structures may need to be shifted; for example, new teams may have to be created to manage each step of the COP process , or TWGs may need to be collapsed to streamline processes . OUs should consider how to de -duplicate current activities across the team to maximize efficiency. How will the OU team handle key tasks during the year? Who is the lead? Who are the alternates and/or team members? Second, the OU should analyze the staffing data and review the staffing fo otprint to determine whether there is alignment with the core competencies and functions. What do the data tell you about how the OU is managing the program and essential tasks? Are there skills for which training is needed or new/revised positions require d? Is there a need to repurpose or update existing positions (whether filled or vacant) to meet key competencies and accomplish tasks? If space is available, is there a need for new positions? In lieu of new positions, is there a plan to bring in temporary duty assignment, intermittent, or temporary hire assistance at certain times of the year? Teams should consider the trajectory, including funding, of the program in reviewing the staffing footprint and organizational strategy. Best Practices For COP23, t eams should consider the following best practices: Consult with embassy and agency management support offices for help finding balance across the OU footprint. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 182 of 220 Create or update the interagency charter, standard operating procedures (SOPs) , and/or manual to codify decisions made around core tasks and assignment of individuals and groups. As examples, OUs could consider including: SOPs for each working group or task team Principles for scheduling and capturing minutes / action items from regular and ad hoc meetings General communication principles , including how and when information is shared and SOPs for email direct/copied recipients Review of all PEPFAR -related position descriptions (vacant and encumbered) to ensure they are updated and aligned to the latest PEPFAR strategy Itemized training or other skill development needed across the team to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat and sustainably strengthening health systems and create a training schedule in partnership with S/GAC and agency HQ Identified positions that would benefit from a Framework Job Description (FJD ) or standardized position description for mid - and senior -level common positions that can be used by any agency or OU . (See the PEPFAR SharePoint site for currently available FJDs t hat can be used as is or as guides ). OUs should identify any additional HQ assistance requir ed to facilitate a staffing or organizational analysis, implement organizational changes, or provide training. This should include considering how the HQ SMEs may be leveraged to assist with programmatic challenges. 10.1.2 Strategic Direction Summary Requirement The SDS M&O narrative will: Summarize the staffing and interagency organizational structure analysis conducted for COP23. Please address the following key questions in the narrative: 1. What changes did the team make to its USG staffing footprint and interagency organizational structure to maximize effectiveness and efficiency to achieve program pivots? How was the baseline L OE of current staff assessed to determine changes in staffing needs? COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 183 of 220 2. How has the team ensured balance between interagency business process coverage and intra -agency partner management and technical roles? 3. How will staff be utilized to meet QA requirements through SIMS or oth er QA methods? 4. What additional action does the team want to take that has a timeline beyond COP23 submission? 5. Were missing skill sets or competencies identified? What steps are being taken to fill these (e.g., training, repurposing vacancies/encumbered positions)? 6. Did the team alter existing, unfilled positions to better align with COP23 priorities? Explain vaca nt positions, summarizing the steps being taken to fill positions that have been vacant for more than 6 months and actions that have been taken to alter the scope of the position to balance interagency and intra -agency needs. For each approved but vacant (as of March 1, 2023) position, the narrative should describe the reason(s) it is vacant and the plan and timeline for filling the vacant position. Vacant position narratives should be no more than 500 characters. The narrative should also be entered dir ectly into the Comments field within the staffing section of FACTS Info. There should be a single explanation for each staffing record marked as vacant. If the position has been previously encumbered, please provide the date that the position became vacant and whether the position has been recruited yet. If recruitment has occurred but the team has been unable to fill it, please indicate why (e.g., lack of candidates, salary too low, and hiring freeze). Submitting this information will help identify progr am-wide recruitment and retention issues and skill and knowledge gaps. Justify Proposed New Positions The SDS narrative should summarize the interagency analysis and decision -making that culminated in the agreement to request funding for a new position, i ncluding whether space for the position has been validated with the embassy management officer and COM . Teams should provide justification for the proposal of new positions rather than repurposing existing filled or vacant positions. For direct -hire or per sonal services contractor (PSC) positions that the team COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 184 of 220 plans to fill with a U.S. citizen, indicate why this position cannot be hired locally. In addition, teams are encouraged to use term -limited appointments versus permanent mechanisms. In the Comments field within the staffing section of the FACTS Info PEPFAR module, OUs must describe how each proposed new position fits into the interagency and individual agency staffing footprints (e.g., meets changes in the program, addresses gaps, and complements the existing staff composition). New position narratives should be no more than 500 characters. All proposed positions not previously approved in a COP should be marked as planned in the staffing data. In the COP23 review process, all proposed new positions will be rigorously evaluated for relevance to new business process needs and alignment with programmatic priorities. Because the approval threshold for new positions will be high, wherever possible, teams are advised to repurpose existing vacancies to fil l new staffing priorities --particularly long -standing vacancies (i.e., those vacant for 2 or more COP cycles). Note that any proposed new positions should spend at least 50% of their time on PEPFAR activities. Explain Major Changes to CODB The SDS M&O narrative should summarize any factors that may increase or decrease CODB in COP23. Outline any major scopes of work for which agency SME assistance is requested during COP23 implementation. 10.2 Staffing and Leve l-of-Effort Data OU teams must update their staffing data within the FACTS Info (pre -populated with COP22 staffing data). 10.2.1 Who to Include in the Database 1. All PEPFAR -funded staff must be included in the staffing data. This means all fully or partially PEPFAR -funded filled positions (currently onboard), vacant positions, and proposed positions, regardless of PEPFAR account (i.e., GHP, GAP, or another account). This includes positions working on PEPFAR planning, management, COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 185 of 220 procurement, administra tive support, technical, and/or programmatic oversight activities, as well as any non -PEPFAR -funded current, vacant, and proposed positions that: a. are involved in decision -making for PEPFAR planning, management, procurement, and/or programmatic oversight ac tivities ; or b. will spend at least 30% of their time working on PEPFAR planning, management, procurement, administrative support, technical, and/or programmatic oversight activities. Hiring mechanisms include: USG direct hire (USDH) (e.g., Department of State Foreign Service Officers, CDC appointed staff, military, and public health commissioned corps) Internationally recruited PSC (including Department of State Limited Non -Career Appointment) Personal services agr eements (PSAs) (includes locally recruited Eligible Family Members and Foreign Nationals) Locally employed (L E) staff, including locally hired PSC or PSA host country nationals, U.S. citizens, and third -country nationals (TCNs) Internationally recruited TCNs Non-personal services contractors (also known as commercial, third party, or institutional contractors) Fellows Other employment mechanisms (for which there should be very few entries) The above criteria also include any non -PSC/institutional contra ctor employed by an outside organization (e.g., CAMRIS International , Global Health Technical Assistance Mission Support , and International Technical, Operational, and Professional Support ) who provides full -time, permanent support to operations an d works alongside federal employees . Please do not include temporary or short -term staff ; however, if the position slot is permanent and the incumbent rotates, please include the position and state \"rotating\" in the last and first name fields. The costs of these staff should be captured in the Institutional Contractor CODB field. Temporary or seasonal hires should not be included but should be considered in overall footprints/organizational structures. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 186 of 220 PCVs should not be included in the staffing data as they are not USG employees ; however, Peace Corps staff should be included. HQ agencies should review the submission to ensure that positions are marked as non - PEPFAR funded where appropriate to avoid skewing staffing analyses. If a mission picks up a position, it can then be marked as either partially or fully PEPFAR -funded. 10.2.2 Staffing Data Field Instructions and Definitions Country teams should update the staff details on FACTS Info, pre -populated f rom COP22. Complete and correct staffing data is needed for successful COP23 submission. 10.2.3 Attribution of Staffing -Related CODB to Technical Areas Each position's entry should reflect the amount of time spent on PEPFAR and whether the position is par tially or fully PEPFAR -funded or non -PEPFAR -funded. The costs for all positions should be reflected in the USG salaries and benefits CODB categories. There are separate CODB salary and benefit categories for: Internationally recruited staff (e.g., USG direct hire, U.S. PSC, and TCNs) Locally recruited staff (e.g., host -country national PSA staff, locally hired Americans , and TCNs) Department of State direct hires ( foreign service officer and LNA) Salary costs for institutional contractors should be entered in the appropriate CODB category for non-PSC/PSAs. In the FAST, OU teams should enter the top -line budget amount for each CODB category by fund account for USG Staff Salaries and Benefits and Staff Program Travel (see CODB guidance below). For fully or partially PEPFAR -funded positions, calculated full -time positions are aggregated for each agency , and a portion of the agency's top -line CODB budget will be attributed to relevant program areas and beneficiaries as well as the M&O funding amounts. For institutional contractors, OU teams should enter the planned funding amount, by fund account, for the appropriate technical areas (i.e., the area(s) for which institutional contractors are providing personnel support on behalf of the U.S. Government ). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 187 of 220 For Peace Corps staff in COP23, teams should attribute all PEPFAR -funded staff positions to the appropriate intervention in management and operations . 10.3 OU Functional and Agency Management Charts OU teams are required to submit charts reflecting their functional and management structures . The functional staff chart and the interagency management charts should be uploaded in FACTS Info. The interagency chart should reflect the leadership and decision -making structures for the OU. It should also include permanent working groups or task tea ms involved in interagency program management and oversight and/or external engagement. Only include leadership positions and TWG titles; do not include names. Teams should review their staffing footprint and organizational structures and update their char ts to reflect any organizational changes. Along with the functional staff chart, OU teams should submit copies of each agency's existing organizational chart that demonstrates the reporting structure within the agency. Please highlight the management p ositions within the agency organizations. One chart per OU should be uploaded for each USG agency. The functional staffing and agency management charts are not intended to replace or duplicate existing agency organizational charts that depict formal repor ting relationships or existing administrative relationships between staff within agencies. 10.4 Cost of Doing Business USG CODB includes all costs inherent in having the USG footprint in country (i.e., the cost to have personnel in -country providing technical assistance and collaboration, management oversight, administrative support, and other program support to implement PEPFAR and to meet PEPFAR goals). Multiple factors ma y drive changes in CODB, including global U.S. Department of State increases in capital security cost sharing (CSCS), ICASS costs, and LE staff pay increases or COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 188 of 220 separation pay (when applicable). In addition, as PEPFAR business processes evolve, teams must ensure that they are staffed and supported to successfully implement SIMS, quarterly program reviews, and enhanced routine program planning with civil society, governments, and the Global Fund. As in previous years, the CODB should be manually entered int o the FAST. 10.4.1 C ODB Categories By capturing all CODB funding information, data are organized into a single location, allowing for clear itemization and analysis of individual costs. In addition to providing greater detail to review teams and parity in the data requirements for management costs, the data provide greater transparency to Congress, OMB, and other stakeholders on each USG agency's costs for managing and implementing the PEPFAR program. Non-ICASS Administrative Costs: Please provide a detai led cost breakout of the items included in this category and their associated planned funding (e.g., $1,000 for printing or supplies). Non-ICASS Motor Vehicles: If a vehicle is necessary for the implementation of the PEPFAR program (not for IMs) and will be used solely for th is purpose, the purchase or lease information needs to be justified and the dollar amount specified. USG Renovation: Describe and justify the requested project. Significant renovation of properties not owned by the U.S. Government may be an ineffective use of PEPFAR resources, and costs for such projects will be closely scrutinized. The description should be no more than 1,000 characters and include the following details: The number of USG PEPFAR personnel that will occupy the facility, the purpose for which the personnel will use the facility, and the duration of time the personnel are expected to occupy the facility. A description of the renovation project and breakout of associated costs . Include a description of why alternatives --facilities that could be leased and occupied without renovation --are unavailable or inadequate to meet personnel needs. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 189 of 220 The mechanism for carrying out the renovation project (e.g., Regional Procurement Support O ffice). The owner of the property. The USG agency that will implement the project and to which the funds should be programmed upon approval. If the project will be implemented by the Department of State through the Regional Procurement Support Office, the funding agency should be the Department of State Bureau (e.g., State/AF). Institutional Contractors: Describe the institutional contractor (IC) activities and why these activities will be conducted by an IC rather than a U.S. direct hire or PSC/PSA. Where possible, please provide the contracting company name and the technical area(s) that the IC(s) will support. Once you have completed the steps for one agency, please repeat for all other agencies working in country. There are eleven USG CODB categories. The following list of CODB categories provides definitions and supporting guidance: USG Staff Salaries and Benefits: The required costs of having a person in country, including housing costs not covered by ICASS, rest and relaxation (R&R ) travel, relocation travel, home leave, and shipping household goods. This category includes the costs associated with technical, administrative, and other staff. PEPFAR program funds should be used to support the percentage of a staff person's salary an d benefits associated with the percentage of time they work on PEPFAR. The direct costs of PEPFAR, specifically the costs of staff time spent on PEPFAR, need to be paid for by PEPFAR funding (e.g., GHP -State and GAP). For example, if a staff person works 7 0% on PEPFAR activities , PEPFAR program funds should fund 70% of that person's salary and benefits. If the percentage worked on PEPFAR activities is 10%, then PEPFAR funds should fund 10% of the person's salary and benefits. For agencies that cannot split -fund staff with their agency appropriations (such as USAID's Operating Expense funds), multiple staff may be combined to form 1 full-time equivalent ( FTE), COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 190 of 220 and 1 of the staff's full salary and benefits will be funded by PEPFAR. For example, if 2 staff each work 50% on PEPFAR activities , PEPFAR funds should be used to fund the salary and benefits of 1 of the positions. If 3 staff each work a third of their time on PEPFAR activities (33% + 33% + 33%), PEPFAR funds should be used to fund the salary and benefi ts of 1 of the positions. If multiple staff work on PEPFAR activities but not equally (such as 10% + 20% + 70% or 25% + 75%), the full salary and benefits of the person who works the most on PEPFAR (in the examples, either 70% or 75% ) should be PEPFAR funded. Staffing data should reflect this split. If the agency is paying for partner -country citizen fellowships and is going to only train the fellows, then the funding can remain in an IM. If the agency will receive a work product from the fellows, then this cost should be counted in M&O. Similarly, if agencies are paying for trainers who are USG staff, then the costs associated with these staff should be reflected within M&O. If the mechanism is paying for the materials and costs of hosting training, then the funding should be reflected in an IM. There are 2 categories of salaries and benefits : Internationally recruited staff Locally recruited staff Staff Program Support Travel: The discretionary costs of staff travel to support PEPFAR implementation and management, except for required relocation and R&R travel, which are included above in USG salaries and benefits. This includes the associated costs for technical assistance provided by non -PEPFAR -funded staff. Other technical assistance funding (e.g., materials) should be reflected in an IM. Teams should include SIMS -related travel costs in this category. Refer to the OU's list of sites prioritized for SIMS assessments and ensure that the following costs are properly captured: driver travel, driver overtime, gas, lodging, and meals and incidental expenses (General Services Administration rate ). As in COP22, in COP23, technical assistance -related travel costs of HHS/CDC HQ staff for trips of less than 3 weeks will be included in the PEPFAR HOP and funded centrally. Under this COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 191 of 220 model, costs for short -duration technical assistance travel by HHS/C DC staff should not be included in COPs. International Cooperative Administrative Support Services (ICASS ): ICASS is the system used in embassies to provide shared common administrative support services and equitably distribute the cost of services to agencies. ICASS charges represent the cost to supply common administrative services such as human resources, financial management, general services, and other support, supplies, equipment, and vehicles. It is generally a required cost for all agencies operating in country. Each year, customer agencies and the service providers present in country, then update and sign the ICASS service contract. The service contract reflects the projected workload burden of the customer agency on the service provision for the upcoming fiscal year. The workload assessment is generally done in April of each year. PEPFAR teams should ensure that every agency's workload includes all approved PEPFAR positions. ICASS services are comprised of required cost centers and optional cost centers. Each agency must sign up for the required cost centers and has the option to sign up for any of the optional cost centers. More information is available at https://fam.state.gov/Fam/FAM.aspx?ID=06FAH05 . ICASS charges must be planned and funded within the COP/ROP budget ; however, ICASS costs are typically paid by the agency from the budgeted funding on behalf of the team . Eac h implementing agency, including the Department of State, should request funding for PEPFAR - related ICASS costs within its M&O budget. It is important to coordinate this budget request with the embassy financial management officer, who can estimate FY23 a nticipated ICASS costs for agencies. S/GAC will provide ICASS costs for State. It is important to request all funding for State ICASS costs in the original COP submission, as it is difficult to shift funds at a later date. State ICASS costs are paid durin g FY24 with new COP23 funding, not applied pipeline. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 192 of 220 The Peace Corps subscribes to minimal ICASS services at post. Most general services and all financial management work (except Financial Services Center disbursing) are carried out by Peace Corps staff. To capture the associated expenses, Peace Corps will capture these costs within the indirect cost rate. Non-ICASS Administrative Costs: These are the direct charges to agencies for agency - specific items and services that are easy to price, mutually agreed to, and outside of the ICASS MOU for services. Such costs include rent/leases of USG -occupied office space, vehicles, shipping, printing, telephone, driver overtime, security, supplies, and mission -levied head taxes. In addition to completing the Budget Data field, teams are expected to explain the costs that compose the non-ICASS administrative costs request, including a dollar amount breakout by each cost category (e.g., $1,000 for printing or supplies) in the Item Description field. Non-ICASS Motor Vehicles: If a vehicle is necessary to the implementation of the PEPFAR program (not for IMs) and will be used solely for that purpose, purchase or lease information needs to be justified. For new requests in FY23, please explain the purpose of each vehicle(s) and associated cost(s) in the Item Description field. It is also a requirement that the total number of vehicles purchased and/or leased under Non -ICASS (motor vehicles) costs to date (cumulative through COP21) are provided in this category. Tea ms should include new vehicle requests related to the completion of SIMS requirements in this category. CSCS (Capital Security Cost Sharing): Agencies other than the State Department should include funding for CSCS, except where this is paid by the agency (e.g., USAID). The CSCS program requires all agencies with personnel overseas subject to COM authority to provide funding in advance for their share of the cost of providing new, safe, secure diplomatic facilities : (1) on the basis of the total overseas presence of each agency ; and ( 2) as determined annually by the Secretary of State in consultation with such agency. The State Department uses a portion of the CSCS amount for the Major Rehabilitation Program (MRP). COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 193 of 220 It provides steady funding annually for multiple years to fund 150 secure new embassy compounds in the Capital Security Construction Program. More information is available at http://www.state.gov/obo/c30683.htm . Teams should consult with the agency for the appropriate amount to budget in the COP/ROP. http://www.state.gov/obo/c30683.htm Computers/IT Services: Funding attributed to this category includes USAID's information resources management (IRM) tax and other agency computer fees not included in ICASS payments. If IT support is calculated as a head tax by agencies, the calculation should transparently refl ect the number of FTEs multiplied by the amount of the head tax. CDC should include the IT support (ITSO) charges on HIV program -funded positions; these costs will be calculated at CDC and communicated to teams for inclusion in the CODB. USAID should inc lude the IRM tax on HIV program -funded positions. Planning Meetings/Professional Development: Discretionary costs of team meetings to support PEPFAR management and of providing training and professional development opportunities to staff. Please note that costs of technical meetings should be included in the relevant technical program area. Translation and Interpretation Costs: Costs related to country -specific interpretation and translation needs. USG Renovation: Teams should budget for and include cost s associated with the renovation of buildings owned/occupied by PEPFAR personnel. Costs for projects built on behalf of or by the partner government or other partners should be budgeted for and described as IMs. Institutional Contractors (Non -PSC/Non -PSA) : Institutional and non -personal services contractors/agreements (non -PSC/non -PSA) includes organizations such as IAP Worldwide Services, COMFORCE, and all other contractors that do NOT have an employee -employer relationship with the U.S. Government . All i nstitutional contractors providing M&O support to PEPFAR should be entered in M&O, not as an IM template. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 194 of 220 In addition to the budget information, teams must provide a narrative to describe institutional contractor activities in the Item Description field. Costs associated with this category will be attributed to the appropriate technical program area within the FAST. Peace Corps Volunteer Costs ( Including Training and Support): Includes costs associated with PCV s, volunteer extensions, and PCRVs arriving at post between October 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024 . The costs included in this category are direct PCV costs, pre -service training, Volunteer - focused in-service training, medical support and safety and security support. The costs excluded from this category are USG staff salaries and benefits, staff travel, and other office costs , such as non -ICASS admini strative costs, which are entered as separate CODB categories. Also excluded are activities that benefit the community directly, such as Volunteer Activities Support and Training (VAST) grants and selected training events. These types of activities should be attributed to the appropriate intervention in an IM template. Funding for PCVs must cover the full 27 -month period of service. For example: Volunteers arriving in June 2024 will have expenses in FY24 (4 months), FY25 (12 months) and FY26 (11 months) . Volunteers arriving in September 2024 will have expenses in FY24 (1 month), FY25 (12 months), FY26 (12 months), and FY27 (22 months) . PCV services are not contracted or outsourced. Costs are incurred before and throughout the volunteer's 27 -month period o f service. Costs incurred by Peace Corps Washington and domestic offices \u2014such as recruitment, placement, and medical screening of volunteers \u2014are included in the HOP. Costs such as living allowance, training, and support will continue to be included in the COP/ROP. Inclusion of Global Fund Liaison Costs ( Where Applicable): For Global Fund liaison positions (full or cost share), the percentage of the position that is PEPFAR funded should be reflected in the COP/ROP and allocated to the above CODB categories. Please contact S/GAC COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 195 of 220 multilateral team and copy your PEPFAR program manager with any questions about the funding stream for this position. 10.5 USG Office Space and Housing Renovation Teams may include support for USG renovation in their CODB submission. All other construction and/or renovation should be included in the IM section of the COP/ROP. USG Renovation --refers to a renovation project of a USG facility. Describe and justify the requested project. (For definition of construction and non -USG renovation projects, please see Section 8.7.1 .) All construction and renovation projects should be cleared by the U.S. ambassador in country before submission to the agency . The notes below outline how USG renovation funds may be used. PEPFAR Funding May Not Be Used for New Construction of USG Office S pace or Living Quarters: Consistent with the foreign assistance purposes of PEPFAR appropriations, PEPFAR Global HIV/AIDS Initiative , Global Survival ( GHCS ), and GHP -State funding should not be used for the construction of office space or living quarters to be occupied by USG staff. The Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) account in the State Operations budget provides funding for construction of buildings to be owned by the Department of State. The Capital Investment Fun d (CIF) is a similar account appropriating funds for USAID construction. Other agencies such as HHS/CDC and the Department of Defense have accounts that provide funding to construct USG buildings. IMs may contribute to the ESCM account through the CSCS pro gram. PEPFAR Funding May Be Used to Lease Facilities: PEPFAR funds may be requested (through the COP/ROP planning process) for the U.S. Government to rent or lease a space for a term not to exceed 10 years, to implement PEPFAR programs, where essential office space or living quarters cannot be obtained through the embassy or USAID mission. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 196 of 220 PEPFAR Funding for Renovation of USG -Owned and Occupied Pro perties Teams may request the use of PEPFAR funds to renovate USG -occupied facilities in exceptional circumstances. The justification for using PEPFAR funds to renovate USG -occupied facilities must demonstrate the following items: ( 1) the circumstances for the request are unique; (2) the renovation is a necessary expense and essential to carrying out the foreign assistance purposes of the PEPFAR appropriation; ( 3) the cost of renovation represents the best use of program funds; ( 4) the rationale for not usi ng appropriate alternative sources of funding for renovation; and ( 5) the renovations have the support of the ambassador. In addition to the Item Description narrative, teams must provide the total costs associated with renovation of buildings owned/occupi ed by PEPFAR personnel under the CODB section. Renovation of facilities owned by the U.S. Government may require coordination with the State Department's Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) and other State Department bureaus and the clearance of the State Department/Office of the Legal Advisor. 10.6 Peace Corps Volunteers For each OU and in aggregate, Peace Corps Washington will submit to S/GAC the number of PEPFAR -funded: Projected volunteers on board as of October 1, 2023; Projected volunteer extensions on board as of October 1, 2023; Projected Peace Corps response volunteers on board as of October 1, 2023; New volunteers proposed in COP23; Volunteer extensions proposed in COP23; and New Peace Corps response volunteers proposed in COP 23. SECTION 11: OTHER ELEMENTS 11.1 Small Grants Program Eligibility Criteria Any awardee must be an entirely local group. Awardees must reflect an emphasis on community -based groups, including FBOs, and groups of persons living with HIV/AIDS. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 197 of 220 Small Grants Program funds should be allocated toward addressing structural barriers to HIV services (e.g., stigma, discrimination and violence mitigation, poverty alleviation, and educational attainment), democracy and governance (as related to the nation al HIV response), HIV prevention, care and support, CLM , or capacity building. They should not be used for direct costs of treatment. When PEPFAR funds are allotted to Post for State to issue grant awards, the clauses below must be included in addition to the standard terms and conditions. CONSCIENCE CLAUSE IMPLEMENTATION : An organization, including an FBO, that is otherwise eligible to receive funds under this agreement for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, or care; (a) Shall not be required, as a conditio n of receiving such assistance: (1) To endorse or utilize a multi -sectoral or comprehensive approach to combating HIV/AIDS; or (2) To endorse, utilize, make a referral to, become integrated with, or otherwise participate in any program or activity to which the organization has a religious or moral objection; and (b) Shall not be discriminated against in the solicitation or issuance of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for refusing to meet any requirement described in paragraph (a) above. PROHIBIT ION ON THE PROMOTION OR ADVOCACY OF THE LEGALIZATION OR PRACTICE OF PROSTITUTION OR SEX TRAFFICKING: (a) The U.S. Government is opposed to prostitution and related activities, which are inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and contribute to the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. None of the funds made available under this agreement may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to preclude the provis ion to individuals of palliative care, treatment, or post - exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis, and necessary pharmaceuticals and commodities, including test kits, condoms, and, when proven effective, microbicides. (b)(1) Except as provided in (b)(2) and (b )(3), by accepting this award or any subaward , an NGO or public international organization awardee/sub -awardee agrees that it is opposed to the practices of prostitution and sex trafficking. (2) The following organizations are exempt from (b) (1): U.S. organizations; the Global Fund; the World Health Organization; the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; and any United Nations agency. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 198 of 220 (3) Contractors and subcontractors are exempt from (b)(1) if the contract or subcontract is for commercial items and services as defin ed in Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR) 2.101, such as pharmaceuticals, medical supplies , logistics support, data management, and freight forwarding. (4) Notwithstanding section (b)(3), not exempt from (b)(1) are recipients, sub -recipie nts, contractors, and subcontractors that implement HIV/AIDS programs under this assistance award, any sub -award, or procurement contract or subcontract by: (i) providing supplies or services directly to the final populations receiving such supplies or ser vices in host countries; (ii) providing technical assistance and training directly to host -country individuals or entities on the provision of supplies or services to the final populations receiving such supplies and services; or (iii) providing the types of services listed in FAR 37.203(b)(1) -(6) that involve giving advice about substantive policies of a recipient, giving advice regarding the activities referenced in (i) and (ii), or making decisions or functioning in a recipient's chain of command (e.g., providing managerial or supervisory services approving financial transactions, personnel actions). The following definitions apply for purposes of this provision: Commercial sex act means any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person . Prostitution means procuring or providing any commercial sex act and the practice of prostitution has the same meaning . Sex trafficking means the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpo se of a commercial sex act . The recipient shall insert this provision, which is a standard provision, in all sub -awards, procurement contracts , or subcontracts . Accountability Programs must have definable objectives that contribute to sustainable epidemic control, including addressing stigma and discrimination, HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and/or (indirectly) treatment. Objectives must be measurable. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 199 of 220 Renewals are perm itted only where the grants show significant quantifiable contributions toward meeting country targets. 11.2 Pre -Award Planning According to the grant regulations of the Department of State's Administration / Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE ), before any single/individual grant estimated to be over $25,000 can be signed by grants officers, the grant documents going into the grant file must be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by S/GAC and the authorized program office in Washington, D.C. If the award is over $25,000 , the pre -award package must also be reviewed by the corresponding regional bureau at State. At least 60 days prior to award, posts planning to issue a grant with PEPFAR funds in the amount of $25,001 or more (for a single gran t) must submit grant documents to the respective PEPFAR program manager and S/GAC Management and Budget for review via email. PEPFAR program managers will review the pre -award package including the following documents for PEPFAR program -specific accuracy and completeness (also see the S/GAC - PEPFAR grant review checklist): 1. DS-1909 2. Award specifics 3. SF 424, 424 -A, project and budget narratives 4. Reporting plan 5. Monitoring plan 6. Competition or sole source justification 7. Statement of work (SOW) 8. Other relevan t pre-award documents ( e.g., grant award panel notes, N otice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) , audits, relevant documents from SAM.GOV, relevant documents from the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS ), funding documentation [i.e., Congressional Notification (CN) or agency funding strip ], Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement , etc.) The governing federal regulation for grants and cooperative agreements is 2 Code of Federal Regulation ( CFR) 200. Allowability of costs can be viewed in section 2 CFR 200.420 Considerations for selected items of cost. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 200 of 220 S/GAC strongly encourages posts to minimize the number of grants exceeding $25,000 so that additional work and extended timelines are not required on behalf of both the p ost and S/GAC. Grants exceeding $25,000 must be awarded competitively by issuing a NOFO and holding a grant panel for award selection. (It is a best practice to have a NOFO and grant review selection panel for all awards .) In addition, grants exceeding $25,000 are required to have both a monitoring plan and a risk assessment as part of the pre -award package. 11.3 Key Personnel Involved in Grants Oversight Federal Assistance Team: Grants officers (GOs), grants officer representatives (GORs), and other staff involved in helping to oversee PEPFAR grants are part of the Federal Assistance Team. The Federal Assistance Directive (FAD) underscores the value of teamwork and communication for team members in sharing the program vision and goals. It is important that members of the Federal Assistance Team avoid conflicts of interest, the appearance of conflicts of interest, as well as maintain impartiality. GOs interpret laws, rules , and policy and have the ultimate authority to manage the award and to direct changes. GOs must be U.S. direct hires at State (including eligible family members and locally employed staff who are U. S. citizens). While actually employed (WAE ) personnel may be GOs on a case -by-case basis. Training to be a grants officer at post for a level -1 warrant requires 40 credit hours; training for a level -2 warrant requires 56 credit hours. Please see training u pdates below. GORs manage the programmatic aspects of the award and are appointed by the GO. A GOR must be a U.S. direct citizen ; a re-employed annuitant , a such as WAE, PSC , or PSA ; locally engaged staff (LES), or an eligible family member. GORs may not be third -party contractors. Third -party contractors may not serve as GOs or GORs. Contractors may participate in many of the processes in grants management ; however, contractors may not perform inherently governmental functions. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 201 of 220 In addition, although gra nt awards for $100,000 or more must have a GOR assigned to them, GOs may assign a GOR to grant s that are below the $100,000 threshold . It is a best practice to have a GOR for each grant if possible. Training Updates from A/OPE: The State Department has recently updated training in grants management with the launch online training courses listed in Table 5 (PY472, PY474, PY476, PY478). This online course series is deemed equivalent to the 40 -hour, in -person course PY260 -Federal Assistance Management and replaces the previous online course series. Starting October 1, 2020, with the release of the FY21 FAD, this new online course series replaced PY220, PY220, and PY224. Table 5: Four Online Courses Replace the Previous 40 Hours of In -Person Training . Course Number of Hours PY478/Federal Assistance: Closeout 4 Below are some examples of how you may use these online course s: Applying for a first -time GOR certification? Register for PY472, PY474, PY467 and for PY472, PY474, PY467 and PY478. Register for PY472, PY474, PY467 and PY478 (these courses will provide 40 hours of training). See the Training section of t he A/OPE/AP/FA SharePoint site (must open in OpenNet or GO Virtual) for information on additional hours needed for higher warrant levels as well as a list of recommended training. Renewing a GOR certification or $100K warrant? You will need 16 hours of ref resher training. Register for PY472 or PY276. Renewing a higher -level GO warrant? COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 202 of 220 Consult the Training section of the A/OPE/AP/FA SharePoint site for information on the number of refresher training hours you will need, and consider registering for a combination of the new online courses. For more information on training requirements and options, see the Training section of the A/OPE/AP/FA SharePoint site. Submission and Reporting Funds for the program should be included in the COP under the appropriate budget category. Individual awards are not to exceed $250,000 per organization per year; the approximate number of grants and dollar amount per grant should be included in the narrative. Grants should normally be in the range of $5,000 -$25,000. In a few cases, some grants may be funded at up to the maximum award level for stronger applicants. Any award greater than $25,00 0 must be managed through the PEPFAR Coordination Office at Post. The management requirements of administering each award should be considered. Once individual awards are made, the country or regional program will notify thei r PEPFAR program manager of which partners are awarded and at what funding level. This information will be added in the SubPartner field for that activity. Successes and results from the Small Grants Program award should be included in the Annual Program Results and Semi -Annual Program Results due to S/GAC. These results should be listed as a line item, like all other COP activities, including a list of partners funded with the appropriate partner designation.

targets state that by 2025 less than 10% of countries should have punitive legal and policy environments that deny or limit access to services, less than 10% of people living with HIV and key populations will experience stigma and discrimination, and less than 10% of women, girls, people living with HIV, and key populations will experience gender inequality and violence. 95-95-95 targets of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS): UNAIDS launched the 95 -95-95 targets with the aim to diagnose 95% of all HIV -positive individuals, provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 95% of those diagnosed and achieve viral suppression for 95% o f those treated by 2030 COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 211 of 220 Breakthrough Innovation : Opportunities that are new to the OU or the community and push beyond existing program design and/or policy boundaries, producing significant growth and impact aligned with the 5x3 strategy . The variables m easuring success are new and therefore may be more difficult to quantify . Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) : Civil society organizations include: traditional health practitioners, community elders, and leaders; local and international non -governmental organizations; faith -based groups; religious leaders living with HIV groups; professional associations; organizations representing people living with HIV; activist and advocacy groups, including those representing key and priority populations; human rights g roups; women's rights groups; men's health groups; youth organizations; religious leaders living with HIV groups ; access to justice and rule of law groups; groups representing other populations highly affected by the epidemic, such as people with disabilities, women, and girls; PEPFAR program beneficiaries or end users; community associations; champions of data -drive n decision -making; and not -for-profit organizations at national, district, and local levels (e.g., Rotary, Lions Clubs, and other global and local groups). Core Standards : In recent years, Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs) have effectively focused attention on global standards PEPFAR considers essential for a successful HIV response. In COP23, MPRs are reframed as Core Standards . Community Led Monitoring (CLM) : CLM initiatives monitor a w ide range of issues associated with accessible, available, equitable, effective, and high -quality HIV service delivery. CLM obtains input from a variety of respondents, including recipients of HIV services (including key populations and underserved groups) , as well as clinic management, and health care providers. CLM implementers obtain this input, in a routine and systematic manner that will translate into action and change, building trusting and sustainable relationships with health care leadership and other stakeholders. CLM is central to PEPFAR's person -centered approach because it puts communiti es, their needs, and their voices at the center of the HIV response. CLM must be conducted by independent and local civil society organizations. Evaluation Activities : PEPFAR defines evaluation as the systematic collection and analysis of information abou t the characteristics and outcomes of a program, including projects conducted COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 212 of 220 under such a program, as a basis for making judgments about the program, improving program effectiveness, and informing decisions about current and future programming. PEPFAR supports 4 types of evaluation activities: process, outcome, impact, economic. Full definitions of these evaluation types can be found in the Evaluation Standards of Practice (ESoP) , Version 3.1.2 (available on DATIM Support . Gender Equity: Gender equity hap pens when actions are taken to end and compensate for the historical and social disadvantages that prevent women and girls in all their diversity from operating on a level playing field. Health Equality: All individuals can access the same health services ; because health equality is not tailored to a person or groups needs and challenges, it is not the same as health equity (Please see health equity definition) . Health Equity : Health equity happens when everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health. For PEPFAR, health equity reflects our commitment to eliminate unfair, avoidable, or remediable differences in health among groups of people, especially as it relates to the PEPFAR mission. Health equity recognizes dif ferences between individuals' circumstances and tailors services and advances policies to achieve optimal health outcomes for all. Health equity requires that we address causes of inequities, including stigma, discrimination, violence, criminalization, and marginalization. In other words, when using a health equity approach, all sub -populations may not receive the same exact services, and unjust policies and practices must be ended, and their effects undone. Health E quity Approach : Such an approach reflects an intentional practice that takes action to tailor services and to eliminate inequities by prioritizing, engaging, and empowering populations who have had historical, contemporary, or cultural injusti ces. PEPFAR's 5 -year Strategy designates (1) infants and children, (2) adolescent girls and young women, and (3) key populations as global priority populations. In countries where gaps are evident f or these populations, COP/ROP strategy should clearly address them. In addition, other priority populations (e.g., ethnic minorities, migrant workers , etc.) may require an equity approach in a national context. COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 213 of 220 Key Populations : Throughout this guidance, k ey populations include sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs , and people in prisons or other enclosed settings. \"KP\" is used as an adjective (e.g., KP -led CSO), whereas \"key populations, \" is used as a noun. Incremental Innovation : Opportunities that are tweaks (small changes) and are low -risk, yet high-impact . Incremental opportunities have value that is easily measurable because the impact variables are well known . Innovati on: Within PEPFAR, innovation can manifest itself in many ways within PEPFAR programs: Adoption of a new technology that transforms how health care is provided Incorporation of a new partner management or performance incentive model that dramatically improves the efficiency of services delivered Introduction of a new national, sub -national, or community -level enabling policy that permits both public and private providers to access and distribute essential medicines and evidence -based prevention programming Formation of a new partnership with an organization that has complementary capabilities to the PEPFAR program and enables a different way of working to advance strategic priorities Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) : Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live in areas of high HIV prevalence and may be vulnerable to the disease or its socioeconomic effects.\" Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC ) funding : Serves the dual purpose of mitigating the impact of HIV and AIDS on children and adolescents as well as the prevention of HIV - and AIDS -related morbidity and mortality. Outlays : Defined by the Office of Manag ement and Budget (OMB) as payments to liquidate an obligation. PASIT ( Planning Activities for Systems Investment Tool (PASIT) : Former Table 6 , this COP/ROP23 Guidance for All PEPFAR -Supported Countries Page 214 of 220 PEPFAR Global Priority Populations : Children, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) , and key population s (KPs) are PEPFAR global priority populations . Public -Private Partnerships (PPPs) : PEPFAR defines formal PPPs as collaborative endeavors that coordinate technical expertise and contributions from the public sector with specialized skill sets and contribu tions from the private sector (financial or in -kind) to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 and sustainably strengthen health systems. Status Neutral Approach : means all people are directly linked to services appropriate to their health needs (notably prevention or ART services) regardless of HIV status. Within HIV testing services , this starts with mitigating barriers to testing (including HIV self -testing) and supporting immedi ate, seamless linkage to treatment and/or prevention services . Surveys -Surveillance Activities : PEPFAR defines surveys -surveillance as the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data to describe and monitor health events . Sustainab ility: PEPFAR defines sustainability as a country having and using its enabling environment, capable institutions, functional systems, domestic resources, and diverse capacities within the national system (including the government, community, and faith -based organizations as well as for -profit and non -profit private sectors) to sustain achievement of 95 - 95-95 goals; to ensure equity in its HIV response; and to protect against other public health threats.
