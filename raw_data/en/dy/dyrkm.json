Improper thoughts, foods, or actions can create a wide range of symptoms. The physical and energetic medicine of acupuncture and Chinese herbs has provided the way to overcome these challenges for thousands of years. Medical energy healing in the Ni family tradition is called InfiniChi\u00ae and has been studied for 5,000 years in China. It serves as the energetic foundation for all modalities of Traditional Chinese Medicine, including [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), and [tuina bodywork](/tuina-bodywork). When you schedule an InfiniChi appointment, you are taking advantage of another branch of the long tradition of practices spanning the 38 generations of medical healers in the Ni family. Essential Energy In Chinese medicine, the power of the body's healing systems is accessed by a transfer of energy. This is often done with an acupuncture needle, a food, or an herb. InfiniChi is the Ni family practice of medical energy healing that focuses solely on the transfer of energy without the use of a physical medium. It is a non-touch therapy where a practitioner reads and manipulates the internal and external energies of a patient to bring about healing and balance. Areas of weakness are strengthened and areas too excessive are gently purged. This is done by reception and emission of qi (energy) from the practitioner's hands. You can feel the invisible energy yourself when you hold your hand over an ice cube or a lit candle. InfiniChi shares the same scope of practice as acupuncture and herbal medicine but works especially well for the following: What Happens During An InfiniChi\u00ae Treatment First, a consultation will inform the InfiniChi practitioner of the treatment focus. Then, either lying down or sitting, the patient is instructed to breathe calmly and relax. The practitioner takes an initial reading of energies in order to assess areas of imbalance. From this point, a host of qi manipulation techniques are performed as the practitioner's hands move around the patient while making the necessary energetic adjustments. There may also be the use of light massage, acupressure, or guided visualization to further direct the flow of energy. The patient may experience deep relaxation, temperature changes, numbness, tingling, light-headedness, emotions, or body movement. It's also normal to experience no physical sensation during the treatment. The InfiniChi practitioner customizes the 30-minute session and the treatment frequency to meet the unique needs of the patient. The real power of InfiniChi comes from two places: a trusting patient-doctor relationship and the intuition and training of the practitioner. A skilled therapist's intentions will be aligned with the patient's. Together they will literally think, feel, and relax their way to meeting a healing objective. These kinds of interactions already take place when you receive a Tao of Wellness acupuncture treatment. What makes InfiniChi unique is the sole focus on this more subtle energy, allowing a very special experience to take place. InfiniChi perfectly supplements other Chinese medical treatments, ensuring that your wellness goals are effectively met. Its ease of administration makes it ideal for those sensitive to needles or herbal medicine, and its portability allows anyone to be treated, including those with mobility issues. "}
