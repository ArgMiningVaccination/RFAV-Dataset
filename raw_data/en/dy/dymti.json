Partially immunized and unimmunized children are most susceptible to childhood diseases and are at a much higher risk of dying as compared to fully immunized children.1 In the past , it has been seen that the increase in immunization coverage had slowed down , and it increased at the rate of 1% per year between 2009 and 2013. To accelerate this coverage , Mission Indradhanush was launched in 2014 to rapidly increase the full immunization coverage to 90%.2 It aims to reduce child mortality and accelerate the process of full immunization coverage for children at a rapid pace, ensuring that all children under the age of 2 years and pregnant women are fully immunized with all available vaccines. 1 https://www.indiascienceandtechnology.gov.in/st -visions/national -mission/mission -indradhanush -mi 2 Press Information Milestones of Immunization Mission Indradhanush India's Universal I mmuni zation Programme is the largest in the world , with annual cohorts of around 26.5 million infants and 29 million pregnant women. The mission initially aimed to immunize unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children of the country against seven vaccine - preventable diseases . These diseases were identi fied as diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis, measles and hepatitis -B. Later, the basket of vaccines was expanded to cover 12 diseases including pertussis, meningitis and pneumonia (Hemophilus influenza type B infections), Japanese encephalitis (JE) in JE endemic districts with introduction of newer vaccines such as rotavirus vaccine, IPV, adult JE vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) measles -rubella (MR).3 Achievements Eleven phases of Mission Indradhanush have been completed covering 701 districts across the country As on February 2023, 4.45 Crore Children and 1.2 Crore Pregnant Women have been vaccinated First two phases of Mission Indradhanush resulted in 6.7% increase in full imm unization coverage in a year Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) Encouraged by the success of Mission Indradhanush and to further intensify the immunization programme, P rime Minister Narendra Modi launched the \"Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI)\" on October 08, 2017 to cover 121 districts, 17 urban areas and 52 districts of NE states (total 190 districts/urban areas across 24 states) for intensified immunization c ampaign. 4 3 http://employmentnews .gov.in/newemp/MoreContentNew.aspx?n=Editorial&k=50256 4 http://employmentnews.gov.in/newemp/MoreContentNew.aspx?n=Editorial&k=50256 It aimed to achieve 90% Full Immunisation Coverage (FIC) with focus towards districts and urban areas with persistently low levels. IMI was built on MI, using additional strategies to reach populations at high risk, by involving sectors other than health. It was an effort to shift routine immunization into a \"Jan Andolan\" or a \"peoples' movement\". It aimed to mobilise communities and deal with barriers to seeking vaccines. This was followed by a Coverage evaluation survey which showed an average increase of 18.5% in full immunization coverage as compared to that in National Family Health Survey (NFHS -4) carried out in 2015 -16.

Thus, to catch up on gaps that might have emerged due to the pandemic, \"Intensified Miss ion Indradhanush 4.0\" was launched by the Government of India on February 07, 2022. Under IMI 4.0, the immunization drives were conducted in 416 districts (including 75 districts identified for Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav) across 33 States/UTs in the country. These districts were identified based on vaccination coverage as per the latest National Family Health Survey -5 report, Health Management Information System (HMIS) data and burden of vaccine preventable diseases. Under IMI 4.0, three vaccination programmes were conducted in three rounds from February 2022 to May 2022. Total 59.99 lakh children and 15.31 lakh pregnant women were vaccinated under IMI 4.0.
