The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22, 2023. CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation, which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling, called angioedema, may occur most commonly on the face, hands and feet, but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines, medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However, the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients, who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms, including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life. The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B) evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. [Study A](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=N8mwAh7yG0s6eX_ncFUQMtd-DiXZ7tNepeeWrCFJdP_TCwu8g1HL4VdIp1CyTaFU7Ul_7FodZWgUuXvoIdMHrPF6NyCv1v4OI9x4tCw02DAHo84-oPWVlAEfJhDCw_8aHjZ_5TH6P8PuKaHnwruMrx8X_tf4R-9o8JrXlqzJUWsPfWRDwgZPGmuozXLY91CUjC2Nz0-ETExJriP_QHWt6g==) was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission, while [Study B](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=N8mwAh7yG0s6eX_ncFUQMlnFH3T2l2LCyJjvkkL7Ye86ikMP220q5KA6qV5A2FyhiCUI_XRw8hvcOrOvDtdN_r4B-mTjNYTBJi3ZVblGWHgZyZ3yu-YufXj7EhKxJoehlA5S-ZxmIp8TgaqDb4zQNHeJgIyO3dEhAjN6gpmsrgKD2fXa8ZXsxw0EaQPDMPE_RTTXAXIEZ3R5DEs4v_JYgw==) was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data. The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the CSU Clinical Trial Program The clinical trial program, known as LIBERTY-CUPID, includes Studies A and B, two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab. In addition to CSU, Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial. About Dupixent Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune\u00ae technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally. About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to [envision](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aqS20iXliS8GzxUaUnD-q7EkGj9vo__EmszIcJVusjHuFv55iA2G7KctylXquiERuy_IXYQwp67H0AklSlQ8jhisrN8qsNj8IqGJ8puZvndOE2FuUAv8_mJSqDEDYZTJskTJlFxA1Q_n5YVJpXignw==) making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite\u00ae technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, atopic hand and foot dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, CSU, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. U.S. INDICATIONS DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used: - to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.
