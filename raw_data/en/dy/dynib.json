When I wash my face in the morning after wearing this to bed, I can still feel the gel on my face. I use this when I am breaking out. - RVRachel V.Verified Buyer3 years agoRated 1 out of 5 starsWanted to Love it I LOVE this brand so much, the Pure Start face wash is a staple in my skincare routine. I have combination, sensitive (rosacea), acne prone skin and saw this as a possible day gel to help decongest throughout the day and balance out my skin. Unfortunately, it caused my T zone area to get extremely oily and does not work well with makeup. Wish it worked for me! - AMAnne M.Verified Buyer3 years agoRated 5 out of 5 starsGood but not super hydrating While there seem to be a lot of clean choices for AHAs, that doesn't seem to be the case for BHAs. I like this option for my dry, sensitive skin prone to hormonal acne. It doesn't dry my skin out but its also not moisturizing. Unless you have oily skin, plan to layer additional moisture over this.
