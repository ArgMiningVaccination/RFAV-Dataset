The register offers an opportunity to recognise, celebrate and protect exceptional trees throughout the City of Melbourne. Sitting in the appropriately named Fig Tree Court, the gigantic, wall-hugging Port Jackson fig tree was one of more than 100 trees added to the Register that year. This type of tree is native to New South Wales and is unusual to be found growing in Victoria. Between 70 and 90 years ago, a bird or bat deposited a seed which grew into the magnificent tree we see on the RMIT City campus today.The tree was also listed in the top ten of the 2021 Victoria Tree of the Year Awards.1.

RMIT participates in the annual TEFMA sustainability performance benchmarking study to track performance in the sector.21 5.3. Sustainability Engagement Plan RMIT is committed to widespread engagement across its student and staff community to encourage sustainable practices and outcomes. In 2020, RMIT worked with sustainability engagement experts, the Republic of Everyone, to help craft storytelling about the progress made at the University to date, and the journey ahead as the institution strives to reach Carbon Neutrality by 2030 and embed the SDGs into the next Strategic Plan. The project aimed to: \u0083Explain and communicate the sustainability framework, goals and broader objectives clearly to students, staff and the wider community. \u0083Develop a communications strategy and relevant collateral that deepens the RMIT community's understanding and knowledge of sustainable practices. As part of this work, RMIT published the Sustainability Story under the campaign banner 'Let's Lead the Way'. Each year the community is engaged through sustainability initiatives including events, behaviour change programs, social media campaigns and living lab projects. For this work, RMIT received an Australasian Green Gown Award in the Creating Impact category. The three focus areas for sustainability engagement activities in 2020 where:1. Circular Economy - How do we shift the focus from recycling to reuse? 2. Climate Change - How do we bring students and staff on the journey to Carbon Neutral 2030? 3. Sustainable Contractors & Retail - How do we support retailers and contractors to transition to a more sustainable model?5.4. Key Activities Given COVID-19 restrictions, the sustainability engagement program moved online in early 2020 with over 30 events and the 'Acts of Connection' program which was designed to provide connections and support to the wider RMIT community. Themes ranged from how to minimise plastic use, to tackling supply chain traceability during Fashion Revolution Week. Virtual Sustainability Ambassador Program The Virtual Student Sustainability Ambassador Program engaged passionate students to develop fresh online content via the sustainability social media channels. Participants came from a range of disciplines, including Landscape Architecture, Applied Chemistry, Marketing, Design, Engineering and Youth Work. Students undertook a comprehensive induction program which included four sustainability micro-creds, a workshop with the Sustainability Team and two of the Future Edge workshops. By participating in the required induction and voluntary work, students received academic recognition through the 'Future Edge' program, aimed at supporting and improving key skills for future employment. The students also took part in the Green Impact program, forming RMIT's first student team and auditing the staff component of the program. Green Impact Working from Home RMIT also successfully transitioned its Green Impact staff engagement program online. The program is based around a bespoke online toolkit that educates staff about what they can do at an individual level to address social and environmental sustainability actions at home and in the workplace. In 2020, the program proved a positive way for staff to feel connected and learn new skills while working remotely. The program also connects staff with the Australasian Campuses Towards Sustainability (ACTS) network to create a community of people working together towards common goals. Student volunteers completed accredited training to become environmental auditors to verify that the actions teams recorded in their workbooks were implemented to a satisfactory level. This form of work-integrated learning is an opportunity for students to gain invaluable industry experience. The 'School of Health and Biomedical Science Nature Nurturers' took out first place this year for their outstanding sustainability efforts.22 Sustainability Annual Report 2020National Sustainable Living Festival For over two decades, the National Sustainable Living Festival has provided community events and an education platform to encourage widespread cooperation in the pursuit of social and ecological sustainability. From its early beginnings in regional Victoria, the Festival has grown into Australia's largest and most comprehensive platform for showcasing the community, commercial, and technological responses to the environmental challenges of our time. Now the country's longest-running celebration of sustainability, the Festival has helped to push sustainable living into the mainstream and continues to present unique and creative opportunities for diverse audiences to connect with a positive and empowering social movement. Since 2012, RMIT University has been a proud partner of the National Sustainable Living Festival. In February 2020, Melbourne hosted the first National Climate Emergency Summit - a flagship event to inspire and energise the movement. The Summit brought together expert practitioners, local governments, climate scientists, community organisation and industry innovators to advocate for action together on a public stage. The event focused on defining and aligning high-level, emergency-scale strategies for safe climate restoration across communities, governments, environmental and social movements, and the private sector. Thought-leaders and changemakers were convened to tackle the big topics spanning economic, technical and social change dimensions in an effort to chart a course of local action for the climate emergency that can be replicated on a global scale.RMIT, as a major partner of the festival, participated in the Summit and hosted a range of on-campus events with RMIT expert panellists during the festival month. RMIT ABC Fact Check also participated by providing real-time fact-checking throughout the sessions. RMIT collaborated with the SLF to deliver a series of engaging sessions, including a Sci-Fight Comedy Debate. The debate brought academics, scientists and comedians together to question whether this is a time for hope, or a time to watch the most well-informed animal on the planet become endangered. Two panel sessions were curated by the academic experts from the Centre for Urban Research, which posed the questions 'Can we achieve climate justice at emergency speed?' and 'Living in a climate of change - how can we shape cities to adapt to uncertain futures?'. Fashion Design Experts at RMIT also hosted a panel with Vinnies Victoria Retail to explore how to 'repurpose with purpose'. The panel addressed how the secondhand clothes market is expanding as demand in sustainable fashion grows and why it's incumbent upon consumers and designers to always keep a garment's final destination in mind. All RMIT-hosted sessions held at the City Campus were recorded by Climatic FM to share the stories of climate change action to a wider audience beyond the festival. All events sold out and there was strong engagement from the audience throughout the sessions. The long-standing partnership between RMIT and the SLF is a testimony to the organisations' shared values and deep belief in sustainability. 23 Other key events At the start of the first Semester, Art students and RMIT Creative curated the 'Here for it' Public Art Trail that included installations, projections, soft sculptures and performances. Supported by the Sustainability Committee, the Greenhouse Project, installed a fully functional greenhouse on the City campus. The immersive urban growing space provided solace from the bustling city and hands-on experiences. A series of workshops stimulated conversations and promoted sustainability, community, health, self-care and nurturing for the environment. In place of Sustainability Week, usually held in March, the Sustainability Team hosted a series of 'Sustainable Practices' through social media that could be undertaken online or at home. The series consisted of several practical social and environmental sustainability workshops, as well as shared online resources to build community knowledge in particular topic areas aligned to the SDGs. In April 2020, RMIT Sustainability brought together industry leaders to wrap up Fashion Revolution Week in style. The 'Transparency, Traceability & Technology' online event featured panellists from ELK The Label, Australasian Circular Textile Association and the RMIT School of Fashion and Textiles who spoke about the challenges and opportunities of supply-chain traceability and sustainable fashion. Plastic Free July was a month-long campaign where the Sustainability Team collaborated with Australasian Campuses Towards Sustainability (ACTS) to deliver a diverse range of workshops and engagement initiatives delivered online or within the community. Activities included Plalking (collecting litter while walking), DIY workshops, a waste audit and the screening of 'The Story of Plastic' documentary with a Q&A. The Q&A had a panel of experts, including the Co-Founder and the Principal Environmental Engineer both from Ocean Protect and a Senior Lecturer from the RMIT School of Fashion and Textiles.RMIT Sustainability collaborated with RMIT Activator and the RMIT Social Innovation Hub to ensure sustainability was at the core of Entrepreneurship Week. In a kick-off event, the audience gained the latest insights on why entrepreneurship, circular economy and sustainability are crucial in embracing the new (ab)normal. The panel discussion focused on the following UN SDGs: \u0083Reduced Inequalities: Policies should be universal in principle, paying attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalised populations. \u0083Sustainable Cities and Communities: A future in which cities provide opportunities for all, with access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more. \u0083Responsible Consumption and Production: Decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles. For more information about Entrepreneurship Week, visit the website. As part of the consultation phase for developing the University's next Strategic Plan, the RMIT:NEXT Sustainability Forum was held. The event was attended by staff and students from across the University with an opening address by the Chair of RMIT's Sustainability Committee and Chief Operating Officer, Dionne Higgins. Dr Emma Shortis, a Research Fellow from the School of Global Urban and Social Studies curated an engaging panel session with representatives from across RMIT, RMIT Europe and an industry leader from Australia Post. The panel investigated what it might mean for RMIT to be part of the transformation to a sustainable world: to reform the systems we live by and investing in sustainable and regenerative practices necessary to create a sustainable world. Sustainability is a key theme of the RMIT NEXT Strategy and this Forum officially kicked off a month of engagement activities with the RMIT community to capture and reflect their feedback and suggestions. Green Campus Day was held during World Green Building Week in September as universities across Australasia opened their 'virtual' doors for a day of sustainable events and tours for staff, students, business and the community. The Sustainability Team ran a guided image tour online, which has now become a useful resource showcasing the sustainability features of a range of RMIT buildings. 24 Sustainability Annual Report 2020David Greybeard Installation Artist and RMIT alumnus Lisa Roet, in collaboration with the Jane Goodall Institute Australia and Airena, designed and fabricated a 9-metre tall inflatable sculpture of the chimpanzee, David Greybeard. The public artwork, installed at the Arts Centre in Melbourne, was created to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Dr Jane Goodall's ground-breaking scientific research into chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. The artwork is based on the image of chimpanzee David Greybeard, representing the conservation work of Jane Goodall. The public artwork aimed to raise awareness around human's relationship with nature and our closest animal relative, while drawing attention to the conservation efforts of the Jane Goodall Institute. Lisa Roet has won acclaim as a multi-disciplinary visual artist in Australia and internationally for her investigation into the complex interface between humans and our simian relatives. She works with the image of the ape as a mirror for humanity, reflecting what it means to be human and highlighting a range of social and environmental issues. For the past 5 years, Roet has presented a series of large-scale public artworks touring urban centres such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Chengdu, and The Netherlands, and is experienced at delivering major projects. These large-scale public artworks draw attention to the increasing impact of urbanisation and global warming, the leading causes of species extinction and forest habitat destruction. They have attracted huge global audiences and social media appeal, offering a creative platform for all generations to be educated and engaged to consider the pressing environmental issues of our time. RMIT research group, Contemporary Art and Social Transformation (CAST), School of Art in collaboration with Roet developed and implemented an educational package that accompanied the artwork in Melbourne. At the centre of the education package was the Art and Sustainability Forum that brought together key thinkers in public art, sustainable practice, conservation, and design to discuss ways of amplifying the powers of public art in addressing the key pillars of sustainability. The RMIT Sustainability Team worked with Roet to calculate the carbon footprint of the project over its expected international tour, providing recommendations for offset purchases that tie in with the core purpose of the project.25 6. Education 26 Sustainability Annual Report 2020To meet future challenges and shape the world, RMIT expects all graduates to demonstrate a wide range of practical skills and expertise whatever their program of study. RMIT's graduate attributes are: \u0083Work-ready \u0083Global in outlook and competence \u0083Environmentally aware and responsible \u0083Culturally and socially aware \u0083Active and lifelong learners \u0083Innovative 6.1. Digital Campus A commitment to sustainability is part of the fabric of RMIT's digital learning and teaching environment. In 2020, sustainability-focused outcomes were practically delivered through two broad streams of work: Stream 1: Optimising the digital learning environment to robustly handle unprecedented usage As campus access was extensively restricted for much of 2020, RMIT moved quickly to adapt to online learning and teaching. This resulted in higher demand for tools including Canvas Studio, used for storing and presenting video content. Usage peaked at 3.5 million weekly events early in Semester 1, compared to 1 million at the same time in 2019. By week 7 of Semester 1, the number of Canvas requests (2 billion) had exceeded the total from the entire Semester 1 the previous year. Such increased usage posed potential risks for business continuity including: \u0083Increases in vendor support wait times for teachers and students \u0083Demand for new learning technologies to fill gaps that don't exist when campus access is unrestricted \u0083Increased license fees \u0083Increased costs associated with data and asset storageActions to mitigate these potential risks included introducing intensive LiveChat and online teaching professional development services for teaching staff, automated file and asset management projects, and implementing a variety of new learning tools and streamlined course production processes. Stream 2: Shifting a wide variety of learning and teaching activities onlineThe increased use of digital learning tools has provided some benefits in terms of sustainability. This includes greater opportunities for students to choose how and when they learn, linking to SDG Goal 4 'Quality Education.' Students now have more flexible access to course learning materials and there is less pressure for students to travel to campus for all lectures. There are currently on average over 6,000 individual virtual classroom sessions each week, with more than 100,000 average total attendees. With the vast majority of these sessions being recorded, students who have work or other clashes, change classes during semester or wish to revise have greater flexibility in accessing the content. The work to shift teaching online for 2020, has laid the foundation for a flexible, future-appropriate blended learning approach, which incorporates the best of: \u0083On-campus learning (e.g. practical learning activities, great facilities, sense of community and campus life) \u0083The digital learning environment (e.g. access to learning regardless of location or time, the ability to progress through work at a personalised pace, providing students with practical experience using various technologies that they may also use in their future workplaces) 27 Bachelor of Fashion and Textiles (Sustainable Innovation) In 2020, RMIT launched a new degree - the Bachelor of Fashion and Textiles (Sustainable Innovation). Across the world, the textile industry is one of the main drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and waste - issues that this cutting-edge degree seeks to tackle through improving design and practice in the textile industry. This degree reflects RMIT's commitment to integrate sustainability and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into learning and teaching. The Bachelor of Fashion and Textiles (Sustainable Innovations) incorporates both technological innovations and improved environmental, social and ethical practices to change the way clothes are made. From the integration of 2D and 3D virtual fashion and textile design and digital production methods, to material innovations, smart textiles, and the need for improved transparency, the degree takes a holistic approach to making the textile industry more sustainable. Students in this degree study specialised courses focusing on ethics in fashion and the environmental impacts and effects of fashion production. The final year focuses on sustainable innovation practices and a self-directed capstone project. As they can also minor in either fashion design, textile design, or fashion enterprise, graduates will have the knowledge and ability to work in diverse roles across the fashion and textiles sector. Their unique experience will empower them to effect sustainable change throughout the fashion industry, and leverage the unique skills they have learnt at RMIT.< Designed by Rute Chaves, from School of Fashion and Textiles 28 Sustainability Annual Report 20206.2. Employability and Careers Education Work-Integrated Learning Work-integrated learning (WIL) connects the classroom to the workplace and is an integral part of the University's commitment to work-relevant, industry-engaged education. As for all areas of learning and teaching, 2020 created numerous challenges for RMIT's students, staff and industry partners involved in WIL. Pivoting from face-to-face WIL to fully online was difficult as many students could not complete their WIL course requirements and required flexibility with timing and approaches to the program. Technology was an issue for many students and industry partners. For some students, the move to online WIL provided excellent opportunities for engagement with industry/community partners as it reduced the travelling and access issues. Providing students with the opportunity to switch to online WIL placements and industry projects, not only prepared them for real-life situations, such as working from home but also allowed them to learn about more online collaboration. Many industry partners have now switched to continuing to offer WIL opportunities online (or as hybrid offerings) as they see the sustainable and scalable benefits of engaging with students and the institution in this way. The WIL team ran weekly Community of Practice sessions and developed a suite of resources for staff and students to support the changeover to online WIL. In 2020, RMIT worked with 2,152 unique industry partners, with 15,168 WIL activities being completed. This included 7,052 placements, nearly 8,000 industry-engaged projects and 132 WIL in simulated workplace environment activities. 1,417 placements were cut short or cancelled as a result of COVID-19 and another 760 were withdrawn by either the host or the student. 2,406 placements were completed remotely with 33 of these replaced by projects or simulations.6.3. Careers and Industry Experiences Careers and Industry Experiences (C&IE) plays a significant role in preparing students to be ready for life and work, so they can positively contribute to, and shape the world. C&IE partners with students and industry to drive positive employment and innovation outcomes. In 2020, 3,452 students received careers guidance and support through the Job Shop services which includes peer-to-peer appointments and one-on-one appointments. The Job Shop also provided over 600 events which included resume reviews, skill and job-ready workshops. 3,260 students were connected with an industry mentor or engaged in Group Mentoring Experiences to receive personalised guidance, coaching and support. Over 3,700 students registered in the Future Edge program, to build their employability/21st-century skills through a range of workshops and programs. Given the impacts of COVID-19 on RMIT resources, a significantly reduced number of students were employed by the Jobs on Campus program in 2020. Targeted career and industry initiatives were delivered to final year students, international students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds including low-socioeconomic status (SES) students which again resulted in increased engagement across these cohorts. 6.4. Strategy and Planning The Strategy and Planning team worked in partnership with the CX and Digital team and Present Company to deliver the Learner Experience Project report in January 2020. This project delivered a detailed holistic understanding of the student journey, their motivations and the learning experience at RMIT. The team spoke to 60 current students, prospective students and alumni, and incorporated 59 submissions from RMIT Learning and Teaching staff. The outputs of this research were distilled into 19 insights, a new learner journey framework and eight diverse learner personas, to help understand the experience from the perspective of the student. Furthermore, five broad opportunity areas were identified for RMIT to explore further to improve the learner experience. These are now being actioned by the Strategy and Planning team and across the institution through the Education Plan to 2025 and major initiatives including the Blended Learning and Assessment Frameworks, and curriculum architecture. The Strategy and Planning team delivered a feasibility study on Learning and Teaching Models that Reflect Indigenous Perspectives for the Office of Indigenous Education and Engagement in March 2020. This study aimed to investigate learning and teaching models that could reflect discipline-specific Indigenous perspectives and offered several important recommendations for the University to consider in moving towards this priority. 29 6.5. Supporting Students The Students Group shapes and delivers transformative experiences with and for students so that they are ready for life and work. Their work supports the collective achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, a commitment to end poverty, fight inequality and respond positively to climate change. RMIT is demonstrating progress towards a sustainable future through various student-facing programs.

In 2020, there were four RMIT University Student Union (RUSU) affiliated sustainability groups in action on campus: \u0083Environmental Engineering Student Association: Hosts social and industry events, in what is the longest-running engineering student organisation at RMIT. \u0083Student Association for Sustainable Systems Engineering (SSE): Helps students adjust to University life and encourages connections between other SSE students. \u0083Fossil-Free RMIT: Campaigns for the University's divestment from fossil fuels from the University's philanthropic funds. \u0083RMIT Vegan Club: Promotes the ethical, health and environmental reasons behind veganism, how to become vegan and provides a social network for RMIT vegans, vegetarians and others interested in making this change. The RUSU Sustainability Department also drives sustainability initiatives on campus with coordination from a dedicated Sustainability Officer, who also sits on the RMIT Sustainability Committee.RUSU Free meals program RMIT University Student Union (RUSU) is run by students for students. Many students suffered a loss of income during the coronavirus crisis in Australia. To help provide food security for students and to promote healthy food choices, RUSU provided free deliveries of healthy meals and snack packs to those in student accommodation. In 2020, RUSU gave out over 30,000 free meals to students across the RMIT campuses. Feedback on the program: \u0083We are extremely thankful and appreciative of RUSU's continuous support and effort providing our students with an incredible range of fresh fruit, tasty meals and snacks. During this difficult time it makes a great difference and provides the student an extra sense of comfort knowing they are being assisted. Each week we have received new snacks so the students continue to feel rewarded and excited every time. Having a sense of security is extremely important for our students welfare and this exceptional service and offering has been very well received by all. \u0083Thank you RUSU!!! Thanks for all the support you've given us RMIT students here at Scape... They all brighten up my days during this pandemic. RUSU has honestly kept some of our residents here at the lodge eating well and consistently through the pandemic. I know of people that are going through financial hardships and are sacrificing healthy meals because of it. But thanks to RUSU those people are able to eat and keep a balanced diet through this time. RUSU has definitely helped our residents to cope and persist in these challenging times. \u0083The support that RUSU has given our residents throughout this difficult time emotionally and financially has been incredible. It has given residents the ability to not only eat well, but try new and delicious food cooked by RealFoods, as well as put a smile on their faces during these difficult times. 31 7.

Research Partnerships and Translation RMIT encourages researchers to create a positive impact through research, delivering tangible benefits to society. A dedicated Research Translation team supports researchers in planning to achieve impact through their research including where research can contribute towards SDG goals. Researchers are assisted in developing a pathway to impact with a strong focus towards research application and uptake in real-world settings, and in measuring their impact to demonstrate benefits to partners and society. A specialist Intellectual Property and Commercialisation team provides expert advice to researchers seeking to develop and market new technologies or services. The Research Partnerships team applies their sector expertise to support researchers in identifying and responding to industry research needs. This facilitates partnerships with government, business, community and service organisations that bring RMIT's research capability to bear on critical social, environmental and industry challenges. The provision of this integrated support across impact planning and capture, commercialisation and partnerships enhances RMIT researchers' capacity to contribute to the SDG goals. Examples of innovative research projects that help solve complex local, regional and global sustainability problems are presented in this section. 34 Sustainability Annual Report 20207.4. Research Integrity Through the work of the Research Ethics, Integrity, and Governance team and its related committees and networks, RMIT promotes a culture of responsible research conduct and upholds its responsibility to establish and maintain good governance and management practices for responsible research conduct. Responsible research, or research integrity, is the coherent and consistent adherence to a set of principles that underpin the trustworthiness of research. Principles and responsibilities for responsible research are outlined in the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (2018). The Research Ethics, Integrity, and Governance team upholds these principles through: \u0083Management of allegations of potential breaches of research integrity \u0083Training and education in research integrity \u0083Providing guidance on research integrity \u0083Operations and activities of the Research Integrity Advisors' Network \u0083Facilitating a Research Integrity Review \u0083Review and revision of RMIT's Research Policy suite In 2020, the Research Ethics, Integrity, and Governance team collaborated with the Research Integrity Advisors' Network, School of Graduate Research, RMIT Library and ITS to develop a Guidance note on COVID-19 and research integrity. This Guidance Note consolidates advice on COVID-19 and responsible conduct of research and contextualises that advice for RMIT researchers and other stakeholders. It describes new practices and resources that support responsible research and meeting the principles and responsibilities of the Australian Code during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Research Ethics, Integrity, and Governance team and the Research Integrity Advisors' Network also drafted a working paper 'Realising the Hong Kong Principles at RMIT: Recognising and Rewarding Research Integrity at RMIT University'. This document seeks to apply the Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers to RMIT and recognise and reward responsible research practices that make research trustworthy and showcase RMIT as a strong, accountable, and transparent institution.7.5. Examples of Research Projects Research to transform biosolid resource management A new research centre is set to transform Australia's biosolid use as a valuable resource, providing new practices, technologies and products for improved land management and training. The Australian Research Council (ARC) Training Centre for the Transformation of Australia's Biosolids Resource is based at RMIT University and led by RMIT's Distinguished Professor Andrew Ball. The centre brings together expertise from 20 national and international partners from Australia, the UK and US including universities, water management authorities and industry. Biosolids are a by-product of the wastewater treatment process that can be used as fertiliser, in land rehabilitation or as a construction material. However, around 30% of the by-product still goes to landfill in Australia. This centre aims to transform the way biosolids are managed in Australia and pave the way for improved and more environmentally sustainable practices across the globe. It will also ensure we are equipped and ready to go with a skilled workforce ready to use the new technologies as they are developed. The training centre will attract a total of $13.7 million in cash and in-kind support including access to outstanding facilities, expertise and involves collaboration with 20 participating organisations across three countries. 35 The new digital platform mapping liveability in Australia's major cities A groundbreaking new digital platform is set to transform how liveability is mapped in major cities across Australia. The Australian Urban Observatory (AUO) is an essential new online tool for government and industry - from policymakers wanting to improve the health and liveability of their cities to developers looking for the next suburbs to invest in. Developed by RMIT health and urban researchers, the Observatory is based on research knowledge about public health and urban environments and brings together critical data on easy-to-use maps for the first time in Australia. Director of the AUO Dr Melanie Davern, from the RMIT Centre for Urban Research, said the simplicity of the data could help anyone from policymakers, planners, developers and students to members of the general community develop a clear understanding of real liveability. Drawing on over eight years of research findings by the RMIT Healthy Liveable Cities Group, the Observatory maps liveability indicators across the country's 21 largest cities and measures liveability across cities, council areas, suburbs and neighbourhoods. The data has been mapped to display a real-world view of how the information exists in cities and where urban design and planning can be changed to influence the health and liveability of Australian cities. Policymakers looking to encourage active lifestyles for residents can easily access and understand key ingredients of liveability - like walkability, access to schools, public transport, and public open spaces - to decide which areas and people need resources the most. Transport sector skills gaps In 2020, researchers commenced mapping the skills gaps and training needs for Australia's transport sector in the most comprehensive national study of its kind. The RMIT University and iMove Cooperative Research Centre aims to give state and federal policymakers a clear roadmap on filling the skills gaps in the wide-ranging sector, worth more than $123 billion to the nation's GDP (7.3%). The research looks at the impact of automation and AI already being felt by the 273,000 Australian workers in the transport and mobility sector, as well as where new jobs are likely to be found and the skills they will require. iMOVE initiated the project after consultation with industry and government partners who highlighted concerns about technology-related gaps in particular. The project takes a broad view of the nature of gaps across the whole industry. RMIT Associate Professors Victor Gekera and Darryn Snell are the lead academics. Both have extensive experience in probing occupational change and skills development questions across a range of industries including agri-foods, digital, transport and logistics, cleantech and the electricity generation industry. Even before the pandemic struck, the sector had long been associated with chronic skills and labour supply challenges, including difficulties with recruitment and retention of younger workers, an increasingly ageing workforce and growing skills gaps. 36 Sustainability Annual Report 2020An entrepreneurial initiative from RMIT Vietnam tackles plastic pollution An entrepreneurial concept initiated at RMIT University was recently announced as one of four winners in the United Nations Development Program's (UNDP) plastic pollution challenge. As a winner of UNDP's challenge in ending plastic pollution, founder of Refill Day and RMIT Associate Lecturer Nguyen Huu Nhan received a grant to implement the initiative in Ha Long Bay Vietnam. The inaugural UNDP's Ending Plastic Pollution Innovation Challenge (EPPIC) invited participants from ASEAN countries to share their ideas on preventing plastic waste and pollution. Refill Day, an idea initiated by Nhan, from RMIT's Saigon South campus, proposed the use of mobile refill stations to reduce plastic waste. The core purpose of Refill Day is to encourage people to refill and reuse plastic bottles, addressing the plastic pollution problems before they become a problem by preventing virgin plastics from being used in the first place. The project provides a convenient alternative to single-use plastic by refilling reusable containers with trusted products at customers' homes, offices, restaurants or hotels. Refill Day was first launched in Ha Long Bay in 2020, where the service was well received by local residents and it will be rolled out in Ho Chi Minh City. This project is a collaborative effort by the UNDP , Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), Vietnam Administration of Sea and Islands (VASI), Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), and Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, EPPIC is an ASEAN-wide competition aimed at beating plastic pollution in coastal cities in Asia.European Training Network for InduStry Digital Transformation across Innovation Ecosystems - EINST4INE RMIT Europe is coordinating the European Training Network for InduStry Digital Transformation across Innovation Ecosystems - EINST4INE, a collaborative project funded by the European Commission under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks scheme (MSCA-ITN), aims to build the next generation of industry transformation leaders. The success of digital transformation for industry hinges on the capabilities of creative, multidisciplinary, open-minded and highly skilled individuals. The EU-funded EINST4INE project aims to provide cutting-edge training to a cohort of 15 PhD candidates and to equip them with broad-ranging skills and capabilities to successfully embrace the challenges of contemporary and future industrial systems. Drawing on world-class research and practice on open innovation, Industry 4.0 and innovation ecosystems, this interdisciplinary and intersectoral programme will develop a unique knowledge base on the human side of digital transformation, coordination and decision-making, enabling technologies and new value creation logics as well as the orchestration of innovation ecosystems. 37 8.

This supports staff to excel in their professional development and builds communities of practice across the organisation. The variety of delivery modes for professional development enable equitable access to learning. RMIT continues its strong commitment to creating a workforce that is inclusive and reflects the diversity of people and cultures that exist in the wider Australian community. RMIT is committed to increasing the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and implementing initiatives supporting employment. Table: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Workforce 2018 2019 2020 Total 31 34 39 The RMIT 2018 Higher Education Enterprise Agreement includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment and participation principles that recognise the rights and responsibilities of Indigenous employees, as well as highlighting the role reconciliation has as a core value of RMIT. It also requires that the University provides all non-Indigenous staff with the opportunity to participate in the relationship of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People.41 8.2. Diversity and Inclusion Led by the values of inclusion, passion and courage, RMIT is focused on creating an environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Diversity and inclusion are celebrated and equal opportunity is paramount. The RMIT Diversity and Inclusion Framework is the high-level statement of RMIT's aspirations. The Framework outlines the University's commitment to increase access, build a more diverse student and staff community, and provide equitable, inclusive experiences and outcomes for all students and staff.The University Framework outlines: \u0083Students from low socio-economic backgrounds Improve the access, retention and success of domestic students from low socio-economic backgrounds. \u0083Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and students Appoint, retain, develop and support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, as outlined in Action Area four of the Reconciliation Action Plan. \u0083Gender equality for staff Drive progress towards gender equality and ensure diverse and balanced representation at every level of the organisation. \u0083Students and staff of diverse genders, sexes and sexualities Promote a culture of inclusion and respect, through leadership actions, communications, events, training, and professional development for staff. \u0083Staff and students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds Promote a culture of inclusion and valuing diversity, through leadership actions, and communications, events and training. \u0083Staff, students and visitors with disability Provide an equitable and inclusive experience and outcomes for all students and staff with a disability RMIT continues to make significant progress in recognising, embracing and growing RMIT diversity, and living by the University's values to ensure that RMIT remains an inclusive place to study and work. Thank you for the wonderful workshop, I really enjoyed being able to listen to SNAP champions and working with students from RMIT and this experience has helped me gain a better understanding about my future and what I want to do!\" This program was very helpful considering my interest in the arts, it was an amazing learning experience, with the addition of the RMIT students sharing their knowledge, that was very helpful. Student participants in the 'I Belong' equity outreach program42 Sustainability Annual Report 2020Student Access, Retention and Success \u0083RMIT partners with 235 Victorian secondary schools in the Schools Network Access Partnership (SNAP) - an equity access scheme that gives priority entry to RMIT for eligible applicants. \u0083In 2020, 2164 students enrolled in a degree or vocational program through SNAP Access Schemes, accounting for 62% of all low SES enrolments made through the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre. \u0083The 'I Belong' equity outreach program adopted online delivery methods during COVID-19, connecting 1807 students from SNAP secondary schools from across 10 regions in Victoria with staff and industry professionals to build aspiration and awareness for tertiary education. \u008325 secondary students from 30 SNAP schools were sponsored to attend ConocoPhillips Science Experience 3-day program. We continue to see increased parent engagement with the growth in family transition sessions for commencing SNAP students in 2020. \u0083Feedback from participants was positive, with post-program evaluation comments indicating that 'I Belong' achieve positive shifts in building student understanding of the University. The RMIT needs-based scholarship program helps eliminate the financial barriers that prevent students from pursuing tertiary studies, enabling them to devote more time to their studies, and therefore supports retention and completion. In 2020, RMIT awarded more than 2,200 scholarships to VE and undergraduate HE students, valued at over $6.8m, with 96 per cent of scholarships provided to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The retention rate of commencing students with scholarships from 2019 were higher at 91% compared with non-scholarship holders at 80.90%. Continuing low SES students who hold a scholarship have a retention rate of 90.70% in comparison to non-scholarship holders at 83.60%.Accessibility Ensuring RMIT is physically, technologically and culturally accessible for people with a disability remained a key area of focus in 2020. RMIT was proud to be recognised as the leading organisation for accessibility in the Australian Network on Disability Access and Inclusion Index. RMIT was also the highest-ranked organisation for 'Products and Services' for provisions for students with disability. RMIT promotes inclusion for thousands of students with disability through individual education support plans, professional counsellors, mental wellbeing programs, mentoring and internships, and accessible teaching and learning materials. The Equitable Learning Services (ELS) team provided individual consultations to more than 3,000 students with a disability, long-term illness and/or mental health condition and primary carers of individuals with a disability in 2020, with 2,625 learning plans for students with disability to access adjustments and services for full participation. Through an Equitable Learning Plan (ELP), students can receive equitable adjustment arrangements, which can include adjustments to study and assessment, sign language interpreters and other support staff, accommodation scholarships, and assistive technologies. RMIT values the richness of diversity among staff and recognises the contribution being made already by those working with disability. As a signatory to the Disability Confident Recruitment Charter, RMIT offers advice and support through recruitment processes to ensure inclusive applicant management. The Accessibility at Work team focuses on making workplace adjustments for staff which may include physical changes to the working environment, technological adjustments or working arrangement flexibility.At RMIT our purpose is to empower people - all our people, staff and students alike - to shape their own futures, be their best and belong. Vice-Chancellor and President Martin Bean CBE 43 Diverse Genders, Sexes and Sexualities (DGSS) Inclusion RMIT submits to the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI), recognising the University's commitment to celebrating the diverse genders, sexes and sexualities (DGSS) community. In 2020, RMIT was awarded the Employer of the Year for LGBTQ+ Inclusion for the second consecutive year - demonstrating the University's continuous effort in building a culture of inclusion and respect for staff and students of the DGSS community. In addition, RMIT was awarded the Trans and Gender Diverse Inclusion Award and the Employee Network of the Year Award in recognition of the Staff DGSS and RMIT Ally Networks.As a University of Choice leading and promoting LGBTI inclusion, RMIT is proud of how the student and staff community work together to build a culture of care and belonging. These awards recognise RMIT's commitments and achievements to promote a culture of inclusion and respect through leadership actions, communications, events, and professional development. RMIT has enhanced its policies and procedures for inclusion, improved provision for trans and gender diverse staff and students, and formed partnerships with external community groups, charities and events. RMIT has an active student and staff Ally and DGSS network. This community continues to grow outreach beyond RMIT through partnerships with leading community organisations and events including Minus 18, the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, and Pride and Diversity, Midsumma. Being an inclusive place to work and study is what makes RMIT special. This index will help ensure our approach and services remain strong, relevant and measured so we can constantly improve to make a difference for everyone, Dionne Higgins, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Champion for AccessibilityWe aim to be a place where diverse genders, sexes, and sexualities are recognised and welcomed, everyone is free to be themselves, and where staff and students benefit from our diversity of our community. Dene Cici, Executive Director, Students 44 Sustainability Annual Report 2020Gender Equality Led by the Gender Equality Action Plan, RMIT continues to identify and address barriers to women's inclusion and career progression. The University remains focused on delivering strategic, sustainable and meaningful change across the priority areas: leadership and governance, employment conditions and women's career advancement. RMIT was recognised as an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality (EOCGE) citation from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) in 2020 for the third consecutive year. The citation demonstrated a continued commitment to best practice in promoting gender equality in Australian workplaces.RMIT reports under the Workplace Gender Equality (WGEA) Act 2012. This report encompasses all employees (headcount) in Australia including full-time, part-time, casual and temporary employees. WGEA defines specific occupational categories to classify and report on managers and non-managers. Managers include the CEO, key management personnel, general managers, senior managers and other managers. As a result, the statistics below may differ slightly from those reported within the 2020 Annual Report.

While the Athena SWAN accreditation is related to increasing participation of Women in STEMM academia, there is a significant focus on Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility and Indigenous staff and student participation in STEMM. Action plans focus on seven key areas from Leading Local Action and Building the Pipeline to Transforming Cultures and Engaging Moments of Transition. 2020 highlights include the Executive Leadership Capability Program to develop inclusive leaders, the establishment of the STEMM Diversity and Inclusion Advocates Group with representation from each STEMM school to drive local actions at a local level and the HDR women in STEMM mentoring program where 47 HDR women from the STEM College were mentored by an academic outside of their direct discipline. Leading local action: driving transformation to support female careers in STEMM In 2020, RMIT established the Diversity and Inclusion Advocates Group (DIAG). DIAG is charged with identifying and addressing barriers to inclusion and progression for women in STEMM and for diverse-gendered staff and students and other minority groups at the University. Comprising an Advocate from each of the eight STEMM schools and the VE College, DIAG will drive local actions to effect change. New data dashboards allow advocates and leaders in each school to view real-time data and analysis of workforce and student profiles. The dashboards provide greater transparency and accountability, assisting leaders to more effectively consider diversity and inclusion in their decision making. Building the pipeline: inspiring and attracting future female talent RMIT is focused on ensuring a diverse workforce for the future, including inspiring and attracting future female talent. In 2020, RMIT focused on building the academic pipeline through: \u0083The Always on Women in STEMM Recruitment campaign, with almost 800 women expressing interest since October 2019. \u0083Special Measures recruitment has been granted for Engineering and Science disciplines with low female representation below 40% women. Special Measures was also expanded to explicitly be inclusive of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples and of transgender and gender diverse people. \u0083The HDR women in STEMM mentoring program provided supportive mentoring partnerships for 47 HDR women to be mentored by an academic outside of their discipline. For the student pipeline, RMIT's range of activities to support young women students in STEMM had to adapt rapidly to the COVID-19 public health response. New online platforms allowed RMIT to connect with far-reaching audiences to inspire young women in STEMM in collaboration with RMIT's 'I Belong' Team, Student Recruitment and Global Marketing, the STEM College Engagement and academic staff, external industry partners including NASA and Victoria's Lead Scientist. I have learnt over my career that gender equity is not only the right thing, it's unequivocally the smart thing and it should certainly be the norm. Our Gender Equality and Athena SWAN Action Plans are designed to work toward equitable career progression, address gender pay inequities and prevention of gender-based harassment and sexual harm. Vice-Chancellor and President Martin Bean CBE 46 Sustainability Annual Report 2020We need to be producing great role models for all of our students and staff, but you can't do that if you have gender disparity. Our involvement in the Athena SWAN program has given us the impetus to consider revisions and updates: to our policies, to our recruitment practices, and to our working culture, all with the aim of encouraging greater participation of women in leadership and research, and to ensure that the careers of all our staff are not limited by life's challenges. Professor Kay Latham, Dean - STEMM Diversity & Inclusion and Lead for SAGE Athena SWANSupporting fulfilling careers: nurturing existing female talent To support and foster fulfilling careers, RMIT focused on academic promotions and ensuring gender balance and culturally diverse representation. For the first time in 2019 and 2020, female academic promotion application rates were close to or exceeded AT standards. This milestone aligns with the implementation of the new academic promotions framework designed with improved flexibility and support for diversity and inclusion. Furthermore, the 2020 promotion committees included at least 40% male and 40% female and were representative of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) identified colleagues. Achievement Relative to Opportunity (ARtO) is used in employment-related decisions such as recruitment, performance review, career planning and academic promotion. In 2020, significant progress was made to incorporate ARtO guidelines throughout the HR policy suite and talent acquisition processes. Engaging moments of transition: creating in-time and flexible support mechanisms RMIT is focused on supporting gender equality in caring responsibilities and career progression for all carers, improving the management of career disruptions and transitions. The Career Reignite Program designed to support research academic staff who experience career interruptions that impact their ability to access research opportunities. In 2020, career coaching panels took place to assist these researchers in developing their research career transition plans. For many parents and carers, remote working in 2020 posed additional complexities with childcare and schools closed during lockdown periods and caring responsibilities increased for elderly dependents and people with disability. RMIT recognised additional supports were needed and implemented: \u0083COVID-19 support with parents and carers webpage \u0083Group workshops on resilience coaching reaching 200+ attendees \u0083Collaboration with School of Education to design resources for parents managing online learning.47 Transforming culture: delivering an inclusive, respectful and compassionate workplace RMIT has focused on building an inclusive culture supporting diversity and gender equity through enterprise-wide action and local leadership. Inclusive culture underpins success in all SAGE Athena SWAN actions and ambitions to further diversify and support intersectionality at RMIT. In 2020, the STEM College continued an Executive Leadership Capability Program, a comprehensive and validated model of an inclusive culture. Close to 70 leaders upskilled in psychological safety and boundary spanning. The visibility of women in STEMM was amplified by the Women in STEMM gallery and events. We profiled 14 inspirational female researchers demonstrating the incredible work of RMIT researchers and inspiring others to do the same. The inaugural Virtual Women in Vocational Education Conference was attended by 100 students and staff where they heard from industry speakers from across the globe. Supporting and encouraging intersectional communities The Athena SWAN commitment encompasses actions for diversity and inclusion across the University's intersectional communities. The school of Science in collaboration with Ngarara Willim hosted the 'Deadly STEM Experience, an immersive experience for young indigenous students from across Australia. For National Reconciliation Week, the STEM Ngulu Reconciliation committee produced a short video allowing members of the STEM community to share what reconciliation means to them. Strengthening foundations: futureproofing Athena SWAN through good governance and leadership RMIT's Athena SWAN project is driven by leadership and action across all areas and levels of RMIT University for implementation and governance. In a Victorian first, RMIT appointed Professor Kay Latham as Dean STEMM Diversity and Inclusion. Professor Latham leads RMIT's Athena SWAN project and facilitate the University's progress in Reconciliation and Diverse Genders, Sexes and Sexualities (DGSS) action plans, along with accessibility, low socio-economic backgrounds and cultural inclusion initiatives. We encourage all our people to be creative in establishing ways of working that suit their roles and teams while balancing their life outside RMIT. Meegan Marshall, CPO8.3. Changing the Course: RMIT's plan and prevention framework to reduce sexual harm We have continued our work to create a culture of inclusion and respect at RMIT, where every member of the community is safe and free from sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Guided by our three-year 'Changing the Course' framework, we have continued to implement initiatives that focus on prevention and response. In 2020, we strengthened both our reporting and governance on sexual harm risk management and adopted a whole of University approach to gender-based violence encompassing initiatives for both students and staff. The framework actions include: \u0083Communications and social marketing including the 'Be the Change' campaign, which aims to support the community to address sexual violence and the social norms that make it acceptable. \u0083Direct participation programs such as student bystander inventions workshops, which empower individuals to recognise and intervene where they witness sexism and sexual harassment. This program addresses the norms and attitudes that drive sexual violence. \u0083Provision of support and care: Creating a single intake point to support those experiencing sexual harm and targeting interventions aimed at those at risk of perpetrating these behaviours. \u0083Strengthening institutional responses through policy and process review to ensure that those seeking help for sexual harm do not have their trauma compounded by the institutional response mechanisms. RMIT recognises that sexual harm disproportionately affects women and fits within a spectrum of gendered violence. Consequently, the Changing the Course Advisory Group works closely with the Diversity and Inclusion Working Group to address the drivers of gendered violence. Gender equality is a human right and the costs to individuals and society of gender inequality and gendered violence are high. RMIT recognises that gender equality will serve to make the community, safer, healthier and more sustainable. RMIT will continue to work towards this goal through Changing the Course and other strategic actions in the years to come. 48 Sustainability Annual Report 20208.4. Flexibility RMIT is committed to supporting its people with fit-for-purpose flexible working arrangements that foster and encourage a diverse and adaptable workforce. Several resources, professional development opportunities and services are in place to support flexible ways of working. At RMIT, more than one in four staff choose a formal form of flexibility, including working part-time, purchasing leave or working a compressed work week. Other forms of flexible working include flexible start and end times, time-in-lieu, job-sharing or other creative forms of working arrangements that suit the work and life needs of staff. All forms of flexibility have continued to evolve with the move to primarily remote working in 2020, with more men working formally flexibly than ever before.

Reconciliation and Indigenous Engagement RMIT's dhumbali (commitment) to a just and meaningful relationship between Indigenous communities and the RMIT community is at the durrung (heart) of how we live our values. RMIT's second Reconciliation Plan - Dhumbah Goorowa 2019-2020 focuses on how to embed reconciliation across the RMIT's values, culture, processes and systems. Dhumbah Goorowa recognises that there is still much work to be done in support of First Nations' right to self-determination in education and in community life. All colleges, portfolios and RMIT entities outline their dhumbali to reconciliation and the specific outcomes and indicators on which their progress will be evaluated. Each college and portfolio has created a reconciliation committee called a Ngulu (voice), to develop, implement and monitor reconciliation activities, reporting to their executives and further embedding reconciliation into all aspects of RMIT's operations. RMIT reviewed the admissions policies resulting in significant reforms which will see Indigenous access represented as a University-wide priority. RMIT also focused on improving and expanding the Indigenous Access Program, including a review of accommodation scholarships for regional and remote students. The work also enabled a refinement of Ngarara Willim's communications to schools and the community, and engagement with future students both pre and post-application to RMIT. Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, Ngarara Willim hosted the Gama-dji Orientation program for students. An online version of the program was then developed for students from the second-semester intake who were impacted by the pandemic. Ngarara Willim also developed an online module in Canvas to provide a central online community for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and these resources proved valuable tools to maintain connections with, and support for RMIT's students. Throughout 2020, the Ngarara Willim Centre continued to support all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and community. In the face of COVID-19 disruptions, every student was called directly to discuss their wellbeing and ensure they were equipped to transition to online learning, identifying many who required support to enable their continued engagement with their studies. 2020 was a significant year for public debate and engagement with issues of race and reconciliation. RMIT's response to the Black Lives Matter movement and destruction of sacred Aboriginal sites in different parts of the country, both publicly and through Ngarara Willim, enabled us to acknowledge our dhumbali to strengthening our relationship with Australia's First peoples.49 8.6. Health, Safety and Wellbeing RMIT is committed to providing a safe and healthy place in which the RMIT Community can work and learn. RMIT's actions are guided by the RMIT Health Safety and Wellbeing (HSW) Strategy, the values of the University and the deep sense of care that RMIT's people have for each other across the student and staff communities. The HSW Strategy is supported by policies, strategies, processes, guidance materials and proactive programs. In 2020, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a significant health, safety and wellbeing response. The Health Safety and Wellbeing team worked across the University, sector and with external stakeholders to provide a rapid response which focused on addressing both the physical and psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 for the RMIT community. Planned initiatives within the HSW Strategy were also quickly pivoted to meet the changing needs of the University's staff and students, allowing for much to be delivered despite unprecedented disruption. Other achievements in 2020 include: \u0083University-wide launch of the \"Five Ways to Wellbeing\" mental health promotion model and integrated tools for all students and staff. \u0083Redesigned 25 health and safety specialist training modules, creating more contemporary and relevant resources for staff and students. \u0083Delivered the \"Seeds for Growth\" seven-part resilience series to 1484 staff and \"RMIT Assisting students in distress\" training for 225 staff. \u0083Reviewed the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) program life cycle identifying areas for improvements in support of the health, safety and wellbeing of students participating in these activities. Certificate IV in Project Management Practice -Indigenous Cohort Several major new initiatives were developed to meet the needs of the Community and encourage pathways and transition into further study and higher education opportunities. Fee waiver bursaries were offered, and College partners offered free online short course places throughout the year. This included an Indigenous cohort program for the Certificate IV in Project Management Practice which was developed in direct response to an identified community need. This program was fully subscribed in 24 hours.Awareness of reconciliation among RMIT students and staff continued to grow in 2020. The number of students completing the Womin Djeka Indigenous orientation micro-credential increased by 62% from 2019 while a staff survey showed that 72% per cent of staff agree RMIT offers them enough Indigenous engagement and awareness to do their job. 2020 was a challenging year, highlighting the fundamental importance of RMIT's commitments to just and meaningful relationships. Despite the challenges, there were also many positive achievements as a result of dedicated work and care in difficult circumstances. This has created a foundation for a renewal of RMIT's commitment to Aboriginal leadership, self-determination and progress in the University's reconciliation agenda. 50 Sustainability Annual Report 2020Mental Wellbeing A key focus area of the HSW strategy is the Mental Wellbeing Strategic Action Plan to strengthen the University's approach to student and staff mental wellbeing. RMIT aims to create a mentally healthy community in which everyone can realise their potential and feel safe and supported. Key action areas focus on culture, systems, skills, experiences and support. Key deliverables in 2020 included: \u0083Launched a mental health promotion campaign \"RMIT Together\" to foster connection and reduce psychosocial risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emissions Australian Operational Emissions Profile RMIT is a global leader in climate action, taking practical steps and innovative projects to become carbon neutral by 2030 and adapting to climate risks. The University also supports local and international communities and partners to transition to a low carbon future. RMIT is acutely aware of the need to become more resilient to a changing climate. Guided by the Climate Change Adaptation Plan, RMIT is addressing climate risks through adaptation measures across operations. Having a prepared response to extreme heat, severe storms, flooding events and prolonged drought will ensure that the University's campuses and people are safe and can continue to work with minimal disruption. RMIT University is committed to becoming carbon neutral in its operational emissions profile by 2030. Guided by the Carbon Management Plan, RMIT undertakes a range of emissions reductions activities to meet this goal. The Plan is updated every two years and strives to represent best practice in emissions management. In 2020, RMIT achieved a 62 per cent decrease in operational emissions from the 2007 emissions baseline. The majority of this reduction is due to energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy contracting. It should be noted that the impact of COVID-19 and the move to remote learning had a significant influence on the 2020 emissions profile, contributing an additional 14% reduction. RMIT saw the overall electricity consumption reduce significantly, correlating to the reduced on-site activities. The RMIT co-generation and tri-generation plants at the City and Bundoora West campuses had a reduced operation, but still generated 19,000 MWh of electricity onsite, saving approximately 10,000 tCO2-e of emissions. RMIT's existing renewable energy contract (Melbourne Renewable Energy Project) provided 5,000 MWh of carbon-neutral electricity in 2020. The University also signed a second renewable contract in 2020 under the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project 2 - detailed below. In 2020, RMIT's existing solar 603kW PV portfolio generated 595,000kWh of renewable electricity. RMIT's energy savings working group focused on closely tracking electricity demand across the campus throughout the COVID-19 lockdowns. As Victorian Government restrictions were implemented buildings were taken offline, the change in electricity demand was monitored to ensure all unnecessary equipment was off during these times. Under the Australian operational emissions profile, RMIT accounts for all energy and emissions produced and consumed within the building profile. RMIT calculate all buildings emissions (Scope 1 and 2 emissions, intensity and reductions) according to the appropriate Australian Government factors, aligning with those under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act. All targets are based on a 2007 baseline when the RMIT operational emissions were 78,120 tCO2-e. RMIT includes a complete picture of all emissions in subsequent sections. Melbourne Renewable Energy Project 2 RMIT demonstrated sustainability leadership through leading the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project 2 (MREP2). Building on the success of the first MREP 1 project, RMIT and six partners used their combined purchasing power to source wind energy produced in regional Victoria. The group consisted of RMIT, Cbus Property, ISPT, Mondelez Australia, Deakin University, Fulton Hogan and Citywide Asphalt, committed to purchasing a contract volume of 110 GWh of renewable electricity per annum. This is equivalent to providing renewable energy to power more than 22,000 Australian households every year. It will reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 123,000 tonnes a year, which is comparable to taking nearly 28,000 cars off the road.Following a rigorous procurement process in line with RMIT policy and probity procedures, the MREP2 deal was signed in June 2020 to source wind energy produced at the Yaloak South Wind Farm near Ballan. The MREP2 deal sees a further 22 RMIT buildings being powered by 100% carbon neutral electricity from January 2021. This is RMIT's second large-scale renewable energy contract to date.

RMIT aims to expand the reporting of emissions over time to encompass scope 1, 2 and 3, including upstream and downstream emissions associated with the University's operations. \u0083Scope 1 are direct emissions, primarily fuel combustion on-site and fleet vehicles under the control of RMIT. \u0083Scope 2 are indirect emissions from the purchase and use of electricity by RMIT. \u0083Scope 3 are all other indirect emissions from RMIT activities, occurring from sources that are outside the ownership or control of the University. RMIT is developing environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) approaches to scope 3 emissions reporting and intends to publish data in future sustainability reports as these methodologies mature. The following table captures RMIT's complete emissions profile including data from the RMIT Vietnam campus, fleet vehicles, employee travel, waste to landfill, water consumption, transmission and distribution losses. This marks the first full public disclosure of this extended profile in the Sustainability Annual Report.

Environmental Management Materials and waste RMIT University is committed to leading the shift to a circular economy that values resources and thinks holistically about systems, processes and supply chains. The circular economy aims to transform the current mindset of the take-make-waste linear model towards circularity, where waste and pollution are eliminated through good design, and the life of existing materials is prolonged through new and innovative ways of repairing, reusing and remanufacturing. Guided by the Waste Management Plan, RMIT aims to improve waste management practices across the campuses. The plan is designed to divert waste from landfill by following the waste hierarchy of avoidance, minimisation and recycling. The RMIT Australian waste profile consists of operational waste from collection points throughout its campuses and construction and demolition (C&D) waste from projects. Data is collated from various contractors throughout the year. Waste data does not include Vietnam operations, although Vietnam staff are introducing management systems that may result in greater levels of data capture. RMIT's operational waste contractor reports on waste to landfill, mixed-recycling, paper/cardboard and organic waste from all on-shore campuses. Operational waste excludes confidential paper waste which is collected separately. In 2020, RMIT Australian operations produced a total of 498 tonnes of waste and had a diversion rate of 23.1 per cent. The overall waste profile was down 60% on 2019 levels, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the move to remote learning. The landfill waste produced is equal to 7.5kg per student. Operational Waste ProfileIn 2020, RMIT collected C&D waste data from all capital development projects. RMIT has been applying circular economy principles to capital projects to continue avoiding waste and strengthen reuse, setting a benchmark to recycle 90 per cent of all construction and demolition waste. C&D waste data is provided by the principal contractor on each of RMIT's capital projects. In 2020, RMIT had 18 active capital development projects providing C&D waste data. From these projects, 499 tonnes of waste was produced and 90 per cent was diverted from landfill, with only 48kg of waste sent to landfill. RMIT reduces waste from capital development projects by putting circular economy principles into practice, such as prioritising the reuse and upcycle furniture before buying new items.

The objective of the campaign was to increase individual awareness about the current littering situation and to reimagine a cleaner Vietnam for our children. The idea of a #motothung was born for this purpose. Each motothung can be placed on a motorbike and serves as a mobile trash can, so people have a convenient place for their rubbish all the time. The students shared their opinions about the project, with many acknowledging the dire littering situation in Vietnam. Students threw their support behind the campaign and agreed to start using it, to work towards a cleaner Vietnam.It can cause pollution, undermining the beauty of Vietnam. RMIT Student 57 Flights COVID-19 had a significant impact on air travel around the world. In 2020, RMIT saw the number of flights taken drop by 98%, this was primarily due to the early response by the University and the subsequent travel restrictions imposed by the Australian Government. Consequently, RMIT's scope 3 emissions from domestic and international travel dropped to 279 tCO2-e, the lowest levels recorded. Management Systems In 2020, RMIT Property Services achieved re-certification of their Integrated Management System, which brings together quality, environment and occupational health & safety. Property Services is also certified under the Asset Management Standard and is externally audited against the new ISO 41001 Facility Management Standard for the management of its building services. RMIT University Property Services is formally certified and externally audited against the following ISO standards: \u0083ISO 9001 Quality Management \u0083ISO 14001 Environmental Occupational Health and Safety Management \u0083ISO 55001 Asset Management Alignment to these international standards provides greater assurance of service delivery outcomes to RMIT's students, staff, contractors and other stakeholders. Sustainable Transport RMIT encourages healthy and active lifestyles through sustainable transport choices. RMIT generates significant travel with 50,000 staff and students travelling almost every day for work and study in a standard year. RMIT's approach to sustainable transport is guided by the Integrated Sustainable Transport Plan which provides the framework to enable and motivate more staff and students to walk, ride and use public transport. RMIT is well served by public transport (trains, trams and buses) at the three Australian campuses. RMIT University is a key interface point with Rail Projects Victoria for the delivery of the Metro Tunnel project. The Metro Tunnel will provide more train services for students, staff and visitors whilst strengthening connections between RMIT campuses. The University provides a range of high-quality cycling infrastructure to encourage students and staff to ride to campus. This includes secure bike parking and comprehensive change facilities, as well as many bike hoops available across all onshore campuses. RMIT has a total of 787 secure bike parks available: City campus Building 51 Bike Hub 400 spaces Building 80 Bike Parking 90 spaces Building 100 Bike Parking 12 spaces Building 106 Bike Parking 132 spaces Building 108 Bike Parking 24 spaces Brunswick campus Building 514 Bike Cage 57 spaces Bundoora campus Building 202 Bike Cage 40 spaces Building 253 Bike Cage 32 spaces RMIT supports new staff and students to cycle through a series of bike workshops available throughout the year, run by student clubs and external providers. RMIT also support key cycling events throughout the year such as Ride to Uni day.58 Sustainability Annual Report 2020Water RMIT is committed to reducing water use intensity across the campuses, through a focus on water efficiency, harvesting and reuse. RMIT prioritises water efficiency in the RMIT Design Standards, by setting minimum standards for fixtures and fitting, encouraging water capture and storage and introducing water sensitive urban design in landscaping. In 2020, RMIT consumed 182,503 kilolitres of potable water, this was significantly influenced by COVID-19 and the move to remote learning. The operational split between water consumption was: \u0083Australian campuses consumed 136,265 kilolitres. \u0083Vietnam campuses consumed 46,238 kilolitres. RMIT does not record consumption volumes from alternative water sources, such as those harvested from stormwater or captured from rainwater. While these sources are used, they are not directly measured, instead, their use offsets the University's requirements for potable water and is reflected by lower potable water consumption levels. The water consumption levels at the Australian campuses represent a 56 per cent reduction in water consumption intensity per EFTSL compared to 2007. RMIT has a total of 40 smart meter devices installed across the building portfolio, giving visibility to consumption profiles. As well as the smart meter devices, RMIT has a total capacity of 1.3 million litres of on-site storage tanks, reducing requirements for potable water usage. The on-site storage allows for the capture of rainwater and stormwater, typically for use in toilet flushing or irrigation. At the Bundoora Campus RMIT captures stormwater in natural basins, when the water levels are high enough the excess water is used in cooling tower applications on the campus In 2020, the University installed a total of 524 sensors to existing bathroom taps, as part of the University response to COVID in reducing the number of touch points in high traffic locations. This project also reduced the consumption of potable water as the more efficient taps are on for a shorter periods of time. 2018 2019 2020Waste (tonnes) 50,000 0100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000 Vietnam water consumption (kL)Australian water consumption (kL)59 9.3. Sustainable Buildings Sustainable Buildings on Campus The RMIT Sustainable Design Principles provide specific guidance for designers and consultants in capital projects to ensure industry best practice sustainable outcomes are achieved throughout the lifecycle of RMIT's new and existing spaces. RMIT aims to achieve sustainable outcomes in capital projects by encouraging design and operation practices that promote: \u0083passive design to reduce building energy consumption \u0083materials selection that prioritise low toxicity \u0083low environmental impact materials \u0083supply chain transparency \u0083principles of a circular economy \u0083active and sustainable transport \u0083good health and wellbeing for all occupants These outcomes are embedded in the project management processes and the RMIT Design Standards. As a founding member of the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA), RMIT has a longstanding commitment to the Green Star rating tool. RMIT ensures that changes to the built environment demonstrate leadership excellence in sustainable design and innovation. RMIT values the Green Star framework, as a clear and consistent model to recognise sustainability achievements and targets a minimum 5-star Green Star As-Built certification for all new developments and significant refurbishments.Below is a list of all RMIT Green Star rated projects: Project Rating Rating Tool Year Building 106 OurPlace5 Star Interiors V1.2 2021 New Academic Street (Buildings 8, 10, 12 & 14)5 Star Interiors (pilot) 2017 Building 231 Bundoora West Student Accommodation5 Star Multi-Unit Residential (legacy tool)2015 Building 100 Design Hub5 Star Education Design Rating V1 (legacy tool)2012 Building 80 Swanston Academic Building5 Star Education Design Rating V1 (legacy tool)2012 Building 224 Bundoora West Lecture Theatre4 Star Education Design Rating V1 (legacy tool)2011 Building 55 Advanced Manufacturing Precinct5 Star Education Design Rating V1 (legacy tool)2011 Building 1 Francis Ormond Building5 Star Office Design Rating V2 (legacy tool)2010 60 Sustainability Annual Report 2020OurPlace OurPlace is the University's workplace for operational staff and the space was designed to bring people together and help them connect. OurPlace is located at 222 Lonsdale Street, centralising over 1,000 RMIT staff members into one collaborative workspace, occupying over 10,000m2 over three levels. OurPlace is an activity-based workplace, providing a range of work settings where people have the choice to work in the best space for the type of work they are doing. Indigenous Reconciliation was a key objective of OurPlace and was a fundamental part of the architect's design work. Throughout the design process, the OurPlace designers worked closely and often with Boon Wurrung elder N'Arwee't Dr Carolyn Briggs AM and the Indigenous Education and Engagement Team. The materials and colours in the spaces represent the six Boon Wurrung seasons. The five-star Green Star Interiors v1.2 certified fitout was assessed against nine holistic impact categories including management, indoor environment quality, energy, transport, water, land-use and ecology, emissions and innovation. The Green Star certification has demonstrated that the design, construction and operations of OurPlace has met \"Australian excellence\" in sustainability standards. OurPlace was designed with health and wellbeing in mind, with indoor spaces having fresh air and ample natural daylight. The lighting control has been designed to maximise natural daylight in the space. Particulate and toxins from paints, sealants, carpets, furniture and cleaning products have been minimised wherever possible and the furniture selected was required to have strong third-party sustainability and ergonomic ratings. Indoor plants have been evenly distributed throughout the building to improve indoor environment quality and ensure that people still feel connected to nature when they are inside. 100% of OurPlace electricity comes from renewable energy supplied from the RMIT supported Crowlands Wind Farm in regional Victoria, procured under MREP1 (see section 9.1). OurPlace is automated to ensure that energy and water consumption is minimised, this includes temperature control, lighting control and the shutdown of IT and AV equipment after hours. Additionally, kitchen appliances were selected based on their energy efficiency rating. The base building also offers end of trip facilities to RMIT staff working within the building, this facility is offered as part of the building's lease arrangements. The end of trip facilities located on level B1, offer showers, change facilities, large lockers and amenities to assist staff in choosing a sustainable commute. The bike storage facility is capable of holding 132 bikes securely with direct access to the staff lifts. RMIT has similar facilities available at the large central Bike Hub, located in Building 51. 61 9.4. Procurement As one of Australia's largest tertiary institutions, RMIT has a significant impact through the University's operational footprint and supply chain. This allows the University to leverage its buying power to drive improved practices in the supply chain and support the strategic objective of shaping the world. Guided by the Sustainable Procurement Plan, RMIT integrates sustainability considerations into its procurement practices including processes, responsibilities and governance. The University's approach to sustainable procurement is aligned with the international standard, ISO 20400:2017 Sustainable procurement - guidance (ISO 20400). The standard defines sustainable procurement as \"procurement that has the most positive environmental, social and economic impacts possible over the entire life cycle\". RMIT is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and is committed to applying its Ten Principles that establish fundamental responsibilities of business in the areas o human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The RMIT Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework is applied in the procurement process to meet these principles and to ensure that suppliers meet the minimum requirements regarding their own ethical practices. The CSR framework includes a comprehensive screening process for all prospective suppliers and the signing of the RMIT Supplier Code of Conduct as a requirement of the contract process. All tenders have a weighting for sustainability, Indigenous and student engagement outcomes and sustainability outcomes are also driven through the contract management process with existing vendors. Overall RMIT expenditure in 2020 significantly dropped due to the pandemic, with the largest categories of third-party spend being in IT operations and projects, the implementation of the new Enterprise Resource Platform and the repairs and maintenance of University buildings. Key sustainability highlights: \u0083RMIT's major facilities management agreement with Airmaster Australia resulted in the employment of 29 apprentices in 2020. \u0083Approximately 10% of RMIT catering expenditure in 2020 was with the three Indigenous and two non-profit enterprises on the RMIT Catering Panel. \u008388% of all RMIT office paper purchases in 2020 were carbon neutral certified products. In 2020, overall Australian spend on office consumables was lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 and most staff working from home for much of the year. Products supplied by Indigenous companies were also actively pursued and added to the RMIT office supplies contract as and when available. RMIT retendered the office supplies and general consumables contract. The tender evaluation criteria focused on fair trade, recycled, reusable and Indigenous-produced goods, reinforcing RMIT's commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The responsible sourcing framework, developed for the Campus Store, was activated in 2020 to improve sustainability and minimise ethical risks in the supply chain. This led to some positive changes, with vendors unwilling to engage removed from the vendor list and a range of dynamic and sustainable companies added and promoted. Work continued with Ngarara Willim and key student groups to showcase and stock community and student-designed products. 62 Sustainability Annual Report 20209.5. Philanthropy and Investments A tertiary education can transform the lives of students, giving them the opportunity to access knowledge and pursue their passion. RMIT Philanthropy RMIT Philanthropy connects the University's community of supporters - donors, staff, alumni, industry partners and students - with University initiatives they are passionate about to deliver strategic funding and support that advances RMIT's ambitions. To effectively manage and further the impact of donations, the executive-led Philanthropy Committee is responsible for managing the RMIT Philanthropy Fund, including implementing the RMIT Responsible Investment Principles. These principles work to ensure that in addition to financial considerations, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues are taken into account when making investment decisions. Ninety-nine per cent of philanthropic funds are managed by Russell Investments, and the other one per cent is invested by RMIT in managed seed investment funds to support start-up companies. As a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, Russell Investments has a sound awareness of ESG factors, allowing RMIT to benefit from their deep expertise in investment strategies and create a spectrum of investment opportunities. Managed by the Philanthropic Fund Committee a total of $2.8m of philanthropic funds were disbursed across RMIT in 2020. RMIT provided 611 philanthropic scholarships, 30 technology grants were supported for vocational students as well as 8,000 relief grants to students during the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, 400 students received philanthropically funded emergency food and care packages. Responsible Investment The RMIT Responsible Investment Principles guide the University's investment managers to ensure that the portfolio minimises activities that have a material impact on climate change, including involvement in fossil fuels, while screening for issues relating to public health and wellbeing. RMIT also monitors the portfolio in relation to globally accepted norms on corporate sustainability behaviours to ensure the University can meet its commitments to the UN Global Compact. RMIT's investment manager Russell Investments is a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment. RMIT has worked with its external investment manager Russell Investments to launch a new sustainable fund, marking the final step in minimising investments with a material impact on climate change. The new Russell Investments Sustainable Global Shares Fund ex Fossil Fuels Fund excludes companies with carbon reserves and companies which derive material revenue from fossil fuel-related activities. As at 31 December 2020, RMIT held $89m in philanthropic funds across a range of investments, including equities, bonds and cash. 100% of the equity component of the RMIT philanthropic funds are invested in two responsible investment products: \u0083The Russell Investments Australian Responsible Investment ETF fund is weighted towards companies that demonstrate positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) characteristics. It negatively screens for companies that have significant involvement in a range of activities including fossil fuels, tobacco, gambling and controversial weapons. \u0083The Russell Investments Sustainable Global Shares Fund ex Fossil Fuels maintains a reduced carbon exposure, whilst also increasing exposure to renewable energy. The Fund excludes companies with fossil fuel reserves, as well as companies with significant involvement in fossil fuels. The fund of international shares is designed for investors who value environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations within the investment decision-making process, particularly those related to climate change risk. Other ESG exclusions include controversial weapons and tobacco companies. This fund change marks the final step in achieving RMIT's commitment to ensuring that the portfolio minimises activities that have a material impact on climate change, including involvement in fossil fuels, as outlined in the RMIT Responsible Investment Principles.63 10.
