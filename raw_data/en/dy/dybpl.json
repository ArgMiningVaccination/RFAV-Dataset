Coca invented an elaborate method to diagnose a new kind of \"allergy\" by testing the pulse rate. He thought \"allergies\" were the underlying cause of most disease. His method has never been tested, but there is every reason to think it is bogus.

A colleague of mine gave a small, rueful shake of her head to the person on her other side. Apparently I had erred.
