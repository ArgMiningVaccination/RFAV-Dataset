Linda Segall, Editor-in-ChiefEDITORIAL Twenty years ago, affirmative action was a hot phrase for government contractors. If a business did any kind of dealings with the federal government, it had to have a written affirmative action plan (AAP) \u2014 and actively work toward recruiting, hiring, training, and promoting minorities and women. The company where I was employed had an AAP that had to be updated each year. The updating literallytook months of one employee's time because she had toreview goals set for the previous year, recordaccomplishments, and set new goals. As the company's new HR manager, I reviewed the plan and was appalled to see little change from year toyear. I discovered the reason why: Our AAP was anunintentional but well-kept secret. Neither managersnor the community-at-large knew we wanted to hirewomen and minorities. The AAP was a secret that had to be brought into the open. My staff and I developed an action plan to make the AAP a livinginstrument. Some of the things we did were to: Discuss the situation with each manager. We explained the status, its impact, the manager's obligation, and how we could help; Visit with referral resources. These included local public schools, the state job service, and organizations that worked with minorities and females injob placement; and Hold an affirmative-action open house. We invited community leaders to come to our headquarters, where managers explained the work theirdepartments did, the types of jobs that periodically opened up, and therequirements for those jobs. What we did was effective. The next year's plan showed improvements that continued in the following years. What we did was marketing \u2014 both internal and external. Marketing, I'm sure you know, is more than advertising. It is educating constituents as well as the public about what you do and how it benefits them.What my staff and I did to market affirmative action within my company isexactly the same type of action you can take to market your practice withinyour community. The only difference is the subject matter. Marketing works. Try it. It's better than being the best-kept secret in town.Until next time,Let me know what's Wendy Bautista wbautista@chiroeco.com Assistant Editor Jennifer Whalen jwhalen@chiroeco.com Online Editor Amy Mitchell amitchell@chiroeco.com Art Director Christine Wojton cwojton@chiroeco.com Production Specialist Patty Bradley pbradley@chiroeco.com Director, Web Operations Manuel Lirio mlirio@chiroeco.com Web Developer Juan Correa jcorrea@chiroeco.com Circulation Manager Darryl Arquitte darquitte@chiroeco.com Accountant Nadine Perry Joseph D.

Ask them how to market a wellness practice and you'll learn about a number of approaches. Ask them what not to do, and you'll want to listen closely. Chiropractic Economics asked a number of practice- management consultants what a wellness practice means to them and for advice on what should and should not happen when marketing a wellness practice. DEFINING A WELLNESS PRACTICE Consultants define \"wellness practice\" in a variety of ways. However, one element common to all definitions iseducation. Whether wellness hinges on lifestyle changes, making healthier choices, or changing patients' perspectives ofchiropractic from pain relief to a higher quality of life,education assumes a predominant role. Michelle Geller-Vino , owner and president of MGV Marketing (www.mgvmarketing.com), said a wellnesspractice \"continually educates its patients on becomingaware of and practicing healthy choices to create asuccessful balance in their lives.\" She added, \"Wellness is a choice and a process of seeking more information on how to improve a person'sphysical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmentalwell-being.\" C. J. Mertz, DC, president and CEO of Team WLP \u2014 The Waiting List Practice (www.teamwlp.com), agreed,but added that a wellness-based practice should focus onfamily and provide solutions for thinking well, eating well,and moving well for life. \"A wellness chiropractor will educate patients with tools for lifelong changes,\" said John Heggie, DC, founder and president of Lakeside Chiropractic Seminars,Inc. (www.LakesideSeminars.com). \"This educationshould include stretching exercises, strengtheningexercises, home and office ergonomics, nutrition, healthyeating habits, organic food advice, and stressmanagement.\" Wellness is not just a state of being; it is the doctor's wellness philosophy reflected in the services offered andembraces the principles of a healthy life, stated Mark Sanna, DC, CEO of Breakthrough Coaching (www.mybreakthrough.com), and Len Schwartz, DC, president and CEO of ChiroPractice Marketing Solutions(www.ChiroPracticeMarketingSolutions.com). Timothy J. Gay, DC, director of Ultimate Practice (www.ultimatepractice.com), said \"A wellness practice istalking to patients about the things they can do beyondchiropractic care and how to implement them into their lives.\" MARKETING A WELLNESS PRACTICE The consultants offer a variety of suggestions on how to market a wellness practice. Among them: Attend or hostexternal events, offer a wide variety of wellness services,hold internal events, hire a public-relations firm, andproperly advertise. Provide external events. President of Integrity Management (www.integritymanagement.com), Keith Maule, along with John Madeira, DC, of Madeira Success Strategies (www.MadeiraSuccess.com), believecommunity outreach programs are some of the best waysto market your practice. Speaking engagements at health fairs, local chambers of commerce, expos, libraries, local businesses, andcorporations, as well as giving wellness talks, healthscreenings, and attending conferences, all maximize yourexposure and build brand awareness. \"Doing lectures on any topic, such as arthritis, digestive problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue, promoted as awellness solution to these problems is the way to presentnot only oneself, but to reshape the way people perceiveyou,\" said David Singer, DC, founder of David Singer Enterprises (www.davidsingerenterprises.com). \"Knowinghow to present a wellness program not only allows you todouble and triple your new patients, but also allows you tobecome involved with corporate America on a levelwhich only wellness programs could provide.\" External events, or events that take place outside of your practice, also provide opportunities to network withhealthcare professionals that provide noncompetitiveservices and/or services for which you provide synergy. Jason A. Deitch, DC, chief wellness officer for The Masters Circle and co-author of Discover Wellness(www.DiscoverWellnessCenter.com), said, \"The mostcost-effective and time-efficient way to educate people isthrough professional, informative, and inspiring wellnesspresentations ... in the office, at local employers,churches, community centers, and other providers'offices.\" Offer other services. In addition to chiropractic, the consultants suggest offering nutritional evaluations,supplements, massage, acupuncture, physical therapy,biofeedback, Pilates, and yoga. They also suggest CONTINUED CHEC2p25.ps 1/16/08 10:40 PM Page 2526 C HIROPRACTIC VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008COVER providing ongoing educational programs related to nutrition,stretching and strengtheningexercises, ergonomics, stressmanagement and reduction, andweight loss. Host internal events. Events held in your office can includehosting dinners for patients and theirfriends or co-workers, so they canlearn more about the benefits ofchiropractic care. Other internalevents include sending e-newsletters,posting articles in your office or onyour Web site, mailing out awellness-oriented newsletter, andconducting special \"health\" days orevents in your practice every month. Deitch added that DCs who offer educational material providecontinuing education, and then stayin touch with people throughperiodic e-mail newsletters. Theyposition themselves to becomeperceived as \"the\" wellness resourcein the community. Hire a PR team. According to Laura Carabello, principal of CPR Strategic Marketing Communications(www.cpronline.com), \"Hiring aneffective public relations team is keyto building your practice and reachingyour market segments.\" She said a PRteam can help you create specificmedia announcements, events, pressreleases, and media advisories whichwould target consumers, local townmedia, and even mainstream nationalmedia to spread the word about yourwellness practice. Advertise properly. \"When a member of the general public sees asign on a chiropractic office (oranywhere else) that says 'WellnessCenter,'\" said Ty Talcott, DC, president of Power Strategies Inc.(www.powerstrategies.us), \"they haveno idea what to expect if they wereto walk in the door \u2014 therefore, alltoo often, their reaction is, 'Whywalk in the door?'\" Talcott and Gay believe that to be successful, you need to properlyadvertise properly the specificbenefits an individual will gain byvisiting your facility. Carabello said not to be vague about the services you offer: Specifyon your Web site or within youroffice the variety and types ofservices you offer to clients, so theyunderstand the full array of what youprovide. ACTIVITIES TO AVOID In a perfect world, there would be no mistakes. Since we do not live ina perfect world, the consultants offeradvice on things to avoid whenmarketing your wellness practice. Avoid focusing on symptoms. According to Shawn Powers, DC, CIRCLE 221FREE INFORMATIONCHEC2p26.ps 1/16/08 10:41 PM Page 26VOL54: I SSUE 2 11, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 27of Powersource Coaching (www.powersourcecoaching.com),you want to avoid focusing ontreating conditions or symptoms. \"Ido not use a symptom-oriented casehistory,\" she said. \"If a new practicemember has a symptom or condition,I ask for permission to explain howthe body works before discussinganything, so they have a better knowledge base to make their family's healthcare decisions.\" Madeira and Mertz also said to stay away from symptom-basedadvertising. \"Make sure not to market or teach on symptomatic-relief care or youwill destroy any chance of becominga highly successful wellness center,\"said Mertz. Heggie agreed by and low-back pain common roads chiropractors useto attract new patients into theiroffice. But, the fact is, this type ofadvertising promotes short-termpatients. When the patient's pain isgone and the patient feels theyreceived what they were looking for,they will terminate care.\" Avoid improper names. \"An effective branding strategy beginswith an evaluation of the practicename, logo, and image the officeprojects,\" advised Deitch. \"Marketingexperts agree that if a DC is seekingto position a practice as a 'wellnesspractice,' then the word wellnessshould be in the name of thepractice.\" Gay agreed, \"If you want to make your practice a wellness-basedpractice, then put wellness in yourclinic name and also involve othernatural healthcare practitioners.\" Lawton W. Howell, CEO of WellnessOne Corporation(www.wellnessone.net), said the firstkey step is the right brand name.\"When your brand name is focusedon 'chiropractic,' such as JonesChiropractic, the unstated message isthat you only provide chiropracticcare, not holistic or wellness care.\" Singer said practitioners need to change not only the name of theirpractices, but also their signs,stationery, cards, and programs.Doing so sends a consistent message. Don't limit yourself. If you are going to market yourself a wellnesspractice, then don't limit yourself toone or two services, said Talcott. \"In CONTINUED Learn how one DC refocused and rebranded her practice. Go to www.ChiroEco.com/warden. CIRCLE 187FREE INFORMATIONCHEC2p27.ps 1/18/08 9:14 AM Page 27other words, say what you do and do what you say. If you are going to be all-encompassing, then potentially labelyourself as a wellness practice.\" Singer said that when doctors of chiropractic market themselves as chiropractors they have to accept the imageor branding that the vast majority of people have of whoand what a chiropractor is. \"They perceive chiropractic asa limited specialty within the area of back treatment.

LAST WORDS OF ADVICE \"To achieve the desired results of a wellness clinic, the doctor must have a good report of findings and do properre-exams to help support the treatment as the patientprogresses through care,\" said Ed Sharp, president of Sharp Management Consulting (www.thesharpmanagement.com). \"If patients do not get through theircorrective levels of care, they will not be there to get onto wellness care.\" Mertz suggested visiting a practice that is fully functioning in wellness and begin modeling it. He alsosuggested hiring a coach to determine the correct actionsand strategies that transition a nonwellness practice into ahighly functioning wellness-based practice. \"Building a wellness brand is more than just providing the same chiropractic experience you have alwaysprovided and just adding the word wellness to yourconversations,\" said Deitch. \"It requires a mental andstructural makeover of your communications, procedures,and fee structure.\" Talcott recommended pricing and packaging services to be attractive and self explanatory, highlighting the benefitsto the patient that can be easily explained to others. He also said it is not always profitable to place advertisements in the same sections of the newspaper thatother healthcare professionals use. \"You may find moresuccess placing ads where you see spas, health clubs, yoga,or alternative providers.\" Schwartz summed up marketing by saying, \"DCs who want to have a wellness practice should be doingeverything mentioned earlier \u2014 and they should avoidanything that is inconsistent with those activities.\" Wendy Bautista is an associate editor of Chiropractic Economics.

Malpractice premiums, proposed Medicare reimbursement cuts, and dwindling availability of employer- sponsored health coverage are just a few challenges thatthreaten to shake up many already-fragile bottom lines. Today, it's more important than ever to reach out to new patients in compelling ways that don't cost an armand a leg or take up too much valuable time. Online patient prospecting is a marketing tool many medical professionals have largely ignored because of per-ceptions that personal practice Web sites are too complex,costly, and time-consuming to set up and maintain. The good news is you can market your practice online today through professional associations, insurance plansthat promote affiliated providers, or consumer-focusedphysician-finder Web sites that cater to the public's growingdemand for a faster, easier way to find a local physician. A number of reputable, online physician search engines exist where healthcare practitioners of all specialties cansign up to obtain a variety of free listings across the Webuniverse. Below are the top 10 reasons physicians should strongly consider marketing their practices through an onlinephysician-finder search engine. 1. It's free. Unlike such traditional advertising tools as the newspaper, phone book, or direct mail, many onlinephysician-finder sites advertise your practice at no cost toyou. And there's no charge to prospective patients either. 2. It's targeted. Online Web sites market your services to \"warm\" patient prospects already seeking a newprovider. Some sites let patients post their medicalproblems, so appropriate providers can respond toconcerns about cost, quality, experience, hours, or practicephilosophy upfront. This enhances the patient's chances of finding the right provider before taking up time at the doctor's office, and10 good reasons to market your practice online By Allison GuimardCHEC2p42.ps 1/16/08 10:52 PM Page 42VOL54: I SSUE 2 EBRUARY 11, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 43increases the provider's opportunities for finding a \"patient for life.\" 3. It's appealing to private pay. Many patients who are looking beyond their health maintenance organization(HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) providerdirectories have conceded their insurance plan doesn'tcover services they need. Because they plan to pay out-of-pocket, they shop for a provider who voluntarily posts office fees or will providean estimate for basic services. Some physician-finder siteslet you post basic office charges or communicate aboutpricing via e-mail. This need for price transparency is growing so rapidly that the American College of Physicians and a number ofother physician organizations now recommend membersvoluntarily provide retail prices to self-paying patients forthe 10 most commonly provided services and procedures. 4. It's differentiating. Many patients seek doctors who are in sync with the times and can communicate online,yet most physicians cannot. In a 2007 survey of more than4,000 Americans, 62 percent of respondents said theirdoctor didn't offer even the most basic of Internet tools.Frustrated patients couldn't e-mail them, schedule anappointment online, or check a Web site for informationon the practice or the doctor's credentials. By utilizing technology to advertise your practice, you project an image of a contemporary practitioner who is insync with technology and, thus, likely to also be in syncwith the latest medical news and practices. 5. It's responsive to market demands. The rapid growth of consumer-directed healthcare and the decline ofemployer-sponsored health insurance are driving the publicto make more informed and cost-conscious healthcarechoices. Online physician listings enable consumers torapidly find local physicians and identify those whoseservices and prices are in line with their needs. 6. It's easy. Do you have 10 minutes? Then register online at a physician-finder Web site. Simply sign in andfill out as much or as little information as you want, thenpost your practice and let patients find you. Remember, themore information you provide about your hours, specialty,years in practice, office visit fees, and other items, the CONTINUED CHEC2p43.ps 1/16/08 10:53 PM Page 4344 C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008MARKETING To assure the best response possible for your listing, pay attention to these three guidelines. 1. Enroll with active, growing online sites. How do you find thesesites? Start by checking with nationalassociations with which you areaffiliated. Some may offer listings aspart of your membership fee. In addition, huge consumer- health Web sites offer freeopportunities to list your practiceonline. There are many other newand growing sites that also providefree listings for you. Simply go onthe Internet and type \"find localdoctors,\" \"find to get anoverview of sites that connectpatients to physicians. Explore a few sites, and then enroll in several. Remember:Consumers are online continuouslylooking for free healthcareinformation and provider referrals.The more free sites that carry yourlisting the greater your chances forlocal referrals. 2. Advertise consumer-friendly features. Consumers are preoccupied with three key issueswhen choosing a healthcareprovider: Cost, convenience, andexpertise. Cost is a key issue as consumers get squeezed out of employer-paidhealth plans and the cost of caregoes up. Providers who can giveconsumers a general price for anoffice visit or can quote priceparameters for basic treatments willhave an advantage compared tothose who don't. Cost parameterscan give patients peace of mindthat they won't be shocked whenit's time to pay the bill. Convenience means different things to different people. Mostimportant are your office location,hours, flexibility in scheduling, andparking or closeness to a nearbybus line. If you have extendedhours, be sure to advertise them. Likewise, if you accept emergency or last-minute patientappointments, also tout thisconvenience. If your office offersfree parking or you are near a busor train line, let patients know.Other special features, such as freebottled water or a \"play center\" forkids, will also set your practice apartfrom others.

It's flexible. Unlike an ad in a phone book or newspaper, which hasvery limited space, online Webportals provide the opportunity tooffer as much information about yourpractice as you want, includingwhat's important to prospectivepatients, such as how long you'vebeen practicing, whether you'reaccepting new patients, and evenwhat your basic office fees are. 8. It's efficient. Traditional advertising requires contracts, contractrenewals, tracking, billing, filing, andmoney. With an online posting, thereis no paperwork, no contract, noinvoice, and no money required. 9. It offers a risk-free payoff. Physicians who become early adoptersof online technology and utilize free,online listing sites can reap therewards of an expanded marketingreach and a growing patient base \u2014with virtually no investment risk. 10.

Clients aren't walking in noticeably heavier or lighter, or complaining of new aches or pains. But they are changing in a way that could cost your practice serious money, unless you act now to prevent it. What has changed? Today's buying public \u2014 consumers of everything from DVD players to healthcare \u2014 has undergone a dramatic shift in the way they do business. Theday of the mass market is rapidly fading into the golden glowof history. Today's consumer is firmly ensconced in the longtail \u2014 a phenomenon described by best-selling author ChrisAnderson in his book of the same name, The Long Tail. In his book, he outlines the cycle of specialization and niche marketing, largely inspired by the technologicalchanges wrought by the Internet. The public has been trained, Anderson argues, to expect products and services targeted exactly to theirwants and needs \u2014 no matter how obscure those wantsand needs might be. Many service providers \u2014 especially those in the healthcare and wellness field \u2014 have been takingadvantage of this phenomenon for years. By marketingthemselves as experts in their field, they have managed tofind riches in niches. Niche marketers succeed by combining their professional skills with personal passion, focusing on the area of theirpractice that brings the most satisfaction and financialreward. Finding a successful niche is an art and a science,and relies in large part in finding the target audience mostsuited to the healthcare you want to provide. Let's take a look at how the cultural changes brought about by the niche marketplace have changed your clients: They want what they want. Customers are no longer satisfied with one-size-fits-all service providers.Instead, and in increasing numbers, the public is seekingprofessionals who specialize in the particular issue thatconcerns them. This may be pediatric care, sports-related injuries,chronic pain, or other narrowly defined specializations. They expect to pay more. With the expert cach\u00e9 comes an expert price tag. Strongly ingrained in the trendtoward niched service providers is the expectation ofhigher prices for specialized services. This, of course, is incredibly beneficial for those service providers who may be offering the same exact services astheir generalist contemporaries, but marketing themselvesdifferently. They are online. Today's consumers \u2014 no matter what generation you're targeting, from the young athleteto the active senior \u2014 begin their research in one place:Online. Having an effective online presence \u2014 whichincludes a Web site, inclusion on targeted vertical searchengines, and participation in relevant online communities\u2014 is essential if you want your practice to enjoymaximum profitability. They are skeptical. Raised on media, and with a healthy distrust of everything they read, hear, and see,consumers are increasingly placing reliance on word-of-mouth referrals. This is staggering, considering research tellsus that 87 percent of all business is driven by word-of-mouthreferrals.

What portion of your income do they represent? According to Chiropractic Economics 10th Annual Salary & Expense Survey, respondents say less than 3 percent of revenues come from the sale of retail products.If you are \"average,\" why don't you sell more? The classic answer is, \"I don't like to sell\" or \"I don't like to push. I am a doctor, not a salesman.\" People have a lot of misconceptions about selling. The original meaning of \"sell\" was \"to give.\" Later, it took onthe negative meaning of \"to cheat\" or \"to betray.\"Although today it is defined as \"to persuade,\" manysuccessful people prefer to think of selling as helping. What do top sales professionals do that others do not? What is it about them that makes their customers (orpatients) want to buy from them? Selling has nothing to do with special techniques or \"magic.\" Nor are salespeople \"born.\" You can sell \u2014 and feel comfortable about doing so. Just keep in mind thesethree \"secrets.\"1. Selling starts by acknowledging your patients' wants. In today's market conditions, the patient does not buy what he needs; he buys what he wants. Desire is much stronger than need in a marketplace in which the power of choice becomes your biggest barrier toa close. Your challenge is to discover what can trigger animpulse or a strong, unbearable desire to make a buyingdecision in your favor. Your success in selling yourtreatment or product depends on your ability to make thecustomer want to buy from you and not from someone else. The first thing a patient buys is trust. He buys confidence about your ability and desire to help himresolve a problem, pain, or discomfort. If he does not trustyou and does not feel confident in what you say, he willfind what he is seeking somewhere else. Your challenge is to demonstrate early in the appointment that you care more for him than his money. 2. Buying decisions are emotional \u2014 not logical. Consider all of your arguments on why your patients shouldfollow your treatment plan or purchase a particular product. No matter how good or how strong your arguments are, other chiropractors are probably using the same argument.Relying on your best argument to persuade a patient doesnot make you any different from your competition. And,using the same arguments as others is confusing to patients. Most salespeople work the customer in a superficial zone; the zone of logics. They do not understand thatpeople do not buy based on logic. Buying \u2014 in healthcare\u2014 is always more emotional than logical.

Arguments only trigger\"thinking\" or counter-arguments. Patients want to feel as though they are making the right decision.To make them feel confident, youneed conviction because patientsbuy your dedication to find the rightsolution for their pain, discomfort, orconcern. Instead of using logical arguments with patients, convert yourarguments into emotional triggers. For example: Assume you have a great superfood-based product, knownto reduce fat and environmentaltoxicity (two good arguments). Yourpatient is overweight and suffers fromrespiratory problems in addition tochronic low-back pain. Your challenge is to figure out how your patient's conditions affect herlife. In other words, why could it beemotionally important for thispatient to use your superfoodproduct? Do her conditions affect hersocial life? Could you ask her that?Or, does she feel tired during the day,unable to focus because of chokingand coughing? These are examples of emotional subjects related to the product. If youcan use your patient's emotionalsubjects and then demonstrate thatyour mission is to help her handle orresolve them, she will want to buyfrom you. 3. The most important quality in selling is curiosity. Everyone has heard that a good salesperson needsto be enthusiastic, convinced abouther product, persistent, caring,honest, passionate, and dedicated.And she must be able to listen, too. All these qualities are definitely needed to succeed. But one qualitysurpasses all others in importance \u2014curiosity. Great salespeople are curious; they are interested. They want to know asmuch as possible about theircustomers or patients \u2014 about theirneeds, personal desires, fears, andconcerns. They want to find outwhat turns their patients on. They also want to know all about their past good and/or badexperiences with similar products or services. Great salespeople do not try to bombard the customer or patientwith arguments. They try to find outthree things: \"Who is this person I am treating?\" \"What are his problems, concerns, likes, and dislikes?\" and \"What are his desires, concerns, or fears relative to my product andservice?\" Remember this truism: The more you know, the more you sell. It is not \"The more I talk, the more I sell,\" as many have beentaught to believe. Consider this: An average salesperson asks between five andeight questions before starting to talkand argue about his product. Successful salespeople reveal they ask from 25 to 40 questions beforepresenting their product or service.Their questions show they aregenuinely interested in their customers. Once you adopt an attitude of genuine curiosity, you will see a bigchange in your profession, as well asin your life. You will soon realize aperson is as successful as he grantsimportance to others.

Arepeople really looking for chiropractors on the Internet? Do youreally need a Web site? The answer tothese important questions is yes. But a Web site, in itself, does not guarantee an increase in patients, even if it has all of the latest \"bells and whistles;\" posts pictures of you, your staff, and your office;and presents your credentials for the public to consider. The reason: Your Web site is a stand-alone entity. Unless potential patients are looking specifically for you,your site may not emerge in a general Web search. Your Web site is similar to other single dimensional search tools, such as an insurance-provider book or theYellow Pages. Insurance-provider book. A provider book lists the name, address, and telephone number of all participatingphysicians. It does not provide any descriptive informationabout you or your practice. When policyholders look for achiropractor, they look geographically and find a name. If a potential patient wants more information, he or she has to call or do additional research. Yellow Pages advertising. An ad in the print version of the Yellow Pages advertising directory generallyhas no more than 100 words to explain you, yourservice(s), and where your practice is located. The print ad describes in a limited way your practice, but again, if a potential patient wants additional information,he or she has to do additional calling or research.

But if you are depending upon technology alone to grow your practice, you will be disappointed. Technology can't do that; growing your practice is up to you. You can, however, use technology to your advantage in your marketing strategy. Technology can be viewed as a new solution to old problems, and new solutions always have appeal. Use thatappeal to attract patients. Here are four ways to market this \"new\" solution: 1. Conduct lectures and seminars. When LASIK surgery for vision correction was first introduced,ophthalmologists found they needed to conduct seminarsand give demonstrations to reassure people of theprocedure's safety. The same principle holds true with technology: Do a \"show and tell\" to introduce your technology to thepublic. Schedule lectures and seminars to provideinformation and possible demonstrations of thetechnology you have incorporated. Let patients andpotential patients see firsthand what will help them.2. Advertise. Either in conjunction with or in addition to your presentations, plan an advertising campaign.Consider flyers, newspaper inserts, radio ads, CDs orDVDs, and direct mail to announce the technology andeducate the public. Plan the advertising campaign as you would any other: Calculate how much return-on-investment you need tomake for the campaign to be successful. Do not makeadvertising a one-shot effort; plan the campaign to sendconsistent information to educate potential patients aboutthe technology and how it can help them. 3. Ask for referrals. Referral is a tried-and-true method of acquiring new patients. When people areexcited about a product because they have experienced itor seen it demonstrated, they tell others. And their\"telling\" is an endorsement of you and your product. Ask patients who have benefited from the technology to refer others to you. 4. Use your internal database. New technology \u2014 whether it is diagnostic or therapeutic \u2014 can bringinactive patients back to your clinic. If you have lostpatients who feel you cannot help them, they will notreturn. But if you offer them a different solution, you maygive inactive patients a reason to come back. Send out letters and/or newsletters (or e-newsletters) to your database of patients, including inactive patients,announcing the new technology and what it offers.Educate and invite them to come in to see the technologyfor themselves.Plug technology into your marketing By David Singer, DC 1/16/08 11:07 VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008MARKETING CONSIDER SEPARATION If the technology you are incorporating lends itself to be a separate business unit, considerseparating its use from the usualbusiness of the clinic \u2014 separatehours, delivery of service, andmarketing. In other words, continue doing business as you always do, but add thenew product or service at separatetimes of the day \u2014 or even better yet\u2014 on different days. Keep the twocompletely separate until you knowall the possible ramifications. For example: Let's say you have an insurance-based practice, but wouldlike to convert to a cash practice. Ifyou tell all of your patients you nolonger accept insurance and they haveto pay cash, you may lose clientele. Instead of trying to convert old patients, introduce the cash conceptto new patients. If the cash conceptis well-received, you will not havedamaged what you are already doing.If it is a disaster, you still have youroriginal practice.

Use the following questions: 1. Can I afford to buy this equipment and use it only on my existing patients? 2. Will I go bankrupt if the new technology does not bring additional revenue? 3. Do I need additional space in my clinic for the equipment? 4. Do I have the time and staff to provide the service, or will I have to hire and train more people? 5. What will it cost me to market this technology?6. Does the technology diagnose or treat problems I believe are prevalent in my community? 7. Does my malpractice insurance cover any possible injuries that might occur? Will my insurance costs go up?

Whether you offer massage, children's services, family chiropractic, or another specialized area of chiropractic services, direct-mail marketing will help you professionallyshare your message with the local community. Here are some strategies to help your direct-mail marketing program be successful: Use quality graphics. Today's consumers are visually oriented. People tend to read advertisements that havecolorful photographs and logos supported by strongheadlines with clear messages. As you make your graphic choices, remember a picture is still worth a thousand words and research has shownthat full-color advertising options can actually increaseredemption rates by 30 percent to 60 percent. Promote with coupons or certificates. If you want to offer specials, make your chiropractic practice couponsas valuable as possible to get a strong response. Promoteyour best chiropractic services with attractive offers andspecial prices. In these coupons or certificates, use strong headlines, such as \"Realign Your Back, Realign Your Life.\" Anothertip: Don't use percentage-off offers. Consumers respondbetter to strong dollars-off discounts and offers than theydo to percent-off incentives. They more readilyunderstand \"$25 Off Any $100 or More Chiropractic CareService or Product Purchase\" than they do \"25% Off AnyPurchase of $100 or More.\" Some examples of special offers or manage your offers, keep rules and disclaimers simple concerning what is not included, such as \"Nodouble discounts. Expires 00/00/08.\" (Use expiration datesof no more than 60 days to 90 days to keep offers timely.) Work with reputable direct-mail marketers. Select a marketer with a proven track record. Many local direct-mail houses can help you create, print, mail, and facilitate your entire piece, while chargingfor these comprehensive services. If you provide yourpatient-mailing list, zip codes, or neighborhoods you wantto target surrounding your chiropractic business, they canfacilitate solo direct-mail campaigns for you. Solo direct mail can be very effective, with costs ranging from 40 cents to $1 per targeted home, depending uponthe flier, magazine, postcard, letter, brochure, or mailingdevice you use. Don't hesitate to ask for samples of workand demographic statistics from their direct-mail database. Although effective, solo direct mail is expensive, considering all of the associated costs for artwork, printing,labels, postage, and handling. An alternative is to createsolo direct-mail pieces yourself \u2014 provided you have thecapabilities to work with software programs to create theartwork, compile the targeted database mailing lists, andfacilitate each of the mailings throughout the year. Another, more cost-effective alternative is cooperative direct mail. At approximately 3 cents to 4 cents per homewith some select high-quality, direct-mail resources,direct-mail marketing can be affordable when you workwith other local businesses in a magazine or a cooperative CONTINUED Attract more patients with direct-mail advertising By Steve Zuckerman VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008MARKETING envelope format. Cooperative direct mailing requires working with a reputable local or national direct-mail resource tofacilitate the direct-mail program foryou. These companies do it all foryou, from complementary marketingconsultations to the creation andmailing of each piece. Direct-mail magazines typically mail to 50,000 homes per targetedmailing area, so you can select thebest ones that will work for yourchiropractic office. A high-qualitydirect-mail magazine option willpotentially cost about 3 cents to 4cents per home, which is much more affordable than most solo direct-mail options. Some of these same direct-mail resources offer detached addresslabel cards and other solo direct-mailoptions. Coupon envelope resources cooperatively mail loose independentcoupons from various local businessesto 10,000 homes per targeted zone. Create annual direct-mail campaigns. Invest in your success by using direct-mail advertising consis-tently throughout the year. Companiesoften offer cost savings when you mailto multiple or larger targeted areaswith annual agreements. Set realistic expectations. Direct mail works, especially withrepetition of strong offers. Like anyother form of advertising andmarketing, however, it usually takes along-term investment. Visit withyour direct-mail consultant to setrealistic expectations so you are notdisappointed. Direct-mail coupons and mini-gift certificates are trackable. If you wantto determine the effectiveness of yourcampaign, ask every patient how theyheard about you. Many patients willbring in the postcards, mailers, andcoupons, but many will respond tothe advertising without bringing inthe coupons or advertisements. Find the right direct-mail company. Many solo, magazine, and cooperative direct-mail resources areavailable. Some offer predesigned postcard formats, special offers, and mailing lists to targeteddemographics and zip codes.

I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008MARKETING CHIRO BIZ QUIZ One of the most versatile and cost-effective marketing toolsavailable to professional practices is direct mail. With thismedium, you can target any group youwant your message to reach. The basic principles for an effective promotion can be summarized by four W's: Who, what, when, and why. Who are you trying to reach? Whether you want to recall patients who haven't been in for a while or are looking to attract new patients, a special offer for directresponse works well. For some promotions, such as those to current patients, you already have the mailing list. But for promotionsoutside of your practice, a good list broker can help youcreate a mailing list targeted to who you want to reach. It is better to rent than to buy the list, as these lists need to be updated frequently. Deal with a broker who isrecommended and reputable. You can also target such referral sources as attorneys and medical doctors instead of individual patients, as onereferral source may produce many new patients. What should you send? For most direct mailings, a letter is the medium of choice. Other common optionsinclude postcards, foldouts, brochures, newsletters, CDs,and DVDs, but a professional-looking letter with tastefulsubheadings in the copy is best for patients and otherprofessionals. Since studies have shown that expensive paper and envelopes do not increase a direct-mail promotion'seffectiveness, use your money for things that do \u2014 such aspersonalizing the envelope and letter. You may think you will save money if your staff does the mailing, but don't. For small mailings, you can usefirst-class mail, but you should use a mailing house. Amailing house will get promotions delivered on time \u2014and your staff can do what they are supposed to do. When should you mail? Experts generally agree it is best to avoid having mail delivered on weekends orholidays, and that midweek is best. In addition, it is bestto avoid the slow season if you live in a seasonal area, andthe entire period from Thanksgiving to New Years. Why should you mail? Direct mail is a science \u2014 and an art. As with other types of promotions, the key isidentifying a need your targeted group has and thenpresenting a better solution. Be careful never to makeunrealistic claims that threaten your credibility and can getyou in trouble with your licensing board. When done correctly direct-mail marketing can significantly increase your name recognition and yourbottom line. Test your knowledge of direct-mail marketing with this short true or false quiz: [ ] 1. It is a good idea to do most of the mailing in-house to save money. [ ] 2. Direct mail can target just about any group.[ ] 3. Except for mailings to current patients, you should use a list compiled for you by a professional. [ ] 4. Expensive stationery increases the professional look and effectiveness of your mailing. Answers. No. 1 and No. 4 are false. No. 1 is false because it is just too labor-intensive for your staff to get outa large mailing and still have time to do their regular jobs. A mailing house will do it correctly and on time, as well as cost-effectively. And No. 4 is false because, asstated earlier, studies have shown that expensivestationery does not increase the effectiveness of a direct-mail promotion. Marc H.

They describe the 1980s as the \"good old days\" of unchallenged insurance reimbursements \u2014 a time when many people were willing to \"give chiropractic a try\" sinceit was covered by insurance. High reimbursements meant a chiropractor could build a dream practice with little skill or attention paid todealing with patients' money issues. If you practiced 25years ago, one of your biggest concerns may have been howto handle the volume of patients that flooded your doors. It was easy to earn a substantial living while having the satisfaction of helping others \u2014 and that is the realbottom line of the \"good old days.\" You'll be happy to know the \"good old days\" are here again; they are just different. Although you can no longerbuild a practice based on high reimbursements frominsurance carriers, you can build a big, profitable,rewarding practice. In fact, the most profitable practices in history exist today in the present healthcare environment. Toaccomplish this, it's necessary to refocus and give peoplewhat they want, instead of telling them what they need.Typically, people do not buy what they need; they buywhat they want. To get the \"good old days\" back \u2014 defined as easily earning a great living while helping others \u2014 you have tooffer patients what they want. In other words, you have tounderstand the difference between how people spend theirown money compared to how they spend someone else'smoney. So, how do they spend their money? Consider: When they want food, they go to a restaurant and order what they want from the menu. When they browse through a catalog, they order what they want. When they go to a spa, they look at the service menu and choose the services they want. In other words, consumers assess their choices and make a selection based on their wants. The message toyou is this: Look at your options and change your basicmodel based on potential-patient wants. You can do thisby changing the way you conduct your consultation andgive your report of findings (ROF) while offering servicesyour patients are willing to pay for.Return of the 'good old days' By Ty Talcott, DC CONTINUED CHEC2p71.ps 1/16/08 11:16 PM Page 7172 C HIROPRACTIC VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PATIENT RELATIONS Change your consultation/ROF. You still have an obligation to tell the patient what is wrong and the care that is needed; however, with the right initialconsultation approach, the patient will end up wantingthe treatment plan and asking for it. (You should refer therare cases in which patients do not want the care.) Let me give you an example: You conduct a consultation and say to a patient, \"This sounds like achiropractic problem. If we don't fix the root cause of thisproblem, you will have an ongoing weak area that will beaggravated every time you overstress the area with work,play, or daily activities, and it will simply get worse overtime.\" When you give this type of \"lecture\" to patients, they do not hear everything you say. Talking in statementscauses a listener to compare what you say to his beliefsand constantly assess whether he believes you or not. So as you are talking, the patient thinks, \"He is wrong. I do things all the time that do not make the conditionworse, and I think it will clear right up. So far, theA laundry list of services people want What services do patients want and are willing to buy? Here is a \"laundry list\" of possibilities, which are offered by a number of differentchiropractic practices throughout the country. Computerized stress management; Programs for seniors (such as fitness or balance); Peak athletic performance enhancement (for children and adolescents); Customized nutritional capsules (formulas customized for individual patients); Migraine program; Knee-treatment program; Adult fitness and yoga; Educational programs (such as healthy eating and weight control); Nutritional weight control; Dizziness program; Research studies; Healthy cooking classes; Specialty chiropractic VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PATIENT RELATIONS condition does not interfere with my work. And what does he mean, 'achiropractic problem'?\" Instead of lecturing \u2014 telling the patient about the consequences ofnot getting the recommendedtreatment \u2014 ask a simple question:\"Mr. Jones, what do you think willhappen if we just treat the symptoms,but don't fix the cause?\" He will likely answer, \"I guess the symptoms will come back.\" That ishis answer, given without doubt or disbelief. Your point is made \u2014 bythe patient. The discipline is in asking the question and waiting for the response. Your reward for stringing the rightquestions together in your initialconsultation is a patient who endsthat visit with two main issues onher mind: \"I hope I have the problemthey treat here, and I hope they areable to accept me as a patient.\" So examine the way in which you conduct your consultation and giveyour report of findings. Do you findyourself selling \u2014 trying to convincepatients to do what you assess theyneed? If so, it is time for a change. Itis very difficult to convince people tobuy what they need when the moneycomes from their own pocket. Do not sell in the ROF . Instead, ask questions during your initialconsultation that lead a patient towant the services rendered in yourclinic. Structure your consultationquestions so your patients come totheir own conclusions that they wantthe type of care you have available inyour office. At that point, your ROFis simply offering them the simplestand easiest way to have what theyalready decided they want. Offer services your patients want beyond handling their chief complaint. The other basic modelchange is to offer multiple services people want and are buyingsomewhere else. If you implement this model, patients will come to your office,select the services they want \u2014including chiropractic care \u2014 andoften pay cash. This allows you tocross-promote multiple services.

Today, many MDs maysuggest over-the-counter antihistamines anddecongestants to relieve the severity of symptoms, butotherwise they do not prescribe additional support unlessa secondary infection develops. THE CHIROPRACTIC APPROACH Chiropractors have long promoted the immune- modulating effects of the chiropractic adjustment. Inaddition to adjustment, however, you have a number ofnatural remedies synergistic to manipulative therapy toprovide to your patients. These remedies can helpalleviate symptoms without exposing patients to drugs. Humidity and hygiene. T wo factors of critical importance in the spread of cold and flu viruses arehumidity and hygiene. Several different mechanisms ofaction have been suggested in regards to humidity,including accumulative distance of aerosol travel, aerosoldroplet size, 5and desiccation of nasal mucosa resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. In one study, low humidity was most conducive to virus transmission, with increased levels of virus shedding seenwith the lowest humidity levels. Humidity higher than 80percent essentially blocked all virus transmission. 6 Basic personal hygiene cannot be overemphasized during cold and flu season. Viruses not only require directentry into the host, but they must also bypass typicalfrontline defenses and be deposited in such tissue aslymphoid or mucosa that allows for viral replication. The simple act of frequent, vigorous hand washing and sanitation of dry contact surfaces significantly inhibit thespread of viral contamination. Nutritional support. While many nutraceuticals have been deemed ineffectual in allopathic studies, a closeexamination of the studies reveals the studies frequentlyuse inferior forms of supplementation, inadequate dosinglevels, or inadequate duration of dosing. Despite media dispersion, many nutritional supplements are favored by chiropractors and like-mindedCAM (complementary and alternative medicine)providers because they have a long history of effective andpractical clinical use. Arabinogalactans have been implicated as immune modu- lators by virtue of their effect on properdin levels. A naturalactivator of the immune system's complement pathway,properdin plays a significant role in nonspecific host defensemechanisms, which include defense against cold and flu. 7Arabinogalactans derived from larch are effective, relatively tasteless, dissolve easily into water or juice, andtherefore are a great option for patients of all ages,including children and seniors. Vitamin C and bioflavonoids have been well documented in their support of healthy immune function. Unlike othermammals, humans do not retain the ability tomanufacture their own vitamin C; however, its presence iscrucial for many different pathophysiological functions,including the synthesis of collagen and the synthesis ofneurotransmitters, including serotonin andnorepinephrine. Vitamin C is also an important structural component of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and bone. Inaddition to being a powerful antioxidant, vitamin C is animportant cofactor in many different biochemicalprocesses and pathways. Although innumerable studies have been performed with vitamin C, some recent studies have downplayed itsimmunosupportive role. A critical examination of thesestudies reveals crucial study-design errors, such as usingsuboptimal dosing. The action of vitamin C, viaimmunological activity of leukocytes, interferon, andinflammatory reactions to promote resistance to infectionis well documented. 8 In a popular study using mega doses of vitamin C (three grams per day, given in divided doses), flu and coldsymptoms were decreased by an average of 85 percent,compared with the control group. 9 Neonatal thymus concentrate shows great promise in cold and flu support. Thymic activity is highest in the neonataland decreases with age. Many immune-system functions,including the production of cellular-mediated immunefactors, such as T-lymphocytes, are directly controlled bythe thymus. Cell-medicated immunity is crucial in the body's resistance to yeasts, fungi, parasites, bacteria, and mostimportantly, viruses because it is a frontline defense thatdoes not require antibody production. Thymus materialshave been documented to support normal, healthyimmune function. 10 Thymus gland concentrate is only one of many nutritive elements which support neutrophil production.A broad-spectrum immunosupportive formula shouldcontain several of the following: Zinc, an essential cofactor for more than 70 enzymes, is of vital importance for the highly proliferating cells of theimmune system, particularly monocyte and macrophagefunction, and affects the number and activity ofneutrophil and natural killer (NK) CHEC2p77.ps Page VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008WELLNESS Vitamin A maintains a distinct action on cellular immunity. In addition to its role in the support ofmucosal surfaces, it also aids inmaintaining lymphatic tissues, and inantibody production, particularlythat of secretory IgA. One studyfound that NK cell activity wasreduced 55 percent as a result ofhypovitaminosis A. 11 Vitamin E is another antioxidant with marked effect on immuno-activity. In addition to its protectiveeffects on gastric mucosa, vitamin Ehas been shown to improve immuneresponsiveness, as evidenced by adecrease in lipid-peroxidation, i.e.PGE2. 12 Several studies of elderly patients have revealed that supplementalvitamin E reduces the incidence ofupper respiratory-tract infections andthe incidence and severity of CONTINUED Is it a cold or the flu?

Being a leader in thecommunity is another. And being a thought leader is somethingaltogether different. A thought leader is well known among his or her peers and perceived as an expert. Thought leadership is the strategic component of the new marketing mix and issomething that can be done inexpensively or on a grandscale. Establishing yourself as a thought leader can provide the framework from which to build a large-scale career asan expert. Put into practice just a few or all of theseelements and you will be well on your way. 1. Work with the press. To be taken seriously in the academic world, university professors must publish. Thesame applies to the professional community. Are you published? If not, identify publications to which you might be able to contribute. Also, list everyoneyou know who runs a newspaper, newsletter, or magazineto which you could contribute. Editors look for content for print publications and Web sites, and if you have some to provide, you will be wellreceived. Keep in mind that publishing articles is differentfrom buying or running an ad about your practice.Thought leadership is about building a relationship and areputation, and this is almost impossible to buy. 2. Write, write, write. Put your ideas, stories, and expertise into a format that will help others. Articlesoften follow a simple format that includes a storylikeopening, a series of tips, and a summarization paragraph. For topics, think of mistakes made, experiences gained, and lessons you can share. Your writings could turn intoblogs, newsletters, articles, columns, special reports, orwhite papers. The choice is almost limitless. When you are writing, be mindful of your audience and what it needs and wants to read. And mind theconfidentiality of those involved in the things you havelearned and stories you tell. You are looking to makefriends, not betray them. 3. Weave in your Web site. Your Web site can be a vehicle to establish a reputation. Take a look at what youoffer. What you want on your site is helpful information(articles) that readers can download at no cost. This typeof information gives a reason for people to go to your site. 4. Be creative in describing yourself. This is probably one of the first questions people ask at parties ornetworking events. The answer you give can help youbecome a thought leader. Here are some suggestions: \"I help people avoid the need for prescription drugs.\" \"I help people stay friends with their pharmacist, even when they don't need him anymore.\" \"I wage a war against bad office furniture, airlines, and poor posture.\" These types of responses help spur conversation; the listener wants to know more. The point is you can't builda relationship with people if you are unable to get theconversation going, which is the aim of these types ofresponses. 5. Give people something to talk about. Quirky or humorous answers about what you do are memorable.They create a buzz for people to talk about. You can also do this being funny, controversial, or highly informative in a conversational way. Give peoplesomething to share with loved ones, or to stimulate theircuriosity and ask for more information. As you cultivate relationships, your reputation will spread. This may be a slow process, but it is effective. Thought leaders are individuals to whom people look for answers. Over a period of time and with someconcerted effort on your part, you can establish yourself asan expert in any area you choose. The areas that need your attention right now are writing articles, updating your Web site, and clarifyingwhat you do. Save the marketing budget for now and findthose folks you wish to connect with.

Learn MANAGEMENT SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 87Staffing is one of the toughest aspects of managing a privatepractice today. Failure to manage staffing issues appropriately can lead tocostly mistakes, lost revenue, andpotential legal issues. Unfortunately, some doctors take these issues seriously only after making mistakes; however, you can learn the skills needed to build a winning and successful team. Think of office staffing as a system, with five basic tenets: 1. Identify staffing needs and outsource positions.2. Find and select appropriate candidates.3. Establish management policies.4. Create clear written duties and checklists.5. Create mechanisms for dealing with noncompliance. 1. Identify staffing needs and outsource positions. Payroll is usually the most costly element of a practice.Hire only after designing an organizational chart showingwhich roles will be internal, and which will be external. In today's practice environment, it is imperative not to hire people for tasks you could more appropriatelyoutsource, subcontract to other professionals, or handle byexisting technology. A perfect example is transcription,which you can largely eliminate with a good electronicrecords system. You can also shift some collections andbilling duties to more affordable subcontractors. Before you place an ad for a potential employee, develop a clear picture of the staff structure you want toachieve. This careful consideration is essential toprofitability. Staffing your office is an evolutionaryprocess that must complement your practice style, andfiscally be responsible. 2. Find and select appropriate candidates. To find the right candidate, develop a clear vision for the positionor role. Create a detailed job description with duties, responsibilities, and career path for this position beforeyou begin the hiring process. Outline the necessary skills,competencies, and experience a candidate must possess tobe successful in the position. Define what \"excellentperformance\" in this role would be. With a clearly defined role, you can begin searching for the perfect candidate. Referrals from existing employees canbe a good source of great candidates. Other sources includelocal or regional newspapers, posting openings in youroffice, in newsletters you send out, or on your Web site. Ask potential candidates to submit resumes, references, and cover letters to your office via e-mail or fax. Withthese credentials in hand, you can: Screen out applicants who do not have a basic level of computer literacy; Check submitted items for spelling, grammar, and style; and See if applicants are able to follow basic instructions. Do not accept phone calls about open positions. You do not want an endless stream of phone calls from applicantsdisrupting the day for your team. Once you find a few potential candidates, conduct interviews with a partner \u2014 preferably a staff person ofthe opposite sex. Interviewing an applicant side-by-sidewith a trusted ally allows you to compare impressions andask different questions. Before making your selection, it is a good idea to conduct a skills test and a second interview.

Establish management policies. Creating and maintaining a policy and compliance manual iscrucial to your practice's operation. This manual will ultimately become your practice playbook. Haveyou ever known a top-notch team ororganization to function at highlevels without a system of policies,directions, and basic rules? Youroffice is no different. The cleareryour manual, the better your resultswill be from your team. You also need to ensure your manual and policies comply withstate and federal employment law.Visit your state's Web site to reviewlabor laws, wage guidelines, and anti-discrimination policies. You may alsowant to have an employmentattorney in your state review yourpolicies and procedures. Once you have your preliminary manual, review it to ensure it meetslegal requirements for such things ashiring, nondiscrimination, and timeoff. Assemble your final manual andput it in accessible locations in theoffice, such as one at everyworkstation. 4. Create clear written duties and checklists. Each position within your office should have a writtenposition description, as well as awritten checklist of responsibilities. Record every task and responsibility \u2014 from how to openoffice locks and the safe, to operatingthe phone system, to end-of-dayresponsibilities. When you writethese procedures, assume nothing.The more detail-oriented you arewhen going through this process, theless chance there will be for futureemployee misunderstanding and error. The key to success is making your documentation exactly match yourrequirements. 5. Create mechanisms for dealing with noncompliance. Write policies and procedures for dealingwith staff negligence, noncompliance,or willful disregard. Be sure to fullycover these topics within your policyand procedure manual. When developing your practice policy, tap all of the knowledge andresources available to you. Obtainadvice from legal counsel, who shouldreview your end product beforedistilling the information to yourstaff. This can save you countlesslegal headaches in the future. By adhering to these five basic tenets, you can begin building awinning and successful team.

If those statements match your staff, your practice has fallen victim to the \"people vs. productivity\" dilemma \u2014 having staff members high in people skills or productivityskills, but not both. Unfortunately, if staff members aretoo high in one and too low in the other, your customerservice will be less than excellent. A recent interaction I had with an employee at a cell phone company demonstrates the people vs. productivityproblem: When I returned a cell phone and requested another, the salesperson quickly retrieved the new phone, made changes,asked me if I wanted a new case, and handed me the phone\u2014 all within a few minutes and without looking at me. She was high on productivity, but low on people skills. Here's another example: After I checked in at a doctor's office, I had to wait to be called. While I waited, I heardthe front-desk person chatting on the phone with patientsand talking to co-workers and others in the office. Sheobviously enjoyed interacting with them. Finally, afterwaiting almost 45 minutes, I asked her when I was goingto be seen. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I forgot you were waiting.\"High on people skills, low on productivity. Customer service comes in high on your list of vital patient-retention practices, but attaining consistentexcellent customer service depends on your ability to hire,train, manage, and motivate your staff to develop highpeople skills and high productivity skills. People skills are more than just being friendly, although friendliness is important. Service workers with highpeople skills truly listen to others, care about them, andtreat them with respect. A person with high people skills: Is an optimist and has a positive expectation about people;The peoplevs. productivity dilemma Staff members need both sets of skills By Jean Murray, MBA, PhD CONTINUED ON PAGE 94 CHEC2p90.ps 1/16/08 11:34 VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Good patient relations depend on your staff having people skills as well as productivity skills. To employ staff members with both traits: 1. Hire for people skills. As you interview, see if he or she smiles and makes eye contact. You can teachtechnical skills to improve productivity, but youcannot easily improve motivation and people skills. 2. Train for productivity. Train staff on your clinic's operation and how their work duties fit in. Work withthem during the training period to give plenty ofexposure to the way your office functions. Use the introductory period to evaluate each new employee thoroughly. If you find the person isn't ableto produce during this critical time, no matter howlikeable, let him or her go quickly. 3. Manage expectations. If you want your staff to do things a certain way, communicate yourexpectations clearly and often. Reward compliance; discipline noncompliance. For example: One of the chief complaints by patients is long waiting times. If you do not want patients to wait longer than 10 minutes in the reception area, communicate thisexpectation to your staff, and then work with themto set up an appointment-scheduling and office-visitsystem that assures prompt attention to patients. Keep monitoring compliance to your expectations. If a staff member can't seem to get the idea, don'thesitate to terminate the relationship. 4. Motivate to encourage excellence. Create incentives to reward employees who show exceptionalcustomer service and are productive and efficient. To improve people skills, reward individually. Consider monetary bonuses or recognition. Get patients involvedin identifying staff members with great people skills. To improve office productivity, reward collectively. Offer bonuses or special events for \"days withoutmistakes\" or for meeting a specified collections rate.One doctor promised her staff a spa weekend forachieving a level of production, and made good on it. Survey patients on your productivity and make changes accordingly. Think of productivity in terms of an equation: Productivity = Motivation x Performance. Having staff members who possess both of these characteristics in balance is a must for your office.Focus on balancing people and productivity skills CIRCLE VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Has an ability to make eye contact and establish rapport; and Attends to others by engaging in conversation, listening actively, and using feedback to showunderstanding. Productivity skills refer to performing office tasks to movepatients through the system.Productivity skills include beingorganized, working quickly, notmaking mistakes, and keepingcomplete and accurate records. People and productivity skills are intertwined. Your front-desk personmust be able to move a new patientthrough the sign-in process quicklyand efficiently and still be able tomake the patient feel welcome. If you have associate doctors working with you, they must betechnically competent in their work,while at the same time have theability to look a patient in the eye,smile, and be attentive to his or herneeds, in order to keep thatimportant doctor-patient relationshipmoving forward. The greatest chiropractors have both the technical expertise and thepeople skills to treat many patientsan hour, while making each patientfeel he or she is the most importantperson the doctor saw that day.

Go to www.ChiroEco.com/happystaff.A tale of lost productivity A chiropractor had a superior office manager. She was extremely productive and the chiropractor depended on her completely. However, when the office manager moved out of the area, the practice fell apart. The moral of this true story: Establishing and maintaining a highly productive office does not depend on software, nor does it depend on the skill set of one person. Instead, office productivity is the result ofsetting up good office procedures and systems and making sure all staffmembers adhere to these systems. CONTINUED FROM PAGE 90 CIRCLE 168FREE INFORMATIONCHEC2p94.ps 1/16/08 11:37 PM VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT PRACTICAL DOCUMENTATION One of the most important words in practice managementis documentation. If you do any personal-injury or workers' compensation work or submit claims for reimbursement from insurance providers, you must have proper documentation. Yet, consultants who do audits agree that results of documentation audits are often less than stellar. To get on track, review the purpose of documentation and why it's necessary. Documentation is required to: Demonstrate medical necessity; Create a record of a patient's ongoing treatment; Provide a vehicle by which to communicate with other healthcare providers; Record facts, findings, and observations about a patient's health history (past and present), examinations,diagnostic tests, treatments, and outcomes; and Provide a chronological recording of a patient's care.Proper documentation of a patient's medical record allows you and anyone else involved with the patient'scare to evaluate and plan proper treatment and tomonitor the patient's healthcare over time. It alsofacilitates communication that is sometimes necessaryamong all professionals involved with the patient's careand allows for accurate and timely review and payment ofclaims submitted to a third-party payer. WHAT DO PAYERS WANT? Unless you are fortunate enough to run a total-cash practice, insurance is one of those items you have to dealwith in order to be reimbursed for your services. Third-party payers generally require proof that the services youare billing for are consistent with the patient's insurancecoverage and for any precertifications that have beenauthorized. They may ask you to validate: Place of service; Medical necessity of care rendered; Nature of services provided; and Accurate reporting of services provided.To be in compliance in a court of law, as well as to meet the rigorous demands of insurance-company audits, youneed to adhere to a number of documentation principles.Adherence to these principles mitigates risk and ensuresconformity across all types of office forms and procedures. Here are the documentation principles you should adhere to in your practice: Document a patient's progress, response to, and changes in treatment, and any revision to the workingdiagnosis; Identify any health-risk factors; Make sure the CPT or ICD-9-CM codes you use on third-party payer claim forms or billing statements for apatient are also documented in the patient's medicalrecord; Write neatly and legibly; make sure the medical record is complete; Document the reason for ordering diagnostic or other ancillary services, or make sure your rationale is easilyinferred from the record; and Ensure that all past and present diagnoses are accessible to a patient's treating and/or consulting physician. The documentation of each meeting with a patient in your practice should include: Reason for visit, relevant history, result of physical examination, and prior diagnostic test results; Patient assessment, clinical observation/impression, and/or diagnosis; Plan for care; and Date and legible identity of the observer (chiropractor). WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL NECESSITY? Medical necessity is the vehicle that drives the payment of any claim you submit for a patient. Withoutproper documentation in that area, you won't be paid, soit's extremely important to make sure all care rendered toa patient is documented accordingly. \"Necessity\" is defined as \"a condition or quality of being necessary; a pressing or urgent need; the conditionof being essential.\" In terms of medical necessity, you musthave a valid expectation at the time you render care to apatient that improvement will occur. To fly under the medical necessity radar, your documentation must include: Patient consultation and history data;Maintain documentation basics By Kathy Mills Chang CONTINUED VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT A record of physical examination findings, tests, and measurements; A list of subjective complaints \u2014 those voiced by the patient; Functional goals \u2014 what you hope to have this patient achieve as a result of treatment; Diagnosis/diagnoses; and Treatment plans.It's never too late to start a self- audit of your documentation toensure it meets the guidelinespresented here. Plan the necessaryremedial action if you discover yourrecords are not quite up to snuff.

Quick Tip Write a progress report You probably do a good job in presenting a report of findings. But how good is yourprogress report? Is it as good asyour report of findings? Your progress report is an educational tool that movesyour patient from active care towellness care. If you're reallyinterested in keeping thepatient as a long-term wellnesspatient, start doing a first-classwritten progress report. If giving a first-class report is a good idea at the beginningof care, it's a good idea towardthe end of active care, too. \u2014 Keith Maule Integrity Management www.integritymanagement.com CIRCLE 121FREE INFORMATION CIRCLE 280FREE INFORMATIONCome Visit Us at Parker Booth 98CIRCLE VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT TEAMS TIPS Referrals don't come from satisfied patients. They comefrom excited, enthusiastic patients. Satisfied patients are those who received what they expected \u2014 to get better. Patients who were given an extra dose of excitement and enthusiasm during thecourse of their treatment received more than theyexpected. They listened to you and your staff, got excitedabout what you talked about, and could not wait to sharewhat they learned with others. Here are some simple ways to get patients thinking about referring others: 1. Plant the referral seed. During the initial phone call, ask if they were referred to you by one of yourpatients or a medical professional. This informs potentialpatients that people refer others to you and even medicalprofessionals have confidence in you. 2. Hold the referring patient in high esteem. On the first visit, say something nice about the referringpatient. \"I see you were referred by Mary Smith. Wealways appreciate her referrals; she knows the nicestpeople.\" You just complimented Mary and the newpatient. 3. Write thank-you notes. Send a thank-you note to patients and any doctor who makes a referral to you. Youshould also send a progress report to the referring doctor.Be sure to say something similar to: \"Your referral isgratefully appreciated. Since we do very little advertising,we depend on you to tell others.\" 4. Create a personalized office brochure. Fill it with information about your office, treatment philosophy,services, staff, and yourself to include in new-patientpackets or report-of-findings information packets. You canalso send it to potential patients who desire moreinformation before making their first appointment, or giveit out at health fairs and special events. In addition, youcan offer it to patients to share with friends and familywho are considering chiropractic care. 5. Use a script. When the patient begins to get results, say: \"Please take the time to thank the person who referredyou to our office; that person obviously cares about you.\"6. Look for referral opportunities. When patients tell you how good they feel and how excited they areabout getting better, take the opportunity to ask for areferral. Say, \"I'm so glad you're feeling better. The best way to say thank you to us, however, is to tell someone else aboutour office. If you know someone who would benefit fromchiropractic care, we would be happy to give you someliterature about our office and how chiropractic care mayhelp with his or her specific symptom.\" 7. Display pamphlets in your exam room. While patients are waiting for treatment in the exam room, theyoften read pamphlets about conditions that respond tochiropractic care. This is how the education processbegins. No doubt they will think of someone with one ofthese conditions and ask questions, and then you can askfor a referral. 8. Show your appreciation for multiple referrals. Send a fruit basket or other similar gift to any patient whorefers several patients. Give the patient an opportunity to brag about you by sending it to his or her workplace, and perhaps generatemore referrals for you. You can also send one to the officeof any medical professional who sends you referrals. Makesure to address it to the professional and his or her staff. Inmany cases, it is the staff members who give out referralsand they tend to remember who sends them food. Generating referrals does not have to be work- intensive. With a systemized referral plan of action, andthe ability to recognize times to plant referral seeds intoyour everyday patient interactions, your patients will dothe referral work for you. If each staff member sets a goalto look for two opportunities to ask for a referral, yournew patient stats will definitely increase. It soon willbecome so easy to ask for referrals, everyone will be doingit without any effort at all. Susan Hoy is an award-winning team trainer and consultant.

Compensation as a cost. From a practice owner's viewpoint, employees are necessary to operate the practice, and compensation is a necessary cost of hiringand retaining those employees. With labor costs representing the single highest component of overhead, it's easy to see why so manychiropractors adopt this cost-based view of compensationand strive to cut labor costs. Although managing costs is important, the downside of the cost-based view of employee compensation is it treatslabor as just another overhead expense \u2014 such as rent orsupplies \u2014 and should be reduced whenever possible. Thisleads many practitioners to cut corners \u2014 on the numberand/or caliber of people they hire and, accordingly, thesalaries paid to them. It is a rear-view mirror approach topractice growth. Compensation as an investment. Unlike the cost- based view that focuses largely on the past, theinvestment view of employee compensation looks at thefuture. It concentrates on maximizing the value ofemployees by striving to manage compensation in waysthat drive improved productivity and profitability. By investing in employees through compensation, chiropractors who ascribe to this philosophy hope togenerate returns in the form of staff retention, greaterdiscretionary effort, increased motivation, higher levels ofpatient satisfaction, and many other positive outcomes. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, said it well in his book, Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time, \"I know, in my heart, if wetreat people as a line item under expenses, we're notliving up to our goals and our values. Their passion anddevotion is our number-one competitive advantage. Loseit, and we've lost the game.\" For example: Consider the job of receptionist. Cost- focused chiropractors might try to maximize their netincome by thinking of \"receptionist\" as an entry-level job.They hire someone with minimum qualifications, at theleast possible salary, and provide minimum benefits. Chiropractors with an investment viewpoint, on the other hand, might look for a highly qualified, top-notchreceptionist and be happy to pay a higher-than-averagesalary along with generous benefits. The return oninvestment in this case, would be a smooth, stress-freefront-desk operation with high levels of patient satisfaction. From the success files: A Midwest oncologist, realizing how apprehensive many of his patients werewhen first calling his office, decided such calls (as well asthose from referring physicians) must be handled with theutmost diplomacy and skill. And, he concluded, thepeople most likely to have the training, experience, andpersonality traits needed for the job were airline flightattendants. These individuals know how to deal with emergencies of all kinds. They also have great people skills, are hard-working, quick to learn, and used to on-the-job teamwork. He found the perfect candidate who, after years of international travel, was ready to settle down. Comparedto the standard pay for a medical receptionist, her salarywas significantly higher. \"But,\" he said, \"it's the bestinvestment I've ever made in my practice.\" Bottom line: In the real world, employee compensation must be viewed as a cost and an investment. It is important to control overhead costs, but also important to recognizethat compensation paid to get the right people on boardcan lead to highly positive outcomes.

Approximately two months prior to visiting his chiropractor for neck pain and stiffness, Jim's primary-care physician (PCP) performed tests that indicated he hadhigh blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Jim's PCP placed him on a regimen that included Wellbutrin, Prozac, Cardura, Lipitor, Allegra,and Tylenol. In addition to seeing his PCP , Jim had also been seeing a chiropractor, Dr. William Neely, periodically for about18 months for chronic neck, shoulder, and low-back pain.He went to Dr. Neely about once a month on an as-needed basis. On Jim's initial visit, Dr. Neely did a thorough exam, which included checking Jim's cranial nerves, reflexes,muscle strength, and range of motion (ROM). He alsoconducted cervical and lumbar orthopedic tests, and athorough chiropractic exam revealed cervical,thoracic, subluxations. Dr. Neely evenperformed George's test for vertebrobasilar insufficiency.The result of this test was negative. On his last visit with Dr. Neely, Jim complained of neck and shoulder pain. Dr. Neely documented Jim'ssubjective complaints and examined his spine. He foundcervical, thoracic, and lumbar subluxations and adjustedJim, using diversified technique. The adjustment includeda supine cervical rotatory adjustment to the upper cervical spine. For this adjustment, Jim noted Dr. Neely had to try more than once to \"get it\" and that he felt immediateneck soreness after the adjustment. Jim left the office at approximately 4:30 p.m., and did not feel well during the drive home. When he got home,he slept on the couch until his wife came home later.Telling his wife he felt like he was \"coming down withsomething,\" he went to bed early. In the middle of the night, Jim awakened to use the bathroom. When he got out of bed, he felt dizzy, staggeredinto the bathroom, vomited, and collapsed.Why patient history is important By Timothy J. Feuling This case illustrates the importance of talking to your patients, asking questions, andlistening to responses. Be aware of the five D's and three N's, as well as any ataxia.The five D's include dizziness, dropattacks, diplopia, dysarthria, anddysphagia. The three N's arenausea, numbness, and nystagmus. Since chiropractors have patients presenting with one or more ofthese symptoms all the time, it'simportant to note that just becausesymptoms are present does notmean a dissection is in process. Watch for classic signs of a problem. These include slurredspeech, giddiness, change in voicepatterns, speech problems, andinappropriate reactions. Onecharacteristic promoted as beingalmost pathognomonic is a phrasefrom your patient that the pain inthe neck and/or head is \"unlikeanything ever experienced.\" Be alert to subtle warning signs. Although you should absolutely be alert to these typesof signs and symptoms, themajority of stroke and dissectioncases fall into what you mightconsider \"garden variety\"symptoms \u2014 neck or head pain,fullness in the ear, or othersymptoms that do not necessarilygrab your attention. Be sensitive to subtle warning signs that require you to sleuth. These symptoms, coupled with the patient's history, can help youdecide if the headache is\"normal\" or symptomatic of adissection in progress. Your options at this point are to do an additional workup or discussthe situation with the patient'smedical doctor. If the patient doesnot have a primary-care physician,make a referral immediately. Source: Gerard W. Clum, DC, from his presentation, \"Cervical and C HIROPRACTIC VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008LEGAL When she heard the commotion, his wife ran to him, found him unconscious, and called anambulance. Paramedics on the scenerecorded his systolic blood pressure as220. At the hospital, Jim regained consciousness, but had slurredspeech, difficulty moving hisextremities (especially on the right),and complained of dizziness. Doctorsordered a number of tests, includinga head CT scan, brain MRI, andmagnetic resonance angiography. When Jim's wife told emergency- room physicians he had visited hischiropractor earlier in the afternoonand he felt as though he was comingdown with something, the attendingphysician immediately suspectedstroke from a dissection of thevertebral artery. The CT scan and MRI confirmed a dissection of the vertebral arteryand multiple infarcts in the brain. Jim spent two weeks in the hospital and underwent outpatientrehabilitation for several months toregain most of his functions. Hecontinued to have a slight speechproblem and some upper extremityweakness. Jim filed a lawsuit against Dr. Neely. The lawsuit claimed Dr. Neelyhad acted below the standard of careby not recognizing Jim was at a highrisk for having a stroke due to hishistory of high blood pressure andelevated lipids, and that Dr. Neelyeither caused or exacerbated thedissection and stroke. Experts provided affidavits that it was within a reasonable degree ofcertainty that Dr. Neely's violations ofthe standard of care led directly toJim's subsequent stroke and resulted inpermanent disability. It was alsoasserted by plaintiff's experts that Dr.Neely should have told Jim there wasa risk of stroke from adjusting his neck. A settlement resulted.THE REST OF THE STORY Records from Jim's PCP revealed that at the time of Jim's last visit, thePCP felt Jim's symptoms of memoryloss, concentration problems, andfatigue might have a neurological basisand might need to be explored further. However, the PCP chose to increase Jim's Wellbutrin dosage andadd Prozac how that worked\"before doing any other workups. ThePCP did not make recommendations that Jim lose weight (he weighed 240pounds), stop smoking or drinkingcaffeine, or be evaluated by acardiologist. Further exploration of his medical records revealed that in the monthsleading up to his stroke, Jim hadvisited his PCP several times withcomplaints of fullness in the ear,headache, fatigue, dizziness,depression, moodiness, memory, andconcentration problems. Dr. Neely did not know Jim was seeing his PCP and was unaware ofthe various symptoms Jim wasexperiencing. Other than his visit-by-visit spinal examination, Dr.Neely had not done a formal re-examination or any updating of Jim'shistory \u2014 even when Jim's visitswere sporadic and spaced apart. Although Jim did indicate he had blood-pressure problems on his initialhistory form, Dr. Neely did notexplore this condition further andthe file was never updated. Timothy J.

Throughout 2008, thecolumn will feature case studies fromthe files of VOL54: I SSUE 2 F EBRUARY 11, 2008LEGAL ASK THE ATTORNEY I am trying to decide if I should go to work for someone as an employee or be an independentcontractor. Please help me decide. Legally, there are distinctive differences betweenan employee and an independent contractor. Until recently, many doctors preferred to be treated as an independent contractor for tax reasons, andthe IRS did not seem to object to this arrangement. In thelast few years, however, the IRS has been scrutinizing sucharrangements to make certain a true independent-contractor arrangement exists. Invalid arrangements could cause both the hiring doctor and the employee to be subject to various fines,interest, and other potential penalties. The IRS has issueda number of guidelines which you should review beforedeciding to classify yourself as an independent contractor. For example, you may be an employee if: You do not have a private practice; The practice pays you a straight wage; The practice provides supplies and professional support staff; The practice bills for your services; There is a percentage division of your fees with the practice or vice versa; The practice regulates or has the right to control you; You are on duty at the practice during specified hours; or You wear a pin or label bearing the practice name or insignia. Other factors that determine if you are an employee or independent contractor deal with the degree of controlthe practice has over you. You may be an employee if: You must comply with the practice's instructions regarding work performance;Employee or contractor? By Deborah Green, Esq.

The IRS states that the factorspertaining to control of a doctor's business operationsshould be given greater weight than those pertaining tocontrol of the doctor's professional decisions. A doctor's bona fide control of the business aspects of the delivery of services relate to: The degree to which a doctor has become integrated into the operating organization of the facility; The substantial nature, regularity, and continuity of work for the facility; The authority vested in the facility to require compliance with its general policies; and The degree to which the doctor has been accorded the rights and privileges of any employee.

COM Once you have defined your unique selling proposition(USP), analyzed the market and competition, and determined yourpractice location and target market,you're ready to prepare yourcomprehensive marketing plan for yourpractice's first year. Your plan will be expressed in terms of external and internal marketing. External marketing is what you do outside the office to bring patients in, and internalmarketing is what you do in the office to keep patients,once you have brought them in. External and internal marketing are equally important, so you will need a balance of both. All of your marketingactivities should be tied to your USP (what your practiceis about) and your target market (the specific type ofpatient you want to attract). For both marketing types, you'll need a combination of procedures that you consistently do, and special events,which keep your marketing lively and interesting.Procedures are the bedrock of your marketing plan; theyare the things you do every day, every week, every month. Internal procedures include all of your customer-service activities, such as phone scripts, sending birthday cards,processing new patients, and developing patient routines(such as having patients rest before or after gettingadjusted). External procedures include regular advertising and promotions, such as your Yellow Pages ad, monthly ad inthe local high-school newspaper, and regular radiobroadcasts. Special events are geared toward creating excitement about your practice in the community and maintainingpatient loyalty. Examples of internal special events are apatient appreciation day or a special chiropractic daycelebrated in the office. External special events, such as agrand opening, participation in Kids Day America, orconducting screenings at a county fair, bring you publicity. Your marketing should include: Internal and external special events \u2014 one each quarter, alternating between internal and external; and Internal and external procedures, which you set up as systems. Before you start on the actual marketing plan, don't forget to attach an expected cost to each item. The costswill be included in your estimates of expenses each monthin your business plan. student DCcomwww.

Decide on internal procedures. Consider three areas: Patient protocols \u2014 first day, report of findings, and every-visit routines; Patient-retention activities \u2014 birthday cards, acknowledgement ofreferrals, and healthcare classes; and Customer-service activities \u2014 phone scripts, front-desk procedures,and interactions with patients. 2. Determine external procedures. Select them on the basis of best fit with your USP . If youhave a family practice, for example,consider which local newspapers orradio stations your targeted groupmight read or tune into. Always include a yellow-pages ad as an external procedure \u2014 howlarge or small will depend on yourbudget and viewpoint on these ads. 3. Map out four special events for the first year. Schedule one for each quarter and alternate betweeninternal and external events. Startwith a grand opening in the secondor third month after you open. Since an open house is an external event, schedule an internal eventabout three months later. Thendetermine another external event,and finally an internal event. Noneof these has to be huge or expensive.Just get them in your thoughts so youcan start working on them. Of course, you can change your mind, and can certainly addactivities. But what you want is a fairly clear picture of your marketing for the firstyear, so you can budget and plan toquickly attract and retain patients. Need a refresher on creating a USP?
