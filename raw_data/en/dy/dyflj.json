Released September 6, 2012 JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH, NCMP, and Shari S. Bassuk, ScD (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Ha rvard Medical School, Boston, MA) Many clinicians are confused about the benef its and risks of calcium supplementation for women. A recent draft recommendation from th e U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that daily supplementati on with 1,000 mg of calcium plus 400 IU of vitamin D is of no benefit for fracture prevention in postmenopausal women, 1 and other reports have suggested that calcium supplementation may increase the risk for kidney stones and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this Practice P earl, we provide guidance on the appropriate use of calcium supplements in midlife and older women. Calcium and vitamin D are important for bone health. Calcium and vitamin D provide important bone health benefits. This was the recent conclusion of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on the basis of its comprehensive and rigor ous review of all available research on the topic, including data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI),2,3 a large randomized clinical trial that evaluated the benef its and risks of daily supplemen tal calcium (1,000 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) in 36,282 postmenopausal wome n ages 50-79. Overall, the trial showed that supplementation was associated with significantly less bone loss at the hip (as measured by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) and a 12% reduction in hip fracture.4 Yes, the overall reduction in hip fracture was disappointingly sm all and not statistically significant\u2014and it was this finding that the USPSTF focused on in developing its draft recommendation. However, among women age 60 and over\u2014the age group most likely to sustain an osteoporotic fracture\u2014 the intervention was associated with a much larg er, statistically signifi cant 21% reduction in hip fracture.4 And in analyses restricted to compliant participants (t hose who took their study pills regularly and were also not alr eady taking supplements), the interv ention was associated with a still larger, statistically significant 30% reduction in hip fracture.4 The totality of the findings underscores the need for adequate calcium to ensure bone health and prevent fractures, but women who were already consuming at least 1,200 mg per day of calcium at baseline (from diet and/or supplements) had no clear benefits from the additional supplementation, contradicting the adage that \"if some is good, more must be better.\" Current recommendations for calcium in take call for 1,000 mg per day for women ages 19-50 and 1,200 mg per day for wome n over age 50 to ensure bone health. Given recent concerns that calcium supplements may raise risk for cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, women should aim to meet this recommendation primarily by eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calc ium supplements only if needed to reach the RDA goal (often only ~500 mg per day in supplements is required). 2 Understanding the recommended diet ary allowance (RDA) for calcium. The current RDA for calcium set by the IOM is 1,000 mg per day fo r women ages 19-50 and 1,200 mg per day for those over age 50. The RDA refers to total calcium intake\u2014diet plus supplements (the latter only if needed to reach the intake goal). Women should aim to meet this guideline primarily by eating calcium-rich foods. Good dietary sources of calcium include milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy foods; canned oily fish with bones, such as sa rdines or salm on; tofu; collard greens, a nd kale. A general rule of thumb is that most dairy products and calcium-rich foods provide ~300 mg of calcium per serving. Most women should consider calcium supplements only if thei r dietary calcium intake falls short of the recommended amount. Too many wome n are taking calcium supplemen ts at higher doses than they need, especially in view of emerging conc erns that such supplements\u2014but not calcium from food\u2014may raise the risk for kidne y stones and CVD. Because the me dian dietary calcium intake of midlife and older women is ~700 mg per day2 (equivalent to 2-3 daily servings of the above foods), the majority of women do not need more than 500-800 mg per day in calcium supplements to reach a total calcium intake (d iet plus supplements) of 1,000-1,200 mg per day. As a side note, the body cannot absorb more than ~500 mg of calcium (from food or supplements) in any 2-hour period, so women taking daily doses above 500 mg should space their intake accordingly. Calcium and kidney stones . Higher dietary calcium intake appears to reduce kidney stone formation, whereas the use of calcium supplements may increase kidney stone formation.2 A significant 17% increase in risk for kidney stones was found in the WHI,4 but the background intake of calcium in this cohort was high, with an average total intake of ~2,100 mg per day in the active treatment group (1,100 mg per day in background intake from diet plus nonstudy supplements + 1,000 mg from randomized treatme nt). Although calcium citrate may be less likely to cause kidney stones than the calcium car bonate tested in the WH I, the evidence for a difference in risk remains inconclusive. Supplemen tal calcium taken to me et but not exceed the aforementioned RDA would not be expected to produce th is elevation in risk. Why should high intakes of supplemental but not dietary calcium raise kidney st one risk? Most kidney stones (~80%) contain calcium combined with oxalate. Dietary calcium in food may bind to dietary oxalate in the digestive tract, reducing absorpti on and subsequent urinary excretion of oxalate and thus risk for kidney stones. Other mechanisms may also play a role. Thus, getting sufficient calcium via dietary sources is pref erable to taking supplements. Calcium and cardiovascular disease. There is no evidence to sugge st that calcium from food increases the risk for CVD, and some observational studies have even found a reduced risk for CVD with higher dietary calcium intake. 5,6 Overall, dietary calcium has been linked to an inverse or neutral association with ri sk for CVD, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome,5,6 while concerns have been raised recently about calcium supplements and increased CVD risk by both observational6 and randomized studies.7,8 It has been proposed that calcium supplements may more quickly increase blood calciu m levels than dietary calcium, which could lead to greater deposition of calcium in coronary arteries and an increased risk for coronary heart disease. These relationships, however, remain unproven. In one widely cited study from New Zealand, 1,471 healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to 1 g per day of calcium citrate or placebo and followed for 5 years. Women in the cal cium group experienced more CVD events than women in the placebo group,7 although the risk elevations were no longer significant when unreported events identified from the na tional database of hospital admissions were 3 included. A 2010 meta-analysis of randomized tria ls of calcium supplements administered without vitamin D, including the New Zealand tria l, concluded they raise risk for myocardial infarction (MI) by ~30%.8 In the WHI calcium-vitamin D trial, there was no asso ciation between randomized treatment and incident MI or stroke in the overall cohort,9 although a recent subgroup analysis reported an increased risk for MI (rela tive risk [RR], 1.22; 95% confidence participants who first started taki ng calcium supplements as part of the trial but not in participants alrea dy taking calcium supplements at baseline.10 However, a study among 754 WHI participants who underwen t cardiac computed tomography to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) at the end of the trial found no relationship be tween calcium- vitamin D supplementation and CAC.11 In a 2012 systematic review of randomized trials, our research group found no significant elevation in CVD risk associat ed with either calcium alone (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.92-1.41) or calcium plus vitamin D (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.79-1.22) compared with placebo.5 In our opinion, whether calcium su pplements\u2014particularly when taken without vitamin D\u2014are dangerous for the heart remains an ope n question, but it would be prudent to try to obtain calcium from food rather than supplements where possible and to ensure adequate concurrent vitamin D intake (RDA for vitamin D, 600-800 IU per day). Calcium and other health outcomes. The WHI found a borderline significant 9% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0. 83-1.01) associated with calcium-vitamin D supplementation,12 as well as a neutral effect on inciden ce of total cancer (RR, 0.98), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer.13 Summary: The current RDA for calcium is 1,000 mg per day for women ages 19-50 and 1,200 mg per day for women over age 50. These amounts ar e necessary to maintain bone health. Women should aim to meet the RDA primar ily by eating a calcium-rich diet and take calcium supplements only if needed to reach the RDA goal, given recent concerns that such supplements may raise risk for cardiov ascular disease and ki dney stones. Often only ~500 mg per day in supp lements is required. In women with a low dietary intake of calci um, supplementation to bring the total intake of calcium to the RDA level\u2014but not exceed it\u2014would be expected to reduce risk for hip fracture while having a neutral effect on ri sk for heart disease, stroke, kidney stones, and cancer.
