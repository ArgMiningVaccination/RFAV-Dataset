Standards of medical care are determined on the basis of all clinical dataavailable for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and practice patterns evolve. These parameters of practice should be con-sidered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome for every individual, nor should they be interpreted as including all proper methods of care orexcluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate recommendation regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the psychiatrist in light of the clinical data, the psy- chiatric evaluation, and the diagnostic and treatment op-tions available. Such recommendations should incorporate the patient's personal and sociocultural preferences and val- ues in order to enhance the therapeutic alliance, adherenceto treatment, and treatment outcomes. This practice guideline was approved in May 2010 and published in October 2010. OVERVIEW OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS This practice guideline was developed under the direction of the Steering Committee on Practice Guidelines. The development process is detailed in a document entitled \"APA Guideline Development Process,\" which is avail-able from the APA Department of Quality Improvement and Psychiatric Services. Key features of this process in- clude the following: A comprehensive literature review to identify all rele- vant randomized clinical trials as well as less rigorously designed clinical trials and case series when evidencefrom randomized trials was unavailable Development of evidence tabl es that reviewed the key features of each identified study, including fundingsource, study design, sample sizes, subject characteris- tics, treatment characteristics, and treatment outcomes Initial drafting of the guideline by a work group (\"Work Group\") that included psychiatrists with clinical and re-search expertise in major depressive disorder Production of multiple revised drafts with widespread review; 15 organizations and 71 individuals submittedcomments. Review of the final draft by an Independent Review Panel of experts with no relationships with industry,who were charged to evaluate the guideline recommen-dations for bias from potential conflicts of interest. Approval by the APA Assembly and Board of T rustees. Planned revisions at regular intervals. Development of this APA practice guideline was not fi- nancially supported by any commercial organization. Inaddition, the integrity of the guideline has been ensured by the following mechanisms: 1. Work Group members were selected on the basis of their expertise and integrity, and they agreed to dis-close all potential conflicts of interest before and during their work on this guideline to the Steering Commit- tee on Practice Guidelines and to each other. Employ- ees of industry were not included on the group, andthe group was balanced to include some persons with minimal industry relationships. As disclosed on pages 2-3, from initiation of work in 2005 to approval of theguideline in 2010, some members of the Work Group on Major Depressive Disord er had relationships with industry for which they received research grants or in- come from consulting or speaking related to treat- ments discussed in the guideline. 2. Iterative guideline drafts were broadly circulated to and reviewed by the Steering Committee, other experts, al-lied organizations, and the APA membership; review- ers were asked to disclose their own potential conflictsof interest relevant to evaluating their comments. Over 1,000 comments were received and were addressed by substantive revisions by the Work Group. Oversight ofthe draft review and revision process was provided by the chair and vice-chair of the Steering Committee and by the Medical Editor, none of whom had relationshipswith industry. 3. In response to a 2009 report by the Institute of Med- icine (1), which advocated that professional organiza-tions that develop and disseminate practice guidelines should adopt a new policy that members of guideline work groups have no significant relationships with in-dustry, the following process was implemented: An independent review panel of experts (\"Independent Review Panel\") having no current relationships withindustry also reviewed the guideline and was charged with identifying any possible bias. The Independent Review Panel found no evidence of bias. The Work Group and the Steering Committee dif- fered on how to rate the strength of recommendation forpsychodynamic psychotherapy. Based on their review ofthe available empirical evidence on the use of psycho- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Relevant updates to the literature were identified through a MEDLINE literature search for articles published sincethe second edition of the guideline, published in 2000. Forthis edition of the guideline, literature was identified through a computerized sear ch of MEDLINE, using Pub- Med, for the period from January 1999 to December 2006. Using the MeSH headings depression or depressive disor- der, as well as the key words major depression, major de-pressive disorder, neurotic depression, depressive symptoms, unipolar depression, unipolar depressive, orpseudodementia yielded 39,157 citations. An additional 8,272 citations were identified by using the key words de- pression or depressive in combination with the MeSHheadings affective disorders or psychotic or the key words psychosis, psychotic, catatonic, catatonia, mood disorder, mood disorders, affective disorder, or affective disorders.These citations were limited to English language articles on human treatments using the MeSH headings central nervous system stimulants, hypnotics and sedatives, anti-convulsants, tranquilizing agents, electric stimulation ther- electroconvulsive therapy, psychotherapy, antidepres- sive agents, and monoamine oxid ase or the words antidepressant, antidepre antidepressive, anti- rapid transcranialmagnetic, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, psychother- apy, psychotherapeutic, psychotherapies, behavior therapy,behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral analysis system, cognitive be- havioral therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoanalytic, interpersonal therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, group therapy, family ther-apy, marital therapy, couples therapy, psychoanalysis, psy-chodynamic, aversive therapy, desensitization, exposure therapy, relaxation techniques, or progressive muscle relax- ation. This yielded 13,506 abstracts, which were screened for relevance with a very modest threshold for inclusion, then reviewed by the Work Group. The Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing database (http://www.p-e-p.org) was also searched using the termsmajor depression or major depressive. This search yielded112 references. The Cochrane databases were also searched for the key word depression, and 168 meta-analyses were identified. Additional, less formal, literature searches wereconducted by APA staff and individual Work Group mem- bers and included references through May 2009. Sources of funding were considered when the Work Group re-viewed the literature. The broad scope of this guideline and the substantial evidence base resulted in some practical tradeoffs. Onesuch tradeoff worth highlighting is the decision to build upon literature reviews of the first and second editions of the guideline, rather than re-do them. This decision is ac-knowledged to have resulted in an emphasis of study in this guideline on newer treatments, because the majority of studies about older treatments, including tricyclic anti-depressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, were pub- lished in decades prior to 1999. Readers are advised that the reviews of this older literature are described in theprevious editions of the guideline. The Work Group for this edition considered the previous editions during their evidence review, but for practical reasons, that effort is lesswell documented than the group's analysis of the newer literature. The treatment recommendations of this guide- line, however, were developed to reflect the complete ev-idence base. This document represents a synthesis of current scien- tific knowledge and rational clinical practice regardingthe treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. It strives to be as free as possible of bias toward any theo- retical approach to treatment.

Each rating of clin- ical confidence considers the strength of the available ev- idence. When evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses is limited, the level of confidence mayalso incorporate other clinical trials and case reports as well as clinical consensus with regard to a particular clinical decision. In the listing of ci ted references, each reference is followed by a letter code in brackets that indicates the nature of the supporting evidence. GUIDE TO USING THIS PRACTICE GUIDELINE The Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Ma- jor Depressive Disorder, Third Edition, consists of three parts (Parts A, B, and C) and many sections, not all of which will be equally useful for all readers. The following guide isdesigned to help readers find the sections that will be most useful to them. Part A, \"T reatment Recommendations,\" is published as a supplement to the American Journal of Psychiatry and contains general and specific treatment recommenda- tions. Section I summarizes the key recommendations ofthe guideline and codes each recommendation according to the degree of clinical confidence with which the recom- mendation is made. Section II is a guide to the formula-tion and implementation of a treatment plan for the individual patient. Section III, \"Specific Clinical Features Influencing the T reatment Plan,\" discusses a range of clin- ical considerations that could alter the general recommen- dations discussed in Section I. Part B, \"Background Information and Review of Avail- able Evidence,\" and Part C, \"Future Research Needs,\" arenot included in the American Journal of Psychiatry sup- plement but are provided with Part A in the complete guide- line, which is available in print format from AmericanPsychiatric Publishing, Inc., and online through the Ameri- can Psychiatric Association (http://www.psychiatryon-line.com). Part B provides an overview of major depressive disorder, including general information on natural history, course, and epidemiology. It also provides a structuredreview and synthesis of the evidence that underlies the recommendations made in Part A. Part C draws from the previous sections and summarizes areas for which moreresearch data are needed to guide clinical decisions.T o share feedback on this or other published APA practice guidelines, a form is available athttp://mx.psych.org/survey/reviewform.cfm. OFF-LABEL USE OF MEDICATIONS Medications discussed in this practice guideline may not have an indication from the U.S. Food and Drug Admin- istration for the disorder or condition for which they are recommended. Off-label use of medications by individualphysicians is permitted and common. Decisions about off- label use can be guided by the evidence provided in the APA practice guideline, other scientific literature, and clin- ical experience. INTRODUCTION This guideline summarizes the specific approaches totreatment of individuals with major depressive disorder. It presupposes that the psychiatrist has diagnosed major de-pressive disorder, according to the criteria defined in DSM-IV-TR, in an adult pa tient and has evaluated the patient to identify general medical conditions that may contribute to the disease process (e.g., hypothyroidism, pancreatic carcinoma) or complicate its treatment (e.g., cardiac disorders). The trea tment recommendations that follow may also have some relevance for patients who have depressive symptoms on the basis of other syn- dromes, such as dysthymic disorder. Because many pa-tients have co-occurring psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, the psychiatrist should also con- sider applicable treatment guidelines for these diagnoses.When patients experience depressive symptoms in the context of another disorder and do not meet the diagnos- tic criteria for major depressive disorder, the APA practiceguideline pertaining to the primary diagnosis should be consulted. For patients found to have depressive symp- toms within the context of bipolar disorder, the psychiatristshould refer to APA 's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder (2). Recommendations on the treatment of depressive disorders in children and ad-olescents can be found in the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's Practice Parameter for the As- sessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Depressive Disorders (3).

CODING SYSTEM Each recommendation is identified as falling into one of three categories of endorsement, indicated by a bracketedRoman numeral following the statement. The three cate- gories represent varying levels of clinical confidence: [I] Recommended with substantial clinical confidence [II] Recommended with moderate clinical confidence [III] May be recommended on the basis of individual cir- cumstances B. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Psychiatric management Psychiatric management consists of a broad array of inter- ventions and activities that psychiatrists should initiate and continue to provide to patients with major depressive disorder through all phases of treatment [I]. a. Establish and maintain a therapeutic alliance In establishing and maintaining a therapeutic alliance, it is important to collaborate with the patient in decision mak-ing and attend to the patient's preferences and concerns about treatment [I]. Management of the therapeutic alli- ance should include awareness of transference and counter-transference issues, even if these are not directly addressed in treatment [II]. Severe or persistent problems of poor al- liance or nonadherence to treatment may be caused by thedepressive symptoms themselves or may represent psy- chological conflicts or psychopathology for which psycho- therapy should be considered [II]. b. Complete the psychiatric assessment Patients should receive a thorough diagnostic assessment in order to establish the diagnosis of major depressive disor-der, identify other psychiatric or general medical conditions that may require attention, and develop a comprehensive plan for treatment [I]. This evaluation generally includes a history of the present illness and current symptoms; a psy-chiatric history, including identification of past symptomsof mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes and responses to previous treatments; a general medical history; a personalhistory including information about psychological develop- ment and responses to life transitions and major life events; a social, occupational, and family history (including mooddisorders and suicide); review of the patient's prescribed and over-the-counter medications; a review of systems; a mental status examination; a physical examination; and ap-propriate diagnostic tests as indicated to rule out possible general medical causes of depressive symptoms [I]. Assess- ment of substance use should evaluate past and current useof illicit drugs and other substances that may trigger or ex- acerbate depressive symptoms [I]. c. Evaluate the safety of the patient A careful and ongoing evaluation of suicide risk is neces- sary for all patients with major depressive disorder [I]. Such an assessment includes specific inquiry about sui- cidal thoughts, intent, plans, means, and behaviors; iden-tification of specific psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, severe anxiety, substance use) or general medical condi- tions that may increase the likelihood of acting on suicidalideas; assessment of past and, particularly, recent suicidal behavior; delineation of current stressors and potential protective factors (e.g., positive reasons for living, strongsocial support); and identification of any family history of suicide or mental illness [I]. In addition to assessing sui- cide risk per se, it is important to assess the patient's levelof self-care, hydration, and nutrition, each of which can be compromised by severe depressive symptoms [I]. As part of the assessment process, impulsivity and potential forrisk to others should also be evaluated, including any his- tory of violence or violent or homicidal ideas, plans, or in-tentions [I]. An evaluation of the impact of the depressionon the patient's ability to care for dependents is an impor- tant component of the safety evaluation [I]. The patient's risk of harm to him- or herself and to others should also be monitored as treatment proceeds [I]. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Establish the appropriate setting for treatment The psychiatrist should determine the least restrictive setting for treatment that will be most likely not only toaddress the patient's safety, but also to promote improve- ment in the patient's condition [I]. The determination of an appropriate setting for treatment should include con-sideration of the patient's symptom severity, co-occurring psychiatric or general medical conditions, available support system, and level of functioning [I]. The determination of atreatment setting should also include consideration of the patient's ability to adequately care for him- or herself, to provide reliable feedback to the psychiatrist, and to coop-erate with treatment of the major depressive disorder [I]. Measures such as hospitalization should be considered for patients who pose a serious threat of harm to themselves or others [I]. Patients who refuse inpatient treatment can be hospitalized involuntarily if their condition meets thecriteria of the local jurisdiction for involuntary admission [I]. Admission to a hospital or, if available, an intensive day program, may also be indicated for severely ill patients wholack adequate social support outside of a hospital setting, who have complicating psychiatric or general medicalconditions, or who have not responded adequately to out-patient treatment [I]. The optimal treatment setting and the patient's likelihood of benefit from a different level of care should be reevaluated on an ongoing basis through-out the course of treatment [I]. e. Evaluate functional impairment and quality of life Major depressive disorder can alter functioning in numer-ous spheres of life including work, school, family, social relationships, leisure activities, or maintenance of health and hygiene. The psychiatrist should evaluate the patient'sactivity in each of these domains and determine the pres- ence, type, severity, and chroni city of any dysfunction [I]. In developing a treatment plan, interventions should be aimed at maximizing the pati ent's level of functioning as well as helping the patient to set specific goals appropriateto his or her functional impairments and symptom sever-ity [I]. f. Coordinate the patient's care with other clinicians Many patients with major depressive disorder will be eval-uated by or receive treatment from other health care pro- fessionals in addition to the psychiatrist. If more than one clinician is involved in providing the care, all treating cli-nicians should have sufficie nt ongoing contact with the patient and with each other to ensure that care is coordi- nated, relevant information is available to guide treatmentdecisions, and treatments are synchronized [I]. In ruling out general medical causes of depressive symp- toms, it is important to ensure that a general medical eval-uation has been done [I], either by the psychiatrist or by another health care professional. Extensive or specialized testing for general medical causes of depressive symptomsmay be conducted based on individual characteristics of the patient [III]. g. Monitor the patient's psychiatric status The patient's response to treatment should be carefully monitored [I]. Continued monitoring of co-occurring psychiatric and/or medical cond itions is also essential to developing and refining a treatment plan for an individual patient [I]. h. Integrate measurements into psychiatric management T ailoring the treatment plan to match the needs of the particular patient requires a careful and systematic assess-ment of the type, frequency, and magnitude of psychiatric symptoms as well as ongoing determination of the thera- peutic benefits and side effects of treatment [I]. Such assess-ments can be facilitated by integrating clinician- and/or patient-administered rating scale measurements into ini- tial and ongoing evaluation [II]. i. Enhance treatment adherence The psychiatrist should assess and acknowledge potential barriers to treatment adherence (e.g., lack of motivationor excessive pessimism due to depression; side effects of treatment; problems in the therapeutic relationship; lo- gistical, economic, or cultural barriers to treatment) andcollaborate with the patient (and if possible, the family) to minimize the impact of these potential barriers [I]. In addi- tion, the psychiatrist should encourage patients to articu-late any fears or concerns about treatment or its side effects [I]. Patients should be given a realistic notion of what can be expected during the different phases of treatment, in-cluding the likely time course of symptom response and the importance of adherence for successful treatment and prophylaxis [I]. j. Provide education to the patient and the family Education about the symptoms and treatment of major depressive disorder should be provided in language that isreadily understandable to the patient [I]. With the pa- tient's permission, family members and others involved in the patient's day-to-day life may also benefit from educa-tion about the illness, its effects on functioning (including family and other interpersonal relationships), and its treat- ment [I]. Common misperceptions about antidepressants(e.g., they are addictive) should be clarified [I]. In addition, education about major depressive disorder should address the need for a full acute course of treatment, the risk of re-lapse, the early recognition of recurrent symptoms, and the need to seek treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

P atients s ho uld also be told ab out t he need to taper antidepressants, rather than discontinuing themprecipitously, to minimize the risk of withdrawal symp- toms or symptom recurrence [I]. Patient education also includes general promotion of healthy behaviors such asexercise, good sleep hygiene, good nutrition, and decreased use of tobacco, alcohol, and other potentially deleterious substances [I]. Educational tools such as books, pamphlets,and trusted web sites can augm ent the face-to-face educa- tion provided by the clinician [I]. 2. Acute phase a. Choice of an initial treatment modalityT reatment in the acute phase should be aimed at inducingremission of the major depressive episode and achieving a full return to the patient's baseline level of functioning [I]. Acute phase treatment may include pharmacotherapy, de-pression-focused psychotherapy, the combination of med- ications and psychotherapy, or other somatic therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial mag-netic stimulation (TMS), or light therapy, as described in the sections that follow. Selection of an initial treatment mo- dality should be influenced by clinical features (e.g., se- verity of symptoms, presence of co-occurring disorders or psychosocial stressors) as well as other factors (e.g., pa-tient preference, prior treatment experiences) [I]. Anytreatment should be integrated with psychiatric manage- ment and any other treatments being provided for other diagnoses [I]. 1. Pharmacotherapy An antidepressant medication is recommended as an ini- tial treatment choice for patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder [I] and definitely should be pro-vided for those with severe major depressive disorder un- less ECT is planned [I]. Because the effectiveness of anti- depressant medications is generally comparable betweenclasses and within classes of medications, the initial selec- tion of an antidepressant medication will largely be basedon the anticipated side effects, the safety or tolerability ofthese side effects for the individual patient, pharmacolog- ical properties of the medication (e.g., half-life, actions on cytochrome P450 enzymes, other drug interactions), and ad-ditional factors such as medication response in prior epi- sodes, cost, and patient preference [I]. For be restrictedto patients who do not respond to other treatments [I], given the necessity for dietary restrictions with these med- ications and the potential for deleterious drug-drug inter-actions. In patients who prefer complementary and alter- native therapies, S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) [III] or St. John's wort [III] might be considered, although evidence for their efficacy is modest at best, and careful attention to drug-drug interactions is needed with St. John's wort [I]. Once an antidepressant medication has been initiated, the rate at which it is titrated to a full therapeutic doseshould depend upon the patient's age, the treatment set- ting, and the presence of co-occurring illnesses, concom-itant pharmacotherapy, or medication side effects [I]. During the acute phase of treatment, patients should be carefully and systematically monitored on a regular basis to assess their response to pharmacotherapy, identify the emergence of side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms,sedation, insomnia, activation, changes in weight, and car- diovascular, neurological, anticholinergic, or sexual side ef- fects), and assess patient safety [I]. The frequency of patientmonitoring should be determined based upon the patient's symptom severity (including suicidal ideas), co-occurring disorders (including general medical conditions), coopera-tion with treatment, availability of social supports, and the frequency and severity of side effects with the chosen treat- ment [II]. If antidepressant side effects do occur, an initialstrategy is to lower the dose of the antidepressant or to change to an antidepressant that is not associated with that side effect [I]. 2. Other somatic therapies ECT is recommended as a treatment of choice for pa- tients with severe major depressive disorder that is not re- sponsive to psychotherapeutic and/or pharmacologicalinterventions, particularly in those who have significant functional impairment or have not responded to numer- ous medication trials [I]. ECT is also recommended forindividuals with major depressive disorder who have asso- ciated psychotic or catatonic features [I], for those with an urgent need for response (e.g., patients who are suicidalor nutritionally compromised due to refusal of food or flu- ids) [I], and for those who prefer ECT or have had a pre- vious positive response to ECT [II]. Bright light therapy might be used to treat seasonal af- fective disorder as well as nonseasonal depression [III]. 3. Psychotherapy Use of a depression-focused psychotherapy alone is rec-ommended as an initial treatment choice for patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder [I], with clin- ical evidence supporting the use of cognitive-behavioraltherapy (CBT) [I], interpersonal psychotherapy [I], psy- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Factors that may suggest the use of psychotherapeutic interven-tions include the presence of significant psychosocial stressors, intrapsychic conflict, interpersonal difficulties,a co-occurring axis II disorder, treatment availability, or\u2014most important\u2014patient preference [II]. In women who are pregnant, wish to become pregnant, or are breast- feeding, a depression-focused psychotherapy alone is rec-ommended [II] and depending on the severity of symptoms, should be considered as an initial option [I]. Consider- ations in the choice of a specific type of psychotherapy in-clude the goals of treatment (in addition to resolving major depressive symptoms), prior positive response to a specific type of psychotherapy, patient preference, and the avail- ability of clinicians skilled in the specific psychotherapeu- tic approach [II]. As with pa tients who are receiving phar- macotherapy, patients rece iving psychotherapy should be carefully and systematically monitored on a regular basis toassess their response to treatment and assess patient safety[I]. When determining the frequency of psychotherapy sessions for an individual patient, the psychiatrist should consider multiple factors, including the specific type andgoals of psychotherapy, symptom severity (including sui- cidal ideas), co-occurring disorders, cooperation with treat- ment, availability of social supports, and the frequency ofvisits necessary to create and maintain a therapeutic rela- tionship, ensure treatment adherence, and monitor and ad- dress depressive symptoms and suicide risk [II]. Marital andfamily problems are common in the course of major de- pressive disorder, and such problems should be identified and addressed, using marital or family therapy when indi-cated [II]. 4. Psychotherapy plus antidepressant medication The combination of psycho therapy and antidepressant medication may be used as an initial treatment for patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder [I]. In addition, combining psycho therapy and medication may be a useful initial treatment even in milder cases for pa- tients with psychosocial or interpersonal problems, intra- psychic conflict, or co-occurring Axis II disorder [II]. In general, when choosing an antidepressant or psychother-apeutic approach for combinat ion treatment, the same is- sues should be considered as when selecting a medicationor psychotherapy for use alone [I]. b. Assessing the adequacy of treatment response In assessing the adequacy of a therapeutic intervention, it is important to establish that treatment has been adminis-tered for a sufficient duration and at a sufficient frequency or,in the case of medication, dose [I]. Onset of benefit frompsychotherapy tends to be a bit more gradual than that from medication, but no treatment should continue un- modified if there has been no symptomatic improvementafter 1 month [I]. Generally, 4-8 weeks of treatment are needed before concluding that a patient is partially respon- sive or unresponsive to a specific intervention [II]. c. Strategies to address nonresponse For individuals who have not responded fully to treat- ment, the acute phase of treatment should not be con-cluded prematurely [I], as an incomplete response to treatment is often associated with poor functional out- comes. If at least a moderate improvement in symptoms is not observed within 4-8 weeks of treatment initiation, the diagnosis should be reappraised, side effects assessed,complicating co-occurring co nditions and psychosocial factors reviewed, and the treatment plan adjusted [I]. It isalso important to assess the quality of the therapeutic al-liance and treatment adherence [I]. For patients in psy- chotherapy, additional factors to be assessed include the frequency of sessions and whether the specific approachto psychotherapy is adequately addressing the patient's needs [I]. If medications are prescribed, the psychiatrist should determine whether pharmacokinetic [I] or phar-macodynamic [III] factors suggest a need to adjust med- ication doses. With some TCAs, a drug blood level can help determine if additional dose adjustments are re-quired [I]. After an additional 4-8 weeks of treatment, if the pa- tient continues to show minimal or no improvement insymptoms, the psychiatrist should conduct another thor- ough review of possible contributory factors and make ad- ditional changes in the trea tment plan [I]. Consultation should also be considered [II]. A number of strategies are available when a change in the treatment plan seems nece ssary. For patients treated with an antidepressant, optimizing the medication dose is a reasonable first step if the side effect burden is tolerable and the upper limit of a medication dose has not beenreached [II]. Particularly for those who have shown mini- mal improvement or experienced significant medication side effects, other options include augmenting the antide-pressant with a depression-focused psychotherapy [I] or with other agents [II] or changing to another non-MAOI antidepressant [I]. Patients may be changed to an antide-pressant from the same pharmacological class (e.g., from one SSRI to another SSRI) or to one from a different class (e.g., from an SSRI to a tricyclic antidepressant [TCA]) [II].For patients who have not responded to trials of SSRIs, a trial of an SNRI may be helpful [II]. Augmentation of an- tidepressant medications can utilize another non-MAOIantidepressant [II], generally from a different pharmaco- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Additional strategies with [III]. If anxietyor insomnia are prominent features, consideration can be given to anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic medications For patients whose symptoms havenot responded adequately to medication, ECT remains themost effective form of therapy and should be considered [I]. In patients capable of adhering to dietary and medica- tion restrictions, an additional option is changing to a non- selective MAOI [II] after allowing sufficient time between medications to avoid deleterious interactions [I]. T ransder-mal selegiline, a relatively selective MAO B inhibitor with fewer dietary and medication restrictions, or transcranial magnetic stimulation could also be considered [II]. Vagusnerve stimulation (VNS) may be an additional option for individuals who have not responded to at least four ade- quate trials of antidepressant treatment, including ECT[III]. For patients treated with psychotherapy, consideration should be given to increasing the intensity of treatmentor changing the type of therapy [II]. If psychotherapy is used alone, the possible need for medications in addition to or in lieu of psychotherapy should be assessed [I]. Pa-tients who have a history of poor treatment adherence or incomplete response to adequate trials of single treat- ment modalities may benefit from combined treatmentwith medication and a depression-focused psychotherapy [II]. 3. Continuation phase During the continuation phase of treatment, the patient should be carefully monitored for signs of possible relapse [I]. Systematic assessment of symptoms, side effects, ad- herence, and functional status is essential [I] and may befacilitated through the use of clinician- and/or patient- administered rating scales [II]. T o reduce the risk of re- lapse, patients who have been treated successfully withantidepressant medications in the acute phase should con- tinue treatment with these agents for 4-9 months [I]. In general, the dose used in the acute phase should be usedin the continuation phase [II]. T o prevent a relapse of depression in the continuation phase, depression-focused psychotherapy is recommended [I], with the best evidenceavailable for CBT.Patients who respond to an acute course of ECT should receive continuation pharmacotherapy [I], with the bestevidence available for the combination of lithium andnortriptyline. Alternatively, patients who have responded to an acute course of ECT may be given continuation ECT , particularly if medication or psychotherapy has been inef-fective in maintaining remission [II]. 4. Maintenance phase In order to reduce the risk of a recurrent depressive epi-sode, patients who have had three or more prior major de-pressive episodes or who have chronic major depressive disorder should proceed to the maintenance phase of treat- ment after completing the continuation phase [I]. Mainte- nance therapy should also be considered for patients with additional risk factors for recurrence, such as the presenceof residual symptoms, ongoing psychosocial stressors, early age at onset, and family history of mood disorders [II]. Ad- ditional considerations that ma y play a role in the decision to use maintenance therapy include patient preference, the type of treatment received, the presence of side effects dur- ing continuation therapy, the probability of recurrence, thefrequency and severity of prior depressive episodes (includ- ing factors such as psychosis or suicide risk), the persistence of depressive symptoms after recovery, and the presence ofco-occurring disorders [II]. Such factors also contribute to decisions about the duration of the maintenance phase [II]. For many patients, particularly for those with chronic andrecurrent major depressive disorder or co-occurring medi- cal and/or psychiatric disorders, some form of maintenance treatment will be required indefinitely [I]. During the maintenance phase, an antidepressant med- ication that produced symptom remission during the acutephase and maintained remission during the continuationphase should be continued at a full therapeutic dose [II]. If a depression-focused psychotherapy has been used during the acute and continuation phases of treatment, mainte-nance treatment should be considered, with a reduced frequency of sessions [II]. Fo r patients whose depressive episodes have not previously responded to acute or con-tinuation treatment with medications or a depression- focused psychotherapy but who have shown a response to ECT, maintenance ECT may be considered [III]. Main-tenance treatment with VNS is also appropriate for indi- viduals whose symptoms have responded to this treatment modality [III]. Due to the risk of recurrence, patients should be mon- itored systematically and at regular intervals during themaintenance phase [I]. Use of standardized measurementaids in the early detection of recurrent symptoms [II]. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Discontinuation of treatment When pharmacotherapy is being discontinued, it is best to taper the medication over the course of at least several weeks [I]. T o minimize the likelihood of discontinuation symptoms, patients should be advised not to stop medi-cations abruptly and to take medications with them when they travel or are away from home [I]. A slow taper ortemporary change to a longer half-life antidepressant may reduce the risk of discontinuation syndrome [II] when dis- continuing antidepressants or reducing antidepressant doses. Before the discontinuation of active treatment, pa-tients should be informed of the potential for a depressive relapse and a plan should be established for seeking treat- ment in the event of recurrent symptoms [I]. After discon- tinuation of medications, patients should continue to be monitored over the next several months and should receiveanother course of adequate acute phase treatment if symp- toms recur [I]. For patients receiving psychotherapy, it is important to raise the issue of treatment discontinuation well in ad-vance of the final session [I], although the exact process by which this occurs will vary with the type of therapy. 6. Clinical factors influencing treatment a. Psychiatric factorsFor suicidal patients, psychiatrists should consider an in- creased intensity of treatment, including hospitalization when warranted [I] and/or combined treatment withpharmacotherapy and psychoth erapy [II]. Factors to con- sider in determining the nature and intensity of treatmentinclude (but are not limited to) the nature of the doctor-patient alliance, the availability and adequacy of social sup- ports, access to and lethality of suicide means, the presence of a co-occurring substance use disorder, and past and fam-ily history of suicidal behavior [I]. For patients who exhibit psychotic symptoms during an episode of major depressive disorder, treatment shouldinclude a combination of anti psychotic and antidepressant medications or ECT [I]. When patients exhibit cognitivedysfunction during a major depressive episode, they mayhave an increased likelihood of future dementia, making it important to assess cognition in a systematic fashion over the course of treatment [I]. Catatonic features that occur as part of a major depres- sive episode should be treated with a benzodiazepine [I] orbarbiturate [II], typically in conjunction with an catatonic symptoms persist, ECT is recom- mended [I]. T o reduce the likelihood of general medical complications, patients with catatonia may also requiresupportive medical interventions, such as hydration, nu- tritional support, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombo-sis, turning to reduce risks of decubitus ulcers, and passiverange of motion to reduce risk of contractures [I]. If anti- psychotic medication is needed, it is important to monitorfor signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, to which pa- tients with catatonia may have a heightened sensitivity [II]. When patients with a major depressive disorder also have a co-occurring psychiatric illness, the clinician shouldaddress each disorder as part of the treatment plan [I]. Ben-zodiazepines may be used adjunctively in individuals with major depressive disorder and co-occurring anxiety [II], al- though these agents do not treat depressive symptoms, andcareful selection and monitoring is needed in individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders [I]. In patients who smoke, bupropion [I] or nortriptyline [II] may be options to simultaneously treat depression and assist with smoking cessation. When possible, a period ofsubstance abstinence can help determine whether the de- pressive episode is related to substance intoxication or withdrawal [II]. Factors that suggest a need for antide-pressant treatment soon after cessation of substance use include a family history of major depressive disorder and a history of major depressive disorder preceding the on-set of the substance use disorder or during periods of so- briety [II]. For patients who have a personality disorder as well as major depressive disorder, psychiatrists should institutetreatment for the major depressive disorder [I] and con- sider psychotherapeutic and adjunctive pharmacothera-peutic treatment for personality disorder symptoms [II]. b. Demographic and psychosocial factors Several aspects of assessment and treatment differ be- tween women and men. Because the symptoms of somewomen may fluctuate with gonadal hormone levels, the evaluation should include a detailed assessment of mood changes across the reproductiv e life history (e.g., men- struation, pregnancy, birth control including oral contra- ception use, abortions, menopause) [I]. When prescribing medications to women who are taking oral contraceptives,the potential effects of drug-drug interactions must be considered [I]. For women in the perimenopausal period, SSRI and SNRI antidepressants are useful in amelioratingdepression as well as in reducing somatic symptoms such as hot flashes [II]. Both men and women who are taking an- tidepressants should be asked whether sexual side effectsare occurring with these medications [I]. Men for whom trazodone is prescribed should be warned of the risk of priapism [I]. The treatment of major depressive disorder in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant re-quires a careful consideration of the benefits and risks of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For women who are currently receiving treatment for de- pression, a pregnancy should be planned, whenever pos-sible, in consultation with the treating psychiatrist, who may wish to consult with a specialist in perinatal psychia- try [I]. In women who are pregnant, planning to becomepregnant, or breast-feeding, depression-focused psycho- therapy alone is recommended [II] and should always be considered as an initial option, particularly for mild to moderate depression, for patients who prefer psycho- therapy, or for those with a prior positive response to psychotherapy [I]. Antidepressant medication should beconsidered for pregnant women who have moderate to severe major depressive disorder as well as for those who are in remission from major depressive disorder, are re- ceiving maintenance medication, and are deemed to be at high risk for a recurrence if the medication is discontin-ued [II]. When antidepressants are prescribed to a pregnant woman, changes in pharmacokinetics during pregnancy may require adjustments in medication doses [I]. Electro-convulsive therapy may be considered for the treatment of depression during pregnancy in patients who have psy- chotic or catatonic features, whose symptoms are severeor have not responded to medications, or who prefer treat- ment with ECT [II]. When a woman decides to nurse, the potential benefits of antidepressant medications for themother should be balanced against the potential risks to the newborn from receiving antidepressant in the mother's milk [I]. For women who are depressed during the post-partum period, it is important to evaluate for the presence of suicidal ideas, homicidal ideas, and psychotic symp- toms [I]. The evaluation should also assess parenting skillsfor the newborn and for other children in the patient's care [I]. In individuals with late-life depression, identification of co-occurring general medical conditions is essential, asthese disorders may mimic depression or affect choice or dosing of medications [I]. Older individuals may also beparticularly sensitive to medication side effects (e.g., hypotension, anticholinergic effects) and require adjust- ment of medication doses for hepatic or renal dysfunction[I]. In other respects, treatment for depression should par- allel that used in younger age groups [I]. The assessment and treatment of major depressive dis- order should consider the impact of language barriers, aswell as cultural variables that may influence symptom pre- sentation, treatment preferences, and the degree to whichpsychiatric illness is stigmatized [I]. When antidepres- sants are prescribed, the psychiatrist should recognize that ethnic groups may differ in their metabolism and re-sponse to medications [II].Issues relating to the family situation and family his- tory, including mood disorders and suicide, can also affecttreatment planning and are an important element of the initial evaluation [I]. A family history of bipolar disorder or acute psychosis suggests a need for increased attention to possible signs of bipolar illness in the patient (e.g., withantidepressant treatment) [I]. A family history of recur- rent major depressive disorder increases the likelihood of recurrent episodes in the patient and supports a need formaintenance treatment [II]. Family history of a response to a particular antidepressant may sometimes help in choosing a specific antidepressant for the patient [III]. Be-cause problems within the family may become an ongoing stressor that hampers the patient's response to treatment, and because depression in a family is a major stress in it- self, such factors should be identified and strong consid- eration given to educating the family about the nature ofthe illness, enlisting the fam ily's support, and providing family therapy, when indicated [II]. For patients who have experienced a recent bereave- ment, psychotherapy or antidepressant treatment should be used when the reaction to a loss is particularly pro- longed or accompanied by s ignificant psychopathology and functional impairment [I]. Support groups may be helpful for some bereaved individuals [III]. c. Co-occurring general medical conditions In patients with major depressive disorder, it is important to recognize and address the potential interplay betweenmajor depressive disorder and any co-occurring general medical conditions [I]. Communication with other clini- cians who are providing treatment for general medicalconditions is recommended [I ]. The clinical assessment should include identifying any potential interactions be-tween medications used to treat depression and those usedto treat general medical conditions [I]. Assessment of pain is also important as it can co ntribute to and co-occur with depression [I]. In addition, the psychiatrist should con- sider the effects of prescribed psychotropic medications on the patient's general medical conditions, as well as the effects of interventions for such disorders on the patient'spsychiatric condition [I]. In patients with preexisting hypertension or cardiac conditions, treatment with specific antidepressant agentsmay suggest a need for monitoring of vital signs or car- diac rhythm (e.g., electrocardiogram [ECG] with TCA treatment; heart rate and blood pressure assessment with SNRIs and TCAs) [I]. When using antidepressant medi- cations with anticholinergic side effects, it is important toconsider the potential for increases in heart rate in indi-viduals with cardiac disease, worsening cognition in individ- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In individuals with Parkinson's disease, the choice of an antidepressant should consider that seroton- ergic agents may worsen symptoms of the disease [II],that bupropion has potential dopamine agonist effects (benefitting symptoms of Parkinson's disease but poten- tially worsening psychosis) [II], and that selegiline has an-tiparkinsonian and antidepressant effects but may interact with L-dopa and with other antidepressant agents [I]. In treating the depressive syndrome that commonly occurs following a stroke, consideration should be given to the potential for interactions between antidepressants andanticoagulating (including antiplatelet) medications [I]. Given the health risks associated with obesity and the ten- dency of some antidepressant medications to contribute toweight gain, longitudinal monitoring of weight (either by direct measurement or patient report) is recommended [I], as well as calculation of body mass index (BMI) [II]. Ifsignificant increases are noted in the patient's weight or BMI, the clinician and patient should discuss potential ap- proaches to weight control such as diet, exercise, change inmedication, nutrition consultation, or collaboration with the patient's primary care physician [I]. In patients who have undergone bariatric surgery to treat obesity, adjust-ment of medication formulations or doses may be re- quired because of altered medication absorption [I]. For diabetic patients, it is useful to collaborate with the pa-tient's primary care physician in monitoring diabetic con- trol when initiating antidepressant therapy or making significant dosing adjustments [II]. Clinicians should bealert to the possibility of sleep apnea in patients with depres-sion, particularly those who present with daytime sleepi- ness, fatigue, or treatment-resistant symptoms [II]. In patients with known sleep apnea, treatment choice shouldconsider the sedative side effects of medication, with mini- mally sedating options chosen whenever possible [I]. Given the significant numbers of individuals with unrecognizedhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the availability of effective treatment, consideration should be given to HIV risk assessment and screening [I]. For pa-tients with HIV infection who are receiving antiretroviral therapy, the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be assessed before initiating any psychotropic medications [I].Patients who are being treated with antiretroviral medi- cations should be cautioned about drug-drug interactions with St. John's wort that can reduce the effectiveness of HIV treatments [I]. In patients with hepatitis C infection, interferon can exacerbate depressive symptoms, makingit important to monitor patients carefully for worsening depressive symptoms during the course of interferon treatment [I]. Because tamoxifen requires active 2D6 en-zyme function to be clinically efficacious, patients who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer or other indications should generally be treated with an antidepressant (e.g.,citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine) that has minimal effect cyto- chrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme [I]. When depression oc-curs in the context of chronic pain, SNRIs and TCAs may be preferable to other antidepressive agents [II]. When ECT is used to treat major depressive disorder in an in-dividual with a co-occurring general medical condition, the evaluation should identify conditions that could re- quire modifications in ECT technique (e.g., cardiac con-ditions, hypertension, central nervous system lesions) [I]; these should be addressed insofar as possible and dis- cussed with the patient as part of the informed consentprocess [I]. II. FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A TREATMENT PLAN A. PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT For all patients with major depressive disorder, psychiat-ric management includes a broad array of possible inter-ventions and activities. Essential components include educating the patient and when appropriate the family about depression, discussing treatment options and inter-ventions, and enhancing adherence to treatment. Devel-oping a successful plan of treatment for individuals withmajor depressive disorder is also promoted by an initial, thorough assessment of the patient. In addition, the psy- chiatrist must determine the treatment setting that will bemost likely to enhance the patient's safety as well as pro- mote improvement in the patient's condition. These ele- ments of psychiatric management are described in moredetail below. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Establish and maintain a therapeutic alliance A psychiatric assessment begins with establishing thera- peutic rapport and developing an alliance with the patient, regardless of the treatment modalities ultimately selected. The alliance itself may be the primary active therapeuticagent even for patients who receive monotherapy with medication (4). T o establish and maintain a therapeutic al- liance, it is important for the psychiatrist to be sensitive tothe patient's concerns. By virtue of their depressed state, patients often view themselves in a negative light. They may feel unworthy of help, embarrassed or ashamed ofhaving an illness, guilty about placing burdens on family members or the clinician, and distant or alienated from others. Individuals may also have a negative view of prior treatment experiences or have misconceptions about psy- chiatric treatment, which can color the therapeutic rela-tionship. Such issues require open discussion to educate the patient about the goals and framework of treatment and to provide an empathic and trusting environment inwhich the patient feels comfortable expressing his or her self-doubts, fears, and other concerns. Cultural and reli- gious factors may influence the patient's view of the depres-sive illness, his or her receptiveness to psychiatric treatment, and his or her preference of treatment modalities (5-7). Establishing a therapeutic alliance with a clinician of a dif-ferent background may present additional challenges for some patients. Management of the therapeutic alliance should also include awareness of transference and counter- transference issues, even if these are not directly addressed in treatment. Because patients frequently have strong preferences about treatment options, the psychiatrist should identifythe patient's wishes for treatment and collaborate with the patient in choosing among effective treatments. In addi-tion, treatment adherence can be enhanced by the delivery of patient-centered care and by a strong treatment alli- ance with the psychiatrist. Severe or persistent problemsof poor alliance or nonadherence to treatment may be caused by the depressive symptoms themselves. They may also represent psychological conflicts or a psychopatho-logical condition for which psychotherapy should be con- sidered. If possible and appropriate, the family should be in- cluded in discussions about the patient's illn ess and plans for treatment. When family members are involved, they can also be encouraged to play a helpful role in improvingthe patient's adherence to treatment and supporting the therapeutic alliance. 2. Complete the psychiatric assessment Patients with symptoms of depression should receive a thorough biopsychosocial assessment, both to determinewhether a diagnosis of major depressive disorder is war- ranted and to identify the presence of other psychiatric or general medical conditions. The general principles andcomponents of a complete psychiatric evaluation have been outlined in APA's Practice Guideline for Psychiatric Evalua- tion of Adults, Second Edition (8). The evaluation includes a history of the present illness and current symptoms, in- cluding vegetative symptoms and symptoms of mania or psychosis, as well as a psychiatric history that particularlynotes current treatments, responses to previous treat- ments, past hospitalizations or suicide attempts, and the presence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Assessingthe severity of the specific symptoms of depression may be aided by the use of standardized clinician- or patient- administered rating scales such as those described in Sec- tion II.A.8. Many individuals with depression attempt to alleviate symptoms through the use of alternative or complemen-tary treatments, over-the-counter or prescription medica- tions or dietary regimens, or through use of caffeine,tobacco, alcohol, or other substances, which may precip- itate or exacerbate depressive symptoms. Consequently, each of these factors should be carefully assessed. The per-sonal history will include an assessment of psychological development; a sexual history, including history of sexual abuse or assault; identification of early life trauma, includ- ing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect; deter- mination of responses to life transitions, major life events, or significant traumas; a social history; and an occupationalhistory, including history of military service. Co-occur- ring general medical conditio ns are common and can in- fluence the diagnosis of major depressive disorder as well as choices of treatment. Thus, a general medical history is essential, along with a review of the patient's current med- ications; a review of systems, including assessment forpain; and any indicated diagnostic tests or physical exam- inations. The latter may be done by the psychiatrist or by another physician or medically trained clinician. A mentalstatus examination is crucial in identifying signs of depres- sion, associated psychosis, co gnitive deficits, and factors influencing suicide risk (e.g., suicidal ideas, anxiety), as well as in identifying co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Because major depressive disorder is associated with func- tional impairment, the presence, type, and severity of thedysfunction should be evaluated. Impairments can include deficits in interpersonal relationships and family func- tioning, work performance, maintenance of health andhygiene, and deficits in quality of life. Whenever feasible, assessment should also include input from family members in order to determine the impact of the patient's conditionon his or her family. Family members and significant oth- ers can also report key elements of the patient's history or Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition, family function- ing may affect the outcome of the patient's depressive ill-ness (9, 10). A family history is also important to obtain and in- volves the collection of the family pedigree including par-ents, grandparents, and number and sex of siblings and children. For patients with children at home, information on their symptom state may be useful because of the highpossibility of psychiatric problems in the offspring of a de- pressed parent (11, 12). Such problems may require inter- vention or may be an added stressor for the patient. Thefamily history includes history of depression or other mood disorders, substance use disorders, psychosis, suicide, and unusual behaviors in the patient's relatives along with any associated impairments. Because family history is a potent and consistent risk factor for mental disorders, formulat-ing diagnosis and treatment decisions for the patient can be aided by knowing the age of onset and severity of psy- chiatric symptoms in the patient's family, as well as relatives'psychiatric treatment history, especially the tolerability and effectiveness of those treatments. In establishing a diagnosis of major depressive disorder as part of the initial assessment, other differential diag-nostic possibilities are important to consider. An initial consideration in the differential diagnosis is mood disorderdue to a general medical condition. Specific medical condi- tions that are important to consider and that may be associ- ated with a major depressive episode include neurologicalconditions (e.g., stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis), thyroid disorders, metabolic conditions (e.g., hypercalcemia), malignancy, and infectious diseases(13-15). Depressive symptoms that would otherwise be diagnosable as major depressive disorder are diagnosed instead as a mood disorder due to a general medical con-dition if the mood disturbance is judged to be the direct physiological consequence of a specific general medical con- dition. Similarly, medications used to treat general medicalconditions may induce depressive syndromes. Such medi- cations include transplant anti-rejection agents, chemo- therapy agents, interferon, ster oids, some antibiotics, and others. Depression caused by medications is classified in the DSM-IV-TR as other (or unknown) substance- induced mood disorder (DSM-IV-TR code 292.84) (16). Psychosocial stressors and other antecedent events, and their possible contribution to the generation of de-pressive symptoms, should be explored in the course of apsychiatric assessment. Depressive symptoms are a com- mon response to psychosocial stressors, particularly be- reavement. Symptoms characteristic of a major depressiveepisode may arise after a significant loss; however, the di- agnosis of major depressive disorder is generally not givenunless depressive symptoms are still present 2 monthsafter the loss, are particularly severe, or are uncharacter- istic of or unrelated to bereavement, such as persistentsuicidal ideation or morbid preoccupation with worthless- ness or guilt (16). Following a stressor, depressive symp- toms that do not reach sufficient number or severity to beclassified as a major depressive episode may be better de- scribed as an adjustment disorder. Despite the possible presence of antecedent stressors, psychiatrists should notdismiss potentially disabling depressive symptoms as \"nor- mal,\" thereby depriving patients of needed therapeutic at- tention. A thorough assessment of depression also includes the evaluation of psychotic symptoms. Major depressive dis-order may be associated with mood-congruent and mood- incongruent hallucinations and delusions. Depressed pa- tients may not initially present with psychotic symptoms,and patients may wish to hide shaming or distressing thoughts. Therefore, psychiatrists should carefully query patients about such symptoms in order to provide appro-priate treatments for them (see Section III.A.2.a). Identify- ing the presence of atypical, melancholic, or catatonic features of depression is also important, as such featuresmay influence the choice of treatments (see Sections III.A.2.b, III.A.2.c, and III.A.2.d). Considering that major depressive episodes are common in the course of bipolar Idisorder and that recurrent major depressive episodes are characteristic of bipolar II disorder (17), it is important to consider bipolar disorders as part of the differential diagno-sis of major depressive disorder. This distinction is especially important because the treatments for bipolar disorders of- ten differ from those for major depressive disorder. All patients who present for treatment for a major de- pressive episode should be screened for a past history ofmanic or hypomanic episodes and for past adverse reac-tions to antidepressants that might be consistent with a \"switch\" into hypomania or mania. Screening instruments for manic and hypomanic episodes include the Mood Dis-orders Questionnaire (18) and the Screening Assessment of Depression-Polarity, which includes three easily ad- ministered dichotomous questions (19). However, sincepatients are often unaware of prior hypomanic or manic episodes, even when questioned carefully, collateral sources of information, such as family members livingwith the patient, may be crucial in uncovering such epi- sodes. Clinical assessment sh ould also include whether or not the patient is experiencing a mixed episode, which is characterized by symptoms of both a major depressive ep- isode and a manic episode that occur nearly every day for at least 1 week. It is also important to consider the frequency and chro- nicity of prior episodes of major depressive disorder. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In clinical studies, chronic depression has a lower response rate than nonchronic depression, but be-cause the placebo-response rate is also lower, the relative clinical benefit is comparable. The onset of benefit in chronic depression appears more gradual than in nonchro-nic depression. However, despite a smaller response rate and slower response, it is important to recognize that chronic depression is not treatment refractory (20). Un-fortunately, however, in many patients, chronic depression remains undiagnosed or, if diagnosed, undertreated (21). The presence of a family history of a mood disorder should also be determined. Family histories of major de- pressive disorder and bipolar disorder are common inthose with major depressive disorder, but a family history of bipolar disorder may indicate increased risk of bipolar disorder in the patient. A family history of suicide is rele-vant in determining a patient's suicide risk (22) and may also signal the presence of an unrecognized mood disor- der in a relative. 3. Evaluate the safety of the patient Addressing safety concerns may take precedence over es-tablishing a full differential diagnosis or completing the psychiatric assessment. Because of the increased rates of suicide in depressed patients (22-24), a thorough and on-going evaluation of the patient's suicide risk is essential. Some components of an evaluation for suicidal risk are summarized in T able 1. The psychiatrist should evaluatethe presence of suicidal ideation and behaviors, the extent to which the patient has made plans for or begun to prepare for suicide, the availability and lethality of the means forsuicide, and the degree to which the patient intends to act on suicidal plans. A complete assessment also includes clin- ical factors that may increase the likelihood of a patient's acting on suicidal ideation, including a history of prior sui- cide attempts and the presence of psychotic symptoms, se- vere anxiety, panic attacks, impulsivity, and substance use.Patients should also be asked about a family history of sui- cide and recent exposure to suicide or suicide attempts by others. A suicide risk assessment should be individualizedto the particular circumstances of the patient by including an evaluation of the patient's strengths, motivation to seek help, social support systems, and physical health. Despite the best efforts of the psychiatrist, some pa- tients may engage in self-harm (22). Even with careful as-sessments of suicide risk, the ability to predict suicidalbehavior is poor, with many false positives (i.e., patients who appear more likely to make attempts or die by suicideTABLE 1. Factors to Consider in Assessing Suicide Risk Lifetime history, nature, seriousness, and number of previous attempts and aborted attempts Presence, history, and lethality of suicidal ideation, intent, or plans Access to means for suicide and the lethality of those means, such as access to a firearm Presence of hopelessness, psychic pain, decreased self-esteem, narcissistic vulnerability Presence of severe anxiety, panic attacks, agitation, impulsivity Presence and history of aggression and violence Nature of cognition, such as loss of executive function, thought constriction (tunnel vision), polarized thinking, closed-mindedness, poor coping and problem-solving skills Presence of psychotic symptoms, such as command hallucinations or poor reality testing Presence of alcohol or other substance use Presence of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorders, cluster B personality disorders Recent psychiatri c hospitalization Presence of disabling medical illness, especially with poor prognosis, such as ch ronic pain, brain and spinal cord injury, malignant neoplasm, HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Huntington's disease, chronic hemodialysis-treated renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Demographic features, such as age, race, marital status, sexual orientation Presence of acute or chronic psychosocial stressors, which may include actual or perceived interpersonal losses, financial difficulties or changes in socioeconomic status, family discord, domestic partner violence, and past or current sexual or physical abuse or neglect Absence of psychosocial support, such as poor relationships with family, unemployment, living alone, unstable or poor therapeuti c relationship, recent loss of a relationship History of childhood traumas, particularly sexual and physical abuse Family history of or recent exposure to suicide Absence of protective factors, such as children in the home, sense of responsibility to family, pregnancy, life satisfaction, cultural beliefs, or religiosity Source: Adapted from APA's Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Suicidal Behaviors (22).

The assessment of suicide risk is complicatedby the fact that suicidal in dividuals often conceal their thoughts and plans or act impulsively on short-lived sui-cidal thoughts, making their response to direct questionsan unreliable predictor of dangerousness to self. For this reason, in addition to using direct questioning, the psychi- atrist should also obtain information through observationand collateral history whenever possible (22, 25). The risk of suicide should also be monitored as treat- ment proceeds, since variations in depressive symptomsmay be associated with fluctuations in suicide risk. In youth and young adults, increases in suicidal thoughts and attempts have been reported early in the course of treat- ment with antidepressants, al though no increases in mor- tality rates were seen in clinical trials (26). Family members can provide information that increases the likelihood of early detection of harmful behaviors. It is also useful to convey the expectation that family members will call thepsychiatrist if concerns for safety emerge (27). For informa- tion about how suicidal ideation or behaviors affect the treat- ment plan, see Section III.A.1.a. Although the greatest risk surrounding depression in- volves the patient's health, a rare but also potentially di-sastrous outcome of depression is violence toward others,including homicide (28, 29). Psychosis, substance abuse, impulsivity, and a history of aggression increase this risk (30-32). Psychiatrists accordingly should assess not onlysuicidal risk but also history of violence, homicidal ide- ation, and plans of violence toward others. Additional as- sessment may be necessary under specific circumstances.For example, it is important to assess the impact of pa- rental depression (including peripartum depression) onchildren in the home, with specific attention given to theparent's vulnerability to neglect or harm the children (33). Whenever suicidal or violent ideas are expressed or sus- pected, careful documentation of the decision-making pro-cess is essential. In addition, patients who exhibit suicidal or violent ideas or intent require close monitoring. 4. Establish the appropriate setting for treatment T reatment settings for patients with major depressive dis-order include a continuum of possible levels of care, from involuntary hospitalizations to partial hospital programs,skilled nursing homes, and in-home care. In general, pa- tients should be treated in the least restrictive setting that is most likely to prove safe and effective. The psychiatristshould choose an appropriate site of treatment after eval- uating the patient's clinical condition, including symptom severity, co-occurring conditions, level of functioning, andavailable support system. The estimated degree of risk toself and to others is another significant determinant of treatment setting. Decisions about treatment setting should also include consideration of the patient's ability toadequately care for him- or herself, provide reliable feed- back to the psychiatrist, and cooperate with treatment of the major depressive disorder. Patients with suicidal or homicidal ideation, intention, or plans require close monitoring. For those at significantrisk, measures such as hospit alization should be consid- ered; hospitalization is usually indicated for patients who are considered to pose a serious threat of harm to them- selves or others. Patients who refuse can be hospitalizedinvoluntarily if their condition meets the criteria of the lo- cal jurisdiction for involuntary admission. Severely ill pa- tients who lack or reject adequate social support outside of a hospital setting should be considered for admission to a hospital or intensive day program, if available. In addition,patients who also have complicating psychiatric or general medical conditions or who have not responded adequately to outpatient treatment may need to be hospitalized. The optimal treatment setting and the patient's like- lihood of benefit from a different level of care should bereevaluated on an ongoing basis throughout the course oftreatment. Unfortunately, the spectrum of treatment set- tings available to patients is often limited by lack of avail- ability of options in the geographic setting, lack of abilityto pay for care, and/or limitations imposed by third party payers. 5. Evaluate functional impairment and quality of life The assessment of a patient with major depressive disorderincludes a determination of the severity and chronicity of symptoms. Even mild depression can impair function andthreaten life and the quality of life. In the extreme, de- pressed people may be totally unable to function socially or occupationally or even to feed and clothe themselvesand maintain minimal personal hygiene. Severely depressed patients may be immobilized to the point of being bedrid- den, with associated medical complications. The psychiatrist should address impairments in func- tioning and help the patient to set specific goals appropriateto his or her functional impairments and symptom severity.This will likely involve helping the patient to establish in- termediate, pragmatic steps in the course of recovery. For example, the psychiatrist may help patients who are havingdifficulty meeting commitments to develop a reasonable plan to fulfill their obligations (e.g., work, family obliga- tions), potentially by making alternative arrangements.The psychiatrist may advise other patients not to make ma- jor life changes while in the midst of a major depressive episode. Impairments in the patient's overall quality of life should also be assessed, which can be done by asking pa- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

The overall goals of treatment of major depressive disorder should focus on alleviating functional impair- ments and improving quality of life in addition to achievingsymptom resolution and episode remission. 6. Coordinate the patient's care with other clinicians The psychiatrist should assure that a comprehensive assess- ment of general medical conditions is performed in order to identify factors that may precipitate or exacerbate de-pressive symptoms. He or she may initiate the medical evaluations or coordinate care with other appropriate clini- cians. In some situations, review of medical records provided by the patient will suffice. In other situations, particularly when medical treatment is indicated, the psychiatrist should,with the patient's permission, arrange for collaborative care with other clinicians. Such collaboration may incorporate discussion of prescribed medication, including dose changesand possible drug interactions as well as necessary diagnos- tic procedures and medical monitoring, which may include laboratory measures and ECG (34). In treating the patient's depressive illness, a multifaceted approach is typically required that may include provisionof depression-focused psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy,ECT , or other therapeutic approaches. Under some cir- cumstances, all aspects of treatment will be administered by one psychiatrist, and this model of care may improveintegration of treatment components (35) or reduce over- all treatment cost (36). In other situations, treatment may require the coordinated effort of several clinicians. Thisdecision is frequently influenced by the clinicians' ex- pertise in providing the indicated therapeutic modality, economic factors, availability of treatment, and by the pa-tient's preferences. When this treatment model is used, one team member must assume the primary overall re- sponsibility for the patient's care. This individual serves asthe coordinator of the treatm ent plan, advocates for the appropriate level of care, oversees the family involvement,makes decisions regarding which potential treatment mo-dalities are useful and which should be discontinued, helps assess the effects of medications, and monitors the pa- tient's safety. Because of the diversity and depth of medicalknowledge and expertise required for this oversight func- tion, a psychiatrist is generally optimal for this role, al- though this staffing pattern may not be possible in somehealth care settings. If the treatment is split, the psychia- trist who is providing the psychiatric management and the medication treatment should meet with the patient fre-quently enough to monitor his or her care. Ongoing co-ordination of the overall treatment plan is essential and is enhanced by clear role definitions, plans for the manage- ment of crises or relapses, and regular communicationamong the clinicians who are involved in the treatment. Psychiatrists may at times serve as consultants to ongo- ing treatment of depression by other prescribers. Healthcare professionals other than psychiatrists may prescribe antidepressant medication for their patients for a variety of reasons, including convenience, financial reasons, stigma, and access to care issues (37). Primary care doctors, obste- tricians, and physicians of other disciplines may screen for depression and initiate treatment for patients. In fact, atleast one-fourth of patients presenting to primary care set- tings may have major depressive disorder, and 70%-80% of antidepressants are prescrib ed by a primary care physician or medical subspecialist (38, 39). Regardless of whether thepsychiatrist is acting as a consultant or transferring ongo-ing care to another clinician (e.g., with transition from an inpatient to outpatient setting), communication and coor- dination of treatment are essential. Optimal communi-cation with other health care professionals can improve overall treatment by assuring that medical conditions and psychosocial issues are appropriately addressed. Good com-munication also decreases the risk that patients will receive inconsistent information about treatment options and risks and benefits. Furthermore, communication among clini-cians improves vigilance against relapse, side effects, and risk to self or others. 7. Monitor the patient's psychiatric status As treatment progresses, different features and symptoms of the patient's illness may emerge or subside. The psychi-atrist should carefully and systematically monitor changes in the patient's psychiatric status, including major depres- sive disorder symptoms, as well as symptoms of other po-tential co-occurring conditions (T able 2). Monitoring the patient's status for the emergence of or changes in destruc-tive impulses toward self or others is especially crucial; ad-ditional measures such as hospitalization or more intensive treatment should be considered for patients found to be at higher risk. In addition, the patient should be monitoredfor treatment-emergent side effects, some of which may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms of the underlying depressive disorder or co-occurring medical conditions.Significant changes in a patient's psychiatric status or the emergence of new symptoms may warrant a diagnostic re- evaluation of the patient. For example, patients who noteworsening irritability, increased difficulty sleeping, racing thoughts, growing impulsivity, euphoria, or rapid shifts in mood should be monitored more closely and may warrantre-evaluation and consideration of a possible bipolar dis- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Often family members or caregivers notice changes in the status of the patient first and are therefore able to provide valuable input to the psychiatrist. 8. Integrate measurements into psychiatric management The integration of measurement tools into psychiatric man-agement, which has been referred to as measurement-based care, may enhance the quality of care and improve clinical outcomes (40). Clinician-rated and/or self-rated scales canhelp determine the trajectory of disease course and effects of treatment. Many such scales are available in several ver- sions that vary by number of items. Self-rated scales are con-venient to use but require review, interpretation, and discus- sion with the patient. In research studies, commonly used tools include the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), which is available in clinician-rated and self-rated versions (http://www.ids-qids.org/), the clinician-rated HamiltonRating umassmed.edu/mhealth/HAMD.pdf) rated Montgomery Rating Scale(MADRS) (http://www.cnsforum.com/streamfile.aspx?file name=MADRS.pdfandpath=pdf) (43), and the self-rated 9- item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (http://www.depression-primarycare.org/clinicians/toolkits/materials/ forms/phq9/) (44, 45). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-II) is another commonly used, copyrighted, 21-question multiple-choice self-rated instrument (46). Systematic measurement of side effects can also assist in the provision of treatment. Several self-report rating scaleshave been developed for assessing side effects of antidepres- sant treatment and are available in English and Spanish ver- sions (http://www.edc.pitt.edu/stard/public/ assessment_forms.html). The Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating Scale (FIBSER), which has also been re- ferred to as the Frequency and Intensity of Side EffectsRating/Global Rating of Side Effect Burden, uses three global Likert scale ratings to assess side effects experienced over the preceding week (47, 48). The Patient Rated Inven-tory of Side Effects (PRISE) is a 9-item scale that asks pa- tients about the presence of side effects in eight organ system domains, as well as about other side effects (47, 48). A cli-nician-administered scale, the T oronto Side Effects Scale, that focuses on antidepressant medication side effects is also available (http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/cjp/2002/march/orAntidepressantsAppendix.asp) (49). The Udvalg for Kliniske Unders\u00f8gelser (UKU) side effect rating scale (50) (available at http:/ /www.cnsforum.com/streamfile.aspx?filename=UKU. pdfandpath=pdf) is often used in research studies and may offer clinicians ad- ditional questions that could be asked about side effects,but it is likely to be too detailed for routine clinical use.Although the use of rating scales is not yet common practice in clinical settings, in part due to pragmatic con- cerns (51), the use of such scales can be valuable in mon- itoring symptoms and treatment progress. In addition,electronic monitoring is becoming more feasible, as elec- tronic health records are more commonly utilized and patients and psychiatrists have increased access to techno-logical tools that can help monitor and record symptoms. Baseline data and information about treatment-emergent changes can be collected systematically from the patientand electronically transmitted via telephone or the Inter- net. In addition to providing secure electronic capture of patient data, computerized decision support systems canbe useful in implementing evidence-based treatment for major depressive disorder (52). 9. Enhance treatment adherence For treatment to be successful, it is essential to support the patient's adherence to all details of the regimen by provid-ing education about the illness and its treatment, maintain- ing a strong therapeutic alliance, mobilizing family and other supports (including eliciting questions and clarifyingcommon misconceptions), evaluating factors affecting ad- herence, and addressing barriers to adherence as they arise. Major depressive disorder is often a chronic or recurrentcondition that requires patients to participate actively in and adhere to treatment plans for long periods, despite the fact that side effects or requirements of treatments may beburdensome. Patients may have strong preferences for mo- dality of treatment or medication choice, particularly if they or a family member have had past experience with thetreatment or medication. When feasible, factoring in these preferences may improve adherence to treatment. During the acute phase, patients with major depressive disordermay be poorly motivated, unduly pessimistic about their chances of recovery with treatment, suffering from deficits in memory, or poorly caring for themselves. During theTABLE 2.

The psy- chiatrist should recognize these possibilities, emphasize theimportance of adherence for successful treatment and pro- phylaxis, and encourage the pa tient to articulate any con- cerns regarding adherence (e.g., side effects, costs of treat- ment, scheduling conflicts, lack of transportation or child care). Patient and family attitudes about depression and its treatment can also influence adherence. Family memberscan play an important role in promoting optimism about treatment, assisting patients with adherence and providing the psychiatrist with input on side effects or other treat-ment-related concerns that may influence adherence. Some aspects of adherence will vary with the type of treatment being used. For example, patients in psychother- apy may experience increased anxiety as they confront fear- ful or difficult topics. This anxiety, in turn, may decreaseadherence to psychotherapy, and patients may begin to ar- rive late to or miss therapy sessions. In patients who are beginning treatment with a medication, common side ef-fects of medication options should be discussed. Patients should be involved in treatment decisions and encouraged to convey input on side effects that they consider reason-able or unbearable. Side effects such as weight gain, cog- nitive dulling, sexual side effects, sedation or fatigue, and agitation may represent different burdens to different in-dividuals. Emphasizing the following specific topics im- proves adherence: 1) explaining when and how often to take the medicine; 2) suggesting reminder systems, suchas pill boxes, alarms, etc.; 3) discussing the need to take medication for at least 2-4 weeks before beneficial effects may be noticed; 4) emphasizing the need to take medica-tion even after feeling better; 5) reviewing the need to consult with the psychiatrist before discontinuing medi- cation; 6) giving the patient an opportunity to express hisor her understanding of the medication, hearing his or her concerns, and correcting any misconceptions, and 7) ex- plaining what to do if problems or questions arise (53).Behavioral tailoring, which involves developing an indi- vidualized approach to incorporating medication into the daily routine and can also in clude simplifying the medica- tion regimen, has demonstrated efficacy for individuals with schizophrenia and may also be applicable to individuals with other psychiatric illnesses (54). Adherence may alsobe improved by minimizing the cost and complexity of medication regimens. Most antidepressant medications are available in generic forms, which are generally less costly. For individuals who cannot afford needed medi- cations, some pharmaceutical companies offer patient as- sistance programs. Information on such programs isavailable from pharmaceutical company Web sites, from the Web site of the Partnership for Prescription Assistance(http://www.helpingpatients.org), and from Rx Assist(http://www.rxassist.org). 10. Provide education to the patient and the family Education concerning major depressive disorder and itstreatments should be provided to all patients. Education is an essential element of obtaining informed consent totreatment. Whenever possible, education should also be provided to involved family members and significant oth- ers, although generally the patient's consent is requiredbefore such information can be shared. Specific topics to discuss may include that major depressive disorder is amedical illness and that effective treatments are both nec- essary and available. This information may be especially important for patients who attribute their illness to amoral defect, or for family members who are convinced that there is nothing wrong with the patient. Education regarding available treatment options will help patientsmake informed decisions, anti cipate side effects, and ad- here to treatments. Patients with depression can becomeeasily discouraged in treatment, especially if there is lessthan a full initial response. The psychiatrist should en- courage and educate patients to distinguish between the hopelessness that is a symptom of depression and the rel-atively hopeful actual prognosis. In addition, for patients treated with antidepressant medication or ECT , psychia- trists may choose to discuss a predictable progression oftreatment effects: first, side effects may emerge, then neu- rovegetative symptoms remit, and finally mood improves. Often significant others notice symptomatic improve-ment before the patient does. Given the chronic, episodic nature of major depressive disorder, exacerbations are common. Patients, as well astheir families, if appropriate, should be instructed about the significant risk of relapse. They should be educated to identify early signs and symptoms of new episodes andthe stressors that may precede them. Patients should also be instructed to seek adequate treatment as early in the course of the new episode as possible to decrease the like-lihood of a full-blown exacerbation or complications. Patient and family education also includes general pro- motion of healthy behaviors such as good sleep hygieneand decreased use of caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and other potentially deleterious substances. For most individuals, exercise carries benefits for overall health. Data generallysupport at least a modest improvement in mood symp- toms for patients with major depressive disorder who en- gage in aerobic exercise (55-61) or resistance training(62, 63). Regular exercise may also reduce the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the general population, with specific benefit found in older adults (64, 65) and individ-uals with co-occurring medical problems (57, 66).

Choice of initial treatment modality The acute phase of treatment lasts a minimum of 6-12 weeks. During this phase, the aims of treatment are to in- duce remission of symptoms and achieve a full return tothe patient's baseline level of functioning. In addition to general psychiatric management (described in Section II.A), treatment may consist of pharmacotherapy or othersomatic therapies (e.g., ECT, light therapy), depression- focused psychotherapy, or the combination of somatic and psychosocial therapies. Selection of an initial treatment mo-dality is influenced by several factors, including the symp- tom profile, the presence of co-occurring disorders or psychosocial stressors, the patient's prior treatment expe-rience, and the patient's preference. Psychiatrists should present patients with information concerning the evidence for a broad range of treatmentoptions, including somatic th erapies and psychosocial in- terventions. Antidepressant medications can be used as aninitial treatment modality by patients with mild, moder-ate, or severe major depressive disorder. Clinical features that may suggest that medications are the preferred treat- ment modality include a history of prior positive responseto antidepressant medications, the presence of moderate to severe symptoms, significant sleep or appetite distur- bances, agitation, patient preference, and anticipation ofthe need for maintenance therapy. Patients with major de- pressive disorder with psychotic features require either the combined use of antide pressant and antipsychotic medications or ECT . Psychotherapy may also be considered as monotherapy for patients with mild to moderate major depressive dis-order. The availability of clinicians with appropriate train- ing and expertise in specific psychotherapeutic approaches can be a factor in choosing a psychotherapy (67). Other factors that can influence this choice may be the psycho- social context, patient preference, prior positive response to psychotherapy, the presence of significant psychosocialstressors or interpersonal difficulties, co-occurring Axis II disorders, or the stage, chronicity, and severity of the major depressive episode. Specifically, many severely depressedpatients will require both a depression-focused psycho- therapy and a somatic treatment such as pharmacotherapy. Pregnancy, lactation, or the wish to become pregnant maytilt a decision toward psychotherapy as an initial treatment (see Section III.B.6). Given the lower occurrence of side ef- fects and suggestion of enduring benefits associated withdepression-focused psychotherapies (68), such treatments might be preferable alternatives to pharmacotherapy for some patients with mild to moderate depression.Combining a depression-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be a useful initial treatment choicefor patients with moderate to severe major depressive dis-order. Other indications for combined treatment include chronic forms of depression, psychosocial issues, intra- psychic conflict, interpersonal problems, or a co-occur-ring Axis II disorder. In addition, patients who have had a history of only partial response to adequate trials of single treatment modalities may benefit from combined treat-ment. Poor adherence with pharmacotherapy may also warrant combined treatment with medications and psy- chotherapy focused on treatment adherence. Electroconvulsive therapy should be considered as a po- tential treatment option for all patients with major depres-sive disorder who have psychotic features or catatonia and for those with an urgent need for response, such as patients who are suicidal or who are nutritionally compromised as aresult of refusing food. Electroconvulsive therapy may also be the treatment modality of choice for patients with major depressive disorder who have a high degree of symptom severity. Other considerations include the presence of co- occurring general medical conditions that preclude the useof antidepressant medications, a prior history of positive re-sponse to ECT, and patient preference. Evidence for TMS is currently insufficient to support its use in the initial treat- ment of major depressive disorder. If a patient with mild depression wishes to try exercise alone for several weeks as a first intervention, there is little toargue against it (Section II.A.10), provided the patient is suf-ficiently monitored for an abrupt worsening of mood or ad- verse physical effects (e.g., ischemia or musculoskeletal symptoms). The dose of exercise and adherence to an exer-cise regimen may be particularly important to monitor in the assessment of whether an exercise intervention is useful for major depressive disorder (69, 70). If mood fails to improveafter a few weeks with exercise alone, the psychiatrist should recommend medication or psychotherapy. For patients withdepression of any severity and no medical contraindicationto exercise, physical activity is a reasonable addition to a treatment plan for major de pressive disorder. The optimal regimen is one the patient prefers and will adhere to. Figure 1 summarizes treatment modalities that may be appropriate during the acute phase of treatment depend- ing on the severity of the patient's symptoms and other as-sociated features of the depressive episode. It is important to note that other factors may be relevant to treatment de- cisions for individual patients and that determinations ofepisode severity are imprecise, although rating scales may be helpful in assessing the magnitude of depressive symp- toms and their effects on functional status and quality oflife (see Sections II.A.7 and II.A.8).

Pharmacotherapy Antidepressant medications have been grouped as follows: 1) TCAs, which for the purposes of this guideline also include the tetracyclic antidepressant medication ma- protiline; 2) mine, isocarboxazid, and the transdermal formulation of selegiline. Although some studies have suggested superi- ority of one mechanism of act ion over another, there are no replicable or robust findings to establish a clinically meaningful difference. For most patients, the effective- ness of antidepressant medications is generally comparable between classes and within classes of medications. Responserates in clinical trials typically range from 50% to 75% of patients, with some evidence suggesting greater efficacy relative to placebo in individuals with severe depressivesymptoms as compared with those with mild to moderate symptoms (71-73). Although remission rates are less robust and selective publication of positive studies could affect theapparent effectiveness of treatment (74, 75), these factors do not appear specific to particular medications or medi- cation classes. Nevertheless, antidepressant medications do differ in their potential to cause particular side effects such as adversesexual effects, sedation, or weight gain. Therefore, the initial selection of an antidepressant medication will largely be based on the tolerability, safety, and cost of themedication, as well as patient preference and history of prior medication treatment (T able 3). Other factors in- clude the medication half-life and potential for drug inter-actions related to properties such as plasma protein binding or metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system (T ables 4 and 5). On the basis of these consider-ations, the following medications are optimal for most patients: SSRIs, SNRIs, mirtazapine, and bupropion. T able 6 provides the starting and usual doses of medica-tions that have been shown to be effective for treating major depressive disorder.Modality Severity of Illness PharmacotherapyDepression-Focused PsychotherapyPharmacotherapy in Combination With Depression-Focused PsychotherapyElectroconvulsive Therapy Mild to Moderate Ye s Yes May be useful for patients with psycho-social or interpersonal problems, intrapsy-chic conflict, or co-occurring Axis II disorderYes, for certain patients Severe Without Psychotic FeaturesYe s N o Ye s Ye s Severe With Psychotic FeaturesYes, provide both antidepressant and antipsychotic medicationNo Y es, provide both antidepressant and antipsychotic medicationYe s FIGURE 1.

Nevertheless, the medication experiencesof others close to the patient do influence the patient's be- lief about particular medications and pharmacotherapy in general. The presence of co-occurring psychiatric or general medical conditions can be a si gnificant factor influencing the choice of an antidepressant medication. For example, TCAs are generally not optimal in patients with cardiovas- cular conditions, cardiac conduction defects, closed angle glaucoma, urinary retention, significant prostatic hyper-trophy, or eating disorders with significant malnutritionor purging. In older adults and others with malnutrition,autonomic disorders (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, Parkin-son's disease), or low blood pressure, TCAs may exacer- bate hypotension and orthostasis, resulting in syncope or falls. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIsmay be inappropriate for patients who are experiencing sexual dysfunction. Patients who are receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer or other indications should generally betreated with an antidepressant (e.g., citalopram, escitalo- pram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine) that has minimal effect on metabolism through the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoen-zyme, because reduced metabolism of tamoxifen through CYP 2D6 is likely to be associated with lower levels of tamoxifen's active metabolite (76-79) with the possibility ofpoorer patient + ++ +++ Sources: (82, 83).

MAOIs may be particularly effective for patients with major depressive disorder with atypical features, although many psychiatrists prefer toprescribe SSRIs for such patients because of SSRIs' greater safety and tolerability and more favorable adverse effect profile. a. Efficacy of antidepressant medications 1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors escitalopram. A large body of literature supports the superiority of SSRIs compared with placeboin the treatment of major depressive disorder. In more than 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effec- tiveness of SSRIs has been compared with that of other an-tidepressant medications, mainly TCAs. The SSRIs have demonstrated comparable efficacy to the TCAs (84-88),even when anxiety symptoms are considered (85, 87-90). Although a few analyses suggest small advantages of SNRIs over SSRIs in rates of remission (91), a preponder- ance of the data finds no sign ificant evidence of the supe- riority of any other class or agents over SSRIs (84, 89, 90,92-95). One meta-analysis suggests a slight superiority ofescitalopram compared with other SSRIs and venlafaxine (93), and another found signif paroxetine (96), but other studies show no differences in efficacy among individual SSRIs (84, 93-95, 97, 98). 2.

However, the exact mechanism of action of several medications has yet to be determined or varies by dose. bLower starting doses are recommended for elderly patients and for patients with panic disorder, significant anxiety or hepatic disease, and co-occurring general medical conditions. cFor some of these medications (e.g., TCAs) the upper dosing limit reflects risk of toxicity or need for plasma level assessment , whereas for other medications (e.g., SSRIs), higher doses can be used safely but without evidence for overall superior efficacy. dThese medica- tions are likely to be optimal medications in terms of safety, th e patient's acceptance of side effects, and the quantity and quality of clinical trial data. eDose varies with diagnosis; see text for specific guidelines. fHas been used at doses up to 400 mg/day, although doses above 50 mg/day may not provide additional benefit. gThis medication is not typically used for this indication. hSelegiline selectively inhibits MAO B at low doses but inhibits both MAO A and MAO B at the high er doses that are typically required for antidepressant activit y.

For venlafaxine may be achieved for the average patient at lower therapeu- tic doses, although desvenlafaxine has a much greater bioavailability, resulting in a lower effective dose. In indi-vidual studies, venlafaxine and duloxetine are generally as effective as SSRIs (see the meta-analyses of Nemeroff et al. [101] and Thase et al. [102] for tabulated summaries ofindividual study results from the more than 40 relevant randomized controlled trials). Results of comparative studies of desvenlafaxine are not known at this time. Rel- ative to SSRIs, some analyses of pooled data sets have sug- gested a small advantage for SNRIs (91), which mightafford clinically modest benefits for patients with more se- vere depression (102) or for patients who have not re- sponded to prior trials of SSRIs (103). However, othermeta-analyses have shown equivalent efficacy for SSRIs and SNRIs (95), whereas some have shown superiority of individual medications but no clearcut medication classeffects (96). Relative to TCAs, venlafaxine's efficacy is comparable (91, 104, 105), whereas the more recently in- troduced duloxetine and desvenlafaxine have not beensystematically compared with TCAs. 3. Other antidepressant medications A number of other antidepressant medications differ struc- turally or in their pharmacological action from medications in the categories just described and are included here. Although bupropion is classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, the latter effect is rela-tively weak, and its mechanism of action remains unclear(106). There are three formulations of bupropion: im- mediate release, sustained release, and extended release. Bupropion is distinct from most antidepressants in nothaving an indication for th e treatment of any primary anxiety disorder, and it may be less well tolerated thanother antidepressants among patients with significantanxiety. In addition, a meta-analysis showed that SSRIs were modestly superior to bupropion for a subset of pa- tients with major depressive disorder and anxiety (107).For individuals with low to moderate levels of anxiety, the same meta-analysis showed that the efficacy of bupropion in treating major depressive disorder was roughly com-parable to that of the SSRIs (107). Results of another meta-analysis suggested that bupropion may be more likely to improve symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness than atleast some of the SSRIs (108). Bupropion may be a good choice for patients who have a goal of quitting smoking as it has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvalfor this indication, reduces desire for nicotine, and dou- bles rates of smoking cessation (109, 110). Patients typi- cally experience minimal weight gain or even weight losson bupropion (111), and for this reason it may be an ap- propriate antidepressant for patients who are overweight or obese. Mirtazapine is thought to work through noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms , although this tetracyclic compound is not a reuptake inhibitor (112). Mirtazapine has comparable efficacy to SSRIs (113). T razodone is the oldest medication from this group that is still in wide use. Although trazodone is an effectiveantidepressant, relative to placebo (105, 114, 115), in con- temporary practice it is much more likely to be used in lower doses as a sedative-hypno tic than as an antidepres- sant. Despite widespread use of trazodone as a hypnotic,few data support its use for this indication. Nefazodone has an analogous structure to trazodone but somewhat different pharmaco logical properties. In com- parative trials versus SSRIs, nefazodone showed compa-rable efficacy effective treatments for major depressivedisorder and have comparable efficacy to other classes of antidepressants, including SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs (85, 105). The efficacy subclasses of tricyclics (e.g., sec-ondary amines or tertiary amines) appears to be compara- ble. TCAs may be particularly effective in certain populations, such as in hospitalized patients (117, 118).Conventional wisdom is that this advantage is explained by the superiority of TCAs (versus SSRIs) among the subsetof patients with melancholia or more severe depression,because such a specific advantage has not been consis- tently documented in studies of less severely ill outpa- tients (85, 105, 118). 5. Monoamine oxidase comparable efficacy to other antidepres- sants for outpatients with major depressive disorder andmay be appropriate for patients with major depressive dis- order who have not responded to safer and more easily used treatments (119, 120). In fact, the role of MAOIs inmajor depressive disorder is now almost exclusively re- served for patients who have not responded to at least sev-eral other pharmacotherapies. Studies have demonstratedthe effectiveness of MAOIs in patients who have not re- sponded to other antidepressant medications, particularly Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

However, the effectiveness of MAOIs rela- tive to other strategies for treatment-resistant patients in contemporary practice remains unclear, particularly forpatients who have not responded to multiple sequential trials with SSRIs and SNRIs (121). MAOIs have been shown to be particularly effective in treating depressed patients with atypical features, so psy-chiatrists should consider using these medications for pa- tients with symptoms such as reactive moods, reverse neu-rovegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection (119, 120, 122). There do not appear to be any significant differ- ences in efficacy among the older MAOIs (119), althoughthere are important individual differences in responsive- ness, and these medications are not interchangeable. There are no comparative studies of the newer transder- mal (skin patch) formulation of selegiline; its efficacy has only been established relative to placebo (123-125), andclinical experience is limited. b. Side effects of antidepressant medications The severity of side effects from antidepressant medica- tions in clinical trials has been assessed both through the frequency of reported side effects and through the fre-quency of treatment dropout. The likelihood of different side effects varies among classes of antidepressant medi- cations, among subclasses, an d among individual agents. In addition, most newer antidepressants are better toler- ated than TCAs (84-88, 97, 117, 126) and safer in over- dose (127, 128). When side effects occur duri ng treatment with an an- tidepressant, an initial strategy is to lower the dose of theantidepressant or to change to an antidepressant that is not associated with that side effect. As an example, bupro- pion can be used if patients encounter sexual side effectswith an SSRI medication. When lowering the dose or dis-continuing the medication is not effective, additional strat- egies may be considered. These additional strategies are described in T able 7, which also lists prominent and clin-ically relevant side effects associated with particular med- ication classes. Serotonin syndrome, as the name implies, is presumed to result from high levels of serotonin in the brain. Althoughit can occur with administration of one or more seroto- nergic medications, it is most severe when an MAOI iscoadministered with another serotonergic medication. Consequently, great care must be taken when changing patients from another anti depressant medication to an MAOI and from an MAOI to other antidepressant medi- cations because of the persistent effects of discontinued medications. A washout period is essential before and afterusing an MAOI. If the psychiatrist chooses to discontinue a monoamine-uptake-blocking antidepressant medication(e.g., SSRI, SNRI, TCA) and substitute an MAOI, toxicinteractions can best be avoided by allowing at least a 2-week washout period between medication trials (T able 8). Thelong half-life of the SSRI fluoxetine and its metabolites necessitates a 5- to 6-week washout period or longer be- fore the use of an MAOI. Additional information aboutserotonin syndrome with specific medication classes can be found in Sections II.B.2.b.1.g. and II.B.2.b.5.b. Because knowledge of potential drug-drug interactions is frequently changing, it is useful to consult a frequentlyupdated drug information database before selecting an antidepressant in a patient taking other medications. 1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs have comparable tolerability overall, but the spe- cific medications differ somewhat in their side effect pro-files, which may guide selection of an agent for an individual patient. Pharmacokinetic issues, including half- life and effect on the CYP-450 enzyme system, are addi-tional considerations in the choice of an SSRI. a. Gastrointestinal SSRIs commonly cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (98). These adverse events are generally dose dependentand tend to dissipate over the first few weeks of treatment. In some patients, however, diarrhea persists. b. Activation/insomnia SSRIs sometimes precipitate or exacerbate restlessness, ag-itation, and sleep disturbances\u2014side effects that often attenuate with time. Anxiety may be minimized by intro- ducing the agent at a low dose. Akathisia has also been re-ported in patients taking SSRIs (129) and may contribute to reported restlessness or activation. If akathisia does oc- cur, a beta-blocker or benzodiazepine can be tried to re-duce symptoms. Insomnia can be treated by using sleep hygiene techniques or CBT as a first approach or by add- ing a sedative-hypnotic medication or trazodone. Somehave found melatonin to be helpful in treating SSRI- induced insomnia. c. Sexual side effects Although loss of erectile or ejaculatory function in menand loss of libido and anorgasmia in both sexes may be complications of virtually an y antidepressant medication, these side effects appear to be more common with SSRIs. The psychiatrist should ascertain whether the reported sex- ual dysfunction is a result of the antidepressant medication, the underlying major depressive disorder, a co-occurringmedical disorder, a disturbance in a relationship, or a need for education about sexual func tioning. If sexual dysfunc- tion is determined to be a side effect of the antidepressant medication, a number of strategies are available, including Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Specific pharmacological treat- ments that can be added for arousal difficulties, or orgasm dysfunction include buspirone (131), bupropion (132), sildenafil (133), and tadalafil (134). Other phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be also useful in treatingsexual side effects, and a variety of other medications have been used with anecdotal success (135, 136). d. Neurological effects Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can initially exac-erbate both migraine headaches and tension headaches. These effects tend to be tran sient and improve within the first few weeks of treatment. With continued treatment, SSRIs may actually help prevent and treat migraine head- aches (137, 138). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have associated dystonia , parkinsonism, and tardive 140). incidence of such side effects isvery low with SSRIs but may be higher in older patients,especially those with Parkinson's disease.e. Falls Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like other antide- pressive agents, have been associated with an increasedrisk of falls. In studies of nursing home residents, SSRI use has been associated with an approximately twofold in- crease in the risk of a fall (141, 142). An even greater riskof falls in patients who were taking SSRIs was noted in a community-based cohort study (143). Meta-analyses have also documented an increased risk of falls in patientstreated with antidepressive agents, in general (144, 145). The implications of this increase in fall risk are compli- cated by the decrease in bone density that has been notedin depressed patients (146) and in patients treated with SSRIs (147, 148). An increase in the risk of hip fractures has also been noted (149). Rarely, SSRI use has been as-sociated with bradycardia, which could also contribute to syncope and falls (150). In all patients, including those treated with SSRIs, fall risk may be increased in individu-als receiving benzodiazepines or other hypnotic agents (144, 145, 151) and in those receiving multiple medica- tions (144, 145). Systematically reviewing patients' medi-cation regimens may help to eliminate medications thatOther (continued) Hepatotoxicity Nefazodone Provide education about and monitor for clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction.

Inquir- ing about a history of falls in the past year and assessing for abnormalities in gait and balance can also help in identi- fying patients at particular risk for falling (153). f. Effects on weight Weight gain, at times substantial, occurs in some patients taking SSRIs (154). Patients who take paroxetine have a higher incidence of weight gain than those who take otherSSRIs (98, 155). Fluoxetine causes an initial reduction in weight, which tends to normalize with continued treatment (156). g. Serotonin syndrome Use of SSRIs has been associated with the rare develop- ment of a syndrome caused by an excess of central nervoussystem serotonergic activity. Features of serotonin syn- drome include abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, sweat- ing, hyperthermia, lethargy, mental status changes, tremorand myoclonus, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, cardiovas- cular shock, and possibly death (157). Although serotonin syndrome can occur rarely with the use of SSRIs alone, it isusually associated with the simultaneous use of multiple serotonergic agents and is most severe when SSRIs are given together with MAOIs. Consequently, when an SSRI is be-ing changed to an MAOI or vice versa, particular attention must be give to the duration of time between treatments (Section II.B.2.b) to avoid precipitating a potentially lethalserotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome has also been re- ported when SSRIs are used in combination with tramadol, high-dose triptans, or the antibiotic linezolid, which alsohas some ability to inhibit MAO (158, 159). h. Drug interactions The potential for drug-drug interactions differs signifi- cantly across the SSRIs. Selective in- hibitors have variable effects on hepatic microsomal enzymes and therefore cause both increases and decreasesin the blood levels of other medications. For example, when SSRIs that strongly inhibit the CYP of tamoxifen to its active metabolite is reduced (76-79), resulting in a poten- tial decrease in its efficacy in preventing breast cancer re- lapse (80, 81). Interaction with other drugs was higher for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine than for sertra-line, citalopram, and escitalopram (98, 160, 161). As described above, there can be a potentially lethal in- teraction between SSRIs and MAOIs: the serotonin syn-drome. At least five half-lives should elapse between the time an SSRI is stopped and an MAOI is started; for flu- oxetine discontinuation, this means waiting approximately5-6 weeks before starting an MAOI; for discontinuation of other SSRIs, approximately 2 weeks should pass before starting an MAOI (162). A 2-week waiting period has beensuggested after discontinuing an MAOI before starting an SSRI or another MAOI (T able 8). i. Discontinuation syndrome Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors generally should not be abruptly discontinued after extended therapy and, whenever possible, should be tapered over several weeks to minimize discontinuation-emergent symptoms. Clini-cal experience and a few controlled studies suggest that among the SSRIs, discontinuation-emergent symptoms are more likely with paroxetine than sertraline, citalo-pram, or escitalopram and least likely to occur with fluox- etine (due to the long elimination half-life of its primarymetabolite, norfluoxetine) (163, 164). Discontinuation-emergent symptoms include both flu-like experiences such as nausea, headache, light-headedness, chills, and body aches, and neurological symptoms such as paresthesias, insomnia, and \"electric shock-like\" phenomena. These symptoms typically resolve without specific treatmentover 1-2 weeks. However, some patients do experiencemore protracted discontinuation syndromes, particularly those treated with paroxetine, and may require a slower downward titration regimen. Another strategy is to changeto a brief course of fluoxetine, e.g., 10 mg for 1-2 weeks, and then taper and discontinue the fluoxetine (165).TABLE 8.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors The most common side effects of the SNRIs (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine) are similar to those seen with SSRIs, including nausea and vomiting, sexual dys-function, and activation; like the side effects seen with SSRIs, those with SNRIs can attenuate with continued use. The SNRIs also are more likely to be associated with side effects that reflect noradrenergic activity, including increased pulse rate, dilated pupils, dry mouth, excessive sweating, and constipation. Although all three SNRIs carrythe warning of increased blood pressure, this risk is greater during therapy with venlafaxine at doses above 150 mg/day (166) than with duloxetine at doses of 60-120 mg/day (167) or desvenlafaxine at doses of 50-100 mg/day (168). Because this blood pressure increase is dose-related, SNRI-induced hypertension may respond to dose reduction. In the absence of a reduction in hypertension, a different an- tidepressant medication may be considered. Alternatively,in a patient with well-controlled depressive symptoms, it may be preferable to add an antihypertensive agent rather than risk a depressive relaps e or recurrence with medica- tion tapering. As with the SSRIs, abrupt discontinuation of SNRIs should be avoided whenever possible. Discon- tinuation symptoms, which are sometimes protracted, aremore likely to occur with venlafaxine (and, by implication, desvenlafaxine) than duloxetine (100) and may necessitate a slower downward titration regimen or change to fluoxet-ine. As described above (Section II.B.2.b), there can be a potentially lethal interaction between SNRIs and MAOIs: the serotonin syndrome. 3. Other antidepressant medications a. Bupropion Bupropion differs from other modern antidepressants by its lack of direct effects on serotonergic neurotransmission and, as a consequence, a virtual lack of sexual side effects(169). Neurologic side effects with bupropion include head- aches, tremors, and seizures (106). The risk of seizures is minimized by avoiding high doses (e.g., using no morethan 450 mg/day), avoiding rapid titration, using divided dosing schedules for the immediate-release and sustained- release formulations, and avoiding use of bupropion in pa-tients with risk factors for seizures. Bupropion should also not be used in patients who have had anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa because of elevated risk of seizures (170).The risk of seizures may also be increased by the con- comitant use of inhibitors of CYP 2B6 (e.g., desipramine, fluoxetine) blood levels. Bupropion has been as- sociated with a low risk of psychotic symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations. It should therefore be usedcautiously in patients with psychotic disorders. Other side effects with bupropion include agitation, jitteriness, mild cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, and gastrointesti-nal upset. b. Mirtazapine The most common side effects of mirtazapine include dry mouth, sedation, and weight gain. For this reason, mir- tazapine is often given at night and may be chosen for de- pressed patients with initial insomnia and weight loss.Although these side effects tend to occur early in the treatment course and may attenuate with continued use, the weight gain associated with mirtazapine is greater than that with other non-TCA, non-MAOI antidepressants (95) and may make it a less attractive choice for some pa-tients. Mirtazapine increases serum cholesterol levels in some patients (171). Although several patients treated with mirtazapine were observed to have agranulocytosisin early studies, subsequent clinical experience has not con- firmed an elevated risk (172). c. Trazodone The most common side effect with trazodone is sedation. Because the sedation associated with trazodone is greater than that with other non-TCA, non-MAOI antidepres- sants (95), this can be an advantage in patients with initial insomnia (173). T razodone can also cause cardiovascular side effects, including orthostasis, particularly among el-derly patients or those with preexisting heart disease. Use of trazodone has also been associated with life-threat- ening ventricular arrhythmias in several case reports (173). T razodone also can cause sexual side effects, in-cluding erectile dysfunction in men; in rare instances, pri- apism occurs, which might re quire surgical correction (174, 175). d. Nefazodone Side effects with nefazodone include dry mouth, nausea, constipation, orthostasis, and visual alterations (176). Se- dation is also common and may necessitate a gradual titration of nefazodone. However, in patients with insom-nia, the sedating properties of nefazodone can be helpful in improving sleep (177). There appears to be a low inci- dence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (178,179) with nefazodone and, unlike trazodone, it has not been associated with priapism. Nefazodone has also been associated with rare but potentially fatal liver failure (180,181), which has limited its use in recent years. Drug-drug interactions can also be problematic as nefazodone in- hibits hepatic microsomal enzymes and can raise levels administered dications such as certain antihistamines, benzodi azepines, and digoxin.

Tricyclic antidepressants a. Cardiovascular effects Cardiovascular effects, including arrhythmias, can be problematic with TCA treatment. Consequently, a pre-treatment ECG is indicated for patients with significant cardiac risk factors and patien ts older than age 50 years. Follow-up ECGs may also be indicated to identify the de- velopment of conduction chan ges, typically during the early phase of TCA use (182). T ricyclic antidepressantsact similarly to class Ia antiarrhythmic agents such as qui-nidine, disopyramide, and procainamide, which increase the threshold for excitation by depressing fast sodium channels, prolong cardiac cell action potentials through actions on potassium channels, and prolong cardiac re- fractoriness through actions on both types of channels(183). As a result, combinatio ns of TCAs with other class I antiarrhythmic agents can exert additive toxic effects oncardiac conduction; patients wi th ventricular arrhythmias taking another class I anti arrhythmic agent who require TCA therapy should be under careful medical supervi-sion. Individuals with prolonged QT intervals, whetherpreexistent or medication induced, are predisposed to de- velop ventricular tachycardia (184). Even patients with normal pretreatment ECG results may develop atrio- ventricular block with TCAs that reverts to normal after discontinuation of antidepressant medication treatment (185). Because of these effects on cardiac conduction,TCAs (like other class Ia antiarrhythmic agents) may carry an increased risk of serious cardiac adverse effects, including mortality (186-189). In addition, fatal arrhyth-mias can occur in the context of TCA overdose (190, 191). In addition to causing arrhythmias, TCAs can cause a number of other cardiovascular side effects, including tachycardia (through muscarinic cholinergic blockade and -adrenergic blockade) or orthostatic hypotension (through -adrenergic blockade). Side effects such as orthostatic hypotension may in turn lead to events such as dizziness, falls, or fractures, which are of particular concern in elderlypatients (192). Of the TCAs, nortriptyline may be less likelyto contribute to orthostatic blood pressure changes (185). Preexisting orthostasis, antihypertensive treatment, de- hydration, and salt depletion, whether voluntary or a re-sult of diuretic treatment, may contribute to symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with TCAs. If there is no medical contraindication, patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension should maintain adequate fluid intake and be cautioned against extreme dietary salt restriction. b. Anticholinergic side effects All TCAs have antimuscarinic effects; clic amines desipramine and nortriptyline have less antimuscarinic activity (193). The most common consequences of muscarinic blockade aredry mouth, impaired ability to focus vision at close range, constipation, urinary hesitation, tachycardia, and sexual dysfunction. Although patients can develop some degreeof tolerance to anticholinergic side effects, these symp- toms may require treatment if they cause substantial dys- function or interfere with adherence. Impaired visualaccommodation may be counteracted through the use of pilocarpine eye drops. Dry mouth may be counteracted by advising the patient to use su garless gum or candy and en- suring adequate hydration. Constipation can be managed by adequate hydration and the use of bulk laxatives. Anti- depressant medications with anticholinergic side effects should be avoided in patients with cognitive impairment, narrow-angle glaucoma, or prostatic hypertrophy. T ricy-clic antidepressants and concentration and even precipitate anticholinergic delirium, particularly in patients who are elderly, medically compromised, ortaking other anticholinergic medicines. Such toxic confu- sional states may signal the presence of high TCA blood levels and can improve with lowering of the dose (194). c. Sedation T ricyclic antidepressants also have affinity for histaminer- gic receptors and produce varying degrees of sedation. In general, tertiary amines cause greater sedation, while sec-ondary amines cause less (193). Sedation often attenuates in the first weeks of treatment, and patients experiencing only minor difficulty from this side effect should be en-couraged to allow some time to pass before changing anti- depressant medications. Patients with major depressive disorder with insomnia may benefit from sedation whentheir medication is given as a single dose before bedtime. d. Weight gain T ricyclic antidepressants can cause weight gain, possibly through their histaminergic properties and/or blockade of 5-HT 2 receptors (195). The degree of weight gain appears to vary by agent (e.g., greater weight gain with amitrip- tyline and less with desipramine), is often dose dependent, and is potentially reversible with cessation of TCA therapy.Regular monitoring of weight permits early detection of weight gain and can allow the treating clinician and patient to determine whether a management plan to minimize orforestall further weight gain is clinically indicated. e. Neurological effects T ricyclic antidepressants can cause myoclonus (196). Since this may be a sign of toxicity, the clinician may wish to check the blood level (if available) to ensure that it is notexcessive. If the level is nontoxic and myoclonus is not Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

If the myoclonus is problem- atic and the blood level is within the recommended range,the patient may be treated with clonazepam at a dose of 0.25 mg t.i.d. Alternatively, the antidepressant medication may be changed. In overdoses, TCAs can cause seizures.Some vulnerable patients may experience seizures even on therapeutic doses of a TCA\u2014especially clomipramine and maprotiline (197). Amoxapine, a dibenzoxazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant, also produces seizures in overdose and has active metabolites that block dopam- ine receptors, conferring a risk of extrapyramidal side ef- fects and tardive dyskinesia (198). f. Falls Use of TCAs has been associated with an increased risk of falls in a number of studies and meta-analyses, and the rel-ative risk of falling appears comparable to that with SSRI treatment (141, 144, 145). Although systematic reviews show a relatively minor effect of orthostatic hypotension onfall risk, TCAs may contribute to orthostasis and falls in in- dividual patients (153). If orthostatic hypotension is prom- inent or associated with gait or balance problems, it mayrequire further evaluation and treatment to minimize the likelihood of falls (199). Other aspects of fall risk with TCAs are similar to those that have already been describedfor patients treated with SSRIs (Section II.B.2.b.1.e). Other causes of falls include bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, a seizure, or ataxia. g. Medication interactions A number of medications that inhibit, induce, or are me-tabolized by hepatic micros omal enzymes can interact with TCAs (200). For example, medications that induceCYP 3A4 such as carbamazepine or barbiturates will causea decrease in serum levels of TCAs. Drugs such as the an- tipsychotic medication perphenazine or SSRIs such as flu- oxetine or paroxetine can inhibit metabolism via CYP2D6, resulting in a reduced clearance and increased levels of TCAs. T ricyclic antidepressa nts can also alter the phar- macokinetics or pharmacodyna mics of other medications; for example, TCAs can cause a lowering of valproate lev-els and reduce the activity of clonidine. Therefore, adjust- ments in medication doses may be necessary when TCAsare administered concomitantly with other drugs for which there is an interaction. The ability to obtain meaningful an- tidepressant blood levels to guide dosing is an advantagewith several of the TCAs (e.g., nortriptyline, amitripty- line, desipramine, imipramine) (201). Potentially danger- ous interactions, including hype rtensive crises and seroto- nin syndrome, can develop when TCAs are administered with MAOIs (see Sections II.B.2.b and Hypertensive crises A hypertensive crisis can occur when a patient taking an MAOI ingests large amounts of tyramine or other vasoac- tive amines in foods or medications (202). This reaction ischaracterized by the acute onset of severe headache, nau- sea, neck stiffness, palpitations, profuse perspiration, and confusion and can possibly lead to stroke and death (119).Dietary restrictions include avoiding foods such as aged cheeses or meats, fermented products, yeast extracts, fava or broad beans, red wine, draft beers, and overripe orspoiled foods (202, 203). A number of medications includ- norepinephrine reuptake blocking the-counter decongestants can also produce a hyperten- sive crisis when used in combination with MAOIs (202,204). Individuals with asthma who receive MAOIs should be cautioned regarding interactions with sympathomimetic bronchodilators, although other antiasthma agents ap-pear to be safe. Stimulants may be added to MAOIs, but only with caution and in selected individuals with treatment- resistant symptoms (205, 206). At low doses (6 mg/24 hours), selegiline differs from the older MAOIs in selectively blocking MAO B. In addi-tion, the transdermal delivery of selegiline bypasses en-zyme inhibition in the gut and first-pass metabolism in the liver. As a result, a low-tyramine diet is not needed when selegiline is prescribed at the minimum therapeutic dose.However, few safety data are available at higher doses at which selegiline becomes nonselective and inhibits both MAO A and MAO B. Consequently, a low-tyramine diet isneeded when doses of 9 mg/24 hours and higher are pre- scribed as with other MAOIs (207, 208). Moclobemide, which is available in Canada but not the United States, dif-fers from the above MAOIs in binding reversibly to MAO and makes dietary restrictions unnecessary with moclobe- mide. The potential for drug-drug interactions with sele-giline and moclobemide has not been fully studied, but caution suggests that the same drug interactions should be considered as when prescribing the older, nonselective, ir-reversible MAOIs. Although some clinicians continue to recommend that patients carry nifedipine as a self-administered antidote(e.g., 10 mg by mouth at the first sign of a hypertensive crisis [209]), this practice has not been approved by the FDA, and there are concerns about both the safety andefficacy of this strategy, which can produce dangerous hypotension (210). Definitive treatment of hypertensive crises usually involves intravenous administration of anantihypertensive agent (e.g., labetalol, sodium nitroprus- side) in an emergency department setting.

Serotonin syndrome As discussed previously in Section II.B.2.b.1.g, serotonin syndrome is caused by excess CNS serotonergic activityand is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, sweating, hyperthermia, lethargy, mental status changes, tremor and myoclonus, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, car-diovascular shock, and possibly death. Serotonin syndrome most commonly occurs when MAOIs (including reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase and selegiline) are takenin close proximity to other serotonergic agents, such as bus- pirone or antidepressants (157, 204, 211). Consequently, when patients are being changed from an SSRI other thanfluoxetine or an SNRI to an MAOI, a waiting period of at least 2 weeks is needed between the discontinuation of one medication and the initiation of the other. When changing from fluoxetine to an MAOI, a waiting period of at least 5 weeks is needed before the MAOI is started (T able 8).Other medications that have been reported to produce se- rotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with MAOIs chlorpheniramine (204). Cardiovascular effects Orthostatic hypotension is commonly seen during MAOItreatment. Possible treatments for this side effect in- clude adding dietary salt to increase intravascular volume, or use of the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone. Use ofMAOIs can also be associated with the development of peripheral edema, which may be helped by the use of sup- port stockings. d. Weight gain Weight gain is also commonly seen in patients treated with nonselective MAOIs. Although clinical experience islimited, results of one 52-week study suggested that treat- ment with transdermal selegiline may not be associated with an increased risk of weight gain (212). e. Sexual side effects Sexual side effects seen with MAOI therapy include anor- gasmia, decreased libido, and erectile or ejaculatory dys-function. Sexual side effects may diminish over time or with reductions in MAOI doses. The transdermal formu- lation of selegiline appears to have a relatively low risk ofsexual side effects (213). f. Neurological effects T reatment with MAOIs can also be accompanied by head-aches and insomnia; these side effects may diminish over time with continued use. Other neurological effects seen with MAOIs include sedation, myoclonic jerks, paresthe-sias, intense daytime drowsiness, and, rarely, peripheral neuropathy. c. Implementation of pharmacotherapy Improvement with pharmacoth erapy can be observed as early as the first 1-2 weeks of treatment, and improve- ment continues up to 12 weeks. Many patients may show partial improvement as early as the end of the first week(214-216). Others achieve improvement within the first 2-4 weeks (217-220). In short-term efficacy trials, all anti- depressant medications appear to require at least 4-6 weeks to achieve maximum therapeutic effects (221, 222). Thereis also evidence for continued accrual of benefit for an ad- ditional 4-6 weeks (223). Furthermore, longer time to therapeutic effect has been seen with studies conducted in \"real world\" settings (224), as well as in studies of patientswith more chronic illness (225, 226) or patients with ma- jor depressive disorder complicated with co-occurring med- ical and/or Axis I disorders (224, 227). Once an antidepressant medication has been selected, it can be started at doses suggested in T able 6. Initial dosesshould be incrementally raised as tolerated until a thera-peutic dose is reached or the patient achieves remission, provided there has been at least some improvement in symptoms in the initial weeks of treatment (217-220). Forpatients who exhibit a partial response to treatment, doses of antidepressant medications should be maximized, side effects permitting, before changing to a different antide-pressant medication. In some instances, due to factors such as rapid metabolism of medication (228, 229), patients may require doses above those noted in FDA labeling. Pa-tients who have achieved some improvement during the initial weeks of treatment should be encouraged to con- tinue taking antidepressant medication for a total of atleast 4-8 weeks. If at least moderate improvement is not observed with maximally tolerated doses after 4-8 weeks of treatment, reappraisal and adjustment of the pharmaco-therapy should be considered. Patients with no improve- ment in the initial weeks of treatment generally need an earlier adjustment of treatment. For these patients, thepsychiatrist should consider changing to another antide- pressant rather than increasing the dose of the medication.For some antidepressant medications, the exact relation-ships between doses and major depressive disorder symp- tom response have not been rigorously investigated with fixed-dose studies, and minimum effective doses have notbeen clearly established; moreover, for other antidepres- sant medications, some studies have failed to show dose- response relationships (230, 231). Therefore, the initialdoses and usual adult doses in T able 6 are intended to serve as general guidelines, and actual doses may vary from individual to individual.

In general, patients who are older, are medically compromised, or have decreased abil-ity to metabolize and clear antidepressant medications will require lower doses. In such patients, reduction of initial and therapeutic doses to 50% of usual adult doses is oftenrecommended, and dose escalations should be made at a slower rate than for younger and healthier adults. Doses will also be affected by the side effect profile of medicationsand the patient's ability to tolerate these side effects. Med- ication doses should also be tailored to individual patients depending on the potential for pharmacokinetic alterations and drug-drug interactions. Patients who have started taking an antidepressant medication should be carefully and systematically moni-tored to assess their response to treatment, the emergence of side effects, their clinical condition, sa fety, and adher- ence to treatment. Use of clinician- and patient-rated scales can facilitate such assessments (see Section II.A.8). Factors to consider when determining the frequency oftreatment visits include the severity of illness, the patient's cooperation with treatment, the availability of social sup- ports, the presence of co-occurring general medical ill-nesses, and the progression of symptom change. Visits should also be frequent enough to monitor and address suicide risk and to actively promote treatment adherence,since attrition from treatment continues to be a major hurdle in maximizing outcomes. Patients in clinical trials appear to benefit from monitoring once a week or more.This frequency of monitoring enhances adherence rates and likely helps patients avoid the demoralization that may occur before the onset of beneficial effects (216). Inthe recently completed STAR*D (\"Sequenced T reatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression\") trial, up to six visits were recommended during the first 12 weeks (acute phase)of measurement-based treatment at each of the four treat- ment steps (40). In clinical practice, the frequency of monitoring during the acute phase of pharmacotherapymay vary and can be as often as multiple times per week in more complex circumstances. The method of monitoring (e.g., face-to-face visits, telephone contact, or contact withanother clinician knowledgeable about the patient) may vary depending on the clini cal context and the treatment modality. Although for most patients, monitoring of antidepres- sant blood levels is not necessary, it may be useful for those taking TCAs. For some medications, particularly nortrip-tyline, amitriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine, blood drug levels correlate with both efficacy and side effects(201, 232, 233). When such medications are given, obtain-ing blood drug levels can be particularly informative when patients have not responded to treatment with an adequatedose of antidepressant medication for an adequate dura- tion; when patients are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of a medication and require the lowest possibleeffective dose; when there are concerns about patient ad- herence; and when there is concern that drug-drug inter- actions are adversely affecting antidepressant medicationlevels. In time, genetic testin g may help guide selection or dosing of antidepressants, but data are currently insufficientto justify the cost of such tests (229). Some antidepressant medications, especially TCAs, can cause significant morbidity and mortality in overdose(190, 191). Ingestion of a 10-day supply of a tricyclic agent administered at a dose of 200 mg/day is often lethal. Early on in treatment, it is prudent to dispense only small quan-tities of such antidepressant medications and keep in mind the possibility that patients can hoard medications over time. Alternatively, in patients who are suicidal, it may bepreferable to employ agents that are safer in overdose such as the SSRIs, bupropion, or mirtazapine. 3. Other somatic therapies a. Electroconvulsive therapy Electroconvulsive therapy has the highest rates of response and remission of any form of antidepressant treatment, with 70%-90% of those treated showing improvement (234-236). Although the remission rate with ECT appears to be lower when it is used in community settings than when it is used in clinical trials (237), the proportion of patients withmajor depressive disorder who respond to ECT is still greater than the proportion who respond to antidepressant medication. In addition, ECT has been associated with sig-nificant improvements in health-related quality of life (238). Consequently, ECT should be considered for patients with severe major depressive disorder that is not responsive topsychotherapeutic and/or pharmacological interventions, particularly those with significant functional impairment who have not responded to numerous medication trials(239). Electroconvulsive therapy may be particularly bene- ficial and can be considered as a first-line treatment option for severe major depressive disorder when it is coupled with psychotic features (240, 241), catatonia (239, 242), suicide risk (243), or food refusal leading to nutritional compro- mise, as well as in other situations when a particularly rapidantidepressant response is required (240), such as with se- verely ill inpatients (239). Electroconvulsive therapy is also indicated as a first-line treatment for patients who have pre-viously shown a positive response to this treatment modality or who prefer it (239).

Side effects of electroconvulsive therapy Electroconvulsive therapy is a very safe treatment, and there are no absolute contraindications to its use (239). Risks of morbidity and mortality, in general, do not exceed those associated with anesthesia alone (239, 244, 245).However, the presence of some medical conditions may necessitate modifications in anesthesia or ECT adminis- tration. Electroconvulsive therapy may have cardiovascular side effects, mediated by changes in the autonomic nervoussystem with the initial stimulus and subsequent seizureactivity (239). More specifically, ECT typically causes a transient rise in heart rate and blood pressure, with asso- ciated increases in cardiac wo rkload and intracranial pres- sure. These effects can be managed by optimizing bloodpressure control prior to ECT and administering anti-hypertensive agents (e.g., short-acting beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers) at the time of ECT (239). Ar- rhythmias, which are usually transient, can also occur inconjunction with ECT and can be managed with usual antiarrhythmic therapies if they do not resolve spontane- ously (239). Electroconvulsive therapy can also be associated with cognitive effects, the most common of which is a period ofconfusion following the ECT and associated anesthesiathat generally lasts between 30 and 60 minutes (246). Electroconvulsive therapy also is associated with antero- grade amnesia, which typically resolves soon after the lastECT treatment (247). Some degree of retrograde amne- sia, particularly for recent memories, may continue for a longer period of time after the end of the ECT course(247) but is less pronounced for autobiographical memo- ries than for impersonal memories (248). These cognitive effects of ECT are related to electrode placement, stimulusdosage, age, and premorbid cognitive status (249-253). Retrograde amnesia also improves over time, typically re- solving within 6 months (248, 252), although some patientsreport incomplete recovery of memories, particularly for events around the time of the treatment (247, 254). Rarely, patients report more pervasive and persistent cognitivedisruption, the basis of which is uncertain (252, 255). For many individuals, however, subjective memory (256) and quality of life (238) is improved following ECT with theresolution of the major depressive episode and its associ- ated deficits in memory or executive functioning (257, 258). 2. Implementation of electroconvulsive therapy The evaluation preceding ECT consists of a psychiatric history and examination to verify that ECT is indicated, a general medical evaluation (including medical history andphysical examination with cognitive assessment, vital signs,and any specifically indicated laboratory, radiologic, or imaging studies) to define factors that may influence the risk of ECT, and an anesthesia evaluation to identify and address the nature and extent of anesthetic risk and the need for modification of medications or anesthetic tech-nique (239). This evaluation should include a summary oftreatment indications, treatment risks, and a suggestion of any indicated additional evaluative procedures, alterations in treatment, or modifications in ECT technique (239). Inassessing indications for cauti on (e.g., recent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, intracranial space-occu-pying lesions), the relative risks and benefits should becarefully weighed in collaboration with an anesthesiolo- gist, a general medical physician, and other specialists, as necessary. Once completed, the pre-ECT evaluation will serve as the basis for a specific, individualized discussion of the risks and benefits of ECT relative to other thera-peutic options as part of the informed consent process. With the patient's permission, it is helpful to educate the patient's family about ECT and involve them in discus-sions relating to consent. An additional aspect of de cision-making prior to ECT relates to the use of psychotropic medications during theECT course. There is growing use of ECT combined with antidepressant medication. Although data supporting this practice are still few, it does not appear to increase side ef-fects and may augment response (259, 260). An additional goal of combination treatment is to minimize the risk of relapse between the end of the ECT course and the attain-ment of full antidepressant effectiveness. Antipsychotic medications are typically continued during the ECT course (239, 261), although most data on this practice comefrom studies of patients with schizophrenia who are re- ceiving ECT. The safety of combining lithium and ECT has been questioned, although there are conflicting data(239, 262). Medications that have anticonvulsant proper- ties are often discontinued or given at decreased doses during the ECT course to minimize effects on seizure in-duction (239, 261). With benzodiazepines, there is some evidence that concurrent use may diminish ECT effective- ness, particularly when right unilateral electrode place-ment is used (263). Electroconvulsive therapy may be administered either unilaterally or bilaterally (using a bitemporal or bifrontalelectrode placement). Compared with patients who re- ceive bilateral treatment, most patients who receive right unilateral electrode placement with low stimulus intensi-ties experience fewer cognitive effects but less therapeutic benefit (253). Stimuli of higher intensity (i.e., 500% above seizure threshold) are associat ed with antidepressant ef- fects more comparable to those seen with bilateral elec- trode placements, although such stimulus intensities are Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Re- gardless of what electrode placement is chosen, stimulus dosing should be individualized and stimulus parametersadjusted to induce an adequate generalized seizure, which is typically at least 20 seconds or greater in motor duration and 30 seconds in EEG duration (239). Failure to inducean adequate seizure should be followed immediately by restimulation at higher energies until an adequate seizure is elicited. Electroconvulsive therapy is typically administered 2-3 times/week; less frequent administration has been as-sociated with less cognitive impairment but also a longerlag in the onset of action (265). In clinical practice, the need for ECT to be administered at this frequency could produce logistical barriers for some patients who would either require hospitalization or transportation after ECT sessions. The acute course of ECT treatment typicallyconsists of six to 12 treatments and generally does not ex- ceed 20 treatments (239, 266). It is important that treat- ment continue until symptoms have remitted or clearlyreached a plateau, since relapse rates appear to be greater and overall prognosis worse if ECT is discontinued pre- maturely (237). Use of a formal rating scale may be help-ful in assessing symptom response as well as the cognitive side effects of treatment, permitting adjustments in the treatment parameters or frequency (239, 267). For more detail on the administration of ECT, see APA 's The Practice of Electroconvulsive Therapy: Recommendationsfor Treatment, Training, and Privileging (A T ask Force Report of the American Psychiatric Association) (239). b. Transcranial magnetic stimulation T ranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a specifically designed magnetic coil that is placed in contact with the head to generate rapidly alternating magnetic-resonance-imaging-strength magnetic fields and produce electrical stimulation of superficial cortical neurons. Based on the results of a multisite randomized cortex (268), TMS was cleared by the FDA in 2008 for use in individuals with major depressive disorderwho have not had a satisfactory response to at least one antidepressant trial in the current episode of illness. How- ever, another large randomized sham-controlled trial ofTMS added to antidepressant pharmacotherapy showed benefit of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS (269). In comparisons of actual TMS versus sham TMS, most (270-272) but not all (273) recent meta-anal- yses have found relatively small to moderate benefits of TMS in terms of clinical re sponse. Although the primary studies used in these meta-analyses are highly overlapping and the variability in TMS stimulus parameters and treat-ment paradigms complicates the interpretation of re-search findings, these meta-analyses also support the use of high-frequency TMS over the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex. Lesser degrees of treatment resistance may be associated with a better acute response to TMS (274). In comparison with ECT , TMS has been found in ran- domized studies to be either less effective than ECT (275)or comparable in efficacy to ECT (276-278), but in the latter studies TMS was more effective and ECT was lesseffective than is typically seen in clinical trials. A fewer number of studies have compared cognitive effects of TMS and ECT. One randomized trial found no signifi-cant difference between TMS and non-dominant uni- lateral ECT on performance on neuropsychological tests at 2 and at 4 weeks of treatment (276), although a small open-label trial reported a greater degree of memory dif- ficulties with ECT than with TMS shortly after the treat-ment course (279). Across all studies, TMS was well tolerated and was asso- ciated with low rates of treatment dropout (270, 280).T ransient scalp discomfort and headaches were the most commonly reported side effects (280). In clinical practice, the need for daily TMS could pro- duce logistical barriers for some patients. c. Vagus nerve stimulation Vagus nerve stimulation is approved for use in patientswith treatment-resistant depression on the basis of its po- tential benefit with long-term treatment. There is no in- dication for the use of VNS in acute phase treatment ofdepression, as data showed no evidence for acute efficacy (281, 282). Further information on the use of VNS as an adjunct to other antidepressive treatments is provided inSection II.B.7.c. 4. Psychotherapy There has been considerable research on time-limited psychotherapies for major depressive disorder, although the number of studies is smaller than for pharmacothera-pies. Most research has focused on individual, in-person, outpatient treatment, in part based on the needs and con- straints of research methods. However, research has alsobegun to explore psychotherapies in differing formats, including groups, over the telephone, and with computer assistance. When psychotherapy is part of the treatment plan, it must be integrated with psychiatric management (SectionII.A) and any other treatments (e.g., pharmacotherapy) thatare being provided. Clinical considerations and other patient factors should be considered in determining thenature and intensity of psychotherapy. T ypically psycho- therapy is given in an ambulatory setting, although some Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Like pharmacotherapy, the effectiveness of psycho-therapy will vary with the skill and training of the therapist. Patient factors, such as the nature and duration of depres- sive symptoms, beliefs and attitudes toward psychotherapy,and early life experiences (e.g., history of trauma) also affect treatment response to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is particularly useful in addressing the psychosocial stressorsand psychological factors that have an impact on the devel- opment or maintenance of depressive symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psycho- therapy (IPT), and behavioral psychotherapies (e.g., be- havioral activation) have demonstrated acute efficacy in treating major depressive disorder. There is less evidencefor other psychotherapies. However, one meta-analysis found no large differences in long-term efficacy betweenany of the major psychotherapies, including dynamic psy- chotherapy, for mild and moderate depression (286). In terms of longer term outcomes, psychotherapy is generallyfound to have more prolonged effects than pharmacother- apy after cessation of active treatment. In particular, IPT and CBT have shown lasting benefits in maintaining remis-sion (287-289). These time-limited treatments are essen- tially equipotent with antidepressant medications for outpatients with mild to moderate acute depression butprobably should be used in conjunction with medication for severe or melancholic major depressive disorder. Some research has suggested patient and illness characteristicsthat might predict differential benefits of CBT over IPT , and vice versa, for patients with major depressive disorder (e.g., see reference 290), but such preliminary findings re-quire replication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and IPT appear less ef- fective than pharmacotherap y for chronic depression, at least as acute monotherapy (291-296). Nonetheless, in patients who respond to medication, psychotherapy may foster the development of social skills and confidence af-ter years of depression-related impairments (297). Psychotherapy carries its own \"side effects.\" A psycho- therapy that requires considerable time or patience maybe poorly tolerated. The work of psychotherapy itself may generate anxiety or other strong feelings, which may be difficult for patients to manage. An indirect measure ofthe relative side effects and tolerability of psychotherapy can be obtained from the dropout rates in clinical trials; however, many other factors can also affect these rates(e.g., other burdens of the research trial, specific features of the clinical management provided, logistical barriers in attending appointments). Depending on what can reason-ably be expected with the given type of psychotherapy, the psychiatrist should consider a change in the intensity ortype of psychotherapy and/or addition or change to med- ication if psychotherapy for major depressive disorder has not resulted in significant improvement in 4-8 weeks. a. Specific psychotherapies 1. Cognitive and behavioral therapies In the treatment of depressed patients, psychotherapiesthat focus primarily on aspects of cognitive patterns and those that emphasize behavioral techniques can be used alone, but are generally used in combination. Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines cognitive psychotherapy with behavioral therapy and maintains that irrational beliefs and distorted attitudes toward the self, the environ- ment, and the future perpetuate depressive affects andcompromise functioning. The goal of CBT is to reducedepressive symptoms by challenging and reversing these beliefs and attitudes and encouraging patients to change their maladaptive preconceptions and behaviors in reallife (298). Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. In meta-analyses, CBT hasgenerally surpassed control conditions in efficacy and has had equal efficacy compared with other empirically sup- ported psychotherapies (i.e., IPT and behavior therapy)(299). Studies comparing the effectiveness of CBT with pharmacotherapy, however, are methodologically challeng- ing to conduct, and results are inconsistent (296, 300).Also unclear is whether CBT is less effective for patients with more severe depressive symptoms. Behavior therapy for major depressive disorder is based on theoretical models drawn from behavior theory (301)and social learning theory (302 ). Behavioral activation is a newly articulated behavioral intervention with some pos- itive preliminary results that merit further study (288, 303). Specific behavior therapy techniques include ac- tivity scheduling (304, 305), self-control therapy (306),social skills training (307), and problem solving (308). Be- havior therapy involves graded homework, scheduling of enjoyable activities, and minimizing unpleasant activities(309). Behavior therapy has demonstrated efficacy, at times superior to cognitive therapy, in treating major depressive disorder (310). 2. Interpersonal psychotherapy The focus of IPT is on current life changes, including losses, role disputes and role transitions, social isolation, deficits in social skills, and other interpersonal factors thatmay interact with the development of the depressiveepisode (311, 312). In IPT the goal is to intervene by iden- tifying the current trigger of the depressive episode, facil- itating mourning in the case of bereavement, promotingrecognition of related affects, resolving role disputes and Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In IPT , major depressive disorder is defined as a medical illness,and the illness, rather than the patient, is blamed for the symptoms. Interpersonal psychotherapy's medical model makes it highly compatible with pharmacotherapy incombined treatment. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an efficacious treat- ment for major depressive disorder (296, 313). Studieshave shown efficacy of this treatment in depressed pri- mary care patients and patients with more severe depres- sion (311). The efficacy of IPT has been demonstrated foradolescents, pregnant and postpartum women, and geri- atric patients (311). Interpersonal psychotherapy can also be used as a monthly maintenance therapy to prevent relapse (289, 314, 315). Some studies have also suggested possible subgroups in whom IPT may show differentialefficacy, specifically among HIV-positive patients (316) and patients who have co-occurring obsessive personality traits and who are single and not living with others (317).Furthermore, for patients with severe life events, IPT may have advantages over therapies that do not focus on such events directly. 3. Psychodynamic psychotherapy The term \"psychodynamic psychotherapy\" encompasses a range of brief to long-term psychotherapeutic interven-tions (318-320). These interventions derive from psycho- dynamic theories about the etiology of psychological vulnerability, personality development, and symptom for-mation as shaped by development and conflict occurring during the life cycle from earliest childhood forward (321- 325). Some of these theories focus on conflicts related toguilt, shame, interpersonal relationships, the management of anxiety, and repressed or unacceptable impulses. Others address developmental psychological deficits produced byinadequacies or problems in the relationship between the child and emotional caretakers, resulting in problems of self-esteem, sense of psychological cohesiveness, and emo-tional self-regulation (323, 326-330). Psychodynamic psychotherapy may be brief but usu- ally has a longer duration than other psychotherapies, and its aims extend beyond immediate symptom relief. These goals are to modify underlying psychological conflicts and deficits, which increase the patient's vulnerability to depres- sive affect and the development of major depressive disor- der. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is therefore broader than most other psychotherapies, encompassing both cur-rent and past problems in interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, and developmental conflicts associated with anxiety, guilt, or shame. Time-limited, structured psycho-dynamic psychotherapy may focus more on understand-ing the psychological basis of the presenting symptoms or on a selected underlying conflict. Sometimes a goal of psy- chodynamic psychotherapy, brief or extended, may be tohelp the patient accept or adhere to necessary pharmaco- therapy (331). Although psychodynamic psychotherapy is often used in clinical practice, its efficacy in the acute phase of majordepressive disorder remains less well studied in controlled trials than the efficacy in this phase of some other forms ofpsychotherapy. This research is reviewed in Part B, Sec- tion V .B.3. 4. Problem-solving therapy Problem-solving therapy is a manual-guided, brief treat- ment lasting six to 12 sessions. This therapy, often admin- istered by nurses or social workers, has been used to prevent depression in elderly and/or medically ill patients,and it has also been used to treat patients with relatively mild depressive symptoms. The approach combines ele- ments of cognitive therapy (addressing negative assess-ments of situations) and IPT (focal problem solving). Some studies have reported modest improvement in patients with mild depressive symptoms. Although problem solv-ing therapy has had limited testing for patients with major depressive disorder, it may have a role in targeted patient populations with mild depression (332-335). 5. Marital therapy and family therapy Marital and family problems are common in the course ofmood disorders, and comprehensive treatment often de- mands assessing and addressing these problems. Marital and family problems may be the consequence of major de-pressive disorder but may also increase vulnerability to developing major depressive disorder or retard recovery from it (336-339). A number of marital and family ther- apies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression. T echniques include behavioral approaches(338), problem-focused approaches (340), and strategicmarital therapy (341, 342). Family therapy has also been found to be helpful in the treatment of more severe forms of depression in conjunction with medications and hospi-talization (343). 6. Group therapy Group psychotherapy is widely practiced, but research on its application to major depressive disorder is limited.Specific types having some data to support their efficacy include CBT (344-347) and IPT (348-351). Meta-analyses of the relative effectiveness of psychotherapeutic approachesconducted in group format versus individual format have not involved patients with rigorously defined major depres- sive disorder (352-355).

In a study of de-pressed outpatients, a mutual support group and group CBT were found to be equally effective in reducing de- pressive symptoms (346). In a study of HIV-positive pa-tients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder, structured supportive group therapy plus placebo yielded similar decreases in depressive symptoms to structuredgroup therapy plus fluoxetine (356). Individuals experienc- ing stressors such as bereavement or chronic illness may benefit from contact with others facing similar challenges. Medication maintenance support groups may also of- fer benefits, although data from controlled trials for pa-tients with major depressive disorder are lacking. Such groups inform the patient and family members about prognosis and medication issues, providing a psychoedu-cational forum that contextualizes a chronic mental illness in a medical model. The efficacy of self-help groups led by lay members (357) in the treatment of major depressive disorder hasnot been well studied. However, one investigation of group therapies found that a higher proportion of de-pressed outpatients had remission following treatment in groups led by professionals than had remission following participation in groups led by nonprofessionals (346).Further study is needed on the possibility that self-help groups may serve a useful role in enhancing the support network and self-esteem of participating patients withmajor depressive disorder and their families. Overall, group therapy has some evidence to support its use as well as the potential advantage of lowered cost,inasmuch as one or two therapists can treat a larger num- ber of patients simultaneously. This advantage needs to be weighed against the difficulties in assembling the group,the lesser intensity of focus patients receive relative to in- dividual psychotherapy, and potentially adverse effects from interactions with other group members. b. Implementation It can be useful to establish an expected duration of psy- chotherapy at the start of treatment. Communicating this expectation may help mobilize the patient and focus treat-ment goals, yet there are few data available on the optimal duration of specific depression-focused psychotherapies. In many trials, CBT and IPT have been delivered in ap-proximately 12-16 weekly sessions. In a subanalysis of one clinical trial, CBT delivered in 16 weeks was more effec- tive than CBT delivered in 8 weeks for those with severemajor depressive disorder (358). Moreover, evidence sug- gests benefit from monthly continuation phase treatment with IPT in reducing the probability of relapse (314). Inaddition, patients with chronic, treatment-resistant de- pression may require long-term treatment. The optimal frequency of psychotherapy has not been rigorously studied in controlled trials. The psychiatristshould consider multiple factors when determining the frequency for individual patients, including the specifictype and goals of the psychotherapy, the frequency neces- sary to create and maintain a therapeutic relationship, the frequency of visits required to ensure treatment adher- ence, and the frequency necessary to monitor and address suicide risk and other safety concerns. Time-limited brief psychotherapies may mobilize many depressed patients tomore rapid improvement. The severity of illness, the pa- tient's cooperation with treatment, availability of social supports, cost, geographic accessibility, and presence of co-occurring general medical problems may also influ- ence visit frequency. The frequency of outpatient visitsduring the acute phase is generally weekly but may vary based on these factors. Some experienced clinicians find that sessions are needed at least twice weekly, at least ini-tially, for patients with moderate to severe depression. Regardless of the type of depression-focused psycho- therapy that is selected, the clinician should carefully andsystematically monitor the patient's response to treatment, which can be facilitated by the use of clinician- and patient- rated scales at regular intervals (see Section II.A.8). If 4-8weeks of treatment do not yield at least moderate im- provement ( 20% diminution in symptoms), the clinician should thoroughly review and reappraise the treatment plan. c. Combining psychotherapy and medication Several meta-analyses of studies of the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for patients withmajor depressive disorder have documented a modest ad- vantage for the combination as compared with one or the other modality alone (359-361). Particularly large addi- tive effects have been observed in individual studies of pa- tients with chronic depression (362), patients with severe recurrent depression (359), and hospitalized patients(285). Combined treatment might therefore be consid- ered a treatment of first choice for patients with major de- pressive disorder with more severe, chronic, or complexpresentations. Combining family therapy with pharmaco- therapy has also been found to improve posthospital care for depressed patients (343). Dual treatment combines the unique advantages of each therapeutic modality: while pharmacotherapy may provideearlier symptomatic relief, psychotherapy yields broaderand longer lasting improvement (363). Psychotherapy can also be used to address issues that arise during pharmaco- therapy, such as decreased adherence. However, the advan- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

There are no empirical data from clinical trials to help guide the selection of particular antidepressant medicationsand particular models of psychotherapeutic approaches for individuals who will receive the combination of bothmodalities. In general, the same issues that influence these decisions when choosing a monotherapy will apply, and the same doses of antidepressant medication and the samefrequency and course of psychotherapy should be used for patients receiving combination modality treatments as are used for patients receiving them as a monotherapy. Results from a series of recent studies provide indirect evidence that for patients who have had only a partial re-sponse to pharmacotherapy, adding a course of CBT may be an effective strategy for preventing relapse (363-368).During 12 weeks of treatment in the STAR*D study, cog-nitive therapy was as effective as either augmenting with bupropion or buspirone or changing antidepressants to bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine. However, patientswho did not respond to an initial course of citalopram were less likely to accept cognitive therapy as a change or aug- mentation option than they were to accept a different med-ication option (369), perhaps due to the nature of the study design. 5. Complementary and al ternative treatments As defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, complementary and alternativemedicine is \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently con- sidered to be part of conventional medicine.\" As the defi-nitions are usually applied, \"complementary\" therapies are used conjunctively with conv entional medicine, \"alterna- tive\" therapies are used in place of conventional medicine, and \"integrative\" medicine makes use of all therapies ap- propriate to an individual patient's needs. The use of integrative therapies is increasingly com- mon, although training and comfort with complementary and alternative modalities vary greatly by practitioner. Many patients do not spontaneously disclose use of comple- mentary or alternative treatments to health care profession- als, so it is particularly important that direct inquiry aboutsuch treatments be part of routine health care questions.At this time, there are several modalities that have mod- est evidence for antidepressant efficacy and deserve further study. Some of these modalities can be recom-mended with enthusiasm for their general health benefits; however, patients should be informed that evidence for their antidepressant efficacy as monotherapy is limited orabsent.a. St. John's wort St. John's wort is a plant widely used to treat depressive symptoms. Overall, studies of St. John's wort show greaterconsensus and support for benefits in mild to moderate ma- jor depressive disorder, as compared with less consistent findings in patients with more severe symptoms. One re-view of 14 short-term, double-blind trials conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of major de- pressive disorder concluded that St. John's wort in doses of300 mg/day and 1,800 mg/day had efficacy that was supe- rior to placebo (105). St. John's wort had generally compa- rable efficacy and fewer side effects than low-dose TCAtreatment (e.g., 30-150 mg/day of amitriptyline) (105), but doses at the low end of this range would not be expected to produce therapeutic benefits. However, in the two largest controlled studies conducted in the United States (370, 371), effects of St. John's wort did not differ from placebo,which somewhat limits confidence in the magnitude of the antidepressant actions of St. John's wort. In addition, prep- arations of St. John's wort are not regulated by the FDA asa drug and lack standardization of their ingredients, com- position, and potency. Based on the evidence cited, St. John's wort would not meet the FDA 's minimum require-ments to be declared an effective antidepressant and is not recommended for general use in treating depression. Another important consideration with St. John's wort is the potential for drug-drug interactions (372-374). St.John's wort appears to induce the metabolism of drugs via CYP 3A4, reducing the efficacy of medications, includingantiretroviral medications, immunosuppressants (includ- ing cyclosporine), antineopl astic agents, anticoagulants (including warfarin), oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy (373, 374). Unwanted pregnancies have been reported with concomitant St. John's wort and oral contraceptive use (373, 375, 376), and rejection of trans-planted organs has been observed when St. John's wort is taken concurrently with cyclosporin (374). The significant decreases in antiretroviral medication levels with con-comitant St. John's wort use suggest that these medica- tions will be less effective in treating HIV infection (374). Effects of St. John's wort on P-glycoprotein have also beenobserved, altering the phar macokinetics and pharmaco- dynamics of medications such as digoxin that are trans- ported by this route (374). Apart from affecting bloodlevels of nonpsychiatric medications, the safety and effi- cacy of the combined use of St . John's wort with other an- tidepressant medications is not known. The combined use of St. John's wort with MAOIs is contraindicated. b. S-adenosyl methionine S-adenosyl methionine is a naturally occurring molecule. In humans, it is concentrated in the liver and the brain and Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

S-adenosyl methionine is available for both parenteral and oral administration (380). Some data support the efficacy and tolerability of SAMe in patients with major depr essive disorder. Oral, intrave- nous, and intramuscular formulations have been assessed and appear efficacious in at least pilot studies (381-383). Like St. John's wort, SAMe is not regulated by the FDA and lacks standardization of its composition and potency. S-adenosyl methionine has been compared with TCAs and has been reported to have greater efficacy while be- ing more tolerable (381). It is unclear at present how SAMe compares to SSRIs in efficacy and cost-efficiency. While some data support the use of SAMe as monother-apy and as augmentation therapy, the data at this time, as with St. John's wort, are insufficient to make a recom- mendation for its use in the treatment of major depres-sive disorder. c. Omega-3 fatty acids Most studies of omega-3 fatty acids for major depressivedisorder have been adjunctive studies, in which patients were already receiving antidepressant medications but still met the criteria for major depressive disorder. Studies varyin the omega-3 fatty acids used (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], or the combination), and doses and durations of study trials have also varied. It isdifficult to interpret the literature on this treatment given the heterogeneity in study design and outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acids are generally recommended as an adjunctive therapy for mood disorders, as health benefits,including those for cardiovascular health, are well es- tablished, and individuals with psychiatric disorders maybe at greater risk for obesity, metabolic problems, and other health problems than the general population (384, 385). More evidence is required to establish a definitiverole in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder. Doses of 1-9 grams have been studied in mood disorders, with a majority of evidence supporting use of lowerdoses. Adjunctive EPA or the combination of EPA and DHA (the combination found in most commercially available brands) appears most useful, with less evidencefor DHA alone for the trea tment of major depressive disorder. Further data are needed to ascertain the role ofomega-3 fatty acids as monotherapy for major depressivedisorder.d. Folate Folate has been primarily assessed as a predictor of anti- depressant medication response and as an adjunctive treatment. Low folate blood levels have been associatedwith lack of response and slower response to fluoxetine for major depressive disorder (386, 387), and higher folate levels at treatment baseline appear associated with betterresponse to antidepressants (388). Folate has been studied as an adjunctive treatment compared with placebo in ad- dition to fluoxetine, with significantly greater improve-ment in those receiving folate, especially among female patients (389). Folate is a low-risk intervention with general health benefits. Folate protects against neural tube defects in early pregnancy. In general, 0.4-1 mg of folate is recom-mended for women of reproductive age. Considering the modest evidence that supports folate as an augmentation strategy and its attractive risk-benefit profile, folate canbe recommended as a reasonable adjunctive strategy for major depressive disorder that carries little risk and may decrease birth defects in the case of pregnancy. Data areinadequate to suggest efficacy as a monotherapy. e. Light therapy Bright light therapy appears effective for seasonal affec-tive disorder and nonseasonal major depressive disor- der, as demonstrated in generally short-term, placebo- controlled trials (390-394), although some studies havemethodological limitations (395). The mechanism of ac- tion for light therapy is not clear but appears to involve the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (396, 397).There is some evidence that light therapy may hasten the response to treatment with antidepressant medication (398). Open-label data also support light therapy for patientswith major depressive disorder that has not responded to antidepressant medication (399). Greater intensity of light is associated with efficacy (400). Light therapy also mayaugment the antidepressant benefits of partial sleep dep- rivation (401, 402). Monitoring for mania and hypomania may be appropriate with initiation of light therapy, as hy-pomania has been reported (392). However, in general bright light therapy is a low-risk and low-cost option for treatment. f. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment modality that is part of tradi-tional Chinese medicine. Its efficacy is somewhat difficult to assess, as much of the research is published in Asian lan- guages and overlooked in ty pical literature searches. In addition, there is significan t variation in the acupuncture techniques used as well as limited descriptions of method-ology and diagnosis (403). One randomized trial showed Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

However, a subsequent larger study did not replicate these results (406), and a recent meta-analysis concluded that acupuncture was not associated with anybenefits in treating major depression in terms of response or remission rates (407). Assuming needles are properly sterilized, there do not appear to be substantial risks ofacupuncture treatment. However, based on current evi- dence, acupuncture is not recommended in the treatment of major depressive disorder. 6. Assessing response and adequacy of treatment The goal of acute phase treatment for major depressive dis- order, insofar as possible, is to achieve remission and a re- turn to full functioning and quality of life. Remission isdefined as at least 3 weeks of the absence of both sad mood and reduced interest and no more than three remaining symptoms of the major depressive episode ( 408). However, it is not uncommon for patients to have substantial but in- complete symptom reduction or improvement in function- ing during acute phase treatment. A number of studies haveprovided compelling evidence that even mild residual symptoms at the end of a depressive episode are associated with significant psychosocial disability, compared with as-ymptomatic remission ( 40 9); a more than three times faster relapse to a subsequent major depressive episode (410); andin first-episode patients, a more chronic future course (410-412). The presence of mild residual symptoms has been shown to be an even stronger predictor of a subsequent re- turn to a major depressive episode than a prior history ofmultiple episodes of major depressive disorder (410). For this reason, it is important not to conclude the acute phase of treatment prematurely for partially responsive patients.Throughout treatment, both the patient's response and the adequacy of treatment must be vigilantly and systematically monitored. Use of structured measures of depressionsymptom severity, side effects, treatment adherence, and functional status can facilitate identification of patients who have not had a complete response to treatment (40, 44). If a patient is found to have an incomplete treatment response, the treatment itself should be evaluated. Medi- cations must be thoughtfully selected and given at an ad-equate dose and for an adequate duration. Similarly, psychotherapy must be well chosen for the patient, skill- fully executed, and conducted over an appropriate periodof time with an adequate frequency of visits. In addition to being caused by inadequate treatment, poor response may result from multiple other factors (413) that are enumer-ated in T able 9.For pharmacotherapy, determination of the adequacy of treatment requires ensuring that antidepressant medica-tions have been used for an adequate dose and duration. This can be assessed using standardized measurement in- struments (414). Generally, adequate treatment with anantidepressant medication for at least 4-6 weeks is neces- sary before concluding that a patient is not responsive or only partially responsive to a particular medication (218,221). For patients with no improvement in symptoms during the initial weeks of treatment, treatment should be reevaluated and possibly changed. Furthermore, there islittle evidence to support extending antidepressant medi- cation trials beyond 6 weeks in patients who have shown no response. Patients with chronic forms of depression orwith co-occurring Axis I disorders or general medical conditions may require a longer duration of acute phase treatment before concluding that a different treatmentstrategy is indicated (224). For psychotherapy, treatment should be reassessed if there has not been meaningful improvement after a fewmonths, depending on what can reasonably be expected for the given type of psychotherapy. Patients should be reas- sessed every 3-4 months to ensure adequate improvement.Regardless of treatment modality, lack of improvement over time warrants reconsideration of interventions, given the large number of available treatment options. 7. Strategies to address incomplete response The psychiatrist should consider a change in treatmentfor patients who have not fully responded to an adequateacute phase treatment over a sufficient time, generally 4-8 weeks. The treatment plan can be revised by imple- menting one of several therapeutic options, including op-TABLE 9.

These options areoutlined in Figure 2 and described in more detail below. Following any change in treatment, the patient should continue to be closely monitored. If there is not at least amoderate improvement in major depressive disorder symptoms after an additional 4-8 weeks of treatment, the psychiatrist should conduct another thorough review. Thisreappraisal should include the following: verifying the pa- tient's diagnosis and adherence; uncovering and address- ing clinical factors that may be preventing improvement,such as the presence of co-occurring general medical con- ditions or psychiatric conditions (e.g., alcohol or substance abuse); evaluating for potential drug-drug interactions;obtaining collateral information from those involved with the patient; and uncovering and addressing psychosocial, psychological, and personality factors that may be imped-ing recovery (T able 9). If no new information is uncovered to explain the patient's lack of adequate response, othertreatment options should be considered, including ECT and a consultation from an expert in mood disorders. De-spite optimal treatment, some patients may continue to have chronic depressive sympto ms. For these patients, the psychiatrist should add a disease management component to the overall treatment pl an. This component involves setting realistic expectations, improving functioning, anddeveloping self-management skills (415, 416). a. Maximizing initial treatments For patients who have not fully responded to treatment for depression, an initial strategy is to optimize the inten-sity of psychotherapy or maximize the dose of medication, especially if the upper limit of the antidepressant dose has not been reached. Decisions about pharmacotherapy willinvolve a balancing of efficacy, side effects, and medica- tion adherence. Dose escalation and management of side effects at critical decision points are essential in order toavoid premature discontinuation of the chosen antide-Response None or Partial Full Initial weeks Assess adherence. If clinical severity warrants and treatment is well tolerated, consider increasing medication dosage or intensity of psychotherapy, especially if there is no response. If symptoms are severe or life-threatening, consider ECT.If treatment is well-tolerated, maintain current treatment approach. At 4-8 weeks In patients treated with an antidepressant, consider increasing the dose (if well tolerated), changing to a different antidepressant, and changing to or augmenting with psychotherapy. Augmentation therapy or ECT may also be considered. For insufficient response to psychotherapy, consider changing the intensity or type of psychotherapy and/or adding or changing to medication. For ECT, see guideline text.Go to continuation phase. Throughout treatment In patients who have significant side effects with antidepressant treatment, consider changing to a different antidepressant, reducing the dose, or treating the side effect. Also consider changing to psychotherapy or ECT. If trials of two medications from the same antidepressant class have been ineffective, consider changing antidepressants to a different class. For patients with difficulty tolerating psychotherapy, consider changing the intensity or type of therapy and/or adding or changing to medication. FIGURE 2.

Because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences among individuals, some patients may requiredoses higher than those approved by the FDA to achieve adequate blood levels of a medication and receive thera-peutic benefits. Patients who have had their dose in- creased should be monitored for increased severity of side effects; dose increases should be considered only for pa-tients who do not have significant or intolerable side ef- fects while taking the medication. Frequent follow-up contact (either in person or via the phone) may be neces-sary to address symptoms, side effects, and patient adher- ence in order to personalize treatment to the specific clinical needs of the patient. When available and clinically meaningful, therapeutic ranges for blood levels of antide- pressant medications are useful in optimizing medicationdosing (201, 232, 233). Individual differences are common in the time to re- sponse and the tolerability of treatments. For patients whohave shown a partial response to treatment, particularly those with features of personality disorders and prominent psychosocial stressors, extending the antidepressant med-ication trial (e.g., by 4-8 weeks) may allow up to one-third of patients to respond more fully (417-419). In patients who are receiving psychotherapy, similar principles apply in terms of monitoring and adjustingtreatment in the context of nonresponse or difficulty tol- erating psychotherapy (331). Factors to be considered in-clude the frequency of sessions, the type of psychotherapy being used, the quality of the therapeutic alliance, and the possible need for medications in lieu of or in addition topsychotherapy. Whereas increasing the frequency of ther- apy sessions is a reasonable approach to nonresponse, this approach is based on clinical wisdom and has not beensystematically studied. b. Changing to other treatments Changing to a different non-MAOI antidepressant medi- cation is a common strategy for patients with treatment- resistant major depressive disorder, especially those whohave not shown at least partial response to the initial med- ication regimen. Although there are no specific patient characteristics that predict which medication to choose(420), results from STAR*D suggest that changing to a second-step treatment results in additional remission rates of about 25%, and further changes are associated with con-tinued remission, albeit at lower rates (about 13%-14%). T reatment can be changed to a non-MAOI antidepressant medication from the same pharmacological class (e.g.,from one SSRI to another SSRI) or to one from a different class (e.g., from an SSRI to a TCA) (369, 421-422). Addingor changing to a depression-focused psychotherapy shouldalso be considered for patients with major depressive dis- order who do not respond fully to medication treatment.Other strategies for patients who do not respond ade- quately to pharmacotherapy include changing to an MAOI after allowing sufficient time between medicationsto avoid hazardous interactions (see T able 8). T ranscranial magnetic stimulation could also be an option, as it appears to be safe and well tolerated (270, 280). In addition, it hasshown small to moderate benefits in most (268, 270-272) but not all (269, 273) clinical trials and recent meta-anal- yses. Recent randomized trials suggest that quetiapinemonotherapy also produces a greater reduction in depres- sive symptoms than placebo (423, 424), with comparable efficacy to duloxetine (424), although the potential side ef- fects of second-generation antipsychotic treatment need to be taken into consideration. ECT remains the most ef-fective therapy for patients with treatment-resistant symp- toms (239, 425), although results of clinical trials differ on whether patients with medication-resistant symptomshave responses to ECT that are comparable to those of patients without documented medication resistance (426- 428). c. Augmenting and combining treatments Pharmacotherapy can be combined with a depression- focused psychotherapy, both as an initial treatment plan,and as a strategy to address nonresponse to treatment in one modality or the other. See Section II.B.4.c above for further information about combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Antidepressant medications can be augmented with an- other non-MAOI antidepressant or with other, nonanti- depressant agents. The addition of a second non-MAOI antidepressant may be helpful, particularly for patientswho have had a partial response to antidepressant mono-therapy (429). One option is to add a second non-MAOI antidepressant medication from a different pharmacolog- ical class, taking care to av oid drug-drug interactions. An- other option is to add an adjunctive, nonantidepressant medication\u2014such as lithium, thyroid hormone, an anti- convulsant, a psychostimulant, or a second-generation(atypical) antipsychotic. More information about these strategies is given later in this section. Some limited evidence and clinical experience support the addition of bupropion to an SSRI. This combinationis generally well tolerated, a of CYP 2D6, increases blood levelsof some SSRIs (430). In one study, combined treatment with bupropion and an SSRI resulted in better outcomes than either therapy alone (431). Another commonly usedstrategy is the combination of mirtazapine and an SSRI or Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Generally, mirtazapine 15-30 mg at bedtime is added to the incompletely effective antidepressant and titrated up to 45 mg/day on the basis of response and tol-erability (432). For patients with pronounced anxiety or persistent insomnia not adequately relieved by an SSRI or SNRI, ad- junctive use of anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic medica- tions is common (433, 434). These clonazepam (435) and selective GABA agonists suchas zolpidem and eszopiclone (437). Buspirone has also been used adjunctively in anxious individuals (429). Al- though adjunctive therapy of anxiety or insomnia can has-ten symptomatic relief, there is no evidence of sustained benefit, and some patients have difficulty stopping the anx- iolytic or hypnotic medication (438, 439). Lithium, thyroid hormone, and stimulants are some- times combined with antidepressants to augment re-sponse. Lithium is the most extensively studied of these adjuncts (440-443) and may also reduce the long-term risk of suicide (444). The interval before full response toadjunctive lithium is said to be in the range of several days to 6 weeks. The blood level required to enhance the ef- fects of antidepressants still has not been confirmed. If ef-fective and well tolerated, lithium should be continued at least for the duration of acute treatment and perhaps be- yond the acute phase for purposes of relapse prevention. Thyroid hormone supplementation, even in euthyroid patients, may increase the effectiveness of antidepressantmedication treatment, whether used as an augmentationagent (445, 446) or in combination with an antidepressant from the outset of therapy (447). The dose typically used for this purpose is 25 mcg/day of triiodothyronine, in-creased to 50 mcg/day if the response is inadequate after about a week. The duration of treatment required has not been well studied. Second-generation antipsychotic medications may in- crease the rates of response or remission of depressivesymptoms in patients who typically have not responded tomore than two medication trials (448), even when psy- chotic symptoms are not present. Generally, in clinical practice, lower doses are used for antidepressant augmen-tation than for treatment of psychosis. For example, the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has been exten- sively studied (449-452) and is typically initiated with 6 mgof olanzapine and 25 mg of fluoxetine daily and titrated up- ward as tolerated to a maximum of 18 mg of olanzapine and 75 mg of fluoxetine daily. Aripiprazole has received FDAapproval for augmentation of antidepressive agents and is typically initiated at 2.5-5 mg/day and titrated upward as tolerated to a maximum of 15 mg/day (453). With quetia- pin e, doses of 25 to 400 mg/day have been used, with ben- efits for depressive symptoms found in some (454, 455) butnot all (456) clinical trials. Risperidone augmentation, in doses of up to 3 mg daily (457, 458) also appears to improve the response to antidepressant agents. In most of these trials,the onset of the effect of second-generation antipsychotic augmentation has been rapid, although the magnitude of the advantage relative to placebo has been relatively mod-est. In the only two trials to utilize active comparison groups, the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine was not significantly more effective at study endpoint than con-tinued therapy with nortriptyline (450) or venlafaxine (451). Naturalistic follow-up data also suggest that long-term weight gain can be problematic for many patients receivingsecond-generation antipsychotic augmentation therapy, particularly with the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (459). In addition, a recent meta-analysis suggests that the rate at which SGA augmentation is discontinued is nearly four-fold greater than study discontinuation among sub-jects randomly assigned to placebo (448). When compared with other strategies for antidepressant nonresponders, aug- mentation with a second-generation antipsychotic carriesdisadvantages: the high cost of many agents, the significant risk of weight gain and other metabolic complications (e.g., dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose dysregulation,diabetes tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT c prolongation. Thus, the advantages and disadvan-tages of antipsychotic medications should be considered when choosing this augmentation strategy. In addition, when augmentation with a se cond-generation antipsychotic is effective, it is uncertain how long augmentation therapy should be maintained. Many clinicians find that augmentation of antidepres- sants with low doses of stimulants such help ameliorate otherwise suboptimally responsive depr ession (460-462), although not all clinical trials have shown benefits from this strat- egy (463). More recently, the novel compound modafinil has shown modest benefit when combined with SSRIs, re-lated to specific effects on residual symptoms such as fa- tigue and hypersomnolence (464-467). Although there are no clear guidelines regarding the length of time stim-ulants or modafinil should be coadministered, in one ex- tension study the effects of modafinil were maintained across 12 weeks of additional therapy (468). Physicians prescrib-ing modafinil for this off-label use should become familiar with rare but dangerous cutaneous reactions to it, includ- ing reported instances of Stevens-Johnson syndrome,toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia (469), and cytochrome P450 in- teractions. Modafinil can also induce CYP rendercontraceptive medications an d other medications metab- olized through this route ineffective. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

A rarely used strategy is the combined use of a TCA or trazodone and an MAOI (474, 475). The combination of a TCA and an MAOI has been used for more than three decades for treatment of some of the most treatment-resistant depressive disorders; however, the risk of drug- drug interactions necessitates careful monitoring (119).Of particular concern with these combinations is the sero-tonin syndrome, characterized by delirium, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and, rarely, death (see Section II.B.2.b.5.b). Use of an MAOI in combination with a TCA and related antidepressants should probably not be considered until other pharmacological strategies for pa-tients with treatment-resistant illness have been exhausted; psychiatrists and patients choosing to use the combina- tion of an MAOI and a TCA should be well acquaintedwith the potential hazards and carefully weigh the relative risks and benefits of such a strategy. Vagus nerve stimulation was approved for use in pa- tients whose symptoms have not responded to at leastfour adequate trials of antidepressant medications and/or ECT . Acute benefits were not observed in the sham-controlled portion of the VNS trial (282). When com- pared with a parallel treatment-as-usual arm, the long- term (1-2 year) open-label extension showed small (476,477) but persistent (478) improvements in symptoms with VNS that could be clinically significant for some patients. Other open-label studies have also shown some benefitwhen VNS is used simultaneo usly with pharmacotherapy (479-481). As with any surgical device implantation, there is a small risk of postsurgical infection (482). A majority of in- dividuals experience hoarseness or voice alteration during stimulation, and coughing, dyspnea, and neck discomfortare common (281, 481) but generally are tolerable to pa- tients (282, 479). Patients also need to be informed of the implications of having an implanted VNS device for fu-ture medical care (482). For example, with a VNS device in place, brain MRI requires the use of a special send- receive coil. The VNS device may affect the operation ofother implanted devices such as cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators and other procedures such as diathermy, and whole body or radiofrequency receive-only MRI are con-traindicated. VNS is also contraindicated in the presence of bilateral or left cervical vagotomy. Relative to other antidepressive treatments, the role of VNS remains a subject of debate. However, it could beconsidered as an option for patients with substantial symp-toms that have not responded to repeated trials of antide-pressant treatment. C. CONTINUATION PHASE Continuation phase pharmaco therapy is strongly recom- mended following successful acute phase antidepressanttherapy, with a recommended duration of continuation therapy of approximately 4-9 months (assuming good andconsistent control of depression symptoms). The goal of continuation treatment is to prevent relapse (i.e., the re- emergence of significant depressive symptoms or dys-function) in the vulnerable period immediately following remission (i.e., a complete alleviation of symptoms) (408, 410, 411). The possibility of relapse should be carefullymonitored during the continuation phase as this is when risk of relapse is highest (483). Within the first 6 months following recovery from a major depressive episode, re-lapse of depressive symptoms is common, with the propor- tion of patients with relapse ranging from 20% of patients in mixed samples (484-487) to as many as 85% of severelydepressed inpatients receiving treatment with ECT (234, 488, 489). These studies also show that relapse rates are greater if antidepressant treatment (including ECT) isdiscontinued or reduced in dose or intensity following re- covery (234, 489, 490). There is evidence that patients who do not completely recover during acute treatmenthave a significantly higher risk of relapse (and a greater need for continuation treatment) than those who have no residual symptoms (227, 491, 492). Similarly, patientswho have not fully achieved remission with psychother- apy are at greater risk of relapse in the near term (364, 365, 367, 493, 494). T o reduce the risk of relapse duringthe continuation phase, treatment should generally con- tinue at the same dose, intensity, and frequency that were effective during the acute phase. Although the number ofrandomized controlled trials of antidepressant medica- tions in the continuation phase is limited, the available data indicate that patients treated for a first episode of un-complicated major depressive disorder who exhibit a sat- isfactory response to an antidepressant medication should continue to receive a full therapeutic dose of that agent forat least 4-9 months after achieving full remission (105, 225, 495). Published studies for the continuation phase with older TCAs as well as newer medications have consistentlyshown efficacy of these medications in preventing relapse, compared with placebo. Lithium has also been shown tohave efficacy in preventing relapse (496). Cognitive-behavioral therapy may prevent relapse of depression when used as augmentation to medicationtreatment. It may also bestow an enduring, protective ben- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Cognitive group therapy helps to prevent re- lapse and recurrence for patients in remission after a ma-jor depressive episode (497). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a variant of cognitive therapy that encourages patients to pay attention to their thoughts and feelings inthe moment and to accept them rather than judging or trying to change or disprove them. Among patients with remitted depression, mindfulness-based cognitive ther-apy groups may reduce risk of relapse for patients who have already experienced three or more episodes (498). Such benefits for CBT (and potentially, for other psycho-therapies) would offer an ad vantage over pharmacother- apy, which works only as long as the patient continues the antidepressant medication. Continuation therapy is also essential in reducing re- lapse risk after an acute co urse of ECT (239). Although relapse occurs for many patients regardless of continua- tion strategy (234, 488, 489), remission of symptoms fol- lowing successful treatment with ECT may be maintainedwith either pharmacotherapy or continuation ECT (234). Research shows that continuation ECT is comparable in efficacy to the combination of nortriptyline and lithium (234) and that the latter combination is superior to nortriptyline alone in preventing relapse (489). Although there is limited information regarding prognostic factors,relapse may be less likely among patients with melan- cholic depression who receiv e continuation ECT after re- mission with acute ECT than among those who receive continuation pharmacotherapy after remission with acuteECT (499). Given the significant risk of relapse during the contin- uation phase of treatment, it is essential to assess depres-sive symptoms, functional status, and quality of life in a systematic fashion, which can be facilitated by the use ofperiodic, standardized measurements. It is often helpful for patients and families to identify particular signs (e.g., lack of engagement in specific activities that are usually en-joyed, specific \"signal\" symptoms or patterns of thought) that are typical of their earlier depressive episodes and may suggest the beginnings of a depressive relapse. Further-more, any sign of symptom pe rsistence, exacerbation, or reemergence or of increased psychosocial dysfunctionduring the continuation period should be viewed as a har-binger of possible relapse. If a relapse does occur during the continuation phase, a return to the acute phase of treatment is required. An initialstep is often to increase the dose of medication (500) or, with continuation ECT, to increase the frequency of treatment (501). For patients receiving psychotherapy, an increased frequency of sessions or a shift in the psycho- therapeutic focus may be needed. It is also essential to de-termine whether any specific precipitants are contributingto the relapse of depression. For example, the onset or worsening of psychosocial stressors, substance use disor-ders, or general medical conditions can contribute to in- creased depressive symptoms. In addition, decreased treatment adherence or reductions in medication bloodlevels (e.g., due to drug-drug interactions or increased cig- arette use) can also prompt a depressive relapse. D. MAINTENANCE PHASE Patients with chronic and/or recurrent major depressive disorder who complete the continuation phase without relapse proceed to the maintenance phase of treatment, in which the goal is to protect susceptible patients against re-currence of subsequent depression. Patients who have had three or more prior major de- pressive episodes should receive maintenance treatment.Within the first 6 months following recovery from a ma- jor depressive episode, 20% of patients will experience a recurrence (484). Between 50% and 85% of patients willhave at least one lifetime recurrence, usually within 2 or 3 years (502), although there is little consistency in the time to recurrence for any individual patient (484). Patientswho have had a prior major depressive episode also have a high risk of experiencing subsequent affective episodes other than another major depressive episode, such as amanic, hypomanic, or dysthymic episode (503). The num- ber of lifetime major depressive episodes is significantly associated with the probability of recurrence, such that the risk of recurrence increases by 16% with each successive episode (484). Maintenance therapy should be considered more strongly for patients with additional risk factors for recur-rence, such as the presence of residual symptoms, ongoing psychosocial stressors, family history of mood disorders,and the severity of prior episodes (504) (see T able 10). Ad- ditional considerations that may play a role in the decision to use maintenance therapy include patient preference,the presence of side effects during continuation therapy, and the severity of prior depressive episodes, including factors such as psychosis or suicide risk. Due to the risk ofrecurrence and the importance of early detection of recur- rent symptoms, patients should be monitored periodically and in a systematic fashion during the maintenance phase;such assessments can be facilitated by the use of standard- ized rating scales, as described in Section II.A.8. In general, the treatment that was effective in the acute and continuation phases should be used in the maintenancephase. Among the therapeutic options available for mainte- nance treatment, antidepressant medications have received Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

There have been more than 30 trials of phar- macotherapy in the maintenance phase, and results have generally demonstrated the effectiveness of antidepres- sant medication for relapse prevention (105, 226, 314, 505-507). Many of these trials used TCAs (314, 506), although results of trials involving newer antidepressant medica- tions have been assessed in a recent meta-analysis (507).Lithium has also been used as maintenance treatment for major depressive disorder (441). Despite this, there is lim- ited information on many of the clinical decisions involvingmedication use in the maintenance phase. Even though lower doses of medication are less likely to produce side effects, results from one study suggest that full doses aresuperior to lower doses in the maintenance phase (508). Particularly if medications are well-tolerated, it is gener- ally advisable to prescribe the same antidepressant medi-cation doses for maintenance therapy that were effective in prior phases of treatment. Even with adequate mainte- nance treatment, pharmacotherapy is not invariably suc-cessful in preventing relapse and return of symptoms, which still occur in as many as 25% of individuals (509, 510). It is unclear whether some relapses during maintenance ther-apy are loss of therapeutic efficacy, a phenomenon that has been referred to as tachyphylaxis, but many such re- lapses appear related to inadequate prophylactic effectsof medication (511). When relapses occur, clinicians typically address them using the same approaches described to treat incomplete responses to treatment, such as in-creasing the dose of medication, changing to a different medication, or adding another medication or a depression- focused psychotherapy to augment therapeutic response(510, 512). There have been fewer investigations of the effective- ness of psychotherapy in the maintenance phase. Nonethe-less, several studies have shown that acute psychotherapies for major depressive disorder also have maintenance ben- efits. For example, even once-monthly maintenance IPThas been shown to forestall relapse in patients at high risk for relapse (289, 314, 315, 513). Most of these studies have used once-monthly maintenance IPT , but research hasnot demonstrated that frequency of sessions affects out- come (289). In one study, maintenance cognitive therapy delivered over 2 years was as effective as maintenancemedication for recurrent major depressive disorder (514). Combining psychotherapy\u2014such as CBT, cognitive ther- apy, or IPT\u2014with pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase has also been considered by investigators. Some results suggest that the combination of antidepressant medications plus psychotherapy may be more effective in preventing relapse than treatment with single modalities (314, 365, 506, 515, 516). For patients receiving treatment with pharmacother- apy and/or psychotherapy, the frequency of visits duringthe maintenance phase should be set according to theclinical condition and the specific treatments being used. The frequency can range from as low as once every several months for stable patients who require only psychiatricmanagement and medication monitoring to as high as once or twice per week for those receiving psychodynamic psychotherapy. For CBT and IPT , maintenance-phasetreatments usually involve a decreased frequency of visits (e.g., once a month). The duration of the maintenance phase will vary depending on the frequency and severityof prior major depressive episodes, the tolerability of treatments, and patient preferences. For many patients, some form of maintenance treatment may be required in-definitely. Electroconvulsive therapy has also been used in the maintenance phase, although evidence for its benefitscomes largely from case reports (239). Patients who exhibit repeated episodes of moderate or severe major depressive disorder despite optimal pharmacological treatment or pa-tients who are medically ineligible for such treatment may be maintained with periodic ECT. Although the optimal frequency and duration of maintenance phase ECT treat-ments has not been well studied, maintenance ECT is often administered monthly; individuals for whom this is insufficient may find treatment at more frequent inter-vals to be beneficial (501).

The decision to discontinue treatment should be based on the same factors considered in the decision to initiatemaintenance treatment (T able 10), including the probabil- ity of recurrence, the frequency and severity of past epi-sodes, the persistence of depressive symptoms after recovery, the presence of co-occurring disorders, and pa- tient preferences. The type of treatment being received may also play a role in the decision making. In general, psychotherapy has a longer lasting treatment effect and carries a lower risk of relapse following discontinuationthan pharmacotherapy. In terms of timing, patients should be advised not to discontinue medications before holidays, significant events (e.g., weddings), or stressful events. Patients should be carefully monitored during and im- mediately after treatment discontinuation to ensure thatremission is stable. The highest risk for a relapse is seen in the first 2 months after discontinuation of treatment. Hence, it is important to schedule a follow-up visit duringthis period to ensure stability. When pharmacotherapy is being discontinued, it is best to taper the medication over the course of at leastseveral weeks. Such tapering allows for the detection of recurring symptoms at a time when patients are still par- tially treated and therefore more easily returned to fulltherapeutic treatment if needed. In addition, such taper- ing can help minimize the incidence of antidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes, particularly withparoxetine and venlafaxine (98, 163, 164). Discontinuation syndromes are problematic because their symptoms in- clude disturbances of mood, energy, sleep, and appetiteand can therefore be mistaken for or mask signs of relapse (517). Consequently, patients should be advised not to stop medications abruptly and to take medications withthem when they travel or are away from home. Discontin- uation syndromes have been found to be more frequent af- ter discontinuation of medications with shorter half-lives,and patients maintained on short-acting agents shouldhave their medications tapered gradually over a longer pe- riod (518, 519). Another strategy is to change to a brief course of fluoxetine, e.g., 10 mg for 1-2 weeks, and thendiscontinue the fluoxetine (165). The psychiatrist should closely monitor patients withdrawing from antidepres- sants and provide reassurance that symptoms are time-limited and can be addressed by more gradual tapering (see Section II.B.2.b.1.i). How to end psychotherapy is typically dependent on the type of therapy. For time-limited approaches, termi-nation is usually broached from the initiation of treatment and periodically revisited, as the therapist-patient dyad notes which session they are in, how many remain, and how they have progressed toward defined goals. In dy- namically oriented psychotherapy, the therapist typically raises termination as an issue well in advance of the final session, using the opportunity to explore remaining andunresolved issues in transference. Before the discontinuation of active treatment, pa- tients should be informed of the potential for a depressiverelapse. Early signs of major depressive disorder should be reviewed, often with a family member, and a plan estab- lished for seeking treatment in the event of recurrentsymptoms. Patients should continue to be monitored over the next several months to identify early evidence of recurrent symptoms. Again, systematic assessment ofsymptoms, side effects, adherence, and functional status during this period of high vulnerability is strongly rec- ommended. If a patient does suffer a recurrence after dis-continuing medication, treatment should be promptly reinitiated. Usually, the previous treatment regimen to which the patient responded in the acute and continuationphases should be reinitiated (520). Patients who have a re- currence following discontinuation of antidepressant therapy should be considered to have experienced anothermajor depressive disorder episode and should receive adequate acute-phase treatment followed by continua- tion-phase treatment and possibly maintenance-phasetreatment. III. SPECIFIC CLINICAL FEATURES INFLUENCING THE TREATMENT PLAN A. PSYCHIATRIC FACTORS 1. Depressive symptoms a. Suicidal ideation and behaviorsBecause suicide is the worst outcome of major depressivedisorder, a patient's risk for suicide must be assessed re-peatedly over the course of treatment. For patients who report suicidal ideation, intention, or planning, close sur- veillance is necessary (see Sections II.A.3 and II.A.4). Psy-chiatrists should consider greater intensity of treatment for suicidal patients, including hospitalization when war- ranted and/or combined treatment with pharmacother- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In patients at high risk for suicide and in whom a particularly rapid antidepressant response is required, consideration should be given to the use ofECT (239, 243, 521). Patients with major depressive dis- order who present to an emergency department with sui- cidal ideation, or who have made a suicide attempt, shouldbe triaged to determine their level of safety and establish the appropriate level and setting of care. Upon entrance to the emergency department, they should be searched topermit removal of potentially dangerous items, such as weapons and personal belongings that could cause harm (e.g., sharp objects, belts, shoes, medications). Factors toconsider in determining the nature and intensity of treat- ment include (but are not limited to) access to and lethal- ity of suicide means, past and family history of suicidal behavior, co-occurring substance abuse, the availability and adequacy of social supports, and the nature of thedoctor-patient alliance. T o lower the risk of suicide, the psychiatrist should also treat modifiable risk factors, such as anxiety (especiallypanic attacks), insomnia, agit ation, psychotic symptoms, and substance abuse (22), in addition to treating the majordepressive episode. Among inpatients who died by suicide,Busch et al. (522) observed that a great majority were admitted for indications other than suicidal ideation, and anxiety and agitation were common, suggesting that suchsymptoms should be addressed if they are present. Family members can also play an important role in detecting and preventing suicidal behaviors. When permitted by the pa-tient, the psychiatrist should educate those close to the patient concerning appropriate interventions and encour- age communication. There has been a growing controversy about the risk of suicidal ideas and behaviors (sometimes referred to as\"suicidality\") after initiation of antidepressant treatment.Although information on such risk continues to evolve, a predictive relationship to suicide has never been demon- strated. Clinical experience has long suggested that pa-tients may develop the energy and capacity to act on self- destructive plans made earlier in the course of their illnessif neurovegetative and psychomotor symptoms respondto antidepressant treatment before mood improves. More recently, meta-analyses of data from clinical trials have shown statistically significant increases in suicidal thoughtsor behaviors in individuals age 25 years or younger who are treated with antidepressant medication, compared with placebo, with an approximately 1.5- to 2.5-fold in-crease in the relative risk (26, 523-530). In percentage terms, it is estimated that one to three of 100 individuals age 25 years or younger could potentially have an increasein suicidal thoughts or behaviors with antidepressant treatment (26), although there has been no evidence of in-creased mortality in the study subjects as a result of suicide(531). T o alert clinicians to the need for vigilance and communication during the initial phase of antidepressanttreatment, the FDA has issued a black-box warning per- taining to children, adolescent s, and young adults that ad- vises of this increase in the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior; information on the warning is available on the FDA Web site at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/antide- pressants/default.htm. In making decisions about treat-ment, this awareness of a potential increase in suicidal thinking and behavior in chil dren, adolescents, and young adults must be balanced against the negative effects, in- cluding suicide, of untreated depression (532) as well as the demonstrated benefits of antidepressant treatment (523, 533-535). For adults age 65 years or older, a review of the evidence from clinical trials showed a decrease in the risk of suicidal thinking or behaviors with antidepres-sant treatment, with no change in risk detected for other adults (age 25 to 64 years) (536). For additional details about the treatment of suicidal individuals, clinicians are encouraged to consult APA'sPractice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Pa- tients With Suicidal Behaviors (22). b. Major depressive disorder-related cognitive dysfunction Cognitive inefficiency and impairment are common fea- tures of major depressive disorder. Many depressed patientsreport slowed thoughts, poor concentration, distractibility, and reduced capacity to process information. They also dis- play diminished attention to self-care and to their environ-ment. T ransient cognitive impairment, especially involving attention, concentration, and memory storage and retrieval, are demonstrable through neuropsychological testing (537).In extreme cases, especially in elderly patients, these deficits are so prominent that patients appear to have dementia. Forindividuals who exhibit symptoms of a dementia syndrome,it is crucial that any underlying depressive disorder be iden- tified and treated. Among depressed patients, the differential diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction includes degenerative dementias(such as Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease) and revers- ible causes (such as vitamin B 12 deficiency, folate deficiency, testosterone deficiency, substance use). Several clinical fea- tures help distinguish major depressive disorder-related cognitive dysfunction from other dementia syndromes.When performing cognitive tasks, depressed patients gen- erally exert less effort and report greater incapacity than do patients with dementia. The latter, especially in more ad-vanced stages, typically do not recognize their cognitive failures, since insight is impaired. In contrast, depressed patients may report being unable to think or remember. Patients with major depressive disorder-related cognitive Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Nevertheless, distinguishing dementia from depression-related cognitive dysfunction can be difficult, particularly as the two may coexist. For fur- ther discussion of the co-occurrence of dementia and de- pression, the reader may also wish to consult APA's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Alzheimer's Dis-ease and Other Dementias, Second Edition (539). The detection of major depressive disorder-related cognitive dysfunction alerts the psychiatrist to the needfor treatment of the underlying major depressive disorder,which should in turn reduce the signs and symptoms of the cognitive dysfunction. Although initially reversible, major depressive disorder-related cognitive dysfunction increasingly appears to be a harbinger of subsequent de- mentia (540, 541). In addition, research suggests that cer-tain types of executive cognitive dysfunction predict greater disability and limited treatment response in geriatric pa- tients with depression (542, 543). 2. DSM depressive subtypes a. Psychotic features Major depressive disorder is sometimes accompanied by hallucinations or delusions, which may be congruent orincongruent with the depressed mood. Recognition of psychosis is essential among patients with major depres- sive disorder as it is often undetected, resulting in ineffec-tive treatment (544-546). Psychotic features constitute a risk factor for recurrent major depressive disorder and re- current psychosis and hence indicate the need for mainte-nance treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective in treating psychotic depression (241) and can be considered as afirst-line treatment option whenever major depressive disorder is associated with psychotic features (239, 243, 547). Pharmacotherapy can also be used as a first-linetreatment option for major depressive disorder with psy- chotic features. Psychotic depression typically responds better to the combination of an antipsychotic and an an- tidepressant medication rather than treatment with either component alone (547-549), although some research has shown comparable responses for antidepressive treatmentor antipsychotic treatment alone (550, 551). Lithium aug- mentation is helpful for some patients who have not re- sponded to combined treatment with antidepressant andantipsychotic medication (262, 552). b. Catatonic features A catatonic syndrome sometimes occurs in the context of major depressive disorder (553-556) and is characterizedby at least two of the following manifestations: immobil-ity, as evidenced by catalepsy or stupor; extreme agitation; extreme negativism; peculiarities of voluntary movement,as evidenced by posturing, stereotyped movements, man- nerisms, or grimacing; and echolalia or echopraxia (556, 557). The presence of catatonia should prompt a thor-ough differential diagnosis as it can also occur in asso- ciation with general medical conditions and with several other psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorderand schizophrenia (556, 558, 559). Catatonic signs often dominate the clinical presentation and may be so severe as to be life-threatening, compelling the consideration of ur-gent somatic treatment. Patients with catatonic features may also need supportive medical interventions including hydration, nutrition, prophyla xis against deep vein throm- bosis, turning to prevent bed sores, and passive range ofmotion to prevent contractures. Intravenous administra-tion of a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam) or a barbiturate (e.g., amobarbital) may induce rapid relief (242, 553) and can be followed by continued oral admin-istration for patients who show an initial response. When such intervention is ineffective, the clinician should con- sider the urgent use of ECT (239, 242). The efficacy ofECT in catatonia is well documented in the case series literature (239) and is usually apparent after a few treat- ments. After catatonic manifestations recede, antidepres-sant medication treatments may be needed during acute and maintenance phases of treatment. In addition to anti- depressant medications, ongoing treatment may includeECT, lithium, antipsychotics, or a combination of these approaches, depending upon the patient's condition. Pa-tients with catatonia may have an increased susceptibilityto neuroleptic malignant syndrome when exposed to an- tipsychotic medications (560), and this should be consid- ered in planning treatment. c. Melancholic features Melancholic features describe characteristic somatic symptoms, such as the loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities or a lack of reactivity to usually plea-surable stimuli. Other symptoms include worsened de- pression in the morning, early morning awakening, and significant anorexia or weight loss, among others (16).Major depressive disorder with melancholic features is re- sponsive to both pharmacoth erapy and ECT. Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and TCAs may have an advantage over SSRIs for this patient population (561, 562). Psychotherapy may be less appropriate for patients with melancholia (563), particularly if the symptoms pre-vent engagement with the therapist (e.g., lack of interest in activities). Major depressive disorder with melancholic features may also be associated with an added risk of sui- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Atypical features Major depressive disorder with atypical features is charac- terized by a pattern of marked mood reactivity and at least two additional symptoms, including leaden paralysis, along-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity, significant weight gain or increase in appetite, and hyper- somnia (the latter two of which are considered reversedvegetative symptoms) (16). The phrase \"atypical features\" distinguishes this depressive subtype from the more classi- cal \"endogenous\" presentation of depression, but it does not connote an uncommon or unusual form of depression. Atypical features are more common in women, are associ-ated with an earlier age at on set of depression and a greater degree of associated anxiety disorders, and frequently havea more chronic, less episodic course, with only partial in-terepisode recovery (565, 566). These atypical features are also common in the depressed phase of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder (567, 568), indicating a need forcareful screening for manic or hypomanic episodes in pa- tients who present with atypical depressive symptoms. In the treatment of major depressive disorder with atypical features, MAOIs have greater efficacy than TCAs(122, 569-572). Some data also support the use of SSRIs, bupropion, and CBT in this patient population (573- 577). Electroconvulsive therapy is also effective in treat- ing patients with atypical features (578). The presence and severity of specific symptoms as well as safety consider-ations should help guide the choice of treatment for major depressive disorder with atypical features. For example, if a patient does not wish to, cannot, or appears unlikely toadhere to the dietary and medication precautions associ- ated with MAOI treatment, the clinician should consider alternative antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. e. Seasonal pattern A seasonal pattern of major depressive disorder is charac- terized by a regular temporal relationship between partic-ular periods of the year and the onset and remission of symptoms, which is not the result of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment, sig- nificant anniversaries). The most common presentation in the northern hemisphere is the regular appearance of symptoms between early October and late November andregular remission from mid-February to mid-April. Epi- sodes of major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern frequently have atypical features such as hypersomnia andovereating. Some of these patients experience manic or hypomanic episodes as well; hence, it is important to di- agnose bipolar disorder when appropriate.The entire range of treatments for major depressive disorder may be used to treat major depressive disorderwith seasonal pattern, either in combination with or as analternative to light therapy. As a primary treatment, light therapy may be recommended as a 1- to 2-week time-limited trial (395), primarily for outpatients with clear seasonalpatterns. For patients with more severe forms of major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, the use of light therapy is considered adjunc tive to pharmacological in- tervention. In terms of specific antidepressive agents, the extended release formulation of bupropion is FDA approved for use with patients who have major depressive disorderwith seasonal pattern. 3. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders Co-occurring psychiatric disorders generally complicate treatment. Patients with major depressive disorder who also have other psychiatric disorders have greater symp-tom severity and are more challenging to treat than pa- tients with major depressive disorder alone. Yet the presence of co-occurring Axis I or Axis II disorders shouldnot lead clinicians to conclude that patients are untreat- able. Furthermore, other Axis I or Axis II disorders may masquerade as major depressive disorder or may seem toco-occur with the depression. In these cases, the other ap- parent disorders evanesce with successful treatment of theunderlying major depressive disorder. a. Dysthymic disorder Dysthymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder with symptoms that fall below the threshold for major depres- sive disorder. Because of this, it may escape notice and may be inadequately treated. Nonetheless, it can causesignificant suffering and disability. In some patients, both dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder (so- called \"double depression\") may be diagnosed. In the treatment of dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder, there is demonstrated efficacyfor antidepressant medications, including TCAs, SSRIs,other newer agents, and MAOIs. Unfortunately, clinical trials provide little evidence of the relative efficacies of particular agents (105, 579). In general, pharmacotherapyof dysthymic disorder resembles that for episodes of major depressive disorder; responses to antidepressant medications by patients with dysthymic and chronicmajor depressive disorders have been comparable to the responses by patients with major depressive disorder episodes (580). In \"double depression,\" antidepressantmedication can reverse not only the acute major depres- sive episode but also the co-occurring dysthymic disorder (581).

Anxiety disorders As a group, anxiety disorders are the most commonly oc-curring psychiatric disorders in patients with major de- pressive disorder (583). A 2005 epidemiological study found that among individuals with major depressive dis- order, 62% also met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, 52% for social phobia, 50% for posttraumaticstress disorder (PTSD), 48% for panic disorder, 43% for specific phobia, and 42% for obsessive-compulsive disor- der (584). In addition, agitation and anxiety, includingpanic attacks, are frequent co-occurring symptoms of major depressive disorder. Th e appearance of anxiety and agitation in patients in a major depressive episode, particu- larly when accompanied by racing or ruminative thoughts, should alert the clinician to the possibility of a mixed mood state of a bipolar spectrum disorder (585). In studies of major depressive disorder with a co- occurring anxiety disorder, both depressive symptoms andanxiety symptoms respond to antidepressant medicationtreatment (586). However, TCAs and SSRIs may initially worsen rather than alleviate anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks; patients should be so advised, and thesemedications should be introduced at low doses and slowly increased when treating such patients. Adjunctive anti- panic agents, such as benzodiazepines, may be necessaryas well. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are bene- ficial for patients with co-o ccurring depression and social anxiety disorder (587) and co-occurring depression and PTSD (588). Bupropion is comparable to SSRIs in thetreatment of patients with major depressive disorder and low to moderate levels of anxiety (82), but studies vary asto whether bupropion is (589) or is not (590) effective in the treatment of panic disorder. Because benzodiazepines are not antidepressants and carry their own adverse effectsand toxicity, including abus e and dependence, benzodiaz- epines should not be the pr imary pharmacological agents for patients with major depressive disorder who have co-occurring anxiety symptoms. These agents may be used adjunctively with other antidepressive treatments, how- ever (591). Psychotherapies such as CBT, behavioral ther-apy, and IPT may also be used to treat anxiety symptoms in the context of major depressive disorder (591, 592). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are also common in patients with major depressive episodes. In addition, ob-sessive-compulsive disorder may appear as a co-occurringcondition in some patients with major depressive disor- der. Clomipramine and SSRIs have demonstrated efficacyin managing obsessive-compulsive symptoms in addition to treating depression (593-595). c. Dementia Patients with dementia are predisposed to depression, and the psychiatrist should therefore screen for depression in this population, although this is sometimes challenging (539). One screening tool is the Cornell Scale for Depres-sion in Dementia, which incorporates self-report with caregiver and clinician ratings of depressive symptoms (596). T reatment of major depressive disorder in the cog- nitively impaired patient requires careful supervision and monitoring of the patient's pharmacotherapy; this mayentail education of home health aides, nursing home staff, and others. Antidepressants are likely to be efficacious in treatment of depressive symptoms, but they do not im-prove cognition, and data on antidepressant use in pa- tients with dementia are limited (597-599). Individuals with dementia are particularly susceptible to the adverseeffects of muscarinic blockade on memory and attention. Therefore, individuals with dementia generally do best when given antidepressant medications with the lowestpossible degree of anticholinergic effect, e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine, agents, desipramine nortriptyline (600). Alternatively,some patients do well when given stimulants in small doses. Electroconvulsive therapy is also effective in major depressive disorder superimposed on dementia. It shouldbe used if medications are associated with an excessive risk of adverse effects, are not tolerated, or if immediate reso- lution of the major depressive disorder episode is medi-cally indicated (such as when it interferes with the patient's acceptance of food). In individuals with demen- tia, ECT treatment may be associated with a transient worsening of the patient's cognitive status (239, 601, 602). APA 's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, Second Edition (539) contains more information about the treatment of depression and dementia. d. Substance use disorders Major depressive disorder frequently occurs with alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence. Therefore, the psychiatrist should obtain a detailed history of the pa- tient's substance use. With the patient's permission, familymembers, friends, or co-workers can be collateral sources of information. If the evaluation reveals a substance use disorder, this should be addressed in treatment. A patientwith major depressive disorder who has a co-occurring Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Detoxifying patients before initiating antidepressant medication therapy is advisable when possible (110). An-tidepressants may be used to treat depressive symptoms following initiation of abstinence if symptoms do not im-prove over time. It is difficult to identify patients who should begin a regimen of antidepressant medication therapy soon after initiation of abstinence, because depressivesymptoms may have been induced by intoxication and/or withdrawal of the substance. A family history of major de- pressive disorder, a history of major depressive disorder preceding alcohol or other substance abuse, or a history of major depressive disorder during periods of sobriety raisesthe likelihood that the patient might benefit from antide- pressant medication, which may then be started early in treatment. Comparing the temporal pattern of symptomswith the periods of use and abstinence of the substance may help to clarify the patient's diagnosis. Repeated, lon- gitudinal psychiatric assessments may be necessary to dis-tinguish substance-induced depressive disorder from co- occurring major depressive disorder, particularly because some individuals with substance use disorders reducetheir substance consumption once they achieve remission of a co-occurring major depressive disorder. Co-occurring substance use, especially with stimulant drugs, raises the risk of deleterious interactions with MAOIs,although few such events have been reported (609). Ben- zodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics carry the po-tential for abuse or dependence and should rarely be prescribed to patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, except as part of a brief detoxification regimen.Hepatic dysfunction and hepatic enzyme induction fre- quently complicate pharmacotherapy of patients with al- coholism and other substance abuse. These conditionsmay require careful monitoring of blood levels (as appro- priate for the medication), therapeutic effects, and side ef- fects to avoid the opposing risks of either psychotropicmedication intoxication or underdosing. For individuals with nicotine dependence who wish to stop smoking, bupropion and nortriptyline treatment in-crease smoking cessation rates by about twofold (109) and would be useful to consider when selecting a specific an- tidepressive agent (110). e. Personality disorders For patients who exhibit symptoms of both major depres- sive disorder and a personality disorder, psychiatrists should consider appropriate treatment for each. Majordepressive disorder should generally be the initial target;if evidence of a personality disorder persists when the de- pressive symptoms have resolved, psychotherapeutic andadjunctive pharmacotherapeuti c approaches may be help- ful (610-615). Patients with virtually any personality dis-order exhibit a less satisfactory antidepressant medicationtreatment response, in terms of both social functioning and residual major depressive disorder symptoms, than do individuals without personality disorders (616). Personal-ity disorders tend to interfere with treatment adherence and development of a psychoth erapeutic relationship. Fur- thermore, many personality disorders increase the risk of episodes and increase time to remission of major depres- sive disorder (617, 618). Patients with various personality disorders also showed high rates of new-onset major de- pressive episodes in a large prospective study (619) and were at higher risk of attempting suicide than patients withouta co-occurring personality disorder (620). Axis II diagnoses should be made with caution during a major depressive episode, as depressive symptoms may ex-aggerate or mimic personality traits. T reatment of the de- pressive disorder for these patients can cause the apparent personality disorder symptoms to remit or greatly dimin-ish. Depressed patients may believe that their current symptoms have been present from early life, when in fact they only began with the current episode. Such misper-ceptions often hinder accurate diagnosis. Some Cluster C personality disorders (e.g., avoidant, dependent, obses- sive-compulsive) may reflect the residual impact of recurrent depressive symptoms and may remit with maintenance therapy (621). Patients with borderline personality disorder have a particularly high rate of major depressive disorder: 20%in a community sample (622) and 50% in clinical samples (623). About 10%-15% of patients with major depressivedisorder have co-occurring borderline personality disor- der (624), and the percentage increases significantly in hospital and partial hospital samples. Patients with bor-derline personality disorder often exhibit mood lability, rejection sensitivity, inappropriate intense anger, and de- pressive \"mood crashes.\" These symptoms are also com-mon in patients with depression, particularly with atypical features, complicating the di agnosis of these disorders. Antidepressants are in general less effective in treating de- pressive episodes in patients with major depressive disor- der and borderline personality disorder (625-629), with an overall response rate to all therapies of 20% (630). For patients with major depr essive disorder and border- line personality disorder, the personality disorder mustalso be addressed in treatment. Symptoms of both dis-orders can initially be treated with an SSRI or SNRI. Be- havioral impulsivity and dyscontrol can also be treated Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, al- though efficacious, are not recommended due to the risk ofserious side effects and the difficulties with adherence to dietary restrictions. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as dialectical behavioral therapy and psychodynamic psy-chotherapy have been useful in treatment of borderline personality disorder as well. In patients with borderline personality disorder particular attention must be paid tothe maintenance of therapeutic rapport, which is frequently disrupted, and to the risk of self-harm and suicide, which occurs in 8%-10% of such individuals. More informationabout the treatment of borderline personality disorder can be found in APA's Practice Guideline for Treatment of Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder (610). f. Eating disorders Eating disorders are also common in patients with majordepressive disorder (631). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the best studied medications for treatment of eating disorders, with fluoxetine having the most evi-dence for the effective treatment of bulimia nervosa (170). Antidepressants may be less effective in patients who are severely underweight or malnourished, and normalizingweight should take priority in these patients. Although SSRIs and psychotherapy are widely used for patients with anorexia nervosa, the evidence base on which thesepractices rest is modest. Patients with chronic anorexia nervosa have in general been less responsive to formal psychotherapy. On the other hand, evidence strongly sup-ports the use of CBT in the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Other therapies (e.g., IPT, group therapies, family ther- apy) and medications such as SSRIs have also been studiedand have demonstrated effectiveness for this disorder. Bupropion should be avoided in individuals with eating disorders due to the increased risk of seizures in these pa-tients. Electroconvulsive therapy has not generally been useful in treating eating disorder symptoms. Although there are few data to guide treatment of co-occurring ma-jor depressive disorder and eating disorders, it is reason- able to optimize treatment of both disorders based on these and other consideratio ns. More information about the treatment of eating disorders can be found in APA 's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Eating Disorders, Third Edition (170). B. DEMOGRAPHIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES 1. Major psychosocial stressors Major depressive disorder may follow a substantial ad-verse life event, especially one that involves the loss of animportant relationship or life role. This is particularly true in initial episodes of depression, with psychosocial stressors being less associated with the onset of recurrentepisodes (632). Lower socioeconomic status, nonmarried status, unemployment, urbanization, and violent trauma seem to increase the risk of developing major depressivedisorder, whereas religious belief may decrease it (633- 635). Among those exposed to trauma, the prevalence of major depressive disorder seems to be higher among per-sons who develop PTSD than among those who do not (636). A recent meta-analysis underlined that among ref- ugees, PTSD was diagnosed in one of 10 and one in 20 hadmajor depressive disorder (637). Marital discord has been identified as a potent risk factor in women for the development of depression (638, 639). Problems in the family setting may become an ongoing stressor that hampers the patient's response to treatment.Ambivalent, abusive, rejecting, or highly dependent family relationships may predispose an individual to major depres- sive disorder. The psychiatrist should screen for such fac-tors and consider family therapy, as indicated, for these patients. Family therapy may be conducted in conjunction with individual and pharmacologi cal therapies. Even for in- stances in which there is no apparent family dysfunction, it is important to provide the family with education about the nature of the illness and to enlist the family's support andcooperation with the treatment. The psychiatrist may choose to treat a major depressive episode with an antidepressant, even if a major stressorpreceded the episode. Nonetheless, attention to the rela- tionship of both prior and concurrent life events to the onset, exacerbation, or maintenance of major depressivedisorder symptoms is an important aspect of the overall treatment approach and may enhance the therapeutic al- liance, help to prevent relapse, and guide the currenttreatment. A close relationship between a life stressor and major depressive disorder suggests the potential utility of a psychotherapeutic intervention coupled, as indicated,with somatic treatment. 2. Bereavement Bereavement is a particularly severe stressor that can trig-ger a major depressive episode. However, grief, the natural response to bereavement, resembles depression, and this sometimes causes confusion. Psychiatrists treating be-reaved individuals should differentiate symptoms of normal acute grief, complicated grief, and major depressive disor- der, as each of these disorders requires a unique manage-ment plan. Normal grief should be treated with support and psychoeducation about symptoms and the course of mourning; complicated grief requires a targeted psycho-therapy, with or without concomitant medication (535, Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Acute grief is the universal reaction to loss of a loved one, and it is a highly dysphoric and disruptive state (641).Acute grief is characterized by prominent yearning and longing for the person who died, recurrent pangs of sad-ness and other painful emotions, preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the person who died, and rela- tive lack of interest in other activities and people. Despitethe similarity with depression, only about 20% of be- reaved people meet the criteria for major depressive dis- order. Successful mourning leads to resolution of acutegrief over a period of about 6 months. Integrated grief re- mains as a permanent state in which there is ongoing sad- ness about the loss often accompanied by ongoing feelings of yearning for the person who died. However, when the death is accepted, and grief integrated, the person is againinterested in his or her own life and other people. Complicated grief is a recently recognized syndrome in which symptoms of acute grief are prolonged, associatedwith intense and persistent yearning and longing for the deceased person, and complicated by guilty or angry ru- minations related to the death and/or avoidance behavior.Studies of individuals bereaved by the attacks of Septem- ber, 11, 2001, have demonstrated that complicated grief is a distinct condition from either major depressive disorderor PTSD (642, 643). It is important to note that treatment for depression is not effective in relieving symptoms of complicated grief (640). Although DSM-IV-TR excludes the diagnosis of major depressive disorder during the first 2 months followingbereavement, major depressive disorder in the wake of be-reavement can impede the course of mourning. Bereave- ment-related depression responds to antidepressant medication and should be treated; otherwise it is likely tobecome chronic and impairing (644). There is no indica- tion that depression in the context of bereavement differs from other major depressive episodes, and data indicatethat chronicity of bereavement-related depression over 13 months is similar to chronicity of depression in other contexts (644). 3. Culture and ethnicity An appreciation of cultural and ethnic variables is impor-tant to the accurate diagnosis of major depressive disorder and in the selection and conduct of psychotherapy andpharmacotherapy (645-647). Although major depressivedisorder is seen across cultural and ethnic groups, and the age at onset, gender differences, and prevalence of co-oc- curring conditions are simila r across cultures, the actual incidence and prevalence of depression vary (648-656). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that patients of dif-ferent cultures express depressive symptoms differently,particularly somatic and psychomotor symptoms (657). Specific cultural variables may also influence the assess-ment of major depressive disorder symptoms. For exam- ple, in some cultures, depressive symptoms may be more likely to be attributed to physical diseases (658). In addi-tion, language barriers can impede accurate psychiatric diagnosis and effective treatm ent (659), and, even when speaking the same language, individuals of different cul- tures may use different psychological terms to describe their symptoms (6, 7). In addition, the importance of in- dividual experience should not be underestimated in thetherapeutic relationship (660). The assessment and treat- ment process can also be influenced by religious beliefs (5). Individuals with high levels of religious involvement may have diminished rates of major depressive disorder (661, 662). Differences in the utilization of psychiatric services by some cultural and ethnic groups have been well docu-mented. Relative to Caucasians, African Americans andLatinos appear less likely to receive treatment for mood disorders (663-665). Several studies have underscored the lower frequency of use of antidepressant drugs (and more specifically,SSRIs) (648, 666-669), ECT (670), and psychotherapy (671, 672) in minority groups, compared with Caucasians. Iftreatment for depression is initiated, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to receive pharmacother- apy (672), to drop out of treatment (673), and to developchronic symptoms (674) than are Caucasian patients. These differences in mental health service use by minority populations appear to have a number of potential causes.Cultures and ethnicities may differ in the degree to which psychiatric illness is stigmatized (675) and in the prefer- ences of individuals for treatment (676-678). For exam-ple, studies have found that Hispanic individuals were more likely to prefer counseling than whites, whereas Af- rican Americans varied across studies in their relativepreference for counseling rather than pharmacotherapy (6, 679). Service use by minority populations is more af- fected by financial constraints (including those related toinsurance) and social barriers (e.g., stigma) than the use of comparable services by Caucasians (664, 680, 681). In ad-dition, pharmacological factors may play a role in patient preferences and adherence, as ethnic groups may differ in their relative rates of metabolism (682-684) and side ef- fects and response to antidepressant medications (685-688). 4. Older age The combined prevalence of major depression, dysthymic disorder, and \"minor\" depression in individuals over age Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Elderly pa-tients typically display more vegetative signs and cogni- tive disturbance but report less subjective dysphoria than younger patients. Major depressive disorder may conse-quently be misattributed to physical illness, dementia, or the aging process itself. For older adults with chronic illness or physical disability, including those expected toremain in a long-term care facility, depression may be er- roneously regarded as expected or inevitable, and therefore untreatable (690). As a result, it is common for major de-pressive disorder to be undiagnosed and untreated among older adults. As in all depressed individuals, a suicide risk assessment is an essential element of the evaluation process in older individuals. Although older adults constitute only 13% ofthe U.S. population, they account for 19% of all suicides, with elderly white men having the highest rates of com- pleted suicides (691). This increase in suicide risk with ag-ing in some demographic groups should be taken into consideration when estimating suicide risk and develop- ing a plan to reduce such risk. Several general medical conditions common among older adults are risk factors for depression. In addition,the presence of depression of ten exacerbates the course of the co-occurring medical condition and is a risk factor for poor outcomes. For example, elderly patients who are de- pressed and recovering from hip fractures have poorerfunctional outcomes from rehabilitative care and are less likely to return to full ambulation, compared with older adults with hip fractures who are not depressed (692-694). There is also frequent co-occurrence of major de- pressive disorder and cardiovascular disease; 25% or more of those with cardiovascular disease also have major de- pressive disorder, and co-occurring depression increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular illness (695-697). The term vascular depression has been used todescribe depression occurring in late life in patients with clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease (698), al- though at this time it has not been established as a uniquesubtype of depression. In addition, major depressive dis- order is a complication of cere bral infarction (see Section III.C.3). There is also a high prevalence of major depres- sive disorder among patients with dementia, and mood symptoms may precede cognitive symptoms and diagno- sis of dementia (see Section III.A.3.C). Just as patients with medical conditions should be screened for depression, patients exhibiting symptoms ofdepression should be thoroughly evaluated for the pres-ence of co-occurring medical conditions, as major depres- sive disorder and general medical illnesses frequentlycoexist, especially in elderly patients (696, 699). This eval- uation should include a systematic review of the patient's medications. Some medications have been reported to in-duce depressive symptoms (e.g., beta-blockers), although they may simply be producing lethargy and fatigue that mimic depression (700, 701). Consequently, the psychia-trist must carefully assess whether a given medication is contributing to depressive symptoms before prematurely altering what may be a valuable treatment. Patients un-dergoing their first major depressive episode in old age should be assessed for an undiagnosed neurological or other general medical disorder that may be responsiblefor the depressive symptoms. Similarly, frequently co- occurring symptoms of major depressive disorder, such as lassitude or pain, may mimic symptoms of a general med- ical condition. Pain in older adults, especially from ortho- pedic sources, may contribute significantly to the presenceof depression in this population (702). Once the patient has been thoroughly assessed, the treatment considerations for depressed geriatric patientsare essentially the same as for younger patients. A meta- analysis has shown that SSRIs; TCAs; and cognitive- behavioral, behavioral, and psychodynamic therapies areall superior to placebo in the acute treatment for depres- sion in subjects older than age 55 years (703-708). In ad- dition, treatments for depression have been shown to beeffective in nursing home populations (709, 710), as well as in inpatient and traditional outpatient settings of care. However, compared with younger individuals, older pa-tients may be more likely to experience relapses and less likely to achieve a full response to treatment with antide- pressant medications (711-714). In contrast, ECT is notonly effective as a treatment for depression among older individuals, but those over age 65 years actually have bet- ter response rates than younger patients (715). Consid-eration should also be given to combined treatment with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, as evidence for the efficacy of stand-alone psychotherapy, such as CBT, isweak (716). Although the role of stimulants for antide- pressant monotherapy is very limited, these compounds have some role in apathetic major depressive disorder inelderly patients with complicating general medical condi- tions. Late-life depression asso ciated with vascular disease has also been found to respond well to treatment with an- tidepressants (717) and, in one unreplicated study, to TMS (718). Furthermore, in a recent randomized con- trolled trial, administering escitalopram prophylacticallyto patients who had experienced a stroke resulted in lower rates of depression at 12 months (334). Psychoso- cial factors are also frequent contributors to depressionamong older adults and should be addressed as part of the treatment plan (719, 720).

As with any patient, the psychi- atrist should attempt to use as few medications as possible,and this is especially important given the complexity and multiplicity of issues in elderly patients. It is often useful to use medications that address several issues at once, suchas choosing mirtazapine for a depressed, elderly patient with weight loss and insomnia. Elderly patients typically require a lower oral dose than younger patients to yield a partic-ular blood level, and they tolerate a given blood level less well. Nevertheless, the blood levels at which antidepres- sant medications are maximally effective for elderly pa-tients appear to be the same as those for younger patients (721, 722). Dose regimens should be adjusted for age- related metabolic changes, with close attention paid to hepatic and renal metabolic function. For patients who are receiving other medications, careful attention shouldbe paid to potential drug interactions (160, 161, 723-725) (T ables 4 and 5). Elderly patients are particularly prone to orthostatic hypotension and cholinergic blockade; for this reason,SSRIs, antidepressants should be con- sidered over MAOIs or TCAs. Among the TCAs, de-sipramine and nortriptyline should be considered over amitriptyline, imipramine, and doxepin, due to increas- ing sensitivity to side effects and toxicity with advancingage. T reatment with SSRIs causes the syndrome of in- appropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) at a higher rate in elderly patients than in younger patients (726,727). Patients taking SSRIs have a three times greater risk of developing SIADH than patients taking other antide- pressants, with the greatest risk among elderly patients(728). For maintenance treatment, one study has shown that antidepressant medication (nortriptyline) and IPT are ef-fective for elderly patients with recurrent major depres- sive disorder (315), yet a trend toward superior response was observed for combined pharmacotherapy and IPT ,compared with pharmacoth erapy alone. Another study demonstrated that paroxetine (but not monthly psycho-therapy) was effective as maintenance therapy for elderlypatients (729). For older patients with particularly se- vere or treatment-resistant depressive illness, addition of maintenance ECT to nortriptyline appears to improvetreatment outcome (730). Among elderly patients who have had prior depression, the risk of developing another episode of major depressive disorder is substantially in-creased in those who develop or report sleep disturbance (731). Sleep disturbances may function as independent predictors of depression and are not simply prodromal de-pressive symptoms.A body of systematic evidence suggests a particular value for various forms of collaborative or team-basedcare for elderly patients. Such care combines, for example,specialty mental health consultation/intervention with primary care management or community-based outreach and monitoring of care (732, 733). Older adults with de-pression can benefit from integration of mental health services in the setting where they typically receive their general medical care. It has been shown that support foralgorithm-driven depression care processes within the primary care outpatient practice can lead to increased treatment adherence and improved clinical outcomes, in-cluding a reduction in mortality (734). 5. Gender As part of the diagnostic a ssessment of a woman with ma- jor depressive disorder, there should be a detailed inquiry regarding reproductive life history and mood symptoms associated with reproductive life events, such as menses,use of oral contraceptive agents, peripartum, infertility, menopause, and pregnancy loss due to abortions, miscar- riages, and perinatal losses. Although associations be-tween reproductive factors and major depressive disorder are neither widespread nor consistent, some women may be particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in gonadal hor-mone levels (735). The perimenopausal transition has been identified as a high-risk period for new-onset major depressive disorder, with high variability of sex hormonesas a risk factor (736, 737). Women in the perimenopausal transition may benefit from the use of serotonergic anti- depressants, for mood and also for somatic symptoms suchas hot flashes (738). Since women are often caretakers in families, psycho- social stresses such as caring for an ill husband, child, orparent must be carefully assessed. T reating depressed mothers is associated with improved prognosis for their children as well (739). Maternal remission from depression was associated after 3 months with significantly decreased diagnoses and symptoms in their children, compared with children of mothers whose depression had not remitted.Thus, treating depressed mothers may crucially benefit both the patients and their children. The patient's gender also factors into other treatment considerations for major depressive disorder. For exam-ple, the risks of certain adverse effects from treatments may also differ by gender. When prescribing trazodone tomen, it is important to provide education about the risk of priapism (174). Older men typically have prostatic hyper- trophy, making them particularly sensitive to anticho-linergic effects of some antidepressants on the bladder outlet. While both men and women may experience de- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Some women who are taking birth control pills require higher doses of TCA medications because of the induction of the hepatic enzymes responsible for medication metabolism. Similarly, medications that induce hepatic enzymes, suchas anticonvulsants used as adjunctive treatment, reduce the effectiveness of contraceptives. 6. Pregnancy and postpartum Major depressive disorder during pregnancy and postpar- tum presents unique treatment considerations. During these periods, approximately 10% to 15% of perinatal women will experience major depressive disorder, which is at least as common as rates reported for women in non- reproductive states (741, 742). Evaluation and communi-cation of risks and benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy and breast-feeding is challenging and must in- clude the risks of untreated maternal mood disorder, thelimited body of research that informs safety of antidepres- sants, and the general lack of prospective long-term data following antidepressant exposure in utero and throughlactation. Depression-focused psychotherapy or other nonmedi- cation therapies may be considered first for some women,and psychotherapy should be considered as part of the treatment plan whenever possible. As childbearing is a life stressor with psychosocial repercussions that may be ame-nable to psychotherapy, psyc hotherapy may serve to min- imize medication exposure in some women. Althoughthere is little controlled research, psychotherapies appearefficacious in antenatal and postpartum depression, with IPT being the best studied (743, 744). Therefore, depres-sion-focused psychotherapies such as IPT and CBTshould be considered in the treatment plan as a first-line treatment or in combination with medication to minimize medication exposure, especially if the individual has expe-rienced a good response to a particular psychotherapy in the past or strongly prefers to avoid medication. a. Depression during pregnancy Psychiatrists should be familiar with the management of major depressive disorder in the context of pregnancy (745). More than 80% of women in the United States willhave children (746), and about half of pregnancies are unplanned (747). Therefore, pregnancies\u2014including un- planned pregnancies\u2014are likely to occur during the courseof treatment of major depressive disorder, as it is often a chronic and/or recurrent cond ition that is a major cause of disability during the reproductive years and dispropor- tionately affects women, compared with men. In consid-eration of the high prevalence of both unplanned pregnancy and major depressive disorder in women, the risks and benefits of antidepressants and untreated maternal de-pression during pregnancy should be discussed with all fe- male patients who have reproductive potential. Whenever possible, a pregnancy should be planned in consultationwith a treating psychiatrist, who may wish to consult with a specialist in perinatal psychiatry. For women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, decisionsabout treatment for depression require weighing multiple benefits and risks for the woman as well as for the fetus. Making such decisions may require several discussions and will generally involve discussions with the patient's partner as well as her obstetrician. Antidepressant medications carry some reported risks in pregnancy (see below), but so does untreated depres- sion. Suicide risk, marital discord, the inability to engagein appropriate obstetrical care, and difficulty caring for other children must also be considered. There are also se- rious and well-characterized risks to the fetus of exposureto maternal major depressive disorder, including the pos- sibility of low birth weight secondary to poor maternal weight gain (or frank weight loss) and increased risk of ob-stetrical complications such as premature delivery (748). Antidepressant efficacy has not been determined for pregnant women, and questions remain as to whethermedications have equivalent efficacy during pregnancy, compared with the nonpregnant state. Some safety data are available, but the findings often conflict, making datainterpretation challenging and difficult to apply to the care of individual patients. Nevertheless, antidepressant medication should be considered and discussed as an op-tion with pregnant women who have moderate to severe major depressive disorder. For women who are in remission from major depres- sive disorder and receiving maintenance medicationand/or for women deemed to be at high risk for a recur- rence if the medication is discontinued, the risks of treat-ment with medications must also be weighed against the risks of alternative treatment options and untreated de- pression. Relapse rates for women with a history of majordepressive disorder are high during pregnancy, especially if antidepressants are discontinued (749). 1. Risks of antidepressants during pregnancy The impact of the duration and timing of antidepressant exposure during pregnancy requires further study. Wisneret al. (750) reviewed the risks associated with the use of antidepressants during pregnancy, and a growing body of complicated literature has followed. Overall, risk of ter-atogenicity with antidepressants following first trimester Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

First-trimester paroxetineexposure has been associated with cardiac malformations, a finding that resulted in changes in FDA labeling for par-oxetine from C to D (753); labeling changes have beenmade to all SSRI antidepressants with regard to this pos- sibility when used during pregnancy. There have been conflicting results regarding whether first-trimester par-oxetine exposure and cardiac teratogenicity are associated (754, 755). For fluoxetine, one study (756) found a higher incidence of three or more minor physical anomalies ininfants exposed to fluoxetine than in a control group, and fetuses exposed to fluoxetine after 25 weeks' gestation had lower birth weights, which were associated with lower maternal weight gain. Although one case-control study reported a potential association between late antenatalSSRI use and the rare but serious condition of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN) (757), two subsequent retrospective chart review studies showedno such association (758, 759). An additional case-control study (760) showed a marginally significant increase in the relative risk of PPHN with SSRI use, but the estimatedrate of PPHN occurrence was 1.5 per 1,000 births, which is less than the rate of 2.7 per 1,000 births reported by oth- ers (758) in non-SSRI exposed infants. Therefore, whilemany physicians are concerned about the reported associ- ation between SSRIs and PPHN, the preponderance of evidence from published studies on this topic does notsupport an association. Use of SSRIs may also be associ- ated with prematurity (761, 762), although untreated de-pression and stress during pregnancy may also contributeto the risk of prematurity (748, 763). Some naturalistic studies and health care utili zation studies suggest that antidepressants are associated with shorter length of ges- tation (761, 762), but there have been no randomized stud-ies of the treatment of antenatal major depressive disorder that would adequately control for untreated maternal de-pression, antidepressant use, and confounding variables related to treatment selection. With late pregnancy anti- depressant use, some but not all studies show a risk ofmedical complications such as prematurity and a transient neonatal withdrawal/adaptation syndrome (761, 764). The syndrome in the neonate appears to be associated with an-tidepressant use in the third trimester, has been reported in babies exposed in utero to TCAs and SSRIs, and in- cludes transient symptoms such as jitteriness, tremor, dif-ficulty with feedings, and other symptoms (764). Several studies, involving relatively small samples, have examined effects of antidepressant exposure during pregnancy onsubsequent childhood behavior and development and found minimal (765) or no (766-768) effects on language,cognition, or motor or behavioral development indepen-dent of maternal depressed mood during pregnancy and the child's early life (766, 767). 2. Implementation of pharmacotherapy during pregnancy No controlled trials inform the use of antidepressants during pregnancy. Dose requirements may change during pregnancy because of changes in volume of distribution,hepatic metabolism, protein binding, and gastrointestinal absorption. Pharmacokinetic changes in late pregnancy may result in lower blood levels, with clinical implica-tions, although more study is needed to develop monitor- ing and dosing guidelines. The limited data in this area demonstrate that pregnant women metabolize TCAs and SSRIs more rapidly in late pregnancy (769-774). A number of factors influence antidepressant choice during pregnancy. If a woman has had a history of a goodresponse to or is already ta king a particular antidepres- sant, it is logical to consid er that antidepressant among first-line treatments in an effort to minimize the numberof different medication exposures. Using a single agent is also preferable to using several medications concomi-tantly. Because paroxetine use is classified as having a higher level of risk than other SSRIs, it should not be considered a first-line treatment when selecting a new antidepressantfor a pregnant patient. Fluoxetine has the longest half-life and is mor e like ly to b e d emonstr ated at high le vels in newborns after in utero exposure. Sertraline has beendemonstrated to have lower cord blood levels than other SSRIs, although the clinical s ignificance of this is un- known (775). Although there are few data for bupropion and safety in pregnancy, its benefits for smoking cessation may make it especially useful in women who have major depressive disorder and who smoke cigarettes, as tobaccois a known teratogen. Given these data, it is recommended that consideration be given to using an antidepressant with some available safety information that has beenstudied in pregnant women. For women who discontinue medication during pregnancy and are deemed at risk for postpartum depression, medication can be restarted fol-lowing delivery. Electroconvulsive therapy is also recommended as a treatment option for major depressive disorder duringpregnancy (239). The current literature supports the safety for mother and fetus, as well as the efficacy of ECT during pregnancy (239). The psychiatrist should considerECT for pregnant patients with moderate to severe de- pression who are unresponsive to or unsuitable for phar- macotherapy, for pregnant patients with major depressivedisorder with psychotic features, and for pregnant pa- tients electing to use this modality as a matter of prefer- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For details on the use of ECT during pregnancy, refer to The Practice of Electro- convulsive Therapy: Recommendations for Treatment, Train- ing, and Privileging (A T ask Force Report of the American Psychiatric Association) (239). b. Postpartum depression Major depressive disorder with postpartum onset is de- fined in DSM-IV-TR as a major depressive episode with onset within 4 weeks of delivery. However, the occurrence and course of major depressive disorder in childbearingwomen is heterogeneous, and definitions of postpartum depression may evolve with continued research (16, 776). In major depressive disorder with postpartum onset, anx- iety symptoms are more prevalent than in major depres- sive disorder occurring at other times (777). It is notuncommon for women with postpartum depression to experience obsessions and/or compulsions, and obses- sions may often involve thoughts of harming the baby,which must be differentiated from postpartum psychosis. Psychiatrists should provide psychoeducation about ma- jor depressive disorder to pregnant and postpartumwomen and their families to improve the detection of ma- jor depressive disorder during pregnancy and the postpar- tum period. Several other psychiatric conditions may follow child- birth (778). The transient 7- to 10-day depressive condi-tion referred to as \"postpartum blues\" is by definition toomild to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder and does not require medication. In addition to providing re- assurance, psychiatrists should encourage mothers whoexperience postpartum blues to increase psychosocial sup- port and obtain help with the care of the infant. Puerperal psychosis is a more severe disorder complicating one totwo of 1,000 births. Although postpartum psychosis is rare, women with this disorder may have homicidal im- pulses toward the newborn; for this reason, careful assess-ment of homicidal as well as suicidal ideation, intention, and plans is important. Postpartum psychosis must always be treated as a psychiatric emergency, with hospitalizationconsidered for the safety of the mother and baby (779). Many patients who have had episodes of this type ulti- mately prove to have bipolar disorder (780). The woman's parenting skills for both the newborn baby and any other children in her care must be carefullyassessed. Untreated maternal major depressive disorder,and specifically postpartum depression, have negative consequences for children, with adverse effects on attach- ment and child development (781, 782). Major depressivedisorder can seriously interfere with the new mother's abil-ity to provide physically and emotionally appropriate care for her baby and other children. The psychiatrist should work with the patient to develop a plan to manage this ef-fect, such as enlisting family members to assist with child care. Antidepressants are often prescribed for postpartum de- pression, according to the same principles delineated for other types of major depressive disorder, despite a limited number of controlled studies. T wo placebo-controlled tri-als of SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine) have been for the treatment of postpartum depression, with fluoxetine appearing more efficacious than placebo andparoxetine being comparable to placebo on primary out- come measures of depressive symptoms (783, 784). Wisner et al. (785) did not find a difference in response and remis- sion rates in a randomized controlled trial of sertraline ver- sus nortriptyline for postpartum major depressive disorder.Open studies of other antidepressants in postpartum women suggest efficacy, although some studies included only a small number of participants (786). Paroxetine aloneand paroxetine plus CBT both produced a significant change from baseline in one study, but there was no placebo-only group for comparison (787). Patients and clinicians are often concerned about the risks of possible exposure to antidepressants duringbreast-feeding. These risks, however, must be weighedagainst the well-known, and at times profound, risks to the woman and her children of untreated postpartumdepression. Mothers should be counseled regarding therelative risks and benefits when making these treatment decisions. Antidepressant medications are considered compatible with breast-feeding, but long-term data arenot available regarding risks and benefits. Although there have been some suspected case reports of adverse effects in breast-feeding infants exposed to maternal antidepres-sants, most studies show low levels of exposure via breast milk, with the exception of fluoxetine, which appears to have a dose-related risk for detectable levels in infant sera(788, 789). At this time, there are no studies which have determined a \"safe\" amount and duration of antidepres- sant exposure in the fetus and newborn. However, ex- posure to antidepressants via breast milk is considered substantially lower than in-utero exposure. Women who elect to breast-feed while taking antidepressants should besupported in doing so, given the widely known health benefits (e.g., immune system effects) to infants who are breast-fed. Similarly, women who elect to bottle-feedshould also be supported in this decision. Some women will not accept treatment with antidepressant medication while they are breast-feeding. Depression-focused psy-chotherapy can be recommended instead. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Family history Major depressive disorder is one and one-half to three times as common among those with a first-degree biolog- ical relative affected with the disorder as in the general population. In addition, the rates of depression, anxiety,and other disorders are increased more than two- to six- fold in the offspring of depressed parents. A family history of depression is associated with an earlier age at onset ofdepression (790), and children of depressed parents are more likely to have depression with a chronic and recur- rent course (791). Furthermore, a family history of recur-rent major depressive disorder increases the chances that the patient's own illness will be recurrent and that the pa- tient will not fully recover between episodes (792). A fam- ily history of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or acute psychosis probably incr eases the chances that the patient's own major depressive disorder is a manifestation of bipolar rather than unipolar depression, and that anti- depressant medication therapy may incite a switch tomania (793). Patients with such a family history should be questioned particularly closely regarding a prior history of mania or hypomania and should be carefully observedfor signs of a switch to mania during treatment with anti- depressant medication. There are no real predictors of response to individual antidepressants, yet in the absence of other informationclinicians sometimes rely on family history of therapeutic benefit to select a specific medication for a family mem-ber. Although it does not have specific support in the lit- erature, this practice appears reasonable. C. TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS OF CO- OCCURRING GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS In patients with co-occurring medical conditions, there is a higher prevalence of major depressive disorder than inthe general population. Furthermore, co-occurring med- ical conditions in patients with major depressive disorder are associated with poorer outcome (794, 795). A numberof medical conditions are known to cause mood symp- toms, such as stroke, hypoth yroidism, carcinoma of the pancreas, and many others. Apart from directly causing depressive symptoms, debilitating, painful, and chronic medical conditions often constitute an ongoing stressor that predisposes patients to depressive episodes. Never-theless, a depressive episode, in any context, is never a \"normal\" response to illness and consequently warrants treatment. In addition to the increased risk of major depressive disorder with general medical conditions, depressive epi-sodes increase the risk of certain general medical conditions,such as heart disease. (796). Due to the interrelationship between depression and medical illness, it is very impor- tant to recognize and treat depressive symptoms in med-ically ill patients, and vice versa. The psychiatrist should also attend to the potential for interactions between anti- depressants and the co-occurring medical conditions aswell as any nonpsychiatric me dications that the patient may be taking. 1. Hypertension The presence of treated or untreated hypertension may in-fluence the choice of an antidepressant, as a few antidepres-sant medications have been associated with increases in blood pressure. With SNRIs such as venlafaxine and dulox- etine, dose-dependent elevations in blood pressure are usually mild, although more severe hypertension has also been observed (166, 797). However, another study foundno increase in hypertension with duloxetine dosed up to 80 mg/day (798). Hypertension induced by SNRIs may re- spond to a decrease in the medication dose, or an alternativeantidepressant medication may be considered. Alterna- tively, for a patient with well-controlled depressive symp- toms, it may be preferable to add an antihypertensive agentrather than risk a depressive relapse or recurrence with medication tapering. Antihypertensive agents and antidepressant medica- tions may interact to either in tensify or counteract the ef- fect of the antihypertensive therapy (799). The action of antihypertensive agents that block alpha receptors (e.g., prazosin) may be intensified by antidepressant medica-tions that block these same receptors, notably the TCAs and trazodone. T ricyclic antidepressants may antagonizethe therapeutic pha-methyldopa. Concomitant antihypertensive treat- ment, diuretics, increases the TCAs, trazodone, or MAOIs will induce symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Side effects of antihypertensi ve agents, such as fatigue or sexual dysfunction, may also confound the evaluationand interpretation of depressive symptoms. It has also been thought that beta-blockers, especially propranolol,may account for depressive symptoms in some patients, but this association has been questioned (700, 701). 2. Cardiac disease Depression increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (800). In addition, patients who are depressed following amyocardial infarction have an increased rate of mortality, compared with patients without depression (801-803). Following an acute myocardial infarction, the decreasedsurvival rates of depressed patients may in part be due to Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Particularly in patients with a history of major depressive disorder (805), there isevidence that the depressive symptoms associated with cardiac illness respond to antidepressants (717, 806, 807).However, studies in which the attempt has been made toinfluence cardiac-related mortality through treatment of depression have shown mixed results (808-811). A depressed patient with a history of a cardiac problem should be monitored for the emergence of cardiac symp-toms, ECG changes, persistent tachycardia, or orthostatic blood pressure decrements. Consultation with the pa-tient's cardiologist before and during antidepressant med- ication treatment may be advisable, especially for patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Increases in heart rate and blood pressure may be associated with the use of agents with noradrenergic properties such asSNRIs and stimulants; thus, changes in heart rate and blood pressure should be assessed after treatment with these agents is instituted in patients with coronary artery dis-ease, hypertension, or congestive heart failure. Although TCAs have been used effectively to treat major depressive d is o r d e r i n p a t i e nt s w i t h s o m e f o r ms o f i s c h e m i c h e a r tdisease (812), psychiatrists should take particular care in using TCAs for patients with a history of ventricular ar- rhythmia, subclinical sinus node dysfunction, conductiondefects (including asymptomatic conduction defects), pro- longed QT intervals, or a rece nt history of myocardial in- farction (184, 185, 813-818). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs, and bupropion appear to be safer for patients with preexisting car diac disease; several SSRIs have been used safely in patients with cardiac disease in large clinical trials (807, 809, 810, 819). Electroconvulsive therapy can also be used safely in individuals with cardiac disease or arrhythmias, although specialist consultationand modifications in ECT technique or anesthesia may be indicated (239, 245, 820-822). Monamine oxidase inhibi- tors do not adversely rhythm,or contraction but may induce orthostatic hypotension and have risks relating to drug-food and drug-drug inter- actions. 3. Stroke Depression is observed in approximately one-third toone-half of individuals in the weeks to months following a stroke, with a substantial proportion developing major depressive disorder (334, 823, 824). Although conclusionsof meta-analyses are mixed (825, 826), some research suggests that antidepressant treatment immediately fol- lowing a stroke may reduce rates of depression (334) andpossibly mortality (827). Among psychotherapeutic ap-proaches to preventing depression after stroke, problem- solving therapy has been best studied, but findings are in- consistent (334, 825). When depression develops after a stroke, it has detri- mental effects on quality of life (823). In addition, thepresence of depression 1 month following a stroke hasbeen associated with an incr ease in subsequent mortality (828). Use of screening tools such as the PHQ-9 may helpto identify depressive episodes after stroke (829), and caremanagement may improve outcomes once poststroke de- pression is recognized (830). Psychotherapies have not been well studied as treatments for poststroke depression;however, a meta-analysis of randomized trials that have been conducted did not show efficacy (825). Findings on the therapeutic effects of an tidepressants in post-stroke depression have been mixed, perhaps due to the substan- tial heterogeneity of study populations and designs (831,832). Although a meta-analysis did not show any differ- ence in the rate of depressive remission with antidepres- sant treatments compared with placebo (832), patientsreceiving an antidepressant did show more improvement in depressive symptoms (831, 832) and a greater propor- tion were classified as treatment responders (831). Individ-ual randomized controlled trials have shown therapeutic benefits for several SSRIs, including fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram (833-836), an d for the TCA nortriptyline (837, 838); however, not all studies have shown benefit for some of these agents (837, 839-841). Nevertheless, for in- dividuals with poststroke depressive symptoms, a trial ofantidepressant therapy may be considered, with SSRIs being better tolerated and having fewer contraindications in this older and more medically ill population (842, 843).However, in individuals who are receiving concomitant treatment with anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin) or antiplatelet (e.g., dipyridamole, clopidogrel, aspirin) medications, it isimportant to consider the potential for an increased bleed- ing risk due to drug-drug interactions with antidepres- sants (844, 845). 4. Parkinson's disease Major depressive disorder occurs to some degree in 40%-50% of patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease experience alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems that may induce depression.There is no evidence favoring any particular antidepres- sant medication from the standpoint of therapeutic effi- cacy and safety for patients with Parkinson's diseasecomplicated by major depressive disorder (846). A meta- analysis of placebo-controlle d studies identified a clear benefit for both active treatment and placebo, but it did not find differences between them (847). Although SSRIs Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Bupropion, in contrast, exerts a beneficial effect on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in some patients but may also induce psychotic symptoms, perhaps because ofits agonistic action in the dopaminergic system (849). Noradrenergic agents and SNRIs may also be preferable to SSRIs. Nonselective MAOIs (e.g., tranylcypromine,phenelzine, isocarboxazid) may adversely interact with L- dopa products (850). Selegiline, also known as L-depre- nyl, is a selective type B MAOI recommended in the treat-ment of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline loses its specificity for MAO B in doses greater than 10 mg/day. As a result, it may induce serotonin syndrome when given in higher doses in conjunction with serotonin-enhancing antide- pressant medications. The theoretical benefits of the an-timuscarinic effects of some of the tricyclic agents in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder with Parkinson's disease are offset by the memory impairmentthat may result. Amoxapine, an antidepressant medication with dopamine-receptor-blocking properties, should beavoided for patients who have Parkinson's disease. Lith-ium may, in some instances, induce or exacerbate parkin- sonian symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy exerts a transient beneficial effect on the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease in many patients (851, 852); however, it might occasionally worsen L-dopa-induced dyskinesias and induce a transient interictal delirium (853), which ne- cessitates reductions in doses of dopamine agonist medi- cations (239). 5. Epilepsy The prevalence of depression in individuals with epilepsy appears to be increased in secondary and tertiary care cen-ter samples, although in population-based studies this in- crease is not well established (854). On the other hand, major depressive disorder significantly increases the riskof unprovoked seizures even after the adjustment of age, sex, length of medical follow-up, and medical therapies for depression (855). In addition, some antidepressantdrugs, such as TCAs and bupropion, lower the seizure threshold and have a dose-dependent epileptogenic po- tential. This seizure risk is intermediate for immediate-release formulations of bupropion, maprotiline, and TCAs (in particular, clomipramine) and low for sustained- release formulations of bupropion (17, 197, 856). Major depressive disorder in patients with seizure dis- orders can usually be safely and effectively managed ac-cording to the same principles outlined for patientswithout seizures. In particular, SSRIs and SNRIs are notlikely to increase the risk of developing seizures (856- 858). However, blood levels of TCAs may be increased by several antiepileptic drugs, increasing the side-effect bur-den of the anticholinergic and other side effects of tricy- clics (859). Some anticonvulsants appear useful for treatment and prophylaxis of mood disorders (e.g., carbamazepine, val-proate, lamotrigine). Thus, in patients with depression and epilepsy, consideration can be given to concomitant pre-scription of an anticonvulsant (or elevating the dose of an existing anticonvulsant). Nevertheless, anticonvulsant com-pounds may also have a negative effect on mood for somepatients (859). For example, barbiturates and possibly vi- gabatrin have been associated with an increased risk for depression (860). In addition, a recent FDA statement notedthat increased rates of depression and suicide risk may be associated with anticonvulsants (861). 6. Obesity Many individuals with major depressive disorder will beoverweight or obese, given the high prevalence of excess weight in the general population (862). In addition, rates of depression may be increased in obese individuals, par-ticularly among women and in those with a body mass in- dex (BMI) greater than 40 (863). Individuals with obesity resulting from binge eating disorder also have higher ratesof depression (170). In the subgroup of patients with atyp- ical depression, increased eating and weight gain are symptomatic of the depressive disorder (864). For otherpatients, the lack of motivati on and energy that occur with depression can make it difficult to maintain an exerciseregimen or nutritional dietary habits. In addition, treat-ment with many antidepressant medications appears to lead to weight gain (865) and also makes it more difficult to lose weight in a structured weight management program(866). In treating individuals with major depressive disorder who are overweight or obese, the effects of treatment onweight should be considered in selecting a therapeutic ap- proach. If pharmacotherapy is used, the selection of an an- tidepressant medication should include consideration ofits relative tendency to contribute to weight gain, which is generally greatest with mirtazapine, TCAs (tertiary TCAs more so than secondary TCAs), and MAOIs andless prominent with SSRIs and SNRIs (865). Bupropion is generally weight neutral and has been associated with modest weight reduction when used to treat major de-pressive disorder in obese adults (867, 868). Longitudinal monitoring of weight, either by direct measurement or patient report, can permit monitoring of BMI, as well asearly intervention if weight gain becomes a problem with Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Patients' concerns about weight gain may also contribute to poor adherence, and monitor- ing of weight can facilitate su ch discussions. The impact of weight on medication dosing should also be consid- ered. In one study, greater relative body weight was asso- ciated with a lesser likelihood of response to a fixed dosetrial of an antidepressant (869), perhaps suggesting a need for increases in medication dose with increasing body weight. Psychotherapeutic approaches to treatment avoid the potential for medication-induced weight gain and mayalso have modest benefits in weight management. Cogni-tive-behavioral therapy has shown efficacy in the treat- ment of binge eating disorder (170, 870) and could potentially be used in addressing obesity (871) and medi- cation-induced weight gain (872). The increasing use of surgical treatments for obesity also has implications for the treatment of patients withmajor depressive disorder. Depression is common among bariatric surgical candidates and, in and of itself, is not acontraindication for surgery (873-877). Long-term fol- low-up studies show improvements in co-occurring gen- eral medical conditions (878), as well as decreases indepressive symptoms and improved quality of life with weight loss (879-881). However, weight loss after surgery may be less pronounced in individuals with a lifetime di-agnosis of major depressive disorder (882) or in those with severe psychiatric illness that has required hospitalization (883). Close follow up is important following bariatricsurgery in order to assess for changes in psychiatric symp- toms, assist patients in the psychological and psychosocial adaptation to weight loss, and adjust medication regi-mens. Particularly following jejunoileal bypass or bilio- pancreatic diversion, but also following gastric bypass procedures, altered dissolution (884) and absorption ofmedication may require adjusting the dose of medication or changing from a slow-release to an immediate-release formulation (875). 7. Diabetes Diabetes mellitus is common in the general population, particularly in overweight or obese individuals (885). However, it is not clear whether an association exists be-tween diabetes and major depressive disorder, as meta- analyses and epidemiologic studies yield mixed results (886-888). Some patients may have reduced adherence todiet and medications when depressed (889), but there are inconsistent findings on whether successful treatment of depression (with medication, psychotherapy, and/or col-laborative care) improves glycemic control (889-896). How- ever, when initiating antidepressant therapy or makingsignificant dosing adjustments, it is useful to collaboratewith the patient's primary care physician in monitoring diabetic control because fluctuations in fasting blood glu-cose may occur. Some evidence suggests that use of TCAs may be associated with worsened glycemic control, and other antidepressants (such as SSRIs) may be preferable toTCAs for patients with diabetes (896, 897). 8. Sleep apnea The possible contribution of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)to depressive symptoms is an important consideration, par-ticularly in patients who are obese, report excessive daytime sleepiness, or have treatment-resistant depressive symp- toms. Symptoms such as fatigue and poor sleep quality can occur in sleep apnea as well as in major depressive disorder, requiring a careful assessment to distinguish whether eitheror both disorders are present. Underrecognition of OSA is common, and rates of OSA appear to be increasing with the increasing prevalence of obesity (898). Although the proto-typical sleep apnea patient is likely to be obese with a his- tory of snoring, sleep apnea may still be present even in the absence of these findings (899). Individuals with OSA orexcessive daytime sleepiness appear to have greater rates of depression than comparison groups (900-902), although the rates of depressive symptoms and major depressive disor-der diagnosis fluctuate across studies (903). In addition, ep- idemiological findings suggest an increasing likelihood of depression with increasing sleep-related breathing disorderseverity (904). With initiation of continuous positive airway pressure treatment, improvement in OSA symptoms has been associated with decreased depressive symptoms (905,906), in addition to reductions in OSA-associated health risks (898). Consequently, recognition and treatment of OSA is important among individuals with major depressivedisorder. Identification of OSA is also important to treat- ment planning, as use of sedating medications can exacer- bate OSA and worsen daytime sleepiness, with associatedcomplications (907). 9. Human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C infections According to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention, more than one million individuals in the UnitedStates were living with HIV infection by the end of 2003 (908), with increased rates among individuals with psychi- atric disorders, including substance use disorders (909).Estimates suggest that at least one-fifth of infected indi- viduals have unrecognized infection (910), necessitating increased efforts to identify HIV infection (911), giventhe availability of effective treatment (912). Consequently, clinicians treating patients with major depressive disorder should consider screening for HIV . Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

When treating major depressive dis-order in patients who also have HIV , antidepressant medications can be used safely and effectively (914, 915), although high placebo response rates and high study attri-tion rates have sometimes confounded interpretation of re- search findings (916, 917). When antidepressants are used, SSRIs are better tolerated than TCAs (918, 919). In indi-viduals who are receiving treatment with antiretroviral agents, it is important to check for potential drug-drug in- teractions when choosing a medication regimen (920). Sig-nificant interactions can also oc cur if St. John's wort is taken by patients receiving antiretroviral medications. Althoughfew studies have been conducted in patients who meet di- agnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, individual and group psychotherapies using interpersonal, cognitive-behavioral, and psychoeducational approaches have also been associated with reductions in depressive symptoms among patients with HIV infection (316, 921-926). Persons with mental illness also have elevated rates of infection with hepatitis C (927), and infection with hepati-tis C is commonly present in individuals with HIV infec-tion (928). Among individuals with hepatitis C, depressive symptoms are common, and many patients fully meet the criteria for major depressive disorder (929). T reatment ofhepatitis C with interferon appears to be associated with a further increase in the risk for depression, although find- ings vary depending upon the study population, concomi-tant medications (e.g., ribavirin), and the type of interferon used for therapy (930, 931). The increase in depressive symptoms with interferon treatment may also be moreprominent in patients with greater levels of pretreatment depression (932). This suggests a need for careful monitor- ing if patients with current major depressive disorder areadministered interferon, particularly since many patients treated with interferon have unrecognized or insufficiently treated depression (933). Studies in which antidepressantmedications were administered concomitantly with inter- feron have shown inconsistent prophylactic effects (934, 935). However, antidepressant therapy does seem to be ef-fective when used to treat depression that develops in the course of interferon therapy for hepatitis C infection (936, 937). Consequently, major depressive disorder should notbe viewed as a contraindication to the treatment of hepatitis C infection, particularly given the severe long-term hepatic complications associated wi th chronic infection (938). 10. Pain syndromes Pain syndromes and major depressive disorder frequentlyco-occur. Although the reported prevalence of pain among depressed patients varies with cultural differencesand study design, one-half to two-thirds of depressed in-dividuals will typically note some type of pain (702, 939- 941). Conversely, in primary care settings, individualswith pain symptoms are about twice as likely to be de- pressed as those without pain, and the rates of depression are further increased if pain is chronic or involves multipletypes of pain (940, 942). It is important to note that indi- viduals with co-occurring pain and depression tend to have worse treatment outcomes and poorer overall func-tioning than those with either condition alone (940, 942- 944). Consequently, every patient with depression should be assessed for the presence, nature, location, and severityof pain complaints. Overall, antidepressant treatment has been associated with reductions in pain symptoms among individuals with psychogenic or somatoform pain disorders (945). How- ever, among trials of second-generation inindividuals and depression, and paroxetine seem to be of compara- ble but relatively minor benefit (939, 946, 947). Neuropathic pain is commonly associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy but may also have other etiologiessuch as postherpetic neuralgia. For neuropathic pain ingeneral, evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of TCAs or SNRIs (948, 949). Of the antidepressant medica- tions, TCAs have been found to be most effective in de-creasing pain associated with both postherpetic neuralgia (950, 951) and diabetic neuropathy (949, 952) but have no apparent effect on HIV-associated neuropathic pain (949).Given the greater tolerability of SNRI antidepressants, these agents may sometimes be chosen before a TCA for a patient with co-occurring depression and neuropathic pain.In addition, if a TCA is used, therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful, given the wide variability of TCA blood levels across individuals (953). Similar effects have been found for the use of antide- pressants to prevent migraine and tension-type headaches.In patients with and without co-occurring depression,TCAs show greater efficacy than SSRIs (954, 955), but SNRIs also have some evidence for efficacy (956, 957). In individuals with tension-type headaches, addition of stressmanagement therapy may augment the effects of TCA treatment (958). Antidepressant treatment is also recommended for in- dividuals with fibromyalgia, as it is associated with reduc-tions in pain and often leads to improvements in function, with the best evidence available for amitriptyline (959).Beneficial effects are observed in those with or without co-occurring major depressive disorder (960-962). Al- though evidence from controlled trials is more limited fornonpharmacological approaches than for antidepressant treatment, education, exercise, and CBT are generally rec- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, antidepressant medications also appear to be effective in reducing pain aswell as treating depressive symptoms (965-967). Evidence for psychosocial treatment is less consistent, with mind-fulness meditation and emotion regulation therapy being associated with reduced pain and enhanced coping in in- dividuals with rheumatoid arthritis and depression (968),but CBT having mixed results (966, 968). In individuals with co-occurring depression and osteoarthritis, collabo- rative depression care has been associated with reducedpain severity, improved function, and enhanced quality of life in those with low pain scores at baseline but had no ef- fect when compared with usual treatment in those with severe arthritis pain (969, 970). For individuals with chroni c low back pain, there are conflicting opinions about the utility of antidepressantmedications in reducing pain or improving function, even in the presence of co-occurring depression (971, 972).Nevertheless, antidepressant medications may still be in- dicated to treat depression on the basis of individual cir- cumstances. Since depressed patients with concurrent pain are of- ten treated by primary care physicians and other medicalspecialists with a variety of potent analgesic medications,including narcotics, psychiatrists treating such patients are advised to be in contact with these other physicians initially and on a regular ongoing basis as indicated. Thepurposes of such contacts are to review the entire treat- ment plan, to assure that all prescribing physicians are aware of the full extent of pharmacological interventions,to coordinate specific prescribing areas and responsibili-ties so that patients do not receive prescriptions for the same medications or have their doses for given medica- tions adjusted by several different prescribing clinicians,and to set up a mechanism and plan whereby all prescrib- ing clinicians consistently keep one another informed about changes in their treatment plans and prescriptions. 11. Obstructive uropathy Enlarged prostate size and other causes of bladder outletobstruction are relative contraindications to the use of an- tidepressant medication com pounds with antimuscarinic effects. For this reason, tertiary amine TCAs are best avoided in these patients. Benzodiazepines, trazodone, and MAOIs may also retard bladder emptying. The anti- depressant medications with the least propensity to do this are SSRIs, SNRIs, and bupropion. If a TCA is chosen, the secondary amine desipramine is the least likely tocause urinary hesitancy or retention. 12. Glaucoma Medications with anticholiner potency may precipitate acute narrow-angle glaucoma in susceptible individuals(i.e., those with shallow ante rior chambers) (973). Patients with glaucoma receiving local miotic therapy may be treated with antidepressant medications, including those possessing anticholinergic properties, provided that theirintraocular pressure is monitored during antidepressant medication treatment. Prescription of agents lacking anticholinergic activity avoids this risk. Other agentssometimes used in psychiatry, e.g., topiramate and related sulfa-based medications, may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by ciliary body edema, a different mechanism(974).

It is important to note that these symptoms must represent a change from the in dividual's usual self and cause clinically significant distress or impairment. In addition, they cannot be attributable to bereavement or another dis- order, including a substance-induced condition or a generalmedical condition. In some individuals, hallucinations or delusions may occur in the context of a major depressive ep- isode, in which case the episode would be specified as \"Se-vere With Psychotic Features.\" When psychotic features are present, they may either be mood congruent (typically involving themes such as guilt, punishment, personal inad- equacy, or disease) or mood incongruent. Although not a part of the DSM-IV-TR criteria, anxiety and somatic symp-toms (particularly muscular, respiratory, and genitourinary) can also be seen in the context of major depressive disorder (975). Episodes of major depression may also be distin-guishable by their longitudinal course (e.g., chronic if symptoms are present for at least 2 years, postpartum onset if symptoms occur within 4 weeks postpartum, seasonal pat-tern if the timing of episodes is regularly associated with a specific time of year) (16) and characteristic subsets of epi- sode features (T able 12). B. EPIDEMIOLOGY Information on the current prevalence of major depres-sive disorder comes from two large community surveys,the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) study (976) and the National Epidemiologic Survey of Al- coholism and Related Conditions (NESARC) (655). Inthe NCS-R, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder among the 9,090 adult participants was 16.2%, with a 12-month prevalence of 6.6%. The NESARC, whichincluded more than 43,000 adults found slightly lower prevalence rates than the NCS-R (13.25% lifetime and 5.28% 12-month), perhaps because the sample includedpreviously omitted groups of individuals with lower prev- alence rates (655). A number of sociodemographic factors appears to be associated with an increased prevalence ofmajor depressive disorder, including female sex, being middle-aged, being never or previously married, having a low income, being unemployed, or being disabled (655,976), In the NESARC, being Native American increased risk relative to being Caucasian, whereas being Asian, Hispanic, or black decreased risk (655). The impact of major depressive disorders on individu- als and their families is substantial. Virtually all individualsin the NCS-R who had a major depressive episode in thepreceding 12-month period experienced significant levels of symptom severity as assessed by an independent rating scale (976). For more than 50% of individuals, symptomswere rated at severe or very severe (976) and were associ- ated with substantial role impairment (977). Major depressive disorder rarely occurs in isolation; anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, personality dis-orders, and impulse control disorders commonly co-occur with major depressive disorder in community samples (655,976) as well as in individuals in psychiatric treatment (978). In the NCS-R, major depressive disorder was found to co- occur with at least one other DSM-IV disorder in two-thirds of those surveyed (976), but from a temporal stand- point major depressive disorder was the primary diagnosis in only about 12% of these individuals (976). In contrast, in a study of patients in psychiatric treatment in the United States, 84% of major depressive disorder patients had atleast one co-occurring condition: 61% had a co-occurring Axis I condition, 30% a co-occurring Axis II condition, and 58% a co-occurring Axis III condition (978). Anxiety disor-ders were the most common co-occurring disorder in the prior 12 months in both the NCS-R (57.5% of the sample) (976) and the NESARC (36.1% of the sample) (655). Ofthe anxiety disorders, the greatest association was seen with generalized anxiety disorder and the weakest association with specific phobia (655). Substance use disorders in thepreceding 12-month period were less common in the NCS-R (8.5%) (976) than in the NESARC, in which 14.1% of the individuals with major depressive disorderhad an alcohol use disorder, 26.0% had nicotine depen- dence, and 4.6% had another substance use disorder (655). Personality disorders were present in 37.9% of individualswith major depressive disorder in the NESARC (655). Ob- sessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and avoidant per- sonality were most common among subjects withmajor depressive disorder; avoidant, dependent, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders had greater odds ratios for association with major depressive disorder than otherpersonality disorders (655). T reatment of major depressive disorder does not always occur and may be delayed. The average time to treatmentin the NESARC was approximately 3 years, and only about 60% of the sample with major depressive disorder received treatment (655). The NCS-R also evaluated history andadequacy of treatment for major depressive disorder (976). Of respondents who reported having had a major depres- sive episode in the last year, just more than one-half had re-ceived treatment but less than one-half of these individuals (about one-fifth of the total) received adequate treatment(976). These findings highlight the need for changes in thedelivery of mental health services to enhance the timeliness and quality of care for major depressive disorder.

NATURAL HISTORY AND COURSE The age at onset of major depr essive disorder varies widely, although the average age at onset is the late 20s. Although the onset of the first episode is rarely before puberty, the dis- order may begin at any age (655, 976). Symptoms of major depressive disorder typically develop over days to weeks.Prodromal symptoms, including generalized anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, or depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic threshold may occur over the preceding sev-eral months. In some individuals, however, major depressive disorder may develop suddenly, as in the wake of severe psy- chosocial stress. The duration of a major depressive episode also varies. The mean duration of a major depressive episode was 16 weeks in the NCS-R (976), with a median duration forthe longest depressive episode of 24.3 weeks in the NESARC (655). In treated patients, the median time to recovery from amajor depressive episode is approximately 20 weeks (979).Untreated, episodes typically last 6 months or longer. Some patients with major depressive disorder eventually have a manic or hypomanic episode, and they will then receive anew diagnosis of bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder. 1. Recurrence Major depressive disorder is unremitting in 15% of patients and recurrent in 35%. About half of those with a first-on- set episode recover and have no further episodes (502).After three episodes, the risk of recurrence approaches 100% in the absence of prophylactic treatment. Individu- als with major depressive di sorder superimposed on dys- thymic disorder carry a greater risk for having recurrent episodes of major depressive disorder than those without dysthymic disorder (410). When major depressive disor-der is recurrent, its course varies. Some people have epi- sodes separated by many years of normal functioning, others have clusters of episodes, and still others have in-creasingly frequent episodes as they age. 2. Interepisode status Functioning usually returns to the premorbid level betweenepisodes. However, 20%-35% of patients have persistent residual symptoms and social or occupational impairment. Patients who continue to have depressive symptoms but fallbelow the diagnostic threshold for major depressive disor- der are considered to be in partial remission. Residual de- pressive symptoms increase the risk of relapse. Anxiety andsomatic symptoms are particularly prominent residual symptoms of major depressive disorder (980). 3. Complications and prognosis Major depressive disorder adversely affects the patient and others. The most serious complication of a major depres-sive episode is suicide (including suicide/homicide). Major depressive disorder is also associated with significant med- ical comorbidity and complicates recovery from other medical illnesses, such as myocardial infarction (see Section III.C.1). Beyond its impact on the patient alone, major de-pressive disorder also affects th e patient's marital, parental, social, and vocational functioning (981). The disorder, es-pecially when recurrent or chronic, may distress other in-dividuals in the patient's social network, e.g., children, spouse, and significant others. If the patient is a parent, the disorder may affect his or her ability to fulfill parental roleexpectations (982) and increase the likelihood of children becoming depressed as well (see Section III.B.5). Major de- pressive episodes are associated with occupational dysfunc-tion, including unemployment, absenteeism, and decreased work productivity (977, 983). In fact, in terms of the level of disability for the population as a whole, major depressivedisorder was second only to chronic back and neck pain in disability days per year (977). The prognosis for major depressive disorder depends on many factors, such as treatment status, availability of sup-ports, chronicity of symptoms, and the presence of co-oc- curring medical and psychiatric conditions. With treatment,however, the prognosis is generally good (984). Most pa- tients will respond to acute treatment, and continuation and maintenance treatment with acutely active treatments hasbeen shown to lower the risk and severity of relapse. V. REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE T ranslating the product of science into a decision about asingle human patient raises the concept of epistemology:how we know what we think we know and how certain we can be about that knowledge. Like all guidelines, this one is an attempt to distill clinical research into recommenda-tions that will be clinically applicable to the unique indi-vidual who presents for treatment. Science can neverprovide all of the answers that a doctor or patient wishesand, at times, the knowledge base may consist primarily of accumulated wisdom from clinical experience. In addi- tion, every scientific protocol reflects a series of compro-mises, and each compromise may restrict internal and/or Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

No one study, with its inevitable limit s, can reveal \"truth.\" The wise scientist\u2014and physician\u2014demands replication. When multiple trials, with different methods, come to similar conclusions, the clinician can be reasonably confident in the results. Many aspects of the design of research studies can influ- ence the interpretation of the data and their implication forclinical practice. When translating efficacy evidence toclinical practice, it is important to assess the adequacy of the sample size (given modest effect sizes of antidepres- sant treatments), the nature and validity of the controlcondition, the length of the treatment trial, the nature of the participant population, the type and reliability of the outcome measure, and publication bias (in favor of posi-tive trials) (74, 985, 986). Some issues also exist that are specific to pharmaco- therapy trials. First, it is important to consider whetherand what type of comparison group was used (e.g., pla- cebo or active agent). In trials of antidepressant medica-tion treatments, high placebo response rates could make detection of true treatment effects difficult in well- controlled trials, as well as explain observed treatment ef-fects in trials with less robust controls. It is also important to consider whether trials were blinded and, if so, whether medication side effects could reveal the identity of activeagents. Issues related to the outcomes measured in trials are important as well. A variety of different outcome mea- sures are employed, and a report of \"efficacy\" could referto symptom reduction (e.g., reduction in the frequency or severity of major depressive disorder symptoms), re- sponse (e.g., reduction in major depressive disorder symp-toms below a threshold), or prevention of relapse. Despite the fact that a 2006 American College of Neuropsycho- pharmacology task force report (408) emphasized the need to aim for remission as a primary goal, studies may not bedesigned and powered statistically to assess remission as a primary outcome. Until recently most research studieshave reported response rates, often defined as a reduction by 50% in the measured severity of depression. In addi- tion, data often come from short-term (6- to 12-week)efficacy trials that cannot show whether treatments are ef- fective over the medium- and long-term. There has also been recent concern that the apparent effect size of anti-depressants has been exaggerated, due to the lack of re- porting or selective publication of negative clinical trial data (74, 75). A national database of clinical trial data(http://clinicaltrials.gov/) is being expanded in an effort to make these data available and transparent (987). However, most meta-analyses were published prior to this initiative,and previously conducted studies will not be subject to the provisions of recent regulations (988).Evaluating the efficacy of psychotherapeutic ap- proaches for major depressive disorder can also be chal- lenging. Although there have been a number of well-designed trials of CBT and IPT in large samples, for some other types of psychotherapy, few or no clinical trials have been conducted. In studies evaluating psychotherapyagainst a variety of control conditions such as waiting lists, other forms of psychotherapy, medications, placebos, or a no-control group, it is difficult to make comparisons of theobserved treatment effect sizes among trials. Some trials have not examined the effects of psychotherapy exclusively among patients with major depressive disorder and maynot have specifically assessed improvement in major de- pressive disorder as an outcome. In other trials, the nature of the psychotherapeutic inte rvention has been insuffi- ciently described, making it difficult to apply the studyfindings to psychotherapeutic approaches used in practice. In evaluating the impact of a particular intervention, several statistical concepts are helpful to understand. If onestarts with the assumption that the treatment group and thecontrol group are equivalent (i.e., no effect of treatment), the p value indicates the probability that the treatment group will show an outcome that is equal to or more extremethan the observed treatment outcome (989). Although spe- cific values of p (e.g., 0.05) are commonly considered to be statistically significant, the p value does not address thepossibility, known as a type II error, that the treatment group and control group will have similar outcomes even though the treatment is actually effective. This possibilitycan be reduced, to some extent, by using sufficiently sized research samples, which should be calculated as part of the study design (i.e., power analysis). Because these conceptsare difficult to grasp and provide limited information about the clinical importance of an observed impact of treatment, several other measures are often used. One approach to in-dicating the benefit of a treatment relative to a control con- dition is the number needed to treat (NNT), which is the number of individuals who would have to be treated to pre-vent one negative outcome (or benefit one patient) (990). When applied to adverse effects, such a measure is termed the number needed to harm (NNH). The effect size is ameasure of the magnitude of the difference between the treatment group and the control group, which also consid- ers the variability of the measurements. When the statisticCohen's d is used to measure the size of a treatment effect, a general rule-of-thumb is that d=0.2 represents a small ef- fect, d=0.5 represents a medium effect, and d=0.8 (orgreater) represents a large effect of the intervention (991). In addition to being used in describing the results of indi- vidual studies, effect sizes are also used in comparing andsynthesizing the results of multiple clinical trials through meta-analyses.

ACUTE PHASE SOMATIC TREATMENTS 1. Antidepressant medications a. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Many studies and meta-analyses have compared SSRIs among themselves as well as with other classes of anti- depressants. Differences in efficacy and tolerability be- tween SSRIs and TCAs, assessed through a meta-analysis of 102 studies (85), found no overall difference in efficacybetween TCAs and SSRIs. However, TCAs appeared more efficacious in inpatients (p=0.012), and amitripty- line was more effective than SSRI comparators (p=0.012), although publication bias could not be excluded. By con- trast, SSRIs as a class (p <0.01) and, more (p=0.001), (p <0.05), and citalopram (p <0.01) had a significantly lower rate of dropouts for side effects. Other meta-analyses have com-pared the SSRIs among themselves and with other newer antidepressant agents. Cipriani and colleagues (96) per- formed a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which encom-passed 117 randomized controlled trials and 25,928 subjects. Incorporating efficacy and treatment discontinuation, they found the greatest degree of overall acceptability withescitalopram and sertraline, with greatest efficacy for mirtazapine, escitalopram, par-oxetine, and reboxetine. Gartlehner and colleagues (95) also compared the benefits and side effects of second- generation antidepressants including SSRIs using 6 good-or fair-quality of atleast 6 weeks' duration to assess efficacy and 35 observational studies with at least 100 participants and follow-up of at least 12 weeks to assess harms. Although the side effectprofiles and onset of action differed among the antide- pressants, no differences in efficacy or effectiveness were found. A systematic review of 28 randomized studies (89) showed that, even in anxious depression, SSRIs (fluoxetine, parox-etine, citalopram, sertraline, and escitalopram) mirtazapine, imipramine, nefaz- odone, and venlafaxine), both and anxiety parameters. When compared with venlafaxine, fluoxetinewas less effective both in depression and anxiety scores, while paroxetine was less effective in anxiety scores only.No differences were found between venlafaxine and the other SSRIs. A Cochrane meta-analysis (84) that included 132 ran- domized studies (almost all double blind) did not find sig-nificant differences in fluoxetine efficacy versus TCAs.When fluoxetine was compared with newer antidepres- sants, venlafaxine was superior, and within the class of SSRIs, sertraline was significantly superior. However, flu- oxetine was significantly better tolerated than TCAs as aclass and, more specifically, was better tolerated than ami- triptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, and imipramine; no differences were noted in comparison with all of the othermedications. Similar meta-analyses compared sertraline(126) and escitalopram (992) to other antidepressive agents. Although differences were small, there was a trend for ser- traline to be more acceptable and efficacious than compar-ator antidepressants, including TCAs, SSRIs, and several newer antidepressants (126). Escitalopram was found to be more efficacious than citalopr am and fluoxetine in terms of response and remission of depressive symptoms and was as-sociated with lower rates of treatment discontinuation thansubjects receiving duloxetine (992). Another meta-analysis of 21 studies (98) compared ef- ficacy and tolerability of each SSRI (except escitalopram)against the SSRI class overall and showed no difference in efficacy among the drugs. Ra tes of dropout due to side effects were significantly lower in patients treated with sertraline (p <0.05) and significantly higher in patients treated with fluvoxamine (p< 0.01), although the dropout rate in fluvoxamine-treated patients appeared to vary withmedication dose. In this meta-analysis, side effects and discontinuation reactions were observed more often with paroxetine than with other SSRIs. Interaction with otherdrugs was higher with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, etine sertraline and citalopram, citalo- pram was overrepresented in deaths due to overdose. A systematic review based on 18 randomized, double- blind trials (94), which compared escitalopram with either citalopram, venlafaxine, paroxetine, sertraline, or bupro-pion, found no differences in efficacy between escitalopram and the other medications (except for the comparison with citalopram, which showed a significant difference intwo of four studies). Rates of study withdrawal due to side effects were lower with esci talopram than with venlafax- ine (p <0.05) or paroxetine (p <0.05). Another meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials studied the efficacy and tolera bility of antidepressants in people older than age 55 years (704). This study found that there was no difference in efficacy between TCAs and SSRIs, but SSRIs were better tolerated. Compared with patients who were taking TCAs, patients who were takingSSRIs were less likely to withdraw from the study overall or because of side effects, in particular. The qualitative analysis of side effects showed a small increase in gas-trointestinal and neuropsychiatric side effects associated with TCAs. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors also appear to have comparable effi- cacy to other non-TCA antidepressants, although ven-lafaxine shows superior efficacy in some studies, and comparisons of SSRIs and MAOIs have not been done. In terms of tolerability, SSRIs show consistently fewer drop-outs in clinical trials than TCAs, and side effects are also reported less often with SSRIs. There also do not seem to be significant differences in efficacy among the SSRIs.Fluvoxamine appears to have more side effects and more problems with drug interactions than the other SSRIs; drug interactions are also more problematic with fluoxe- tine and paroxetine venlafaxine, and duloxetine, which are classified as SNRIs, and mirtazapine, which (although not an SNRI) also enhances both serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission, has been demon-strated in placebo-controlled studies of depressed patients (101, 102, 105, 113, 993, 994, 995). A number of studies have contrasted these \"dual-action\" antidepressants withthe SSRIs. Although most individual studies have not found statistically significant differences (see, for exam- ple, references 226 and 421), meta-analyses of controlledstudies of venlafaxine (101, 104, 996, 997), duloxetine (102), and mirtazapine (113) using SSRIs as comparators have generally documented small (i.e., 4%-10%) albeit reliable differences in the likelihood of response or re- mission favoring the dual-actio n drugs. Papakostas et al. (995) similarly found an average difference of 4% in re- sponse/remission rates in a meta-analysis of a broader grouping of antidepressant drugs that affect norepineph- rine and serotonin. These average effects are generallybelow the magnitude of difference that is widely consid- ered to be clinically significan t. It is possible that a small average difference in an overall pool of patients may ob- scure larger and more meaningful differences among selected subgroups of depressed patients (e.g., more se- verely depressed patients [102], inpatients [561], or post-menopausal women [998]), but this suggestion has yet to be confirmed by analyses of larger data sets. At present, the efficacy of desvenlafaxine has only been establishedversus placebo (993, 994); there are not yet any published studies assessing its benefits relative to other antide- pressants. Nevertheless, as the principal active metaboliteof venlafaxine, it is likely to have a comparable efficacy profile.Perahia et al. (999) conducted a randomized controlled trial of duloxetine versus paroxetine and placebo in an outpatient setting in patients who met the criteria formajor depressive disorder. After 8 weeks, duloxetine at 80 mg/day (N=93) and at 120 mg/day (N=103) was found to be superior to placebo (N=99). However, paroxetinewas not superior to placebo in this study. Perahia et al. also conducted a relapse prevention study (1000), in which pa- tients were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine orplacebo for 26 weeks after a 12-week open-label treat- ment phase. The 136 patients who received duloxetine had a relapse rate of 23%, compared with the 39% relapserate among the 142 patients who received placebo (p0.005). A large cohort study by Raskin et al. (1001) followed 1,279 patients in 52 treatment centers taking80-120 mg/day of duloxetine over 52 weeks. Patients were assessed by multiple instruments at 6, 28, and 52weeks. At 6 weeks, 50.8% achieved a score of <8 on the HAM-D. The rate of response increased to 75.6% at week28 and 81.7% at week 52, with no safety concerns identi-fied in the course of the study. Venlafaxine extended release (XR) has also been ex- tensively studied. Rudolph and Feiger (1002) conductedan 8-week outpatient trial of venlafaxine XR compared with fluoxetine and placebo. In this trial, 100 patients re- XR (75-225 mg/day), 193 received flu-oxetine (20-60 mg/day), 98 received placebo. Remission rates, determined by an HRSD score of <8, were 37% in the venlafaxine XR arm, 22% in the fluoxetine arm, and 18% in the placebo arm. Sauer et al. (1003) compared 76 patients who received venlafaxine XR (75- 150 with 75 patients who mg/day). Venlafaxine XR yielded response rates of 39.5%, 41.7% for amitriptyline. Saiz- Ruiz et al. (1004) followed 59 patients receiving venlafax-ine over 6 months. Seventy percent of these patients com- pleted the study, and the response rate, determined by a 50% reduction in the HRSD score, was 81%. In anothercohort study, Mitchell et al. (1005) found response rates at 8 weeks to be 52.6%, measured by the MADRS, among 312 patients with treatment-resistant illness taking venla-faxine in an open-label trial. Response rates at 10 months as measured by the MADRS increased to 73% in 149 pa- tients who continued treatment in an extension phase ofthe study (1006). Fewer studies have been conducted with desvenlafax- ine; however, meta-analysis shows that it also is efficaciousin the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (99). In the nine randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled 8-week long trials with desvenlafaxine, there were1,342 subjects in fixed dose study arms (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day), 463 subjects in flexible dose study arms Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Desvenlafaxine showed greater efficacy than pla- cebo in rates of response as well as remission, with nogreater benefit (and greater discontinuation rates) at doses greater than 50 mg daily. Overall rates of treatment dis- continuation due to adverse effects were 3% for placeboand 12% for desvenlafaxine (168). T reatment emergent adverse effects included transient nausea and erectile dys- function in men. Mean blood pressure was statistically in-creased in the desvenlafaxine group, but this change was clinically significant in only 2% of desvenlafaxine sub- jects, compared with 1% of the placebo group. c. Other antidepressant medications 1. Bupropion Meta-analyses of controlled trials have shown that bupro- pion is superior to placebo and is generally comparable in efficacy to both TCAs and SSRIs (105, 169, 1007). Allthree formulations of bupropion are superior to placebo (106), and early studies with the immediate-release for- mulation found it to be ge nerally comparable in efficacy to the TCAs (105, 1008-1011). The newer sustained- release and extended-release formulations have been pri- marily compared with the SSRIs, and meta-analyses haveestablished comparable efficacy (169, 1012). Several studies have compared bupropion sustained re- lease (SR) to SSRIs and placebo. A randomized controlledtrial by Croft et al. (1013) compared bupropion SR to ser- traline and placebo over 8 weeks of treatment and found both drugs to have efficacy superior to placebo. Bupro-pion SR had a lower rate of sexual dysfunction than ser- traline. These findings were confirmed in a 16-week studythat again compared bupropi on SR with sertraline and placebo (1014). Another 8-week study found bupropion SR, but not sertraline, to be superior to placebo and again documented lower rates of sexual dysfunction with bupro-pion SR than sertraline (1015). Similar results were found when bupropion SR was compared with other SSRIs. One study comparing bupropion SR with paroxetine foundequivalent efficacy (1016). In another trial, with approxi- mately 150 patients in each arm, bupropion had similar efficacy to fluoxetine with a significantly lower burden of side effects (1017). Lower rates of sexual dysfunction have also been found with bupropion compared with sertraline (1013-1015) or paroxetine (1016). A survey of 6,297 pa-tients in primary care settings found the incidence of sexual dysfunction with bupropion to be 22%-25%. This inci- dence was comparable to the incidence with nefazodone(28%) but lower than that with SSRIs and venlafaxine (36%-43%) (1018). Several small studies have examinedwhether bupropion might serve as a potential treatmentfor SSRI-induced sexual side effects, with varying results (132, 1019, 1020). Bupropion has also been studied as a treatment for anx- iety associated with major depressive disorder. In onelarge trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive bu- propion SR (N=234), sertraline (N=225), or placebo(N=233). Patients treated with bupropion SR or sertraline experienced significantly greater relief from anxiety symp- toms than those who receiv ed placebo. Compared with sertraline, bupropion appeared to be associated with sim- ilar relief of anxiety in patients with major depressive dis- order (1021). Bupropion has also been shown to reduce the risk of re- lapse following successful antidepressant treatment withbupropion. In a 44-week double-blind trial of bupropion responders (1022), patients were randomly assigned to con- tinue taking bupropion or change to placebo. Continuedtreatment with bupropion after acute phase response re- duced the risk of relapse, compared with placebo, with few differences in side effects reported between the two groups. 2. Mirtazapine The efficacy of mirtazapine has been established in pla- 1026), and in meta-analyses of it TCAs (1027-1029) and SSRIs (1030). Quitkin et al. (1030) analyzed three studies com-paring patients with major depressive disorder treated with mirtazapine (N=289) to patients treated with fluoxe- tine or Although mirtazapine andSSRIs had similar efficacy over 6-8 weeks, a greater pro- portion of patients had onset of therapeutic benefit at week 1 with mirtazapine as compared with an SSRI (13%versus 6%). In a meta-analysis by Watanabe et al. (1031), mirtazapine was superior to SSRIs in response and remis- sion rates at 2 weeks (12 trials), although it was compara-ble to SSRIs at the end of treatment (6-12 weeks). In a subgroup analysis, mirtazapine produced greater response than paroxetine (three trials) and venlafaxine (two trials).At 2 weeks as well as at the end of 6-12 weeks' treatment (8 trials used to obtain outcomes), mirtazapine had com- parable efficacy to TCAs. A meta-analysis of six studies(1027) found mirtazapine to have comparable efficacy to amitriptyline over 6-8 weeks, with both drugs showing superiority to placebo. Several randomized controlled trials have compared mirtazapine to SSRIs. Benkert et al. (1032) randomly as-signed patients with major disorder to treat-ment with mirtazapine (N=127) or paroxetine (N=123) over 6 weeks, and Wade et al. (1033) randomly assigned 197 primary care patients with HAM-D scores of at least 18 to mirtazapine (N=99) or paroxetine (N=98) over Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In both studies, the treatments had equal efficacy at study endpoint, but mirtazapine demon- strated a different profile of side effects. Another trial ran-domly assigned elderly depressed patients (at least age 65 years) to mirtazapine (N=126) or paroxetine (N=120) over 8 weeks (1034). Compared with paroxetine, mirtaza-pine showed a greater benefit at day 14, had less attrition for side effects, and was significantly more effective in im- proving sleep. It was also more effective in reducingHAM-D scores by the study endpoint, although response and remission rates were not significantly different. T wo randomized trials, one 8 weeks long (N=299) (1035) andthe other a 6-week study (N=132) in Chinese patients, have compared treatment with mirtazapine to fluoxetine and found no differences in overall efficacy, although the onset of improvement and side effect profiles differed aswith paroxetine. A similar pattern of outcomes was alsoobserved when mirtazapine was compared with citalopram (N=270) in an 8-week trial (1036) and when an oral disin- tegrating form of mirtazapine was compared with sertra-line (N=345) in another 8-week trial (1037). Mirtazapine has also been compared with venlafaxine (both immediate release [IR] and extended release [XR]forms) in randomized controlled trials. In an 8-week trial, Guelfi et al. (1025) followed patients with major depres- sive disorder (HAM-D scores of at and venlafaxine IR (N=79). Mirtazapine and venlafaxine did not differ significantly in depression outcomes, although sleep was better with mirtazapine, and significantly more patients taking venlafaxine IR (15%) dropped out due to side effects, compared with patients taking mirtazapine (5%). A similar 8-week trial (1026)found no significant differences in final outcome or toler- ability between venlafaxine XR and mirtazapine, although mirtazapine showed greater benefit during the first 15 daysof therapy. Patients with major depressive disorder who were not responsive or who were intolerant of two prior treatmentswith antidepressants were randomly assigned to treat- ment with mirtazapine (N=114) or nortriptyline (N=121) for up to 12 weeks as part of the STAR*D trial (471). Re-mission rates were 12% for mirtazapine and 20% for nor- triptyline. There were no significant differences in any outcome measure, and the medications were comparablytolerated. Neither mirtazapine nor nortriptyline was par- ticularly effective as monotherapy for patients who had not benefited from two consecutive treatment trials. Mirtazapine has been shown to decrease rates of re- lapse following acute phase treatment. Thase et al. (1038)compared 78 patients who received mirtazapine to 78 pa-tients who received placebo over 9 months following an 8- to 12-week treatment with an antidepressant. Patientstaking mirtazapine had about a 50% reduction in relapserates. However, patients taking mirtazapine gained 1.4 kg more weight than those taking placebo across the 9 monthsof continuation phase therapy. 3. Nefazodone and trazodone The efficacy of nefazodone has been established in pla- cebo-controlled trials, with efficacy comparable to both TCAs and SSRIs (105, 1039-1042); however, its recent use has been limited after case reports suggested a risk ofrare but potentially fatal hepatotoxicity (180). While an early review of trazodone (114) concluded that trazodone is as effective as TCAs in the treatment of depression, other investigators have found trazodone to be less effec- tive than other antidepressant medications (115, 1043-1045), a conclusion supported by the results of at least one meta-analysis (93). In a review of 18 studies from 1980 through 2003, Mendelson (173) found that trazodone, whencompared with various control groups, did improve sleep. However, it was also associat ed with significant side ef- fects, and tolerance may develop with prolonged use. d. Tricyclic antidepressants Since the first trial in which a tricyclic compound (imi- pramine) was shown to improve major depressive disorder symptoms (1046), hundreds of subsequent randomizedcontrolled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of this an- tidepressant class as a treatment for major depressive dis- order (105). Several reviews of this early literaturesuggested that approximately 50%-75% of patients with major depressive disorder treated with tricyclic and re- lated antidepressant medications respond, compared with25%-33% of patients who receive placebo (487, 1047- 1049). The efficacy of indivi dual agents and subclasses of tricyclics (e.g., secondary amines or tertiary amines) ap- pears to be comparable, although amitriptyline may pos- sess a slightly stronger effect across all (1050), and the tertiary amine tricyclics (amitriptyline, clomipramine,and imipramine) may than the secondary amine tricyclics and maprotiline in studies of hospitalized depressed patients (117). The meta-analysis of Barbui et al. (1050) reviewed 181 randomized controlled trials of amitriptyline, generally of6-8 weeks' duration, in inpatient and outpatient settings.Amitriptyline was found to be superior to SSRIs in studies of inpatients, but there was no difference in efficacy in outpatients. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were better tolerated. Arroll et al. (1051) compared TCAs with SSRIs in a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled tri- als in primary care settings. Both TCAs and SSRIs wereeffective, but tolerability comparisons across studies fa- vored SSRIs. Wohlfarth et al. (1052) reviewed 30 random- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

T ricyclic antidepressants were more effective than pla-cebo across age and gender groups. Several trials have compared TCAs against interper- sonal therapy and CBT and against the combination ofTCAs and IPT or CBT . Reynolds et al. (1053) followed 80 patients who were at least age 50 years and had a bereave- ment-related depression in a 16-week factorial designtrial in which patients received IPT or case management and nortriptyline or placebo. Nortriptyline (with or with- out IPT) was more effective than placebo (with or withoutIPT). Patients receiving combined nortriptyline and IPT had the highest study completion rate. Interpersonal psy- chotherapy alone (i.e., IPT plus placebo) was not found to be an effective treatment for bereavement-related ma- jor depressive disorder. However, in a continuation trial(N=107) over 24 months (315), combination therapy was found to be more effective than monotherapy in patients age 70 years or older. All patients had been first stabilizedon combination nortriptyline and IPT before entering the continuation phase. In a 16-week randomized con- trolled trial among 102 elderly patients with major de-pressive disorder, Thompson et al. (1054) found that combined treatment with CBT and nortriptyline was su- perior to CBT alone, which was superior to nortriptylinealone. Combined treatment was particularly effective in patients with severe depressi on, as measured by HAM-D scores. For patients with major depressive disorder who re- ceived ECT following a prior nonresponse to treatment with an antidepressant, van den Broek (1055) found that12 patients randomly assigned to receive imipramine (200-300 ng/mL plasma level) had a greater improvement in all measures in preventing relapse than the 15 patientsrandomly assigned to receive placebo. Results of some investigations have suggested that TCAs are particularly effective for patients with more severesymptoms of major depressive disorder (1056-1060), as well as for patients with melancholia (562, 1061-1063). Superior efficacy for TCAs, compared with SSRIs, has been docu-mented in meta-analyses of inpatient studies (117). e. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have also been shown in multiple trials to be effective treatments for major depres-sive disorder. Although some earlier comparisons employ- ing lower doses of MAOIs found TCAs to be superior, MAOIs are now considered to have comparable efficacyto TCAs for most patients with major depressive disorder (119, 120, 1064-1067). Results of several investigations suggest that MAOIs may be particularly effective in treat-ing subgroups of patients with major depressive disorder with atypical features such as reactive moods, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and sensitivity to rejection(572, 1068, 1069). Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have also been shown to be effective treatments for some pa- tients who have not responded to other antidepressantmedications (1064, 1067, 1070, 1071). In more recent controlled trials, 6 mg/24 hours of transdermal selegiline was compared with placebo in 177adults with major depressive disorder in a 6-week trial (1072). The transdermal patch was found to be more ef- fective than placebo and was well tolerated without theneed for dietary restrictions. These findings were repli- cated in two subsequent studies by Amsterdam (124) (N=365; dose, 6 mg/24 hours; duration, 6 weeks) and al. (125) (N=265; dose, 6-12 mg/24 hours; du- 8 weeks). T ranylcypromine in doses of 30-60 mg/day has been compared with the combination of venlafaxine IR (up to300 mg/day) and mirtazapine (up to 60 109 pa-tients with treatment-resistant depression in a 12-week randomized trial (121). Neither the MAOI (7% remission rate) nor the combination strategy (14% remission rate)were particularly effective in this group of difficult-to- treat depressed patients, although efficacy was compro- mised by the use of low tranylcypromine doses. Mono-amine oxidase inhibitor therapy was significantly less well tolerated and had a significantly higher dropout rate. Limited evidence suggests that the nonselective MAOIs have comparable efficacy. Tranylcypromine and phenelzinewere found to have similar response rates (44% and 47%, respectively) in a 5-week trial of 77 patients with severe ma-jor depressive disorder who had been nonresponsive to a TCA or SSRI medication (1073). Clinical experience sug- gests that some patients who fail to benefit from one ofthese MAOIs may benefit from a different one\u2014after al- lowing a several-week period of washout. 2. Electroconvulsive therapy The efficacy of ECT has been demonstrated in multipleclinical trials, including trials of real versus sham ECT. In a meta-analysis of the efficacy of ECT in the treatment ofdepressive disorders, the six trials (256 patients) that in- cluded sham ECT controls yielded a standard effect size of 0.91 favoring real ECT, consistent with a strong effectof active ECT (235). In th e one sham ECT study that used unilateral ECT, no difference was found, but thetreatment was not delivered sufficiently above the seizurethreshold to be effective (236). In comparison with phar- macotherapy, meta-analyses similarly show an advantage for ECT with a standard effect size of 0.80 across 18 trials Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Comparisons of ECT against specific antidepressant classes show ECT to be superior to SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs (236, 425). In terms of tech-nical aspects of ECT administration, meta-analyses show a more substantial effect of bilateral ECT than unilateral ECT (236), with a standard effect size of 0.32 for 22 trialsand 1,408 participants (235). However, many of the in- cluded studies did not adjust the stimulus doses of ECT to account for differences in seizure threshold across pa-tients, which may have increased the apparent benefit of bilateral ECT. When stimulus dosing was assessed, higher stimulus doses relative to the patient's seizure thresholdwere associated with greate r benefit than stimulus doses closer to the seizure threshold (standard effect size = 0.73for seven trials and 342 participants) (235). The efficacy of ECT given twice weekly did not differ from that of ECT given 3 times/week (236). Much information about ECT response and specific factors that predict response has come from the Consor-tium for Research in ECT (CORE) study, a large trialfunded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in which continuation pharmacotherapy was compared with continuation ECT . In the acute phase of that trial inwhich 253 patients were treated with bitemporal ECT 3 times/week, 79% of the sample had an acute sustained re- sponse, with remission occurring in 75% of patients afterECT (mean number of treatments = 8 \u00b1 3). Response to ECT occurred rapidly, with over one-half of patients show-ing response by the end of the first week of treatment (240).Suicidal ideation also resolved rapidly during the course of ECT, with substantial resolution in 38% by the end of the first week, 61% by the end of the second week, and 80% bythe end of the treatment course (243). Individuals who were older (715) or who exhibited psychosis (241) or atypical fea- tures (578) had a greater likelihood of achieving remission,although the presence of melancholic features was not as- sociated with a greater likelihood of response (499). Also, unlike prior studies that had shown reduced rates of remis-sion with ECT in patients with treatment-resistant depres- sion (1074, 1075), the CORE study found that neither resistance to antidepressants as a whole nor resistance toany specific class of antidepr essants was associated with an altered response to ECT (426). In contrast to the high rates of ECT response found in the CORE study and in meta-a nalyses of clinical efficacy trials, ECT appears to have a lower rate of response whendelivered in community settings. Prudic et al. (237) exam-ined clinical outcomes following ECT and over 6 months of follow-up in 347 patients who received ECT at one of seven hospitals in the New York metropolitan area. Re-mission occurred in only about one-third to one-half of the sample, and two-thirds of those with remission expe-rienced a relapse during the follow-up period. Having re-sidual symptoms, psychotic features, or a co-occurring personality disorder conferred a heightened risk of re-lapse. Other studies have delineated technical factors relating to the efficacy of ECT, includi ng stimulus intensities and electrode placements. Sackeim et al. (253) randomly as- signed 96 depressed patients to treatment with a bitempo- ral or right unilateral electrode placement at a low dose orhigh dose relative to the patient's seizure threshold. Pa- tients treated with bilateral ECT had comparable response rates regardless of stimulus dose (65% for low dose versus63% for high dose), whereas patients receiving low-dose right unilateral ECT had only a 17% response, and those receiving high-dose right unilateral ECT had an interme- diate response (43%). In a subsequent randomized double- blind study of 80 depressed patients, an even higher doseof right unilateral ECT was used (500% above the seizure threshold). At this stimulus dose, right unilateral ECT showed comparable efficacy to bilateral ECT (65%) andsuperior efficacy to right unilateral ECT given at 50% or 150% above seizure threshold, for which the response rates were 35% and 30%, respectively. That high-doseright unilateral ECT has comparable benefits to bilateral ECT has also been shown in two randomized studies by McCall et al., one of which included 77 patients and usedright unilateral ECT at eight times the seizure threshold (1076) and one of which included 72 patients and used a high fixed dose of 403 millicoulombs for right unilateralECT (1077). Several smaller studies have examined bifrontal elec- trode in comparison with bitemporal or rightunilateral electrode placements. Bailine et al. (1078), who studied 48 patients with scores of 17 or higher on the 17- item version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression(HAM-D-17) who were randomly assigned equally to receive bifrontal or bitemporal ECT (mean number of treatments = 6 \u00b1 2.5), reported no difference in remission rates between the two groups. Ranjkesh et al. (1079) found no difference in HAM-D scores among patients re- ceiving at least eight sessions of bifrontal (moderate dose,N=15), bitemporal (low dose, N=15), or right unilateral (high dose, N=15) electrode placement in an Iranian in- patient sample of patients with an initial score of 16 orhigher on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for De- pression (HAM-D-24). Similarly, Eschweiler et al. (1080) compared the effects of six right unilateral ECT treat-ments (250% stimulus intensity of titrated threshold) and six bifrontal ECT treatments (150% of threshold) over a 3-week period in a randomized double-blind trial of92 patients and found no difference in response rates be- tween the two electrode placements.

In terms of the time to recover reorien- tation after ECT , Sackeim et al. (253) found that patients receiving bilateral ECT took substantially longer to re-gain their orientation than patients receiving right unilat- eral ECT, and the time to regain orientation increased with the stimulus dose. In addition, the time to regain ori-entation immediately after ECT , as well as the patient's baseline cognitive status, predicted the patient's cognitivestatus after the ECT course and at 2-month follow-up as-sessment (251). Regardless of the stimulus dose of right unilateral ECT that was used, bilateral ECT was associated with more prominent effects on cognition at follow-up as- sessments (253, 1081). Relative to bilateral ECT (at one and one-half times the seizure threshold), high-dose rightunilateral ECT (at eight times the seizure threshold) pro- duced comparable effects on memory, and neither electrode placement produced prolonged anterograde amnesia(1076). Lisanby et al. (248) studied 55 patients with major depression in a randomized double-blind trial of bitem- poral and right unilateral ECT at low and high stimulusdoses and compared the patients' function on a Personal and Impersonal Memory T est with that of a parallel group of normal control subjects. Bitemporal ECT was found tocause more prominent impairments that were most nota- ble for impersonal events and that were independent of stimulus dose or clinical outcome. Studies of other elec-trode placements have shown either no difference (1080) or beneficial effects (1078, 1079) of bifrontal electrode placement relative to bitemporal electrode placement. An-other factor that may relate to memory dysfunction is the number of ECT treatments administered per week, with two studies showing less prominent amnesia with twice-weekly ECT rather than ECT given 3 times/week (1082). The cognitive effects observed in naturalistic commu- nity settings also appear to differ from those observed inresearch trials (252). The seven hospitals in the community study showed considerable variation from one another immediately after ECT and at the 6-month follow-up as-sessment. These differences seemed primarily related to differences in ECT technique across sites, with use of sine wave stimulation and bilateral ECT being associated withgreater and more persistent cognitive effects on several cognitive measures, compared with brief pulse and right unilateral ECT. Given the lower efficacy rates for ECTthat were also seen in the community sample, residual or recurrent depressive symptoms may also have contributed to the poorer cognitive outcomes. These findings suggesta need to optimize efficacy as well as minimize cognitive effects in clinical practice.3. Transcranial magnetic stimulation A substantial number of studies of TMS have been con- ducted, but most have had small sample sizes, and the stud- ies overall have yielded heterogeneous results. Further complicating the interpretation of the TMS literature isthe variability in stimulation intensities (relative to the mo- tor threshold), stimulus parameters (e.g., pulses/second, pulses/session), anatomical localization of stimulation, andnumber of TMS sessions in the treatment course. A recent meta-analysis of 24 studies (with a total of 1,092 subjects) found that individuals with treatment-resistant depressionwere more likely to respond to TMS than to sham treat- ment (25% with TMS versus 17% with sham; NNT=6) (270). However, for active treatment and for sham treat- ment, remission occurred in fewer than 10% of subjects (270). Another meta-analysis that included 33 studies alsofound active TMS to be more effective than sham treat- ment in patients with major depression but also noted sub- stantial variability across studies (271). Studies withstimulation intensities below 90% of motor threshold ap- peared to show less benefit (271). Based on a meta-analysis that included six independent trials of left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex TMS in a total of 195 patients, older individ- uals and those with treatment-resistant depressive episodes may also be less likely to respond (1083). Another meta-analysis of these six clinical trials found TMS to be no dif- ferent from sham treatment overall in the treatment of ma- jor depression; however, the power within these studies todetect a difference was generally low (273). Schutter (272) also examined studies of TMS over the left dorsolateral pre- frontal cortex and found an overall weighted mean effect sizeof 0.39 for TMS based on findings from 30 studies and 1,164 patients. This meta-analysis did not find any differ- ences in the response of individuals with medication-resis-tant major depression as compared with those without documented medication resistance, nor did it find any evi- dence of study heterogeneity or publication bias. Multipleearlier meta-analyses also demonstrated benefits of TMS (1084-1087), but include an overlapping set of studies with those assessed in more recent meta-analyses. If anything,however, earlier studies demonstrated less efficacy for TMS than more recent studies (272, 1088). The duration of TMS effects has not been well studied, but one meta-analysis of 14 studies showed a robust response to TMS compared with sham TMS after 2 weeks of treatment (stan- dardized mean difference = 0.35; 95% confidence interval = 0.66 to 0.04), but no statistically significant benefit of active TMS at 2-week follow-up (1089). The largest published trial of TMS was a randomized, double-blind, multisite study of patients who had not re- sponded to one to four prior trials of antidepressant ther- apy and were free of other medications at the time of the Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Subjects received sham TMS (N=146) or ac- tive TMS delivered to prefrontal cor- pulses/second and3,000 pulses/session at 120% of motor threshold. At weeks 4 and 6 of the study there was a trend for greater improvement in MADRS scores in the active TMS group,but this result did not reach statistical significance. Rates of remission also did not differ between the two groups,although secondary outcome measures, including theHAM-D and response rates, did indicate a beneficial ef- fect of TMS. In an open-label extension study of this trial (1090), 85 subjects who had received sham TMS showedsignificant reductions in MADRS scores after changing to active TMS; 42.4% of these patients met response crite- ria, and 20% had remission of their depressive symptoms by 6 weeks. Of subjects who had received active TMS and continued to receive an addi tional 6 weeks of treatment (N=73), 26% showed a response to TMS, and 11% achieved symptom remission. Subsequent analysis of the data from these trials (274) showed that lesser degrees of treatmentresistance were associated with better response to TMS. The lack of a co-occurring anxiety disorder also appeared t o b e a s s o c i a t e d w i t h a b e t t e r r e s p o n s e t o T M S i n t h eopen-label extension phase of the trial. In another large multisite trial conducted in Europe, 127 subjects with treatment-resistant depression who were beingtreated with antidepressant medication (venlafaxine or mir- tazapine) were randomly assigned to receive active (N=62) or sham (N=65) TMS delivered to the left dorsolateral cortex, with 10 pulses/second and 2,000 pulses/session at 110% of motor threshold for 3 weeks.The two groups did not differ in their degree of improve-ment on the MADRS, HAM-D, or BDI scales, and a sim- ilar proportion of individuals in each group (31%) were classified as having responded to treatment (269). Other smaller studies have compared TMS with ECT , with variable results. One of these studies showed ECT tobe substantially more effective than TMS acutely in termsof HRSD scores and the proportion of responders at the end of the study, and, on the majority of outcome mea- sures, ECT retained this benefit over TMS after 6 monthsof follow-up (275). In the other studies that compared TMS with ECT, rates of remission and response were comparable for the two treatments, although the responseand remission rates for ECT in these studies were some- what lower than typically reported in clinical ECT trials, and rates of response to TMS were higher than those re-ported in sham controlled trials of TMS (276-278, 1091). An additional randomized single-blind trial compared the responses of individuals who received 2 weeks of thrice-weekly unilateral ECT with the responses of individuals who received one unilateral ECT session and four TMSsessions each week (1092) and found no statistically sig-nificant differences in efficacy or side effects between the two approaches. The cognitive effects of TMS and ECThave been assessed in one open study (279), in which sub- jects treated with TMS reported memory to be unchanged or improved approximately 9 days after the treatmentcourse as compared with unilateral ECT , which was asso- ciated with a greater degree of subjective, retrograde, and anterograde memory difficulties shortly after the end of the treatment course. A subsequent randomized single- blind trial (276) showed no significant difference between individuals who received TMS and those who receivedunilateral ECT when neuropsychological performance was tested at 2 and at 4 weeks of treatment. However, there was a trend for worsened performance in those receiving ECT versus a trend for improved performance in those receiving TMS. Analysis of aggregate safety data from more than 10,000 treatment sessions with 325 patients treated at 23 clinicalsites in the United States, Australia, and Canada showedthat TMS was well tolerated, with less than 5% of subjects leaving the study due to adverse effects and no seizures or deaths observed (280). The most common adverse effectswere transient headaches or scalp discomfort. Overall, side effects of treatment were mild to moderate in intensity and dissipated over the initial week of treatment. 4. Vagus nerve stimulation The FDA approved VNS for treatment-resistant depres-sion based on efficacy data from two different samples, for which acute and longer term data are available. The first sample consisted of 60 outpatients with chronic or recur-rent major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, or bipo- lar II disorder who had not responded to at least two medication trials from different antidepressant classes. Thiscohort was first followed in an open-label fashion with 10 weeks of active stimulation after a 2-week period to permit recovery from surgery (281). On the primary outcome mea-sure, the 28-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-28), 30.5% of the sample showed a response (de- fined as at least a 50% reduction from the baseline HAM-D-28 score) and 15.3% of the sample had a full remission of symptoms (defined as HAM-D-28 of less than 11). Re- sponse was less likely to occur in patients who had receiveda greater number of unsuccessful antidepressant trials or who had received ECT prior to VNS. This cohort was then followed for up to 2 years naturalistically, with changes topsychotropic medications and VNS stimulus parameters permitted (479). In a last-observation-carried-forward anal- ysis, response rates were 44% and 42% after 1 and 2 years, respectively, with remission rates of 27% and 22% at 1 and 2 years, respectively (479).

In the acute phase, nonpsy- chotic outpatients with treatment-resistant major depres-sive disorder (N=210) or patients with depressed phase bipolar disorder (N=25) received 10 weeks of active or sham treatment after 2 weeks of recovery from implanta-tion surgery. In terms of response (i.e., at least 50% reduc- tion in HAM-D-24 score), there was no significant difference with VNS treatment (15.2% response vs. 10%for sham). These findings may be confounded by the fre- quent occurrence of hoarseness or voice alteration with stimulation (281), which may have affected the blinding of the study subjects or investigators. During the longer term naturalistic follow-up phase, in which changes inmedication were permitted, the active VNS group re- ceived 9 additional months of VNS, and the sham group received 12 months of VNS (282). A repeated-measureslinear regression analysis of the primary outcome measure showed significant reductions in HAM-D-24 scores, with response and remission rates of 27.2% and 15.8%, respec-tively, at the study endpoint (282). A similar but nonran- domized treatment-as-usual group (N=124) showed a response rate of 13%, suggesting a benefit of VNS (476). T o determine whether the benefits of VNS were dura- ble, data from the studies described earlier in this sectionwere combined, and the persistence of the antidepressiveresponse was determined (478). Of individuals who had shown an early response (by 3 months of VNS), 66.7% and 64.6% of the overall group had maintained that response at1 and 2 years, respectively. Of those who had shown a late response (by 12 months of VNS), 68.5% had maintained that response at 2 years, suggesting persistent benefits ofVNS. An additional uncontrolled multisite European trial showed somewhat lower rates of sustained response (44%)at 1 year of VNS treatment, although overall response and remission rates at 1 year were 53% and 33%, respectively (481). Other smaller, open-label trials have been recentlyreviewed and also show reductions in depressive symptoms when VNS is used in combination with other antidepres- sive treatments for individuals with treatment-resistant de- pression (480). Across all studies, VNS was generally viewed as toler- able (480). Rates of study dropout were low (about 1%)during the initial 3 months of treatment (282), with about 80% of subjects continuing with VNS at the end of 2 years (479). Voice alteration or hoarseness occurred in abouttwo-thirds of subjects in conjunction with stimulation (281). Coughing occurred in about one-quarter of individ-uals (281), and dyspnea and neck pain were also commonly reported (481). 5. Complementary and alternative treatments a. St. John's wort Despite a large number of trials examining St. John's wort (usually in the form of Hypericum perforatum extract), there is no consensus on its efficacy in major depressive disorder. A 2005 Cochrane meta-analysis (1093) provided a sum- mary of treatment studies utilizing St. John's wort for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The published stud-ies demonstrate heterogeneity in methods used and great inconsistency in study outcomes. A number of double- blind studies have demonstrated its superiority over pla- cebo, although some have not (370, 371). In addition, St. John's wort may have better tolerability than TCAs and SSRIs, and several randomized studies have shown nonin- feriority relative to approved antidepressant medications,although the distinctive taste of St. John's wort extract mayhave caused some unblinding during the studies. Among the larger and most rigorous recently pub- lished placebo-controlled trials, the studies by Shelton etal. (371) (N=200) and Davidson et al. (370) (N=340) did not demonstrate a difference between St. John's wort and pla- cebo on primary outcome measures, but Lecrubier et al.(1094) found a significant difference between St. John's wort and placebo in mild to moderate depression (N=375). In addition, a recent review of 14 short-term, double-blindtrials conducted in outpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of major depressive disorder demonstrated that St. John's wort in doses of 300 mg/day and 1,800 mg/dayhad efficacy superior to placebo and was generally com- parable to low-dose TCA treatment (e.g., 30-150 mg/day of amitriptyline) (105). Side effects were observed in alower proportion of individuals taking St. John's wort than among those taking a TCA (25% vs. 40%) (105). b. S-adenosyl methionine A number of studies have found SAMe to be efficacious in oral doses that range from 800 mg/day to 1,600 mg/day. In a double-blind trial, 15 inpatients with major depressivedisorder received oral SAMe or placebo for 21 days (1095). Six of nine patients receiving SAMe demonstrated response as defined by a reduction of 50% or more in HAM-Dscores, and depression ratings compared with placebo were significantly lower in the SAMe group than in the placebo group at days 14 and 21. Side effects were mild and tran-sient. In a meta-analysis of studies comparing effects of SAMe with those of TCAs, SAMe was found to have better tolerability and greater efficacy in the treatment of depres-sion, although the doses of TCAs were subtherapeutic in some studies (381).

In one of the larger controlled trials, which included 293 participants, Pancheri et al. (382) found SAMe (administered intramuscularly at adose of 400 mg/day) and imipramine (administered by mouth at a dose of 150 mg/day) to be similarly efficacious in a 4-week trial. Other studies have focused on specific sub-groups of patients, such as HIV-positive patients and post- menopausal women (1097, 1098). c. Omega-3 fatty acids T wo large meta-analyses found benefits of omega-3 fatty acids overall in mood disorder trials (384, 385) but also highlighted the heterogeneity of study designs and re- sults. The one monotherapy study of DHA for major de-pressive disorder in adults did not demonstrate benefit of DHA over placebo (1099), although small trials in major depressive disorder in children and in pregnant womendid demonstrate a benefit of monotherapy with omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (1100, 1101). d. Folate In a study by Coppen and Bailey (389) that included 127 subjects, 94% of women who received fluoxetine and500 mcg/day of folate responded to treatment, compared with 61% of those who received fluoxetine and placebo (p<0.005). Patients who received folate were also less likely to report side effects (p <0.05). e. Light therapyIn a meta-analysis, Golden et al. (395) found clinically sig- nificant benefit of bright light therapy in seasonal major de-pressive disorder (eight studies), with a large effect size(0.84), and in nonseasonal major depressive disorder in three studies with a medium effect size (0.53). However, the authors, who were participants of an APA work group onthe topic of light therapy, determined that many of the studies of light therapy for mood disorders had method- ological flaws, including small sample sizes, with only 13% ofthe studies they assessed meeting the inclusion criteria for their meta-analysis. Bright light therapy in nonseasonal major depressive disorder was not found to be significantlymore efficacious than placebo in trials when used adjunc- tively in addition to antidepressants. As determined by the APA work group, an adequate placebo condition requires amaximum dose of 300 lux (versus at least 3,000 lux-hours for an active treatment condition for bright light treat- ment). Randomized, placebo-controlled studies haveranged from 7-42 days in duration, with provi- sion of between 2,500-10,000 lux illuminance of white light, with delivery time between 0.5-6 hours/day. Somepublished studies were found to have bright light exposure at levels too high to constitute a scientifically valid control condition, and the difficulty in creating a reasonable con- trol condition for bright light therapy may have contributed to the limited evidence base to date. Control groups have in- cluded lower doses of white light, red light, active lightavoidance, negative air ionizer, and no treatment. Despite heterogeneity of designs and results, evidence supports the efficacy of bright light as a monotherapy for acute majordepressive disorder. Individualization of a regimen may be required in terms of lux, length of exposure, and time of day of delivery. In addition, patients should be monitored foremergence of mania during treatment (1102). f. Acupuncture Assessment of the evidence base for acupuncture is compli- cated by the fact that many reports are in Asian languages and therefore often overlooked by English language litera-ture searches. Results from studies in acupuncture are dif- ficult to interpret, because the description of the methods is often limited and there is variability in diagnosis and in in-terventions (403). Wang et al. (407) published a recent meta-analysis of eight trials of acupuncture and depression chosen from more than 200 studies on the basis of havinga randomized design, specific diagnostic criteria for de- pression, and specific acupuncture interventions (manual, electro-acupuncture, or laser). The depression criteria in-cluded DSM, International Classification of Diseases, and Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders criteria. The meta-analysis did not demonstrate a benefit of acupunctureover control conditions on either response rates or remis- sion but was based on a small number of trials with variable methodological quality. Consequently, additional system-atic study is required to assess the role of acupuncture for major depressive disorder . There have been few randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies to inform the use of acupuncture for de-pression. In one published study, Allen et al. (405) compared 38 women, ages 18-45 years, who were assigned to three dif-ferent groups: an acupuncture regimen specifically chosen to address their depression, sham acupuncture, or a waiting-list control condition. The active acupuncture group experi-enced a significantly greater remission rate. However, Allen et al. (406) failed to replicate these results in a larger random- ized trial, in which 151 patients with major depressive disor-der received acupuncture specific for depression, sham acupuncture, or a waiting-list condition. After 8 weeks, there was no evidence of benefit for the acupuncture interventionspecific for depression, compared with sham acupuncture or the waiting-list condition. Response rates were 22% for the depression-specific acupuncture treatment and 39% for thesham acupuncture treatment. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

(404) compared effects of electro-acupuncture combined with placebo med- ication to the effects of amitriptyline in 241 inpatients.Electro-acupuncture appeared equivalent to amitriptyline at a dose of 150-175 mg/day in treating depression, with greater improvement for symptoms of anxiety, cognitiveproblems, and somatization; it also resulted in a lower side effect burden than amitriptyline. However, no group re- ceived the placebo medication alone, and no sham treat- ment was used to elucidate nonspecific benefits of acu- puncture treatment. B. SPECIFIC PSYCHOTHERAPIES 1. Cognitive and behavioral therapies a. Cognitive-behavioral therapyIn the three decades since its first evaluation as a treat- ment for major depressive disorder, CBT has been exten-sively studied in controlled trials. When meta-analyses have quantified the efficacy of CBT compared with no treatment or minimal treatment, effect sizes have beenfairly robust, generally near or above one standard devia- tion in the outcome measures (514, 1103-1106). Relative to other treatments, estimates of CBT efficacy frommeta-analyses have been less consistent, although effect sizes for CBT have generally been comparable to those for other short-term forms of psychotherapy (e.g., IPTand brief dynamic psychotherapy) (1107). Factors relating to the administration of CBT may in- fluence response. Some data suggest that the efficacy ofCBT may vary depending upon the severity of major de- pressive disorder, with less efficacy in individuals with more severe symptoms (1108). Individuals with moderate to severe depression may need more skilled CBT thera- pists to achieve therapeutic benefits (67). Other trials have failed to show a differential response to treatments on thebasis of initial symptom severity, possibly because of lack of statistical power (1109, 1110). Recent research has raised questions about the relative strengths of the cognitive and the behavioral componentsof CBT. Dimidjian et al. (310) randomly assigned 241 pa- tients with major depressive disorder to receive CBT ,behavioral activation, paroxetine, or placebo. Among pa- tients with more severe depression, behavioral activation had similar efficacy to medication, and both were superiorto CBT. This study shows that behavioral interventions may be preferable to cognitive techniques for patients with more severe depressive symptoms. According to a data synthesis of studies conducted be- tween 1980 and October 2004, conducted by Hollon et al.(363), CBT and IPT can be as effective as medications in the acute treatment of depressed outpatients. Comparable rates of medication and CBT response have also been foundin a number of randomized trials. For example, Jarrett et al. (576) compared CBT to phenelzine and placebo in a 10- week randomized trial that included 108 patients with ma-jor depressive disorder with atypical features. Cognitive-be- havioral therapy had comparable efficacy at achieving response (indicated by a HAM-D score of 9 or lower), andboth were superior to placebo in an intent-to-treat analysis. In another study, DeRubeis et al. (67) reported that among 240 patients randomly assigned to receive paroxetine, CBT, or placebo, CBT was comparable to paroxetine but was not clearly superior to placebo at 8 weeks. In addition, at 16 weeks, CBT and paroxetine showed comparable rates of re- sponse and remission in individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. In subanalyses of the NIMH T reatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program study, CBT was less ef-fective than imipramine plus clinical management amongindividuals with moderate depression (defined by scores of 20 or higher on the HAM-D or scores of 50 or lower on the Global Assessment of Functioning); there was also atrend for CBT to be less effective than IPT (1108). No differences were observed between CBT, IPT, imip- ramine plus clinical management, or placebo plus clinicalmanagement among less severely depressed subjects. At study endpoint as well as at 18-month follow-up, there were no significant differences among these treatmentgroups in degree of symptom reduction or ratings of cur- rent clinical condition. However, at the 18-month follow- up assessment, patients receiving IPT or CBT reported asignificantly greater capacity to establish and maintain in- terpersonal relationships and to recognize and understand sources of their depression than patients in the imip-ramine plus clinical management group or the placebo group (1111). Unlike medications, CBT decreases the risk of relapse even after this treatment is terminated (363), and continu-ing CBT in the maintenance phase further decreases this risk. In a maintenance treatment study by Paykel et al. (368),158 patients with partial remission from a major depres- sive episode while taking medication were randomly as- signed to clinical management or clinical management andCBT. Cognitive-behavioral therapy was given in 16 ses- sions over 20 weeks, with two booster sessions at 72 weeks. Relapse reduced from 47% to 29% with CBT, and CBT was associated with higher remission rates. Bockting et al. (497) also compared treatment as usual (including medication)to treatment as usual and CBT in a German outpatientsample of 187 patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy had \"significant protective effect\" that increased with number Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For patients with five or more prior de- pressive episodes, CBT lowered relapse from 72% to 46%. This study suggests that psychotherapy may have aprotective effect, especially for more severely ill patients. b. Behavior therapy Although numerous trials have examined the efficacy of behavior therapy, relatively few have employed randomassignment and adequate control conditions. T wo meta- analyses found behavior therapy superior to a waiting- list control condition (observed in seven of eight trials)(487, 1107). Results of individual clinical trials have sug- gested that behavior therapy may be superior in efficacy to brief dynamic psychotherapy (1112, 1113) and gener- ally comparable in efficacy to cognitive therapy (1114- 1117) or pharmacotherapy (283). One post hoc examina-tion of clinical trial data found that response to behavior therapy may be more likely in patients with less initial se- verity of major depressive disorder symptoms (1118),but other studies have not found this relationship (1119- 1121). More recently, \"dismantling studies\" comparing the full CBT package to some of its elements suggest that behav-ioral activation, the behavioral component of CBT, may be as efficacious or more efficacious than CBT as a whole,particularly for patients with greater depressive severity (310, 1122). Behavioral activation not only outperformed CBT and placebo with respect to more severely depressedpatients, but it was as efficacious as medications regardless of severity (310) and more enduring following treatment termination (288). In addition, activity scheduling, a be-havioral activation treatment in which patients learn how to increase the number of pleasant activities and interac- tions with their environment, was found in a meta-analy-sis to be an effective treatment for depression (706). 2. Interpersonal therapy Like CBT , IPT was developed to treat patients with majordepressive disorder and has demonstrated efficacy in aseries of randomized clinical trials (1123, 1124). In the NIMH T reatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program study, IPT had greater efficacy than pill placeboplus clinical management and was comparable to imip- ramine plus clinical management for patients with more severe major depressive disorder, whereas cognitive ther-apy was not superior to placebo. Among patients with mild depressive severity (defined as scores less than 20 on the HAM-D or greater than 50 on the Global Assessmentof Functioning scale), IPT , CBT, and imipramine plus clinical management did not differ from placebo plus clin- ical management (1108). The degree to which patient andtherapist can resolve the interpersonal crisis on which IPTfocuses (e.g., a role transition) appears to correlate with symptomatic improvement (1125). Other studies have found IPT effective in treating pregnant and postpartum women with major depressivedisorder (743, 1126) and depressed patients in a develop- ing country (351). A controlled trial of IPT has also dem-onstrated its effectiveness for depressed primary care patients (1127). After 8 mo nths, the propor tions of pa- tients treated with IPT , nortriptyline, or usual care who achieved remission were 46%, 48%, and 18%, respectively. In a study of depressed HIV-positive patients, greater im- provements were observed after IPT or IPT plus imip- ramine than after supportive psychotherapy or CBT (316). However, a large recent study found no benefit for IPTover clinical management in depressed cardiac patients (807). Many trials have been conducted comparing IPT , both as monotherapy and augmentation, to various controlconditions and active comparators, both in acute phase treatment and continuation and maintenance therapy. Generally, IPT is superior to treatment as usual and is an effective augmentation strategy for patients receiving pharmacotherapy. A meta-analysis of 13 studies of IPT conducted from 1974 to 2002 reported that, in nine of the studies, IPT was superior to placebo (1123). In addition, IPT was more efficacious than CBT . However, the com-bination of IPT and medications was not significantly more effective than medication monotherapy for acute or prophylactic treatment. 3. Psychodynamic psychotherapy Psychodynamic psychotherapy has been used widely inclinical practice for the treatment of patients with depres-sive symptoms and syndromes and is sometimes preferred by patients (361). However, its efficacy in major depres- sive disorder has not been adequately studied in con-trolled trials. Using the available evidence to determine the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy in the treat- ment of major depressive disorder is complicated by severalproblems. In some early studies, variants of psychody- namic psychotherapy served as a nonspecific comparison treatment to other psychotherapeutic interventions, butthe details of the psychodynamic psychotherapy employed were poorly defined (1107). Subsequently, some clinical trials of psychodynamic psychotherapy have reportedshort- and long-term therapeutic benefits (as described in references 1128-1130), but few of these trials were ran- domized or assessed treatment fidelity; some includedconcomitant pharmacotherapy, and most studied patients with a multiplicity of symptoms and diagnoses, such as de- pressed patients who did not meet the DSM-IV criteriafor major depressive disorder.

A recent meta-analysis (1132) acknowledgedthat the quality of available studies on psychodynamic psychotherapy for treatment of depression was not opti- mal. In addition, use of low-quality studies in meta-anal-yses of psychotherapy may lead to overestimations of effect sizes (1133). With these caveats, some findings from meta-analyses of short-term (1132) and long-term (1130)psychodynamic psychotherapy suggest possible benefits in individuals with depressive symptoms (1132) and sug- gest that long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy mayhave beneficial effects in individuals with depressive and anxiety symptoms (1130). T o confirm these results and ex- tend them to individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder, further research with more rigorous study de- signs will be needed. 4. Marital therapy and family therapy Reviews have concluded that marital therapy is effectivefor treating depressive symptoms and reducing risk for re- lapse (1134, 1135). In a recent meta-analysis of eight mar- ital therapy trials, marital therapy had comparable efficacyto individual psychotherapy for the treatment of depres- sion (1136). A lower dropout rate was found for marital therapy than for medication therapy, although this resultwas heavily influenced by a single study. Marital therapy was superior in treating depressive symptoms, compared with minimal or no treatment. These findings were weak-ened by methodological problems affecting most studies, such as the small number of cases available for analysis in almost all comparisons, and the significant heterogeneityamong studies. Results from individual studies suggest that the efficacy of marital therapy may depend on whether marital distressis present. In one study, a greater proportion of depressed subjects with marital distress responded to marital therapy than to cognitive therapy (88% vs. 71%), but among de-pressed subjects without marital distress, a greater propor- tion responded to cognitive therapy than to marital therapy (85% vs. 55%) (1137). In another study of depressed sub-jects with marital discord, marital therapy and CBT were equally effective and both were more effective than a wait- ing-list condition (1138). A pilot randomized trial found\"conjoint\" (marital) IPT for depressed married women equipotent to individual IPT in alleviating depression and superior in improving marital satisfaction (1139). A randomized controlled trial of antidepressant drug therapy in comparison to couple therapy for depressed out-patients found a lower dropout rate and greater improve-ment in subjective symptoms of depression, at no greater cost, for the couple therapy group (342). Patients recruitedduring a psychiatric hospitalization for major depressivedisorder were randomly assigned to pharmacotherapy alone; combined pharmacotherapy and therapy;combined pharmacotherapy and family and com- bined pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy, and family ther- apy. Patients who received treatment that included a familytherapy component were more likely to improve and had significant reductions in interviewer-rated depression and suicidal ideation, compared with those whose treatment didnot include family therapy (343). 5. Problem-solving therapy Some studies have reported modest improvement in sub- jects with mild depressive symptoms treated with prob- lem-solving therapy. For example, Dowrick et al. (1140) treated 452 subjects with depressive or adjustment disor- ders, comparing groups that received eight sessions ofproblem-solving therapy to control groups given six ses- sions of group preventive education. At 6 months, the au- thors found a 2.6-point difference on the BDI favoringproblem-solving therapy (NNT=6). T reatment effects at 1 year did not differ. Problem-solving therapy may have advantages over usual care for home-bound geriatric pa-tients with depressive symptoms (1141). Unfortunately, usual care often means little care. Alexopoulos et al. (335) reported that 12 sessions of problem-solving therapy were superior to supportivepsychotherapy for depressed geriatric patients with major depressive disorder and executive dysfunction. Anotherstudy showed problem-solving therapy to have greater benefit than usual care in preventing depression (1142). 6. Group therapy A mostly European body of research suggests that the in- dividual psychotherapies validated in treating depressionalso work in group format. Most of these studies have sought to demonstrate efficacy rather than exploring the technical aspects of group therapy. Group cognitive therapy has shown benefits in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder. For example, Ayenand Hautzinger (347) randomly assigned 51 depressed,menopausal women for 3 months of weekly, 2-hour ses- sions of cognitive group therapy, of group supportive psy- chotherapy, or a waiting list. Both active treatments werewell tolerated and relieved depressive and menopausal symptoms better than the control condition. At 1-year fol- low-up, group CBT was more beneficial than group sup-portive therapy. In contrast, group CBT was ineffective in treating dysthymic disorder. Ravindran et al. (293) found sertraline superior to placebo but 12 weeks of group CBTno better than placebo and ineffective in augmenting ser- traline in treatment of patients with dysthymia.

(1143) conducted a meta-analysis of 48 research reports assessing the efficacy of group therapy for the treatment of depression in individuals with varioustypes of depressive disorders (depressive spectrum disor- ders). Analyses suggested that participants in treatment showed significant clinical improvement. Forms of group CBT have also shown promise in low- ering relapse risk. Bockting et al. (497) reported that for the 41% of 187 patients with remission who had a history of atleast five episodes of recurrent major depressive disorder, augmenting usual treatment with brief group CBT low- ered relapse rates from 72% to 46% over a 2-year period. T easdale et al. (498) found that group mindfulness- based cognitive therapy as an augmentation strategy wasbeneficial relative to treatment as usual in reducing re- lapse rates over 60 weeks for 145 patients with recurrent depression who reported at least three prior major depres-sive episodes. Interpersonal psychotherapy has also been adapted to a group format (1144). Although IPT is less well studiedthan CBT, small trials of group IPT suggest its benefits as both a preventive intervention (350) and a treatment for postpartum depression (349). A group combining inter-personal and cognitive elements improved outcome rela- tive to fluoxetine alone among patients with dysthymia who responded to fluoxetine (1145). C. PSYCHOTHERAPY COMBINED WITH PHARMACOTHERAPY Although many psychiatrists prefer to use a combination ofpsychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to treat patients withdepression, controlled studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s did not consistently find a significant advantage for routinely combining therapies, compared with one or the other treatments provided alone (1146). Part of the prob- lem in establishing the additive value of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in these early studies was methodologi-cal: the specific effects of each modality (i.e., over and above the so-called nonspecific effects of therapeutic support and placebo-expectancy factors) are relatively modest, andnone of the early studies of combined therapy had the sta- tistical power to reliably detect such small effects. Consis- tent with this appraisal, a meta-analysis of these earlystudies found an average effect size of about 0.3 (1147), which is both a clinically significant effect and an advantage that would usually not be found to be statistically signifi-cant in a study of 100 or fewer patients. A meta-analysis of individual patient data performed by Thase et al. (359), which compared remission rates of nearly 600 patientstreated in studies of CBT , IPT, and IPT in combinationwith either imipramine or nortriptyline, confirmed a mod- est overall advantage for combined treatment versus CBT or IPT alone but found a differential impact linked to se-verity and history of recurrent depressive episodes. Specif- ically, whereas combined treatment had a small advantage over psychotherapy alone among patients with less severedepression, there was a fourfold difference in remission rates among the subset of patients with more severe, recur- rent depressive episodes. The advantage of combined treatment over pharmaco- therapy alone in more severe depression was evident in awell-controlled inpatient study of Schramm et al. (285).Conducted in Germany, this 5-week trial included 124 hos- pitalized patients with major depressive disorder; results showed a 70% response rate to IPT plus pharmacotherapy, compared with a 51% response rate to pharmacotherapy alone. In a Swiss study in which 74 outpatients were ran-domly assigned to receive 10 weeks of clomipramine plus psychodynamic therapy or clomipramine alone, the combi- nation treatment produced greater improvements in globalfunctioning, greater cost savings, lower rates of hospitaliza- tion, and fewer lost work days (1148). Keller et al. (362) examined the outcomes of more than 600 patients with chronic depression who were randomlyassigned to treatment with the antidepressant nefazodone or a form of CBT (cognitive behavioral analysis system ofpsychotherapy [CBASP]) singly or in combination. The authors found a large additive advantage for the two treat- ments in combination. Specifically, response rates for com- bined treatment were approximately 20% higher at the end of 12 weeks of treatmen t, compared with the mono- therapies, which were comparably effective. It is noteworthy that patients receiving combined treatment experienced theearlier benefit that characterized the pharmacotherapy as well as the later emerging benefit that characterized thepsychotherapy (362). A post hoc analysis of these results revealed that the advantage of the combined approach was explained by a broader spec trum of efficacy: pharmaco- therapy alone was significantl y less effective than CBASP among the subset of patients with a history of childhood trauma, whereas the opposite trend was evident amongthe patients treated with psychotherapy alone (1149). Pa- tients with chronic depression were thus more likely to benefit from combined treatment whether or not they hada history of early adversity. In the STAR*D study, patients with depression who did not have remission following an initial 12-week course ofcitalopram therapy were offered the opportunity to add or change to Beck's model of cognitive therapy in addition to the various pharmacotherapy options being studied.Among those who opted to add a therapeutic adjunct to ongoing citalopram, about one-third consented to be ran- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Results at the end of 12 weeks of therapy indicated that cognitive ther-apy was as effective as medication augmentation, although patients opting for combined pharmacotherapy responded faster (369). One historic limitation of the literature on combined treatment of depression has been that a vast majority ofstudies have concerned cognitive therapy and IPT, andthere has been a dearth of studies on the more widely prac- ticed forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy. An informa- tive series of studies by one group of investigators in theNetherlands has helped to partly address this issue. The first trial compared outcomes of 167 outpatients with de- pression across 6 months of treatment with either algo- rithm-guided antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone or pharmacotherapy combined with a manual-based form of time-limited dynamic psychotherapy (1150). Significant differences favored combined treatment with respect to retention in treatment and the likelihood of remission. Asecondary analysis determined that the advantage of com- bined treatment was largely explained by the large differ- ence among patients with co-occurring Axis II disorders(1151). In a second study of 191 depressed outpatients, time-limited dynamic therapy alone was compared against psychotherapy in combination with algorithm-guidedpharmacotherapy (1152). In this trial, there were signifi- cant differences favoring combined therapy on patient- rated outcomes, although the numeric difference betweengroups on remission rates was not statistically significant. The investigators next conducte d a pooled analysis of the data from these two trials, also including a third smaller study that did not include a combined therapy arm (361). The analysis included data for more than 300 depressed outpatients and confirmed the advantage of combinedtreatment over the monotherapies across studies on most outcome variables. T wo meta-analyses of study results have confirmed the advantage of combining pharmacotherapy and variousforms of time-limited psychotherapies (360, 1153). The lat- ter report confirmed that the advantage was larger amongstudies of patients with more severe symptoms and among those with more chronic depressive disorders (1153). D. LACK OF RESPONSE TO PHARMACOTHERAPY IN THE ACUTE PHASE 1. Maximizing initial treatments Several studies have shown improved efficacy with higherdoses of medication, supporting the strategy of increasing the medication dose for patients who do not respond to aninitial trial of a medication. As an example, Bech et al. (1154) conducted a randomized controlled trial in which patients meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder wererandomly assigned to receive placebo or citalopram in doses of 10 mg/day (N=129), T reatment continuedfor 6 weeks, and depressive symptoms were measured by 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, MADRS, Clinical Global Impression, and 56-item Symptom Check-list. The percentages of patients lost to follow-up were 9% for placebo, 7% for citalopram at 60 mg/day (nonsignificant p val- ues). The 10- and 20-mg doses were more efficacious than placebo, but they were inferior to the 40- and 60-mg doses (p<0.05). The 20-, 40-, and 60-mg doses had significantly more side effects than placebo, measured by dropout rates due to side effects (p <0.05). 2. Changing to other treatments The recently completed STAR*D trial examined various strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. STAR*D was a multisite, multistep, prospective random-ized controlled trial comparing treatments and treatment strategies in outpatients with major depressive disorder (48). The study provided data on treatment effectiveness,or \"real world\" outcomes in typical patients, making the results generalizable to standard practice. The study was organized into four levels. In level 1, 2,876 outpatientsreceived citalopram for up to 14 weeks. In level 2, nonre- sponders (N=1,493) were offered three alternatives, which were selected based on patient choice: change to anothermedication (N=727), augment citalopram with another medication (N=565), or start psychotherapy (N=147). If the patient changed to another medication, he or she wasrandomly assigned to receive sertraline, bupropion SR, or venlafaxine XR. Patients who chose medication augmen- tation were randomly assigned to augment citalopramwith bupropion SR or buspirone. Patients who agreed to start psychotherapy were randomly assigned to change to cognitive therapy (discontinuing citalopram) or to aug-ment with cognitive therapy (continuing citalopram). For patients who did not respond to level 2, level 3 offered two alternatives: changing or au gmenting with another medi- cation. Patients in the change group were randomly as- signed to receive mirtazapin e (N=114) or nortriptyline (N=121) for up to 14 weeks. Patients in the augmentation group were randomly assigned to receive lithium (N=69) or triiodothyronine (N=73) for up to 14 weeks. Finally, level 4 randomly assigned nonresponders from level 3to receive tranylcypromine (N=58) or the combination of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

STAR*D therefore provides data for several randomized controlled trials of change or augmentation of me dications at various stages. T wo such studies based on STAR*D data provide evidence for continued efficacy of medication augmentation (429) and medication change (471) for treatment-resistant de- pression. Remission rates were equivalent and approxi- mately 25% upon changing from citalopram to either an SSRI or SNRI or bupropion at the second step; there wasno difference in remission between changing to either mirtazapine or nortriptyline at the third step. A number of previous studies evaluated changing from an SSRI to another SSRI, changing from an SSRI to anSNRI, and changing from an SSRI to bupropion or mir- tazapine. These previous studies were either small in size or, in the vast majority of instances, were neither random- ized nor blinded. A few trials have been conducted inwhich patients who did not respond to an initial antide- pressant medication were changed to a non-MAOI anti- depressant medication from the same pharmacological class(e.g., from one TCA to another) or to one from a different pharmacological class (e.g., from a TCA to an SSRI). Al- though results from these trials have been variable, up to50% of patients have been found to respond (i.e., have symp- tom improvement of at least 50%) to a second non-MAOI antidepressant medication trial\u2014even when the second an-tidepressant was from the same class as the first (421). Data regarding the types of treatment-resistant patients who are most likely to benefit from particular changes in medica-tion are limited. 3. Augmenting and combining treatments T raditionally, augmentation agents with the most evi-dence for efficacy have included lithium and thyroid hor- mone for partial responders to traditional antidepressant medications (1155). Recent studies have significantly ad-vanced the literature now with the two augmentation ran- domized controlled trials in STAR*D (429, 446) and the use of adjunctive aripiprazole (453, 1156). In STAR*D study\u2014lithium augmentation of citalopram was neither particularly well tolerated nor more effective than thyroidaugmentation (446). The second-step augmentation trial in the STAR*D study evaluated the comparative add-on sus-tained-release bupropion and add-on buspirone in pa- tients who had not achieved adequate remission status following an initial trial with citalopram. Both agents asadjuncts were associated wi th remission rates of around 30% on primary outcome measures. Patients who did nothave remission with up to 12 weeks of citalopram ther-apy were as likely to benefit from adjunctive buspirone(15-60 mg/day) as they were to benefit from (150-400 mg/day) (429). However, adjunctive treatment with bupropion SR was superior to adjunctivebuspirone on a number of key secondary measures (224). The findings of 16 placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of second-gen eration antipsychotic augmen- tation therapy for patients with major depression disorder (N=3,480) have recently been evaluated in a meta-analysis (448). Augmentation with a second-generation antipsy-chotic agent was significantly more effective than placebo in terms of rates of response and remission. Although arip- iprazole has received FDA approval as an adjunct to sec-ond-step antidepressant medications for patients who had not achieved satisfactory response to at least two prior an- tidepressant medication trials, this meta-analysis showed no differences in response or remission rates among the in- dividual medications (448). Discontinuation rates for ad-verse effects were also higher in the active augmentation groups compared with placebo, suggesting that such effects need to be taken into consideration when choosing to aug-ment antidepressant response with a second-generation an- tipsychotic agent. T o date, few data from controlled studies address the longer term efficacy or side effects of combin-ing antidepressants and antipsychotics. Combining an SSRI and a TCA induced a rapid anti- depressant response in one preliminary study (1157). In asecond study, patients taking this combination also had a greater likelihood of remission, compared with patients receiving monotherapy with an SSRI or a TCA (1158).The efficacy of combining mi rtazapine and an SSRI was demonstrated in one placebo-controlled study (432). Mir-tazapine and venlafaxine led to a 13.7% remission rate inpatients who had not responded to three prior medication trials as part of the STAR*D study (121). Case reports sug- gest that stimulant medications may be effective adjunctsto antidepressant medication therapy (205), although the re- sults of larger scale clinical trials have not demonstrated efficacy (462, 463). E. CONTINUATION TREATMENT Although randomized controlled trials of antidepressantmedications in the continuation phase are limited, theavailable data indicate that patients treated for a first epi- sode of uncomplicated major depressive disorder who exhibit a satisfactory response to an antidepressant medi-cation should continue to receive a full therapeutic dose of that agent for at least 16-20 weeks after achieving and main- taining full remission (105, 225, 495). T wo clinical trials have examined the effects of contin- uation treatment following an acute course of ECT .

Asubsequent trial found that continuation pharmacother- apy with lithium plus nortriptyline (N=94) was comparable in efficacy to continuation ECT (N=89) in maintainingremission (46.3% versus 46.1%) after a successful acute course of ECT (234). The group receiving medication re- ported a greater number of treatment-emergent side ef-fects than the ECT group, but there were no differences in cognitive impairment reported between the treatment groups. A few studies have examined treatment with psycho- therapeutic interventions administered in the continua-tion phase. One study found that among patients who responded to acute treatment with cognitive therapy, those who continued this treatment over 2 years had lower re-lapse rates than those who did not have continuation treatment (493). Results from a series of studies (365, 367, 494) suggest that CBT may be an effective continuationtreatment following antidepressant medication therapy for preventing relapse (364). In a randomized controlled trial of cognitive group therapy as an adjunct to treatment as usual, Bockting et al.(497) studied 187 patients with recurrent major depressive disorder who were currently in remission. Cognitive grouptherapy was found to be effective in preventing relapse/ recurrence, and this protective effect increased in concert with the number of previous depressive episodes. Hollon et al. (68) assessed 104 patients with major de- pressive disorder who had responded to cognitive therapy,pharmacotherapy, or placebo and had remained improvedduring a 12-month continuation phase. Patients were with- drawn from treatment and followed for an additional 12 months. Cognitive therapy patients, who were allowed nomore than three booster sessions over that year, had a lower rate of relapse (31%) than those withdrawn from medica- tion (76%). They also exhibited no greater likelihood ofdepressive relapse than patients who continued pharma- cotherapy (47%), suggesting possible lasting benefits of cognitive therapy. F. MAINTENANCE TREATMENT The multicenter Prevention of Recurrent Episodes of Depression With Venlafaxine for T wo Years (PREVENT) study was designed to evaluate patients with recurrentunipolar major depressive disorder randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine XR or fluoxetine. At the end of a 10-week acute phase treatment, response rates were 79% forboth venlafaxine XR and fluox etine, with remission and 50%, respectively. In the 6-month contin- uation rates were 90% (venlafaxine XR) 92% (fluoxetine), with rates of sustained remission of 52% and 58%, respectively. The cumulative probability ofrecurrence through the first 12 months of the maintenance phase treatment was 23.1% for venlafaxine and 42% for placebo. The cumulative probability of recurrence throughthe second 12 months of maintenance treatment was 8% in the venlafaxine XR group and 44.8% in the placebo group (226, 1159). There have been fewer investigations of the effectiveness of psychotherapy in the maintenance phase. In one study,maintenance cognitive therapy delivered over 2 years was as effective as maintenance medication for recurrent major depressive disorder (514). Other reports indicate that IPTmay effectively lengthen the interepisode interval for patients with recurrent depression who do not receive medication (289, 314, 513, 1056). Maintenance CBT asaugmentation to medication prevented relapse relative to medication plus treatment as usual (368, 497, 1160). Monthly maintenance psychotherapy with CBASP was more effective over a 1-year period than an assessment-only control condition for patients with chronic depres- sion who had responded to acute treatment and remainedimproved in continuation therapy with CBASP (1161). A 6-year follow-up of patients treated with medication and continuation CBT found weakening but continuing on-going benefits lasting as long as 3.5 years after completing CBT (1162). Research on cognitive therapy has explored the concept of an enduring benefit by acquiring persistentskills that reduce the risk of depressive relapse after treat- ment has ended (68, 1110). The combined use of psychotherapy, such as CBT, cognitive therapy, or IPT, and pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase has also been considered by investi- gators. Some results suggest that the combination of an-tidepressant medications plus psychotherapy may be additionally effective in preventing relapse over treatment with single modalities (314, 365, 506, 515, 516). However,in individuals older than age 70 years who received main- tenance treatment with paroxetine and clinical manage- ment, interpersonal therapy and placebo, paroxetine andinterpersonal therapy, or placebo and clinical manage- ment, the combination of paroxetine and interpersonal therapy offered no benefits over paroxetine and clinicalmanagement and each were superior to the other treat- ment conditions (729). Electroconvulsive therapy has also been used in the maintenance phase. Evidence for its benefits comeslargely from case reports and case series (1163-1168), al- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

The optimal frequency, duration, and method ofdiscontinuing maintenance ECT treatment have not been systematically studied, but typically ECT is tapered grad- ually with a return to more frequent treatments if depres-sive symptoms emerge (501). Part C FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS Notable progress has been made in our understanding ofmajor depressive disorder and its treatment. However,there are still many unanswered questions about optimiz- ing and individualizing treatment. The following areas re- quire additional study. T o \"personalize\" care, and someday even prevent de- pression, we must understand factors that cause it. In thenearer term, science can focus on predictors of benefit andadverse effects of specific treatments. Potential causes of depression or moderators of treatment response may be found through genomics, proteomics, physiological mark-ers, personality traits, personal experiences, co-occurring conditions, or clusters of specific depressive symptoms. Culture, race, and ethnicity merit study in shaping treat-ment selection and predicting response and side effects. Even if science were to offer perfect and personalized treatments for depression, patients must be able to gainaccess to care and adhere to recommended interventions. Thus, research must develop better ways to deliver treat- ment, optimizing effectiveness as well as efficacy. Re-search should also consider the cost-effectiveness of care and effects of treatment on functioning and quality of life. As the U.S. population ages and co-occurring illnessesbecome more common, studies are needed on ways to in- tegrate care for depression with treatment for other psy- chiatric and medical problems. Most studies of major depressive disorder have examined the acute phase of treat-ment. More research is required on the continuation and maintenance phases. Questions abound on the persistenceof biological and psychosoci al treatment effects, when treatment may safely be discontinued, how recurrent de-pression differs from chronic varieties in the long term, andmore. The science of psychotherapy research continues to evolve. We need to understand how specific types of ther-apy compare to one another in the treatment of major de- pressive disorder and how to select a treatment for anindividual. Research must di sentangle nonspecific factorsfrom the unique features of a theoretically derived ap-proach. It would be important to determine the compo-nents of specific psychotherapies that are responsible for efficacy, the patient-specific f actors that moderate the ef- ficacy of these therapies, th e indications for using a par- ticular psychotherapy, and the optimal duration andfrequency of psychotherapy for particular patient sub- groups, types of psychotherapy, or phases of depressiontreatment. Outcome measures of psychotherapy studies should not only examine acute symptom response but also whether psychotherapies have enduring, protective ef-fects in averting relapse and re currence of depression after treatment has ended. A manual-based model of psycho-dynamic therapy for depression (1170) may be helpful inthe development of evidence concerning this approach. Strategies for sequencing psychotherapy in the overall treatment of major depressive disorder and for combiningpsychotherapy (either with pharmacotherapy or another psychotherapy) merit further study. Much work remains to be done on medication inter- vention in depression. We should address the comparative efficacies, relative short- and long-term side effect profiles, and specific clinical indications of different antidepressantmedications, augmentation strategies (e.g., second-gener- ation antipsychotic medications, lithium, thyroid mone) and combination treatment approaches (e.g., SSRIsand other moieties). This would include determining if particular treatments or combinations of treatments have differential efficacy in specific subgroups of patients withdepression (e.g., patients with psychotic depression) and, for medications other than the TCAs, whether relation- ships exist between medication blood levels and thera-peutic responses or side effects. Initial studies of mono- therapy with second-generation antipsychotic agents appear promising, but additional study of the acute and long-termbenefits and side effects is essential. The definition and im- plications of treatment-resistance for treatment selection also requires further clarification. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Approaches to reducing cognitive side effects of ECT, speeding response to ECT , or determining the indi-cations and best methods for maintenance ECT could im- prove patient care. More research is also needed on the optimal approaches (e.g., treatment schedule, stimulationparameters) for delivering newer stimulation therapies. Ad- ditional research on light therapy would be helpful, includ- ing determining its effectiveness as adjunctive treatment innonseasonal major depressive disorder or as a primary treatment for seasonal major depressive disorder in themaintenance phase. Given patients' frequent use of com-plementary therapies, additional research on these thera- pies, including acupuncture, is warranted. Further study ofexercise in acute and maintenance treatment of depression would also be useful, including assessment of the benefits of exercise in minimizing side effects of the other therapiesand in optimizing health, functioning, and quality of life. In time, brain imaging, genomics, proteomics, and other recent advances in neuroscience should help us\"carve nature along its joints,\" allowing major depressive disorder to be broken into discrete diseases with defined and personalized treatments. In the meantime, clinical in- vestigation focused on existing and novel treatment strat- egies remains essential.
