Praise for Gentle Energy Touch: The Beginner's Guide to Hands-On Healing (An Open Center Book) \"Science tells us that energy is real.

This is the book I was looking for thirty years ago when I began my journey as a psychic medium and healer.

This is the secret that is ready to be unleashed, and thanks to Barbara the information is now available to anyone willing to read it.\" \u2014 Sunny Dawn Johnston, author of Invoking the Archangels and The Love Never Ends: Messages from the Other Side \"We all have the power and ability to heal ourselves. Through Barbara, I have discovered what energy work is and can do...within us, and surrounding us. Learning how to engage and shift that energy, has allowed me to embrace a deeper sense of inner calm, balance and peace in my life.\" \u2014 Christina Aguilera \"Barbara Savin is an extraordinary energy healer.

I give her and her book the highest recommendation.\" \u2014 Sharon Norling, MD, MBA, author of Your Doctor Is Wrong \"Barbara Savin is one of the finest energy healers I have ever had the pleasure of working with.

She has a rare blend of compassion, knowledge, and talent that makes her a truly gifted Energy Healer. This book is sure to bring comfort and help to readers.\" \u2014 Steven Tan, MD, MTOM, LAc \"During my first healing session with Barbara, I experienced the strangest thing: I felt her hands on or above my head, for instance, but then she would touch my feet and I realized she was nowhere near my head. Whose hands were those?? I told her what I had experienced and she said, \"it's not just me doing the healing, I ask for help from the angels.\" A few weeks after the session, I looked back and realized how much my life had truly improved in the time since that session with Barbara. I was much happier, more in love, more at peace and more creative and energetic than I had been in a very long time. Barbara and the angels made a huge difference in my life!\" \u2014 Heather Holley, music producer and songwriter \"Barbara has been a Godsend in helping my patients heal patterns that were dormant, unconscious, or generally out of their reach. Her gentle demeanor and kindness compliment the directness in her work. She has taught many of my clients energy healing and has helped them on all levels to heal.\" \u2014 Dr. David Shirazi, DDS, MS, MA, LAc \"Consider the knowledge you are about to acquire a gift. Consider it the first step in your journey of self-discovery, enlightenment and spiritual healing. When we learn how to heal our bodies and our minds, and love others and ourselves, is when we truly grow and mature spiritually. With each step, we get closer to our true goal of reconnecting with the Divine. With love and enlightenment to you all.\" \u2014 Joan Mazzeo-Little, RN, Gentle Energy Touch Master/Teacher, North Carolina \"At a very stressful time in my life, Barbara was there to offer me energy healing, and I accepted. It helped me clear my mind, relax, gain composure of my emotions, and give me permission to refocus the direction of my life. During one session I felt tingling throughout my whole body, and another time I saw a white light completely engulf me, and then felt a complete calm wash over me. After several sessions, Barbara taught me how to do energy healing on myself. A great benefit of energy healing is that it can be taught to individuals for self-care, thus encouraging them to take responsibility for their own well-being and state of health. What a gift. Energy Healing is a wonderful means to help yourself and others. Barbara, thank you. Lots of love and light.\" \u2014 Leia Stathakos, MD, Brooklyn, New York \"Barbara's Energy Healing book is extremely informative and helpful on multiple levels. She explains the modality extremely well. The material is educational and user friendly.\" \u2014 Diany Klein, vice president, human resources, Community Memorial Health System \"Barbara Savin grew up in a world of energy healing. Her Grandma Jenny was good at it. When her grandmother died, she tried to leave that world behind, but increasingly-challenging health issues kept pushing her back to it. When she finally acquiesced, her life and her career changed. Over the past two decades she has become one of the most notable energy healers in the country. She is convinced that anyone can learn to do what she does. Gentle Energy Touch is the protocol she developed to teach people how to do that. No elaborate lifestyle changes or expensive courses are required. The core of the practice is unblocking and enhancing life force energy. Your customers will find exercises for learning to sense energy, for protecting themselves, and for opening to the flow of healing energy -- as well as suggested hand positions for healing themselves and others. Thorough and well-intentioned, this is a complete, clearly-written manual for anyone interested in energy healing.\" \u2014 Anna Jedrziewski, Retailing Insight, Feb/March 2016 \"Dear Barbara, when I met you, I felt we were on the same plane and was very glad to have found a new friend. I had no idea how good a healer you truly were until we had a session. You read my body and assessed the situations, dental issues, and identified the pain in my neck discussed the issues, and then the pain went away. I felt like I was hypnotized at some points, being aware of everything you were saying. Then you said there was a woman nearby with short brunette hair. It was my dearly departed Mother (d.1982), I could feel her too. That was exciting for me as well. I know that you have helped many others with your talented healing powers and would recommend you to anyone who wants to have sessions or you teaching them energy healing.\" \u2014 Shelley R. Kramer, Director of the Cancer Prevention Coalition for Los Angeles Healthy-Communications.com \"This clear and concise energy-healing handbook is a standout among a plethora of similar tomes.\" \u2014 Marcy Emmer Graham, Whole Life Times \"Barbara is a true healer. She tuned right into my needs in a gentle and compassionate way. After meeting with her, my body, mind, and spirit felt lighter and clearer. I have recommended many people to her and all have felt as I do about her amazing talents.\" \u2014 Sue Glasscock, Owner, The Ranch at Live Oak Malibu \"This helpful primer provides everything a reader needs to know to embrace the practice of gentle energy healing.\" \u2014 Publishers Weekly "}
