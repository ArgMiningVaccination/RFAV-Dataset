While details of the case remain unclear, Dror Rotkowitz, 56, was charged two weeks after complaints were filed by the women to police. According to police, Rotkowitz opened the downtown \"Natural Health Clinic\" on Hillel Street in 2008 shortly after studying alternative medicine overseas and designating himself a doctor. Rotkowitz primarily treated ultra-Orthodox women from the capital and allegedly falsely claimed he received approval from the haredi rabbinate and leadership to practice holistic medicine. The women allege that he repeatedly sexually assaulted them while claiming it was part of his holistic treatment plan. All four victims said when they protested, Rotkowitz assured them that the sexual acts were necessary to cure their ailments. His office was shut down shortly after police began investigating the complaints. "}
