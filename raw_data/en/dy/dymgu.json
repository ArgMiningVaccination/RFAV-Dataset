English description SACRED PSILOCYBIN CEREMONY This journey with psilocybin is an invitation to go within. I want to invite you to let go of that which no longer serves you. And to step into the memory of who we are, that which we are all a part of. Psilocybin amplifies what's already inside you. It shines light on that which demands attention. The human mind has an incredible capacity for adaptation and evolution. The new skills we can learn, the memories we can hold and release, the trauma we can process and heal from... Sometimes it seems like there is no limit to our cognitive potential. What is Psilocybin? Psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychoactive mushrooms, has formed the spiritual and cultural foundation of many great civilizations. The Aztecs referred to teonan\u00e1catl, which translates as \"divine mushroom.\" Research on psychedelics shows that the psychedelic experience can catalyze a profound personal transformation. Under the influence of psilocybin, the brain creates a feedback loop of neuroactivity and release of neurotransmitters (the chemical messengers neurons use to communicate). It allows neurons to work through connections it normally doesn't use. The brain becomes more flexible and unique. It helps boost neuroplasticity in our brains, which can help us make positive changes in our lives. We make associations that we normally wouldn't and become more creative. We discover completely new ways of thinking about the world and ourselves, expanding our consciousness. Mother Nature, with all her love, has given us this profound medicine. I am here to assist you with this introduction, or perhaps reunion. And to help you get acquainted with your own inner healer. Change is inherent in life. How life changes can be your own choice. Are you ready to take matters into your own hands? The Work The work you give yourself consists of 2 weeks. Preparation A week before the ceremony, your preparation starts with a 1:1 video consultation. Based on this, I will give you homework that is tailored to you. This prepares you for your journey. You can do this in addition to your daily routine. The ceremony The ceremony itself takes up a full day and consists of: - Opening of the circle - Burn ritual - High dose of psilocybin - Sound bath - Live music provided by Nina & musician - Light meal afterwards - Closing the circle You will spend the first part of the ceremony comfortably lying down with an eye mask on. The omission of vision stimulates your other senses and helps you go deeper within. The integration Integration is just as important as preparation. That is why you will receive a final 1:1 video consultation a week after the ceremony. Through this method, the experience can integrate into your daily life and help you with the transition and transformation. A note of caution: If you have heart problems, serious psychological problems or psychoses, or if you use antidepressants or lithium.
