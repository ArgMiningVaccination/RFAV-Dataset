Additionally, if you have a difficult time locating certain herbs, there is an herb exchange available at the bottom of the herbalism page where you can trade a bundle of 3 of the same type of herb for any alternate herb. Below is a table of every herb, including what they are used for and where you can find them. When an herb is listed as being in a certain biome, this means that it can both be foraged there as well as found there while exploring normally. |Herbs| |Image||Item Name||Recipes||Biomes| | | Aloe | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Desert, Swamp, and Rainforest| | | Arnica | | - Cure-For-All (1) |All Biomes| | | Bearberry | | - Constipation Cure (1) |Deciduous Forest, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Taiga, and Tundra| | | Boneset | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, Taiga, and Swamp| | | Buffaloberry | | - Constipation Cure (1) |Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Taiga| | | Burning Bush | | - Constipation Cure (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, and Riparian Woodland| | | Carrionflower | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Riparian Woodland, and Taiga| | | Cedar Bark | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Every biome expect Taiga, Tundra, and Glacier| | | Chaparral | | - Antidote (3) |Desert| | | Charcoal | | - Diarrhea Cure (3) |All biomes| | | Dandelion | | - Cystitis Cure (1) |All biomes| | | Feverfew | | - Heatstroke Remedy (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Rainforest| | | Garlic | | - Tapeworm Remedy (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Swamp| | | Ginger | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Taiga| | | Goldenseal | | - Cough Cure (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Coniferous Forest, and Riparian Woodland| | | Guaiacum | | - Distemper Cure (1) |Swamp and Rainforest| | | Kava | | - Cough Cure (1) |Rainforest| | | Mullein | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Desert| | | Oregano | | - Infection Balm (1) |Mountains, Prairie, Desert, Swamp, and Rainforest| | | Pineapple Leaf | | - Cough Cure (1) |Rainforest| | | Redwood Sorrel | | - Cystitis Cure (1) |Mountains, Coniferous Forest, and Swamp| | | Spoonwood | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Riparian Woodland, and Swamp| | | St. John's Wort | | - Infection Balm (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Swamp| | | Tansy | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Deciduous Forest, Grasslands, Mountains, Coniferous Forest, Prairie, Riparian Woodland, and Desert| | | Tobacco | | - Ear Mites Ointment (1) |Mountains, Prairie, and Desert| | | Tumeric | | - Cure-For-All (1) |Swamp, Rainforest| | | Winterfat | | - Ear Mites Ointment (1) |Mountains, Prairie, and Desert| | | Yarrow | | - Mange Salve (1) |All biomes| November Herbs[ ] The following herbs can only be obtained during the month of November for the Coigreach event, and they can only currently be used for crafting nesting materials. The [Coigreach announcement](https://www.wolvden.com/chatter/topic/551544) indicates that they may be used for something more in the 2022 event, but this was later proven to not be the case when they, again, had no use in 2022. All of these herbs can be found by foraging in November, from unique November explore encounters or by winning a battle against a wolf carrying an herb while exploring in November. | | Elder | | Elfwort | | English Marigold | | Evening Primrose | | Meadowsweet | | Nettle Leaves | | Vervain | | White Clover | | Woad | | Wood Betony Medicine[ ] Medicines are items used to cure wolves from certain [illnesses](/wiki/Herbalism) or to restore HP. In addition, all common medicines provide a 1-day immunity to illnesses and a cure-for-all provides a 3-day immunity to illnesses. Medicine can be crafted by the herbalist using herbs. They must first be learned how to be crafted, which gives a single use medicine and takes a longer period of time to finish. After learning how to craft them, herbalists will be able to craft double use medicines, this takes different amounts of time depending on your herbalist's level. The higher the level, the shorter the crafting/research time. When you remove an herbalist from their role, or they die, your wolves will forget some recipes. You will have to relearn these recipes normally with your new herbalist. It does not tell you when you switch herbalists that recipes have been lost. You have to check your user log to see which ones were forgotten. The maximum number of recipes that an herbalist may forget is three. Restoring the same herbalist to the position will not restore the recipes. |Medicines| |Image||Item Name||Use||Ingredients| | | Antidote |An antidote used for curing a Snakebite, crafted by skilled paws.||3 Chaparral| | | Constipation Cure |An elixir used for curing Constipation, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Bearberry | 1 Pineapple Leaf | | Cough Cure |An elixir used for curing all kinds of Cough, crafted by skilled paws.|| | 1 Goldenseal 1 Kava 1 Pineapple Leaf | | Cure-For-All |This miracle cure will instantly heal any disease for your chosen wolf!||1 Boneset | 1 Spoonwood | | Cystitis Cure |An elixir used for curing Cystitis, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Kava| 1 Redwood Sorrel 1 Dandelion | | Diarrhea Cure |An elixir used for curing Diarrhea, crafted by skilled paws.||3 Charcoal| | | Distemper Cure |An elixir used for curing Distemper, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Guaiacum| 1 Mullein 1 Goldenseel | | Ear Mites Ointment |An ointment used for getting rid of Ear Mites, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Carrionflower| 1 Winterfat 1 Tobacco | | Fleas Remedy |A remedy used for getting rid of Fleas, crafted by skilled paws.||3 Tobacco| | | Healing Salve |This salve is used to heal some of the smaller injuries your wolves may gain. | (Restores 10HP) |1 Charcoal| 1 Dandelion | | Heatstroke Remedy |A used to treat Heatstroke, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Feverfew| 1 Winterfat 1 Ginger | | Hepatitis Cure |An elixir used for curing Hepatitis, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Boneset| 1 Spoonwood 1 Dandelion | | Infection Balm |A balm used for healing Infections, crafted by skilled paws.||1 St. John's Wort| 1 Oregano 1 Feverfew | | Influenza Cure |An elixir used for curing all kinds of Influenza, crafted by skilled paws.||2 Pineapple Leaf| 2 Guaiacum | | Mange Salve |A salve used for healing Mange, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Tobacco| 1 Arnica 1 Yarrow | | Open Wound Salve |A salve used for healing an Open Wound, crafted by skilled paws.||1 St. John's Wort| 1 Winterfat 1 Yarrow | | Pox Balm |A balm used for healing all kinds of Pox, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Redwood Sorrel| 1 Oregano 1 Yarrow | | Rich Healing Salve |This salve will heal a large amount of HP for your chosen wolf. | (Restores 20HP) |3 Chaparral| 3 Aloe 3 Buffaloberry 3 Burning Bush 3 Charcoal | | Ringworm Salve |A salve used for healing Ringworm, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Oregano| 1 Turmeric 1 Aloe | | Tapeworm Remedy |A remedy used for getting rid of Tapeworms, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Bearberry| 1 Garlic 1 Tansy | | Tick Remedy |A remedy used for getting rid of Ticks, crafted by skilled paws.||1 Garlic| 1 Cedar Bark 1 Tobacco "}
