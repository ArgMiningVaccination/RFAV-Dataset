Detoxing. Cleansing. Both are wildly popular in health and wellness, yet is detoxing a real thing and how do our bodies begin to tell us that we do, indeed, need to consume copious amounts of green juice? At Lee Acupuncture, we are a medical facility that fuses functional medicine with Chinese modalities such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs for optimal wellness that gets to the root of your health issues. Follow along in today's post and learn more about the signs your body may be craving some extra detox support. What is Your Body Saying? There is no doubt that our environment is getting more and more toxic \u2014 from indoor and outdoor pollutants to the amount of chronic stress we carry around. Perhaps the question you should be asking is not which detox you should start but when! We can all use a little extra support and by knowing what to look for you can embark detox that is obliging and beneficial for your body. Nonstop cravings. If you seem to be snacking more than usual and you have an insatiable craving for sweet or salty treats, this typically indicates that something is off. Take a look at your diet, are you eating a lot of processed foods that send your blood sugar on a dangerous rollercoaster of highs and lows? The more you can wean yourself from processed foods the better you may feel, and you may even see your cravings decrease. Stress is ever-present. We all have stress, because well, life is stressful! It's the chronic stress that becomes dangerous. If you're having a difficult time managing your stress levels, functional medicine and acupuncture can be helpful combined with a detox to help you get healthier. Not only is a food-based cleansed recommended but a digital detox as well! Digestive difficulties. When you're digestion is off and you experience symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, not only do they disrupt your life, but they indicate something else may be going on. Working with an acupuncturist or functional medicine doctor, they can guide you through a cleanse that will address your gut-health. Even just a day of drinking bone broth can help settle your GI tract and help reset your digestion. Everyday allergies. Perhaps you've gotten older and your allergies may have only been seasonal in the past, and are now something you deal with on a daily basis. You may not know it, but your sinuses are intimately connected to your gut health so if you see an uptick in your allergies, your body may need some additional support. Healthy eating isn't helping. People who do everything right such as eating healthy and exercising can still benefit from a cleanse. You may have a food sensitivity that elicits a response, or something may just not agree with your body. Work with a health care professional to determine if you have any food allergies or sensitivities, and then incorporate a cleanse to assist and support your liver. Your body is intelligent and often shows signs before you even realize there is an issue. Perhaps you resonate with some of these signs but if you still need more information, stay tuned for part two as we reveal even more signs! Feel your best now!
