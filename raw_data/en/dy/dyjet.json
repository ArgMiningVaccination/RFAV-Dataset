Why is this important? Wealth of data on potential mechanisms often not taken into account. Methods for combining information from human, animal and cell studies are lacking. Need to identify gaps in the research. Milestones Develop a method for searching for relevant mechanisms Develop a method for systematically reviewing specific mechanisms Test the methodology above using a case study Analytical approach Large multi-disciplinary group 5 workshops -mixture of presentations with discussion, small group exercises, round table discussions On going searches, and development of methods, feedback to members of the team Regular meetings between PIs and research associates Searching for studies Incorporate an exhaustive list of mechanistic targets (intermediate phenotypes-eg hallmarks of cancer, hormones etc) Three sets of searches: Exposure-Outcome (E O) Exposure-Intermediate phenotype (E IP) Intermediate phenotype and Outcome (IP O) Introducing TeMMPo: Text Mining for Mechanism Prioritisation -Tom Gaunt Identifies co-occurrence of MESH headings in scientific publications to indicate papers that link an intermediate mechanism to either an exposure or an outcome. https://www.temmpo.org.uk/ Step 9: Synthesis of supporting evidence from in vitro and xenograft models underpinning biological plausibility Step 8: Integrate human and animal studies to develop an evidence based conclusion Step 7: Assess strength of overall body of evidence for human and animal studies separately Step 6: Synthesis of data from individual studies Step 5: Assess the quality of individual studies Step 4: Extract data Step 3: Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria, including an assessment of relevance Step 2: Search for studies Step 1: Specify research objectives Cell line and animal studies where a tumour is transplanted into the animal model Supportive evidence from in vitro and xenograft models underpinning biological plausibility Question 1 - Has the cancer arisen in the animal model rather than being transplanted into the animal?. Wider potential impact Apply this to WCRF systematic review of diet, physical activity and cancer Apply this to other systematic reviews of cancer Apply this to research on other diseases Strengths Allows identification of potential mechanisms Quantity and quality of data on specific mechanisms can be assessed Data from human and animal studies can be assessed together Will help to identify gaps in the research Current gaps / priorities Ability to identify pathways rather than single intermediates Ability to identify mechanisms using completely hypothesis free approaches Further automation to speed up process (eg using text mining for RoB) Future research Incorporate changes recommended by validation studies Marty Weijenberg -G\u00f6khan Audrey Jung, Charlotte Le Cornet WCRF funded project -Diet and prostate cancer - mechanistic reviews of BMI and Vit D and PC Integrative Cancer Epidemiology - ICEP funded by CRUK - ongoing mechanistic reviews and work on methodology - Julian Higgins The Team PI- Dr Sarah Lewis -Genetic epidemiology Co-PI- Prof Richard Martin -Epidemiology Dr Mona Jeffreys- Cancer Epidemiology Dr Mike Gardner - Animal biology/systematic reviews Prof Jeff Holly- Molecular biology - IGF and cancer Dr Claire Perks - Molecular biology DrTom Gaunt - Bioinformatics Prof Jonathan Sterne- Systematic review methodology Professor Julian Higgins -Evidence synthesis Prof SteveThomas -Head and neck cancer surgeon Dr Pauline Emmett - Nutritional epidemiology Dr Kate Northstone - Nutritional Epidemiology Cath Borwick - Librarian/ Search strategies Sean Harrison- PhD student Rosie Lennon-PhD student VanessaTan- PhD student University of Cambridge Dr SuzanneTurner- Animal models WCRF Prof MartinWiseman Dr Pangiota Mitrou Dr RachelThompson IARC Dr Sabina Rinaldi- Hormones and cancer "}
