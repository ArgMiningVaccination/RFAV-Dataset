Shakti in essence means power, energy or creative force. Most specifically, Shakti refers to ruling or executive power, the power of guidance and decision making. Shakti is most commonly known in the West for its connection to feminine energy as the creative and transformative powers of Mother Nature and Mother Earth. We can say that Shakti is the basis of the special powers inherent in nature, but including the powers of the Self-nature, Atma-Shakti, not just the world of nature or Prakriti Shakti. There are many healing powers or Shakis in nature relative the qualities and properties and energies that make up the various forces, objects and beings in nature, including in realms or lokas beyond the physical, extending to the Transcendent. Shaktis as Powers of Nature In this article we will introduce and explore the place of the Shaktis of Nature in Ayurvedic Healing. This will provide a new way of looking at Ayurveda, health, disease, and various types of treatment starting with diet and herbs. To get anything done properly we need the right empowerment, preparation or capacity in order to apply the necessary forces to achieve the aimed at result. We need to be able to recognize and apply the right Shakti as per the particular condition or situation involve, which may be changing. The general rule is that we apply the necessary force to counter imbalances and promote positive change. Shakti refers to the unique or primary power that an object or force inherently possesses. For example, fire has the power to burn or Dahana Shakti, which has various usages, from cooking food to burning down a house. Water has the complementary power to moisten or Kledana Shakti, which has hydrating and nutritive powers, but can also drown us. For healing to occur we must energize the right healing Shakti to counter or balance the disease causing forces and conditions. Mother Nature has many healing Shaktis in the five elements, three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), the influences of the sky and atmosphere, minerals, plants, herbs and foods, as well as in nature's Prana. Everything in nature rightly used has a power of healing, but wrongly used can cause harm, just as in the case of fire. Shaktis in Ayurveda for Body and Mind Foods have their properties to provide nutrition or Anna Shakti. These occur relative to the tissues that they build up and their corresponding physiological systems, like blood as a tissue and its circulatory process through the heart. Herbs have their own pranic energetics or Oshadhi Shakti. For example, spicy herbs like ginger, cinnamon, sage or tulsi have a diaphoretic or sweat-inducing effect, which is Svedana Shakti, making them useful in sweating therapies in Ayurveda, particularly good for countering Kapha dosha, colds and various respiratory and circulatory ailments. Oils like sesame, coconut, mustard and castor have a Snehana Shakti, a power of oleation, making them the key substances used in oil applications starting with oil massage, particularly good for countering Vata dosha. Ayurvedic herbal energetics of taste (rasa), heating affects (virya) and special actions (prabhava) are types of Shakti at an herbal level. Prabhava or special potency is perhaps the most important Shakti of herbs. For example, certain special herbs have unique powers of Rejuvenation or Rasayana formula Chyavan Prash. They aid in the deepest level of healing and revitalization. Healing Shaktis also exist at a subtle level as highlighted in Yoga texts and in Ayurvedic psychology, particularly through the power of mantra or Mantra Shakti. Such seed mantras have the power to change the energies and heal the mind and emotions. For some examples: The power of Yogic action and transformation, or Kriya Shakti, is connected to the seed mantra Kreem and Ma Kali. The power of attraction and devotion, or Aakarshana Shakti relates to the seed mantra Kleem and Tripura Sundari Devi. Such seed mantras have the power to change the energies and heal the mind and emotions. Meditation has its own power or Dhyana Shakti, which arises through the power of concentration or Dharana Shakti. These are wakened by steady practice, detachment, discernment and turning the mind within in. Without these inner Shaktis, meditation cannot be effectively practiced. Healing Shakti of the Healer Yet the healer must have an inner power of healing of his or her own to really help others. This begins with their own Prana Shakti or vital energy, notably their connection with the inner unitary cosmic Prana. Prana Shakti is developed through Pranayama and natural living overall. It also gives the power or Shakti of therapeutic touch, Sparshana Shakti. Very important also is Ojas or the power of both physical and psychological immunity, Kshamatva Shakti, including patience and calm. Most significant in diagnosis is Prajna Shakti or the power of wisdom and experiential knowledge, arising from a Sattvic Buddhi necessary for right treatment and proper guidance. In short, there is an entire Vedic science of healing powers or healing Shaktis within us and in the world of nature around us that we need to learn to be able to truly facilitate deep healing and know what healing substances and attitudes to employ. These healing Shaktis are all gifts of Mother Nature (Prakriti) extending back to the Supreme Shakti or power of Consciousness (Chit-Shakti) that is the ultimate power of the Universal Mother, Parashakti. We can contact them through special actions, substances or states of mind, depending upon their nature. Remember to see the inner healing power or Chikitsa Shakti to contact the healing potential in what we are doing. We teach these in our courses, books and programs. Dr. David "}
