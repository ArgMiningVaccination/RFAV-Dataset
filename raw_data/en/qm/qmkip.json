I am trying to do the best for my kid and wanted your feedback. She has thick fluid in her ear, and the ENT suggests an antibiotic to break up the fluid proteins, etc... stuff I am not understanding. Her hearing technically is affected, although she is not showing it, and there is no damage, but as long as the fluid is there, she has hearing loss, even if it is for sounds that are really very low... I wonder if you have any herbal and/or homeopathic suggestions for me to read up and look into? I am a big follower of your FB posts and I thank you so much for the awesome work you do <3 Dr. A: Hi Lovely Mama! Thank you for writing. Yes, you are asking a great question and brava in questioning whether every antibiotic prescription is necessary. While antibiotics are generally not considered necessary for what is called \"otitis with effusion\" - fluid in the ear without signs of infection pediatricians considers it reasonable and appropriate to try an antibiotic if there's long-term fluid - weeks to months of it- that isn't otherwise resolving. In my practice, in the absence of infection, I generally try natural remedies for 2 to 4 weeks to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, and only if after that time the fluid hasn't cleared up, do I consider antibiotics. Look for the Root Causes Whenever there is fluid in the ears, I also want to consider underlying causes. Allergies are the most common - something in the environment or foods. I usually recommend a couple of weeks removing juice, dairy, and sometimes gluten-containing products. Often just removing juice and dairy helps tremendously. For more on allergies in kids and additional supplements, and also on otitis media with effusion, my online kids' courses, [Healthy All Year](http://healthiestkids.com/healthy-all-year/), and [The Allergy Epidemic](http://healthiestkids.com/the-allergy-epidemic/) are a high value - chock full of info on these topics, and pretty affordable - if you want to take a deeper dive. Natural Remedies for Otitis with Effusion NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine) There is very good data on its safety and effectiveness for exactly this purpose in children and adults. A typical dose is anywhere from 300 mg to 900 mg, daily, depending on the child's age, and up to three times daily may be needed and is considered safe. NAC is available in health food stores, and online, and may take several weeks to work. You can open the capsules for young kids and put the powder into some applesauce. Quercetin + Freeze-Dried Stinging Nettles These are natural antihistamines from food and herbal sources that don't overly dry you out, or cause side effects like drowsiness. Eyebright is another classic used for fluid in the ears. It can be given in tincture form and can be used in conjunction with NAC. Kids' Fire Cider Kids' Fire Cider, a recipe you'll find in my children's herbal course, is great for opening up the sinus passages, and can be used for kids 5 and over. Herbal Steams Consider doing an herbal steam each day for 3-5 days to help loosen the congestion in the ear canals. To do one: turn the shower on full heat, toss a washcloth with a few drops of oregano, thyme, or peppermint essential oil on a washcloth under the running water and close the bathroom door so steam builds up for about 5 minutes. Then take your child into the bathroom (not into the shower) to inhale the steam for 5-10 minutes. Kid Friendly Fire Cider Recipe Ok. This stuff is no joke - it's got a punch. And it takes only about 10 minutes to prepare, but 1-2 weeks to \"mature,\" so make it ahead of time. In our house, \"putting up remedies\" is something I typically do in the spring and fall, natural herb harvest times. But you can put up some Fire Cider any time you get the itch to make some. I've modified this recipe to take out some of the sting and bite. But we all know those kids who like spicy foods and foods that pack a flavor punch. My granddaughter's favorite first food was \"spicy pad thai.\" Go figure! Have fun with this - once you make your own first batch, you'll see how easy it is and you can play with your own recipes and even have your kiddos make up their own faves! Most of us pay tribute to herbalist Rosemary Gladstar for popularizing Fire Cider. There are now as many recipes as there are herbalists and crafty mommas! Ingredients - 1/4 cup peeled and shredded/diced ginger root - \u00bc cup peeled and shredded/diced horseradish root (if available, or skip) - 2 TBS diced fresh turmeric (if you can get it, or double the amount of ginger) - 1/2 cup white onion, chopped - 2 TBS minced fresh garlic - 2 cinnamon sticks - Zest and juice from 2 organic lemons - Raw apple cider vinegar - Raw, organic honey to taste Pack all of the herbal ingredients into a 1-pint mason jar. Cover the herbs plus 2 inches over with apple cider vinegar and lemon juice. The important thing is to keep the ingredients immersed in the liquid, so you might need to \"top if off\" once every few days over the 2 weeks it's \"working.\" Place in a dark cabinet away from heat for 3 to 5 days weeks. After that time, strain the whole thing thoroughly, and mix in \u00bd to 1 cup of good quality honey. Put into a clean jar and store in the fridge. It will keep for 4 weeks. Dose: This is for kids 5 and over because it packs a spicy punch. Give 1/2-2 tsp depending on age. Kids can take it right off the spoon or mixed in 1/4 cup of water. It's an acquired taste and not all kids will go for it.
