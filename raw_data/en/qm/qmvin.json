There are many issues that effect the immune system including: In this article I describe each of these factors and steps to change them. I lay out a step-by-step approach for life style changes and supplements that boost or support the immune system. One of the best ways to optimize the immune system is through regular immune boosting practices. These include light to moderate exercise, meditation, quality sleep, and a healthy diet. For information about sleep see: [Sleep 101: The Basics](/treat-lyme-book/sleep-101-the-basics). For information about diet see [The Best Brain, Inflammation, Pain, and Detox Diet Ever](/guide/the-best-brain-inflammation-pain-energy-and-detox-diet-ever). Although exercise is generally good, if done in excess it too can suppress the immune system. So exercise to tolerance only. Experiment to see what amount and intensity of exercise does not leave you more tired or in pain the next day. For some in the beginning of treatment any amount of exercise is too much. Support for the immune system starts by providing the building blocks it needs which are free of environmental toxins. A diet rich in whole (non-processed) organic foods provides essential micronutrients for immune function and optimal liver and kidney detoxification. However, a healthy diet alone does not provide adequate levels of essential micronutrients for those with chronic Lyme disease. Compared to the past, the earth is less micronutrient dense. For this reason a well balanced multivitamin with minerals plus amino acids is essential. Of all the toxins, emotional stress is the most poisonous. The emotional stress of this illness is difficult. In addition many have histories of sexual or emotional abuse and trauma that is unresolved. In some instances I have seen effective counseling as the factor that leads to major health improvement. If these are your issues get the help of a counselor. It could be the thing that most changes your health. Cytokines are made when immune cells are stimulated by germs, oxidizing agents, cytokines, toxins, and other agents. These inflammatory agents stimulate white blood cell production and improve white blood cell function to fight infections. However, in Lyme disease too may are made. Excess cytokines cause many problems. This includes suppression of the immune system. Read [Control Cytokines: A Guide to Fix Lyme Symptoms & The Immune System](https://www.treatlyme.net/guide/cytokines) Low thyroid and adrenals are common in chronic Lyme disease. Both of these hormones help the immune system run effectively. Read [Heat Up, Speed Up: About Thyroid & Adrenals](/guide/heat-up-speed-up-about-thyroid-adrenals) and [Hypothyroidism. The Best Tests, Meds, & Vitamins](/guide/hypothyroidism-lyme-disease) for more information about this topic. Many things in the environment suppress the immune system. These include pesticides, insecticides, heavy metals, and poor quality air and water. Emotional and biologic toxins also suppress the immune system. See [Detoxification 101: The Basics](/guide/lyme-detoxification-101-the-basics) for more information on how to deal with toxins. For information on treating infections see the chapter [Infection Treatment Plans for Lyme Disease](/guide/topics/infection-treatment-plans). In my experience from when I practiced in Seattle, it is best to focus initially on treating Other infections like the chronic viruses will often get better as the immune system is able to deal with them more effectively after these infections are treated and the other basic recommendations below are put in place. Here is a list of supplements that may help. Consider the recommendations above about: Take the multivitamin and curcumin. Start either general transfer factors or the multi-variety mushroom mix. Consider doing this especially if there is a history of repeat colds and other viral infections prior to beginning treatment. For information about chronic virus infections like HHV-6, EBV, or CMV infections and a full treatment approach see [Kills Viruses: A Brief Guide](/guide/kills-viruses-a-brief-guide/). For immune support during the chronic viral infection treatment use both reishi mushrooms, thymic protein A, and targeted transfer factors for viruses When treatment for borrelia, bartonella or babesia is going poorly after 6 months of treatment add targeted transfer factors. If babesia, bartonella, or borrelia relapse, then add targeted transfer factors and remain on them once the anti-microbials are stopped. For repeated viral infections like colds and the flu, then add Thymic Protein A and Astragulus Complex. If this does not help then add olive leaf extract.
