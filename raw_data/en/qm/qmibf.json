Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page3 PREAMBLE This manual is meant to provide a working framework for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) programs. This manual is written for students, staff, mentors and preceptors to better understand and im plement the policies and procedures that are specific to Peoria Area EMS System approved programs. The policies of the Peoria Area EMS program s are intended to provide a safe and professional educational experience for EMS students. It is important for ea ch student to understand and follow both the letter and spirit of each policy. From time to time, situations will present themselves which are not covered by specific language of the policies and procedures. In such cases students and their class faculty w ill be guided by best judgment , best practices, professional ethics, and the intent of current policies and procedures. Regardless of written language, students must, at all times, present themselves as a professional member of an elite community. Student s who fail to represent the pride, integrity, and wholesomeness expected of EMS personnel will be considered in violation of policies, whether written or unwritten, and removed from the EMS program. The standards of professionalism of the EMS community wil l be set by program officials and not the student. The P eoria Area EMS System reserves the right to make any revisions, deletions, or additions to the policies or procedures which, in t he opinion of the PAEMS E ducation Coordinator and/or Medical Director, serve in the best interest of the program and its students. If changes from these policies and procedures are necessary, those changes will be noted on the PAEMS website, and/or in notification by email or in writing.

EMS CODE OF ETHICS Professional status as an Emergency Medical Technician is maintained and enriched by the willingness of the individual p ractitioner to accept and fulfill obligations to society, other medical professionals, and the profession of Emergency Medical Technician. As an Emergency Medical Technician, I solemnly pledge myself to the following code of professional ethics: A fun damental responsibility of the Emergency Medical Technician is to conserve life, to alleviate suffering, to promote health, to do no harm, and to encourage the quality and equal availability of emergency medical care. The Emergency Medical Technician pr ovides services based on human need, with respect for human dignity, unrestricted by consideration of nationality, race, creed, color, or status. The Emergency Medical Technician does not use professional knowledge and skills in any enterprise detriment al to the public well -being. The Emergency Medical Technician respects and holds in confidence all information of a confidential nature obtained in the course of professional work unless required by law to divulge such information. The Emergency Medi cal Technician, as a citizen, understands and upholds the law and performs the duties of citizenship; as a professional, the Emergency Medical Technician has the never -ending responsibility to work with concerned citizens and other health care professional s in promoting a high standard of emergency medical care to all people. The Emergency Medical Technician shall maintain professional competence and demonstrate concern for the competence of other members of the Emergency Medical Services health care tea m. An Emergency Medical Technician assumes responsibility in defining and upholding standards of professional practice and education. The Emergency Medical Technician assumes responsibility for individual professional actions and judgment, both in al l aspects of emergency functions, and knows and upholds the laws which affect the practice of the Emergency Medical Technician. An Emergency Medical Technician has the responsibility to be aware of and participate in matters of legislation affecting the Emergency Medical Service System.

The Emergency Medical Technician has an obl igation to protect the public by not delegating to a person less qualified, any service which requires the professional competence of an Emergency Medical Technician. The Emergency Medical Technician will work harmoniously with and sustain confidence in Emergency Medical Technician associates, the nurses, the physicians, and other members of the Emergency Medical Services health care team. The Emergency Medical Technician refuses to participate in unethical procedures, and assumes the responsibility t o expose incompetence or unethical conduct of others to the appropriate authority in a proper and professional manner. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page5 PROGRAM CURRICULUM All PAEMS EMS courses are taught in accordance with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National Sta ndard Curriculum for the EMR, EMT and Paramedic.

ABILITIES RELATING T O ESSENTIAL JOB/SKIL L FUNCTIONS The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 has implications that pertain to licensure or certification. The law permits testing that requires the use of sensory, manual or speaking skills where the tests are Intended to measure essential functions of the profession. For example, an applicant with reading difficulties is require d to take a written exam since the ability to read is an essential function of EMS. Exams are designed at least in part to measure the student's ability to read. Both the ability to read and the ability to perform skills within time frames are essential fu nctions for an EMS provider. Therefore, in EMS, a person with a disability may not be denied the opportunity to take an examination; but this person shall be required to take a written exam and pass the skills proficiency verifications within established c riteria. The Emergency Medical Technician student must have the abilities and skills necessary to provide competent patient care. These skills and abilities include: observation; communication; and behavior/social acceptability. Communication compensation can be made for some handicaps in certain areas, but a student should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary is not acceptable, in that a student's judgment or physical skills must be mediated by someone else's power of observation, selection or action. The following abilities and skills are necessary to meet the requirements of the curriculum: 1. Observation: The student must be able to ob serve a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. 2. Communication: The student must be able to s peak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to provide Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page6 instructions and elicit information. The student must be able to describe changes in mood, activity, posture and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effective ly and empathetically with patients. Communication includes speech as well as reading and writing. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. 3. Motor: Students s hould have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other assessment procedures. A student must have sufficient motor skills to gain access to patients in a variety of care settings and to m anipulate equipment central to lifesaving procedures. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movement, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. A student must also be prepared to care for patients unde r inclement weather and varied environmental conditions. The student must be able to maintain adequate physical conditioning as to not put himself, the patient or team members in jeopardy. 4. Intellectual -Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem -solving, the critical skills demanded of all health professionals, requires all of these intellectual abilities. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A student mu st possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and e ffective relationships with people. Students must be able to adapt to changing environment, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern f or others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities necessary for members of the health profession. All students enrolled in the EMT Program must possess those intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities re quired to undertake the curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the PAEMS System for safe professional practice. Any student with a learning disability that will require additional accommodations to be made must notify the course instructor or PAEMS Education Coordinator prior to the commencement of the Program. CLASSROOM (DIDACTIC) ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all classes and hospital/field clinical experiences are essential to the learning process and expected of all students. Student paperwork, instructor/student expectations, and important course information is normally disseminated during the first meeting of the class, therefore attendance to the first class is essential and mandatory for all student wishing to enroll in a PAEMS EMT course. Attendance records are maintained for all EMT courses. Excessive absenteeism is grounds f or dismissal and is defined as 1 abse nce from EMD, EMR, or PHRN course, 2 from the EMT course and 3 from the Paramedic course. It is the student 's responsibility to be aware of this attendance policy and arrange for any make up work missed due to illness or emergency. All outside appointments must be scheduled at times other than during assigned EMT experiences, including class, hospital and fiel d clinical experiences. In case of prolonged absences because of illness, accident, or hospitalization, students should notify their respective course instructor. Excessive absence is the most common cause of failing grades and may hinder the student from completing course objectives. A student who does not satisfactorily complete the objectives of any EMT course will be withdrawn from the Program. TARDINESS Showing up even a few minutes late may mean missing important class information plus tardiness di srupts a class in progress. More importantly, it demonstrates a lack of professionalism, respect and commitment to the EMS program. Students are expected to be on time and prepared to work at time of scheduled class starting time. Any student a rriving in t he classroom after the scheduled start of class is considered tardy. If a student arrives 1 - 60 minutes late they will be marked as tardy . Students arriving more than 60 minutes late are considered absent for that class day . This tardy policy will be applie d to students leaving sessions early. Two (2) occurrences of tardiness will constitute 1 absence. COURSE TUITION AND FEES Course tuition and fees are published on www.paems.org along with the course signup sheet. All tuition and fees must be paid for p rior to the course beginning unless other arrangements have been made through PAEMS office. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page7 HEALTH PROBLEMS The student with a pre -existing controlled health problem such as back problems, hypertension, diabetes, or seizure disorders should notify the Co urse Instructor and Hospital/Field Clinical Instructor. The student who develops a health problem or is taking prescription/nonprescription medication that may affect academic or clinical/field performance may continue in the Program provided the student: 1. Submits a written statement from a physician regarding the nature of the health problem, the nature and the duration of restriction, and the student's ability to continue in the Program to the Course Coordinator; 2. If absent for two (2) or more clinical/fiel d days, provides a release from his/her physician before returning to clinical/field education experiences; 3. Meets all clinical/field and academic objectives and requirements. Any condition that restricts the student's ability to perform Program objectives or necessitates alternate assignments may result in an alteration of the student's graduation date until such time as assignments can be completed. Student options include (1) Program withdrawal with request for readmission into Program sequence or (2) c ontinuation in Program sequence with possible extension of educational period. EMERGENCY CLOSINGS Classes (including clinical experiences) will meet as scheduled unless inclement weather or other emergency circumstances create conditions that necessitate closing. Contact the course instructor, the hospital/field clinical instructor, or the class location to check on cancellations. TESTS AND EXAMINATIO NS PAEMS utilizes EMSTESTING.com for most summative examinations within the paramedic program. Evaluation of students must be conducted on a recurrent basis and with sufficient frequency as to provide both the student and the instructor indications as to the progress of the student. Dates of written and practical examinations are identifi ed in the class schedule that is distributed to each student at the beginning of the semester. The final exam may be given on a different day/time than is listed on the final exam schedule. Students will be notified of any schedule changes. PAEMS program s (EMD, EMR, Basic, Paramedic , ECRN, or PHRN ) are divided into sections containing similar subject matter (airway, trauma, medical, etc.). Students will be required to maintain an overall 80% average (quizzes, homework, projects, etc.) in the section, plus achieve a score of 80% or better on the section exam to move on to the next section. If the student is unable to meet these expectations they could be subject to dismissal from the program. Students are expected to be present, in class, during the adminis tration of exams. Making up a missed written exam is rarely permitted except in extenuating circumstances. If the student is to be late or absent the day of an exam, the student must notify the instructor prior to the scheduled time of the exam. Make -up exams will not be given unless the student makes prior arrangements with the course instructor. Any student taking an exam later than the scheduled time may be given a different exam from the one taken by other students. Make -up exams , if allowed, must be taken prior to the day of the next scheduled class session unless other arrangements have been made with the instructor. Students absent for the administration of an exam then (if allowed) fail to make it up in the allotted time will be given a zero for the examination. Students entering class late may be allowed to take the exam, but will not be given additional time to complete the exam. Unannounced quizzes may be given in any class and makeup is rarely allowed. Each instructor will determine if an exc eption may be made. Students entering class late may be allowed to take the quiz, but will not be given additional time. Final grades are calculated from a combination of exams, quizzes, and a final exam for specific subject areas contained within a cours e. The final average for each subject area will constitute a predetermined percentage of the course grade. These percentages will be announced at the beginning of each course. Successful completion of all practical skill teaching and testing stations is required for completion of the Program. Practical skill evaluation is graded on a pass/fail basis. All required practical skills must be successfully performed to complete the training Program. Attendance at all practical skill teaching and testing s essions is mandatory. The competency -based level of achievement is graded as follows: A = 93 - 100% B = 87 - 92% C = 80 - 86% Fail below 80% A 'C' or better g rade is required to pass any EMS Program course and is required in order to progress to the next course in the Program sequence. To receive a 'C' or better grade, the student must (1) maintain a grade average of 80% or better and (2) meet all course requirements within specified time limits. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page8 CLASSROOM SKILLS PRA CTICE During the course of th is program some skills may be low fidelity or high fidelity manikin, live patient, or live acted lab scenario. During the course of this program, students will be taught skills necessary for the assessment and management of patients in many emergency sit uations. It is essential that students practice and perfect these skills using human subjects. All students are hereby advised that the practice of both non -invasive and invasive skills will be practiced on fellow classmates, and that classmates will be pr acticing these same skills on you. The purpose of these practice sessions is to develop the tasks, dexterity, and tactile feel, necessary for each skill, in situations as real as possible, under the control and supervision of program instructors. The pract ice of these skills will involve limited physical contact with all areas of the human body including the areas of the chest and pelvis. The EMS Program is acutely aware of both the importance of hands on human practice and the risk of Inappropriate behavio r. All students involved in these skills practice sessions, in the role of the rescuer, the patient, or as an observer, are expected to display tact and professionalism, as well as to behave under ethical and legal guidelines. Should a student believe that the practice of a particular skill on themselves by another student or as demonstrated by an instructor, crosses a line of professionalism, into overt sexual contact, that student has the responsibility to make that belief known to both the student or ins tructor involved and to the Program Director as soon as possible. Any student who perceives that he or she has been treated in a discriminative manner on the grounds of sex may consult with or file a written complaint with the dean of student development a nd educational services. The practice of skills is an essential part of learning. Students must come to laboratory sessions prepared to practice necessary skills. Being prepared means being dressed properly and having the appropriate equipment ready and av ailable. Additionally, scenario practice requires an attitude and demeanor which do not detract from the scenario created. Communicating with the \"patient\" as if you are a real patient, and performing all skills as appropriate, following proper procedures.

After the instructor confers with the Course Coordinator , the individual may be requested to obtain a letter from his/her treating physician. The letter must state whether or not the student can safely perform in a hospital /field clinical setting and if any specific precautions need to be taken for that student to perform without posing a risk to others. 3. Each infected individual's situation will be considered individually and decisions will be based on the written statement provided by t he physician. In those situations in which a physician has not yet been consulted, decisions will be based on \"reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge\" about the nature of the stated condition, the potential risk to others and th e probability of transmission. These decisions will be made by the Course Coordinator . 4. The Course Coordinator and Instruc tor will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the infected individual with the understanding that regulations set forth by the c linical agencies must be considered. 5. The infected individual is assured of confidentiality in accordance with state and federal requirements. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to initiate contact with an individual who exhibits the signs and symptoms of a communicable disease who has not come forward. This will only occur if the individual has the potential to pose an imminent risk to others or may be unable to perform as a student . PROCEDURE FOR ACCIDE NTAL EXPOS URE TO BLO OD OR BODY FLUIDS IN THE HOSPITAL /FIELD CLINICAL SETTING The following procedure must be followed after an accidental exposure to blood or body fluids in any clinical/field location: In the event of a needle stick, force the wound to bleed if possible by squeezing then wash the exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. In the event of mucous membrane exposure (eye, nose, mouth etc.) , flush the mucous membranes with water as soon as possible, and then complete the following steps: 1. Notify your hospital /field clinical instructor immediately . Follow any instructions that you are given. 2. All students must complete the facility's incident report and you must fill out an additional Exposure Repor t Form (Appendix) . Your Hospital /Field Clinical I nstructor sh ould also fill in the portion of the form that applies to them. You are responsible for sending the completed form and any other reports, such as the facility's incident report (available at www.paems.org), to the PAEMS office a t the address listed on the second page of the form. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page12 3. Blood is typically drawn from both you and the patient who is the source of the exposure. The blood from both you and the source is tested for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. 4. Follow -up treatment and laboratory testing with yo ur personal physician is HIGHLY recommended for students in all occurrences. Students are ENTIRELY responsible for obtaining all follow -up treatment and all medical bills associated with the follow -up treatment. CHEMICAL IMPAIRMENT POLICY PAEMS believe s they have a professional and ethical responsibility to provide a safe teaching and learning environment for students and patients who receive care from our students. To fulfill this purpose, students must be free from chemical impairment during participati on in all aspects of the Program including classroom, field, and clinical settings. The chemically impaired student is defined as a person under the influence of, either separately or in combination: alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, prescribed or over -the-counter medications, synthetic designer drugs, or inhalants. The policy is attached in the Appendix. Substance Abuse The Peoria Area EMS System considers substance abuse (drug dependency and/or alcoholism) to be a health problem, and it will assist an employee who becomes dependent on alcohol and/or drugs. Peoria Area EMS System , and ultimately our patients, will suffer the adverse effects of having a prehospital care provider whose work performance and attendance are below acceptable standards. Any student whose substance abuse problems jeopardize the safety of patients, co -workers, or bystanders shall be deemed \"unfit to practice\" and will be dismissed from their respective course. POLICY/PROCEDURE: A. Any prehospital care provider involved in the Peoria Area EMS System who voluntarily requests assistance with a personal substance abuse problem will be referred to the EMS Medical Director for assessment and referral for treatment when necessary. B. Peoria Area EMS System does not require students t o submit to blood and/or urine testing for alcohol and/or drugs as a routine part of the training Program. However, ambulance agencies that serve as clinical sites may require drug and alcohol testing as part of their individual risk management program prior to the student starting their internship at that agency. C. Any prehospital care provider who has reasonable cause to suspect that a student is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs while on duty, may consult with the EMS Medical Director, who m ay choose to require the student to submit to a blood alcohol test and/or blood and/or urine toxicology screen. 1. If a student is required to submit to testing for drugs and/or alcohol refuses to cooperate, he/she will be subject to disciplinary action f or insubordination up to and including termination from the Program. 2. Anyone caught tampering, or attempting to tamper with his/her test specimen or the specimen of any other prehospital care provider shall be subject to immediate termination from the Program. 3. If the test result(s) is (are) positive, the EMS Medical Director will interview the student. The EMS Medical Director will consult with the student's agency as applicable, to determine if referral to an assistance Program shall occur. a. The first occurrence will result in a referral of the prehospital care provider to the appropriate assistance Program, and the System participant will be subject to disciplinary action as determined by the EMS Medical Director and the students agency (if ap plicable). b. The second occurrence within one year will result in disciplinary action as determined by the EMS Medical Director in consultation with the student's agency (if applicable) and may result in suspension from the Program or EMT license and/or System certification. c. The progress of students with substance abuse problems who have been referred to an agency for assistance will be closely monitored by their agency and the EMS Medical Director. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page13 The student must successfully complete the entire required rehabilitative Program and maintain the preventative course of conduct prescribed by the assistance Program. He/she must attend the appropriate after -care Programs and provide verification of compliance with the Program requiremen ts including additional drug testing as determined by the EMS Medical Director and agency. 4. If the test results are negative, a conference with the EMS Medical Director and the student will be held to determine what future action, if any, will be taken . 5. If the student refuses to correct his/her health problems and their performance continues to be affected, he/she shall be subject to disciplinary action that pertains to all System participants who cannot, or are not, performing their duties and resp onsibilities at acceptable levels. D. The use, sale, purchase, transfer, theft, or possession of an illegal drug is a violation of the law. \"Illegal drug\" means any drug, which is (a) not legally obtainable or (b) legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained. The term \"illegal drug\" includes prescription drugs not legally obtained and prescription drugs legally obtained but not being used for prescribed purposes. Anyone with knowledge of illegal drug activity must report to law enforcement, lic ensing, and/or credentialing agencies when appropriate. All Program students are required to sign and adhere to the PAEMS Student Wellness Contract. When a faculty member or a clinical agency representative suspects a student may be chemically impaired the following procedure, based on the belief that measures to be taken should be assertive rather than punitive, will be implemented: 1. Seek corroboration regarding the observed student behavior, if possible. a. Should the impaired behavior occur at a clinical site, the faculty or agency representative will relieve the student from the clinical assignment. b. Should the observed behavior occur on campus, the faculty member should use his/her discretion in allowing continued participation in the learning activity c. Immediately notify Program director and provide written documentation of observed behavior or physiologic characteristics of suspected chemical impairment as soon as possible. d. Upon request, the student will undergo a drug screen, blood alcohol level, and me ntal health evaluation. Drug screens and alcohol levels will be completed at the student's expense at the nearest Emergency Department. 2. Upon receipt of written documentation, a conference, consisting of, but not limited to, the involved studen t, the instructor and/or agency representative, will be held. The purpose of the conference is to: a. present documented observations of behavior (s) and lab results b. re-emphasize concern for both patient and student well -being c. provide emotional support for the student d. if results are positive, review student options; 1) withdrawal from Program OR 2) Implementation of the \" PAEMS Student Wellness Contract\" for the purpose of chemical professional evaluation of dependency status and determination of a treatment p lan, if indicated. a) Student capability to participate in class, clinical/lab/field assignments will be evaluated on day - to-day basis while awaiting evaluation results. b) The evaluation will be determined by faculty for the course. 3. All oral/written docume nts and communications related to this procedure are confidential . LICENSURE EXAMINATIO N REQUIREMENTS NREMT licensing exam opportunities will be opened to the student upon satisfactory completion of their course requirements . Students must submit an exami nation fee for each attempt at the licensure exam. Students who do not pass the exam in three attempts must repeat the NREMT refresher course in order to challenge the NREMT licensure exam again. * To be el igible to challenge the NREMT licensing exam, stu dents must: 1. be at least 18 years of age; 2. possess a high school diploma or equivalent; Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page14 3. have successfully completed all classroom/laboratory, hospital and f ield clinical requirements, and any other necessary course requirements; 4. receive the recommend ation of the course instructor; 5. Paramedic students must satisfactorily complete their internship requirements and field Capstone phase and meet with the EMS Medical Director prior to being eligible to sit for the NREMT test *Note: Information on Licensure Exams may have changed since this handbook was p ublished. Contact your Cours e Coordinator or the PAEMS System for updated information regarding IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Healt h) or National Registry testing. MAINTENANCE OF CERTI FICATIONS/LICEN SURE In accordance with NREMT/ IDPH requirements, EMTs must maintain current CPR certification at the American Heart Association \"BLS for Healthcare Provider\" level or equivalent. Students in all EMS courses will be required to show proof of such complian ce. Likewise, Paramedic students must maintain their current licensure (EMT -B or EMT -I) during their advanced training. Students are required to maintain certification or licensure throughout the duration of their enrollment within the PAEMS program. Lo ss of a student's professional certification or licensure will result in immediate dismissal from the program, regardless of reason for or duration of loss. Additional Certification s/Requirements may include , but are not limited to: 1. Advanced Cardiac Li fe Support (American Heart Association); 2. Prehospital Trauma Life Supp ort or International Trauma Life Support (American College of Surgeons/American College of Emergency Physicians ); 3. Pediatric Education for Prehospital Providers (American Col lege of Pediatrics) or Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) 4.

Monroe 304 E. Il linois Ave Springfield , Illinois 62761 www.paems.org HOSPITAL/FIELD CLINICAL INFORMATION NOTE: Prior to progressing into Field Clinical time Paramedic students will be required to complete and successfully pass the PAEMS protocol exam. The clinical portion of the Program provides an environment for supervised competency -based clinical education and offers the student sufficient and proportio nate patient experiences and clinical skill performance opportunities. Competency -based clinical education requires that students completing the Program be able to successfully perform all EMT skills. Paramedic students must also be able to perform advance d skills such as; intravenous therapy, medication administration, endotracheal intubation, intraosseous infusion, manual defibrillation and physical assessment procedures according to accepted professional standards as set forth by the Peoria Area EMS Syst em and National Registry of Emergency Medical Technician guidelines. Clinical experiences are divided into hospital and field clinical areas. The number of hours that the student must complete is designated by the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Peoria Area EMS System . Participating Hospita l Clinical Sites : OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Participating Field Clinical Agencies: 1. East Peoria Fire Department 2. Fulton County Emergency Medical Association 3. Metamora Emergency 116 Ambulance Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page15 4. Eureka Goodfield Fire Protection District 5. Germantown Hills Ambulance 6. Advanced Medical Transport 7. Washington Fire Department The number of clinical hours required and the clinical agencie s utilized will v ary depending on the course in which the student is enrolled. The student is expe cted to cooperate with hospital and field clinical personnel. While at the clinical agencies and/or sites, the student must observe reg ulations imposed by the agency/site regarding patient safety and welfare, personal cleanliness, and hygiene. If any concerns arise concerning the performance of specific assignments, consult the clinical instructor. At no time should the student be replaced with another stu dent or employee without proper notification of the student prior to the day of the shift. FIELD TEAM LEADERSHIP Teams are defined as two or more individuals who interact and coordinate their EMS work to accomplish a shared goal or purpose. Teams are EMS organizational groups composed of individuals or members of the team who share common goals and who coordinate their activities to accomplish the goals and response requirements. Additionally, the EMS team shares mission requirements and collective respon sibilities. Team Members are responsible for assisting in the treatment of the simulated patient as a competent provider. While not \"in charge\" they provide appropriate individual skills to assist in patient care using a teamwork approach. During team le ads the student is \"in charge\" and must demonstrate the knowledge, skills and attitudes to manage any call to which the unit is dispatched. During Phase 3 or CAPSTONE the emphasis shifts from assessing the student's individual skill competency to assessing his or her ability to manage the entire scene and patient. It is not necessary for the student to perform all the skills, or any individual skills, outside of assessment. However, he or she must be the main person responsible for the choreography of the s cene and direct all patient care. Team leads are a capstone component. Capstone refers to a culminating student experience in which students apply the concepts that they have learned to solve real -life problems. It is an opportunity for students to demons trate that they have achieved the terminal goals for learning established by their educational program and to demonstrate entry level competency in the profession. The CoAEMSP Policies and Procedures Manual define a capstone experience as: \"Activities occu rring toward the end of the educational process to allow students to develop and practice high -level decision making by integrating and applying their Paramedic learning.\" HOSPITAL/FIELD CLINICAL HOURS GUIDELINES The Peoria Area EMS System (following National Standard Curriculum guidelines) has identified the minimal number of hospital and field clinical hours, as well as psych omotor skills that the EMT , and Paramedic student must complete. The Program Instructor, the Course Coordinator, the Prehospita l Education Coordinator and the EMS Medical Director may extend the number of clinical hours or number of skills performed that the student must complete if the student has not met a satisfactory competency level in the performance of psychomotor skills an d had sufficient patient contacts. Each student is expected to actively participate in scheduling or rescheduling of their clinical shifts. Any conflicts or emergencies that require the student to reschedule will be the responsibility of the student to complete. The student must notify the instructor of any changes in clinical shifts prior to the shift. No Call -No Show situations for clinical shifts are unacceptable and may be cause for dismissal from the program. Students must perform their clinical h ours and skills with an approved PAEMS Preceptor as the 3rd person clinical intern in order to satisfactorily document and receive credit for the required hours and skills. Skills performed and hours accumulated outside of this situation will not count to wards the field clinical internship. PAEMS does not guarantee employment with any of its agencies or affiliates. Satisfactory completion of your course and licensure does not guarantee employment with any EMS agency. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page16 Vaccine Status The student must u nderstand that due to occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials, there is an inherent risk. Therefore, be advised by the instructor and the PAEMS System of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, Peoria, Illinois, that vaccinatio n against Hepatitis B and Influenza be obtained, either at their agency, their personal physician, or health department, at their own expense. Further understand that by failing to obtain this vaccine, the student could be at risk of acquiring a serious di sease. Novel Coronavirus -19 For the health, safety and protection of patients, Mission Partners, and all who receive our care, OSF HealthCare is recommending PAEMS students who perform clinical skills within OSF St. Francis Medical Center to be fully va ccinated with the COVID -19 vaccine. Students who have been diagnosed with Covid -19 must have a doctor's note clearing the student for further clinical shifts declaring that the student has tested negative for the virus. OSF reserves the right to amend th e vaccine recommendations and requirements based upon public health emergencies and CDC requirements.

The student must be the main person respo nsible for the choreography of the scene and delegation of all patient care. Medication Administration for EMT -P student s EMT -P students may ONLY administer medications approved for use in the National curriculum. These inc lude, but are not limited to - Adenocard Morphine MUST directly supervised by their preceptor when administering medications. Preceptors will evaluate the student based on Affective, Cognitive, and Psychomotor disciplines as listed in Pre ceptor Manual. CLINICAL ATTENDANCE POLICY A student is allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absences. This does not include dental appointments, doctor appointments for children, etc. Additional absences may jeopardize satisfactory completion of the course. Instructors are aware that at times there are valid reasons that necessitate absence during scheduled clinical activities. All requests of this nature are to be directed to the Course Coordinator/Instructor and will be given consideration. All makeup time , if approved, must be completed within a time frame determined by the Course Coordinator/ Instructor. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page20 A. If a student is unable to attend a clinical rotation as scheduled, the student is to personally notify the Clinical Coordinator or designee and the clinical location prior to the assigned clinical period. Failure to do so is considered an unexcused absence . Absences will be reflected in the student's clinical performance evaluation. B. If a student fails to report to a clini cal site as assigned and d oes not call ahead of time to notify the course instructor of his or her anticipated absence, the student will receive an unexcused absence for that day. C. A student, who through personal error, goes to the wrong clinical site and/or the right site on the wr ong day or time will be sent home and receive an unexcused absence for the day. D. If a student arrives more than 15 minutes late to the clinical area without calling or paging the course instructor, the lateness will be noted as unexcused . If the unit activ ity the student was to engage in has already been accomplished, i.e., physical examinations and assessments etc., the student may be sent home and rescheduled at the Course I nstructor's convenience and unit availability. E. Highly unusual or extenuating circu mstances occasionally occur, causing a student to be absent or late without opportunity to provide advance notice. We believe these situations are rare. The acceptance of such unusual circumstances as adequate for an \"excused absence\" is at the discretio n of the course instructor. F. Two unexcused absences and/or late arrivals will be interpreted as irresponsible behavior violating the course ethics policy and may be grounds for dismissal from the Program. Attendance infractions will be evaluated by the Cou rse Instructor and Course Coordinator. G. Rescheduling of clinical rotations can only be done based on clinical site availability. A student who does not complete the clinical component of the course in the prescribed time may be prevented from completing th e course, taking the licensure exam, and/or graduating from the Program. H. Students may not leave a clinical site before completing the assigned shift unless permission is granted by the course instructor or they are dismissed by the clinical instructor as having completed all objectives and/or there are no continuing opportunities to provide patient care. I. The policies concerning clinical time are very specific and will be consistently enforced throughout the various Program locations. It is important that students handle clinical responsibility in a professional way. The ability to function in a professional and dependable manner will be as important as knowledge in overall success as an EMT. CLINICAL SUPERVISION While performing hospital and field clinic al rotations, the student is directly responsible to the MD, RN or Paramedic Field Training I nstructor (or their designee) in charge of their respective areas. The student must have adequate and proper supervision during all clinical experiences. Each student progresses from the role of observer and assistant to relative independence according to initiative and capabilities. Until a student achieves and documents competency in any given procedure, all psychomotor skills shall be carried out under the direct supervision of a clinical instructor. After demonstrating competency, the student may perform those procedures with indirect supervision (an instructor is immediately available, i.e., adjacent to the room or location where the procedure is being per formed, to assist the student). A student shall not take the responsibility or the pla ce of a licensed EMT -I or EMT -P in a work or clinical setting. At all times, regardless of a student's level of achievement, a clinical instructor must: determine if th e condition of the patient prohibits performance of the skill by the student; check and approve all skills performed by a student. be present during the performance of all repeat skills. A student is responsible for performing all psychomotor skills associated with their level of training. Students must perform skills according to the PAEMS System Protocols and in accordance with the prevailing Scope of Practice. If the student is asked to perform procedures for which no instruction or practice has been obtained, it is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor . The student must also assume responsibility for assuring that all skills are performed under the direct supervision of a clinical instructor. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page21 PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIO R AND DRESS AT CLINI CALS A. Students shall wea r the designated PAEMS uniform or such uniform/clothing as prescribed by the clinical location. B. Students shal l wear their student NAME BADGES at all times while at the clinical agencies. C. Students reporting in inappropriate attire will be dismissed from the area and must reschedule the rotation based on unit availability. D. Students must have all the required equipment and paperwork with them during the clinical experience or they will be dismissed from the area and must reschedule the rot ation based on unit availability. E. Students will refrain from smoking while on clinical agency premises . F. Students should attempt to schedule their lunch and breaks so they coincide with their preceptor's breaks. When leaving the unit at any time during the shift, the student must report off to their preceptor. CLINICAL EQUIPMENT In order for the student to have a successful and rewarding hospital/field clinical experience, the student should come prepared with the following clinical equipment : REQUIRED Course ID name badge, Stethoscope, Black ink pen , as well as, Watch , and Appropria te Clinical Forms RECOMMENDED Trauma shears, Penlight, Notepad CLINICAL DRESS CODE POLICY The student is expected to follow the dress code policy. Part of being a profes sional is look ing like a professional . The student uniform (Appendix) is to be worn only during assigned clinical and field clinical activities. 1. EMT -B student uniform : Navy/black trousers or uniform pants (no jeans). Uniform shoes or jump boots for field clinical shifts, clean tennis shoes are acceptable for ED clinical shifts.

Remember that a \" smile and a \"can do \" attitude\" is the most important part o f your uniform. Should a student fail to comply with the dress code policy, the clinical instructor or faculty members have the prerogative to dismiss the student from the clinical agency and the time missed must be rescheduled with the Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page22 Clinical Coordinat or. Failure to comply with the dress code will be reflected in the student's clinical performance evaluation. GRADING/EVALUATION O F CLINICAL EXPERIENC E The clinical evaluation system consists of a combination of methods and procedures designed to assist both students and instructors in the teaching, learning, evaluation, and documentation of the student's progress toward achievement of entry -level professional competency. To fulfill these multiple purposes, multiple evaluation instruments and direct obse rvation of your clinical performance by instructors are used. A student will receive a grade of Satisfactory when: 1. All clinical and field clinical rotation hours have been completed and appropriate signed paperwork has been submitted to the Course Coo rdinator /Instructor. 2. The minimum number of required psychomotor skills have all been successful, signed off by a clinical instructor and paperwork s ubmitted to the Course Coordinator/ Instructor . 3. All evaluations have been completed . A student will n ot be able to progress in the Program , graduate or achieve state licensure unless a Satisfactory grade is achieved in the hospita l/field clinical component. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS A. Students in the Paramedic Program will utilize Platinum Planner documentati on to document and record data pertinent to their requirements for CoAEMSP.

I have circled and placed my initials in the table above to indicate the vaccine(s) I am declinin g. I understand that I can change my decision in the future and have myself vaccinated. Student Signature:___________________________________________________________________ Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page29 Policy on the Use of 'Platinum EMS Testing ' REASON FOR POLICY CoAE MSP has in place a requirement for fair and evaluated testing for all Paramedic Programs. The program must have a policy in place to describe and define the Testing Policy and use of EMT Testing. As such CoAEMSP has indicated the requirement in the followi ng statement: CoAEMSP Statement IV. Student and Graduate Evaluation/Assessment A. Student Evaluation 1. Frequency and Purpose Evaluation of students must be conducted on a recurrent basis and with sufficient frequency to provide both the students and prog ram faculty with valid and timely indications of the students' progress toward and achievement of the competencies and learning domains stated in the curriculum. Rationale: The Program is conducting item analysis of examinations; to include validity/relia bility testing of the exams. Generally using Platinum Group Testin g tools which are validated through their system , but we may add some questions of our own. All questions, when offered, will be evaluated for p - values, difficulty and discrimination (natio nal and local if available) and Point Bi -Serial, if sufficient numbers are available. Requirement to submit met: The program will have the physician director and advisory board review and approve all high stakes exams (Final exams and any other exams used to determine continued progression through the program). The Program shall submit the results of the analysis of validity and reliability of the major examinations (e.g., item analysis, correlation to external exams) to the advisory board. We will also submit to the advisory board the interpretation of the validity and reliability data and describe changes that were made to examinations based on that interpretation. Components of Testing & Analysis Policy for Quizzes and Tests For the reliability, if the KR20 is less than a 0.70, t hen the Instructor and/or the program director will evaluate the data as to the time correlation the questions were answered to evaluate for cheating. Note: areas causing the test to be less than reliable including but not limit ed to test interruptions, material not being covered in advance, and any other identified areas will also be reviewed. Sample Exam/Question Review/Discussion This component allows the students to request a review/discuss in class on objectives and/or questions. When we have 10% of the class requesting a review/discuss in class, we will be reviewing, re - teaching and re -testing. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page30 Sample Class Testing Discrimination Values If the class discrimination value is 0.2 or greater below the national results, or any time the class results are negative, or 0, questions will be reviewed/evaluated by the instruc tor and/or program director . Reason for a zero (no discrimination results) might be the question is too easy or too difficult (see difficulty). Negative discrimination occurs because top performers have done worse on a particular item than poor performers. If this occurs look to textbook, lecture notes, or other times when incorrect or contradictory messages may have been provided. Another case would be an incorrectly keyed item. See Question number 2 and 4 in the sample below. Difficulty Level Determination When the difficulty level is greater than 0.5, the test items will be reviewed/evalu ated by the instructor and/or program director . We will be l ooking to see if the questions are correctly keyed, are the questions misleading, or was the material inadequately covered. If a question is suspected of being keyed incorrectly, Platinum Educational Group will be contacted immediately to request editing. If the question is one of our own, we will review and rekey the question. If it is misleading, the team will evaluate why and determine the question outcome from that analysis. If material was covered inadequately, this will be reviewed/re -taught/re -tested. See Question number 3 in the sample below. If the class item difficulty value is 0.2 or more above the national the questions will be reviewed/evalu ated by the instructor and/or program director . We will be looking to see if the questions are cor rectly keyed, are misleading, or the material was inadequately covered. If the question is suspected of being keyed incorrectly, Platinum Educational Group will be contacted immediately to request a rekey. If the question is one of our own, we will revi ew and execute the procedure outlined above. Again, see Question number 3 below Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page31 Validated questions where 30% or greater of the class has answered incorrectly will be included in the next quiz/exam. See Question numbers 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 below. Overview of the Computer Adaptive Portion The computer adaptive portion of the EMSTesting program is designed to serve the following purposes. To prepare the student for the National Registry credentialing exam. As an instrument to determine the readin ess of students to sit for the NREMT written exam. To evaluate the overall effectiveness of the educational program. More information regarding Computer Adaptive exams can be found in the Paramedic Student Manual. Student Review & Recommendation Student s will only be recommended for the Registry when they have received an Exceptional rating in at least 6 of the categories and at least a good in the remaining categories on at least 4 consecutive comprehensive, timed tests covering all of the offered categ ories. The consecutive exams may be waived if a student can show cause as to why he/she has not done well consistently on the exams. Students must complete at least 1 of these comprehensive exams in a proctored environment at the Mt Nebo Paramedic offic es. Student performance on the Registry will then be compared to these results. Program Review The program will evaluate the Summary results provided with EMSCAT. The entire program will receive a review by the instructor and/or PD if the program fai ls to rank among the top 50%. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page32 Category Reviews The program will also evaluate any category receiving a percentile rating less than the 50th percentile or raw score less than 65%. The category will then be further investigated by topic and objective lo oking for causes of the less than desirable results. Areas to review will be curriculum, schedule disruptions, changes such as in instructor or text material, or any other causes. Once an area is identified, changes will be made, documented, and subseq uent performances will be monitored during the next offering looking for changes in results. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page33 Definitions & Overview of Testing Evaluation Techniques Kuder -Richardson (KR20): The Kuder -Richardson (K -R 20) measures consistency of responses to all the it ems within the test and reflects two error sources: item sampling and heterogeneity of the content domain sampled. Both of these indices report reliability as a coefficient ranging in size from 0.00 (no consistency) to 1.00 (perfect consistency). P Value s: Expresses the proportion or percentage of students who answered the item correctly . Item difficulty can range from 0.0 (none of the students answered the item correctly) to 1.0 (all of the students answered the item correctly). Item Difficulty: Express es the proportion or percentage of the upper 25% and lower 25% of the performers who missed the question. O indicates that no one missed to 1.0, everyone missed. We also add a factor for Bloom level assignment Discrimination: Expresses the proportional o r percentage difference of the upper 25% and lower 25% of the performers who missed the question. Lower performers who missed minus the upper performers who missed. The number of people in one of the groups then divides this numerical difference. This v alue can range from 1.0 (discriminates perfectly) to a -1.0 (negatively discriminates perfectly and is hopefully improperly keyed). The Point B i-Serial correlation is an index of item discrimination, i.e., how well the item serves to discriminate between students with higher and lower levels of knowledge. We will use a base of 1.0 to -1.0 as a program and based in the Platinum Education exams we are currently using. The ideal number for Discrimination shall be 0.2 or greater in our program. The Point Bi -Serial: A point bi-serial coefficient is a special type of correlation coefficient that relates observed item responses to a total test score. A point bi-serial coefficient is specifically used when one set of the data is dichotomous in nature. A point bi -serial coefficient, computed for every multiple -choice item, is considered useful because it reflects how well an item is \"discriminating.\" Questions of concern from the chart above would be number 2. The question does not discriminate as no one missed t he question. The question might be asked, why we even included this question in this examination. (Note: In number 4 there is no National discrimination. This would be because the question has not been queried at least 40 times within our Adaptive Testi ng) A high point bi -serial coefficient means that students selecting the correct response are students with higher total scores, and students selecting incorrect responses to an item are associated with lower total scores. Very low or negative point -bi-serial coefficients computed after field -testing new items can help identify items that are flawed. Correlation Coefficient : The common correlation statistic used is known as the Pearson correlation coefficient. Almost all correlation coefficients range fro m -1.0 to +1.0 in their values, and are used to demonstrate how two sets of numerical data are related. Numerical data can be anything from a range of salaries, years of education, or scores on a test. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page34 Positive Correlation . When relatively high values are paired with relatively high values, and relatively low values are paired with relatively low values. A good example is salary and years of education. Negative Correlation . When relatively low values are paired with relatively high values, and relatively high values are paired with relatively low values. An example of a negative correlation might be years smoking versus life expectancy. Zero Correlation . When there is basically no relationship between two sets of numerical data. Your imagination can come u p with goo This information is derived from a variety of educational publications. This information is to be used as a guide only and is not considered to be an absolute for all testing evaluations. Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page35 Declaration of Understanding of the PAEMS Student Handbook Classroom Attendance Policy: It is the student's responsibility to be aware of this attendance policy and arrange for any make up wor k missed due to illness or emergency. All outside appointments must be scheduled at times other than during assigned EMT experiences, including class, hospital and field clinical experiences. In case of prolonged absences because of illness, accident, or h ospitalization, students should notify their respective course instructor. Excessive absence is the most common cause of failing grades and may hinder the student from completing course objectives. A student who does not satisfactorily complete the objecti ves of any EMT course will be withdrawn from the Program. Tardy / Absentee Policy: Any student arriving in the classroom after the scheduled start of class is considered tardy. If a student arrives 1 -60 minutes late they will be marked as tardy. Students arriving more than 60 minutes late are considered absent for that class day. This tardy policy will be applied to students leaving sessions early. Two (2) occurrences of tardiness will constitute 1 absence. Classes (including clinical experiences) will mee t as scheduled unless inclement weather or other emergency circumstances create conditions that necessitate closing. Contact the course instructor, the hospital/field clinical instructor, or the class location to check on cancellations. Make -up exams , if allowed, must be taken prior to the day of the next scheduled class session unless other arrangements have been made with the instructor. Students absent for the administration of an exam then (if allowed) fail to make it up in the allotted time will be g iven a zero for the examination. Students entering class late may be allowed to take the exam, but will not be given additional time to complete the exam. Unannounced quizzes may be given in any class and makeup is rarely allowed. Each instructor will dete rmine if an exception may be made. Students entering class late may be allowed to take the quiz, but will not be given additional time. Final grades are calculated from a combination of exams, quizzes, and a final exam for specific subject areas contained within a course. The final average for each subject area will constitute a predetermined percentage of the course grade. These percentages will be announced at the beginning of each course. Successful completion of all practical skill teaching and testing stations is required for completion of the Program. Practical skill evaluation is graded on a pass/fail basis. All required practical skills must be successfully performed to complete the training Program. All students are hereby advised that the practice of both non -invasive and invasive skills will be practiced on fellow classmates, and that classmates will be practicing these same skills on you. The purpose of these practice sessions is to develop the tasks, dexterity, and tactile feel, necessary for ea ch skill, in situations as real as possible, under the control and supervision of program instructors. The practice of these skills will involve limited physical contact with all areas of the human body including the areas of the chest and pelvis. The EMS Program is acutely aware of both the importance of hands on human practice and the risk of inappropriate behavior. All students involved in these skills practice sessions, in the role of the rescuer, the patient, or as an observer, are expected to display tact and professionalism, as well as to behave under ethical and legal guidelines. Withdrawal Policy: Students may be administratively withdrawn from a course for good cause when the EMS Medical Director deems such withdrawal is necessary. A student, who finds it necessary to withdraw from the program, must have a conference with the EMS Course Coordinator prior to withdrawing. Students who have withdrawn from the program may apply for readmission. However, this in no way guarantees acceptance back into th e program. EMT: All hospital clinical time must be completed before the last didactic session. Paramedic, ECRN, & PHRN All Hospital clinical time and laboratory skills proficiencies must be completed before the last didactic session. All field clinical tim e must be completed by the final completion date listed on Peoria Area EMS - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Student Handbook Page36 the approved IDPH training application_________________. By the end of the didactic section the student has not completed the required skills and/ or patient contacts within laboratory and/ or hosp ital clinical settings. For all courses, students must achieve an 80% on all \"High Stakes\" section exam scores to continue on with the Program; Failure to demonstrate proficiency in all skill stations. CLINICAL ATTENDANCE POLICY: A student is allowed a ma ximum of two (2) excused absences. This does not include dental appointments, doctor appointments for children, etc. Additional absences may jeopardize satisfactory completion of the course. Instructors are aware that at times there are valid reasons that necessitate absence during scheduled clinical activities. All requests of this nature are to be directed to the Course Coordinator/Instructor a nd will be given consideration.
