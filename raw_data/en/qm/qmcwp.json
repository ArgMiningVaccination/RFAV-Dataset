This paper analyzed the different definitions of IM and its relation to CAM, through a systematic literature review on Medline, during the period of 1996 to 2005. The keyword \"Integrative Medicine\" was used and 36 papers were selected, which presented a definition of IM. It was identified that CAM is part of IM and the definitions include: CAM and conventional medicine integration; use of evidence; combination of old healing systems and biomedicine; appreciation of the medical-patient relationship and communication; person as a whole conception; and focus on health, healing and prevention. It is concluded that the increasing interest of users, professionals and managers in CAM points out the need of developing the IM model, supporting the implementation and management of new care and healing practices.
