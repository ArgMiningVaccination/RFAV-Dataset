These pathways create an energy flow (Qi, pronounced \"chee\") through the body that is responsible for overall health. Disruption of the energy flow can cause disease. Acupuncture may correct these imbalances when applied at acupuncture points and improve the flow of Qi. Acupuncture theories today are based on extensive laboratory research, and have become widely known and accepted. In addition, controlled studies have shown evidence of the effectiveness of acupuncture for certain conditions. At present in the United States, about 3,500 physicians and 11,000 to 12,000 non-physician acupuncturists use this medical art. About 40 acupuncture schools train non-physicians and about 500 to 600 physicians, according to the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. More than 3.2 million Americans have used acupuncture, and the numbers are growing, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Acupuncture is not for everyone. If you choose to see an acupuncturist, discuss it with your physician first and find a practitioner who is licensed as having appropriate training and credentials.
