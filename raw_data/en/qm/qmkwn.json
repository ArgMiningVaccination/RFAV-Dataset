Soon you will find links to research groups. There are some differences, and variations in the concepts and definitions of the TCIM, associated with the evolution of the implementation process in health services, and in the academic and research fields. This section seeks to present these diverse definitions in an inclusive manner. Below we present the TCIM definitions of international institutions and organizations. WHO World Health Organization Definitions [http://www.who.int/topics/traditional_medicine/definitions/en/](http://www.who.int/topics/traditional_medicine/definitions/en/) - Traditional medicine: Traditional medicine has a long history. It is the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. - Complementary medicine: The terms \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system. They are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. - Herbal medicines: Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products, that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations. NCCIH ( National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) The following definitions were taken from the page of the NCCIH, Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What's In a Name? [https://nccih.nih.gov/node/3768](https://nccih.nih.gov/node/3768). - Natural Products: This group includes a variety of products, such as herbs (also known as botanicals), vitamins and minerals, and probiotics. They are widely marketed, readily available to consumers, and often sold as dietary supplements. - Mind and Body Practices: Mind and body practices include a large and diverse group of procedures or techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher. The 2012 NHIS showed that [yoga](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga), [chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/spinalmanipulation), [meditation](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation), and [massage therapy](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/massage)are among the most popular mind and body practices used by adults. The popularity of yoga has grown dramatically in recent years, with almost twice as many U.S. adults practicing yoga in 2012 as in 2002.Other mind and body practices include [acupuncture](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture), [relaxation techniques](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/stress/relaxation.htm)(such as breathing exercises, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation), [tai chi](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/taichi), qi gong, healing touch, hypnotherapy, and movement therapies (such as Feldenkrais method, Alexander technique, Pilates, Rolfing Structural Integration, and Trager psychophysical integration). The amount of research on mind and body approaches varies widely depending on the practice. For example, researchers have done many studies on acupuncture, yoga, spinal manipulation, and meditation, but there have been fewer studies on some other practices - Other Complementary Health Approaches: The two broad areas discussed above\u2014natural products and mind and body practices\u2014capture most complementary health approaches. However, some approaches may not neatly fit into either of these groups\u2014for example, the practices of traditional healers, "}
