There is growing concern about the amount of antibiotic use and drug resistance. Patients with frequent UTIs are encouraged to keep well hydrated. Some are encouraged to drink cranberry juice or cranberry extract. In 2016 a published study demonstrated no difference. The investigators hypothesize that the Uqora dietary supplement will decrease the frequency of UTIs. The study was designed as a prospective randomized blinded study. Results will be patient reported results along with any confirmation of a documented UTI. Participants will be asked to keep a weekly diary logging the supplement intake. The participant will also be asked to complete the King's Health Questionnaire, a urinary health questionnaire and quality of life. The data will be entered by the participant into a portal using a personalized login and password. the Uqora Dietary Supplement Products on Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Incidence in Women With Recurring UTIs| |Actual Study Start Date :||April 18, 2019| |Actual Primary Date :||September || Dietary Supplement: Uqora | Participants will receive 1 Placebo Drink-Mix and 2 Placebo Capsules Daily Other Name: Placebo | Group 1 || Dietary Supplement: Group1 | Participants will receive 1 Uqora Drink-Mix and 2 Placebo Capsules Daily | Group 2 || Dietary Supplement: Group 2 | Participants will receive 1 Uqora Drink-Mix and 2 Uqora Capsules Daily - Recurrence of UTIs at six-months [ Time Frame: 6-months ]A UTI is defined by the receipt of a prescription of antibiotics for treatment Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
