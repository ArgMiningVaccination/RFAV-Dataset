Essential Oils are the natural essences of plants acquired by steam distillation or cold-expression from a single botanical source. These oils are widely used in aromatherapy, [as reed diffuser bases](https://www.newdirectionsaromatics.com/products/aromatherapy-diffusers/), as well as in other commercial enterprises such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, candles, and [natural household cleaners](https://www.newdirectionsaromatics.com/products/household-cleaners/). Essential Oils are the immune systems of the plants being distilled, which enable the plant to defend itself from infection by other organisms. The fluids extracted from the plant are integral for its survival, but they often offer exotic fragrance compounds prized in Aromatherapy and Perfumery. At New Directions Aromatics, we offer a wide selection of pure, unadulterated Essential Oils obtained from the blossoms, leaves, bark, and roots of flowers, herbs, fruits and spices.
