These are circles of compassion that can become incubators for personal and political change.\" ~ Jean Shinoda Bolen ~ Words from past apprentices: My experience as a first year herbal apprentice has been one of the best decisions I have made for myself. I am building a strong foundation in the basics of herbalism and have formed new and nurturing friendships. I have gained a new understanding of the global impact of food practices and its politics on the world and on our bodies. I have become aware of the importance of living organically and environmentally. I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in enriching their lives and living more consciously! -Patty McKenizie This herbal medicine apprenticeship has offered so much more than I anticipated. Not only am I learning about herbs and their uses, the class has also offered hands-on exploration of the plant world and medicine making, and in-depth discussion about food activism. Tony(a) has integrated into our study field trips to beautiful, local areas of interest, encouraged attending an array of noteworthy speakers and has created a meaningful, conscious attitude toward community. -Kara Leistyna The 10 month program is a perfect way to gain insight to the world of herbalism, learn about gardening and the harvesting of herbs, and making medicine and body products out of earth's natural gifts to us. Coming from the Boston area, I look forward to my weekly apprenticeship at BSHS and find it a good way to begin the journey into plant medicine, whole health and conscious living.-Amber Mamakos This is where I see the garden changing my life. I knew on that higher level of knowing, that Blazing Star is not just a garden. It is a quieter space where I have one day a week to contemplate how the rest of my life can be spent-In a tornado or the eye of the hurricane.Tues has become one of my favorite days of the week. -Julie Robbins I tell everyone (just so you know) that my apprenticeship with you was the best, most useful class I've ever taken. -Lucia D 2008 Still feeling so grateful for the apprenticeship and all my herbal friends (both plant and human!)- Rachel S 2011 "}
