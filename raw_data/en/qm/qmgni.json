T elemedicine, for the purposes of this rule establishing standards of practice, does not include the provision of medical services only through an audio-only telephone, email messages, facsimile transmissions, or U.S. mail or other parcel service, or any combination thereof. \" T elemedicine technologies \" means technologies and devices enabling secure electronic communications and information exchanges between a licensee in one location and a patient in another location with or without an intervening health care provider . 327.9 (3) Practice guidelines. A licensee who uses telemedicine shall utilize evidence-based telemedicine practice guidelines and standards of practice, to the degree they are available, to ensure patient safety , quality of care, and positive outcomes.
