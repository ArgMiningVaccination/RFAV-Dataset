The MyHealthHerbals.com e-commerce site features herbal remedies based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western research, designed specifically to address common ailments such as joint health, women's health, poor digestion, and low energy. Among the most popular products in the MyHealthHerbals online catalog is Flexbend, a natural eggshell product harvested using a patented process that contains collagen, glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, hyaluronic acid, and enzymes, which support the joints and connective tissue. Digest & Thrive also is popular with people suffering from gluten or dairy intolerance with symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, and provides a full spectrum of enzymes to breakdown major food groups. Another popular remedy created by Andrew Gaeddert is Astra 8, a precise and proprietary blend of astragalus, ligustrum, eleuthero, and ginseng to help boost energy, tone the body's defensive systems, and help the body adapt to stress. The MyHealthHerbals.com site also includes a variety of other supplements that can be used to address various conditions. What differentiates MyHealthHerbals from other suppliers of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the care taken to ensure consistent quality and maximum effectiveness. All MyHealthHerbals products are produced using strict protocols. Herbs are hand-chosen, paying close attention to species, where it's grown, time of harvest, and the spirit in which plants are gathered. Trained herbalists evaluate the herbs using smell, taste, and appearance as they have done for millennia, then independent labs screen for pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria, and other contaminants. Once they pass inspection, the herbs are processed according to tradition to maximize potency and eliminate undesired qualities, and then they are meticulously combined and packaged as tablets for ease-of-use in consistent dosages. \"Western consumers are still learning about the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and most aren't prepared to consume Chinese herbs in teas or other forms,\" said Gaeddert. \"The Western market needs a reliable source of alternative medicines that offer consistent quality and are available with prompt delivery. MyHealthHerbals.com will fill that niche by giving consumers a variety of herbal remedies available when they want them in easy-to-use tablet form.\" Gaeddert first became interested in Traditional Chinese Medicine when conventional medicine failed to offer a cure for Crohn's disease, a life-threatening digestive disorder. After years of experimentation and research, Gaeddert was able to successfully treat his malady with herbal medicine, and since then he has helped thousands heal with herbal medicines through his private practice. He has studied with master herbalists in the U.S. and China, and has lectured at Columbia University and colleges nationwide. He also has developed clinically tested formulas to help patients with AIDS, cancer, and other chronic diseases. He also is the author of numerous books, including Chinese Herbs in the Western Clinic, Digestive Health Now, Healing Digestive Disorders, Healing Immune Disorders, and Healing Skin Disorders.
