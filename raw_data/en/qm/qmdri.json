Monkeypox Provider FAQs and Resources: Washington State Department -and-your- family/illness -and-disease -z/monkeypox/provider -faq-and-resources . PURPOSE To outline the administration process and the healthcare providers ' responsibilities for assessing, ordering , and administering the Jynneos vaccine to individuals who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). BACKGROUND Monkeypox is a rare viral disease discovered in 1958 in laboratory monkeys with the first human case recorded in 1970. This disease is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxvirus family , the same genus as that of the variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox . There are two known types of monkeypox virus: West African and Congo Basin. Although monkeypox is endemic in several African countr ies, cases in non - endemic countries (e.g., Europe, North America, Australia) have been identified since May 2022.1,2 Monkeypox signs and symptoms are similar to but milder than smallpox symptoms. During the incubation period, which lasts 7 -14 days (range 5 -21 days), the patient does not exhibit symptoms and is not contagious. During the prodrome phase, the patient can experience fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. A patient may be contagious during this prodromal period. Subsequently , patient develops a characteristic rash (i.e., firm, well defined, deep -seated, umbilicated lesions) appearing on the face, inside the mouth, or o ther areas of the body such as the hands, feet, and chest. In the May 2022 outbreak, rash in the genital or perianal regions have been common. Infected persons remain contagious from onset of symptoms through the time all lesions heal, and scabs fall off. Duration of entire illness usually lasts 2-4 weeks. Prior to 2022, the mortality rate in endemic countries ranged from 1 - 10%.17 The ongoing monkeypox outbreak since May 2022 in the United States is caused by the West African type with associated milder dis ease and hospitalizations 1,2,18 The virus can be transmitted from person -to-person through direct contact with an infected person's or animal's body fluids/sores, touching materials (e.g., clothing or linen) that previously touched infectious rash or bod y fluids, respiratory secretions during prolonged face to face contact or intimate physical contact, or pregnant women who can spread the virus to the fetus via the placenta.1,2 Per the WHO, it is likely that people younger than 40 years old no longer ben efit from cross -protective immunity against orthopoxvirus disease provided by prior smallpox vaccination programs in the 1970s. Therefore, the ACIP recommends that people whose jobs may expose them frequently to orthopoxviruses obtain PrEP.16 On May 24, 20 22, the CDC recommends PEP for individuals with high or intermediate degree of exposure to a monkeypox case. Ideally, PEP is given DocuSign Envelope ID: E6E353C1-F7FB-4D50-8FD7-FD100A051BA2Assessment, Administration, and Ordering of the Monkeypox Vaccines, Standardized Procedure Page 5 of 22 Revised 0 8/31/2022 within 4 days of exposure to prevent onset of disease. If it is given between days 4-14 after exposure, symptoms of disease m ay be reduced but disease not prevented.1-3 To increase vaccine supply, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) on August 09, 2022 which allow s the use of intradermal administration of Jynneos at one fifth of the subcutaneous dose in people 18 years old and to allow for subcutaneous injection in <18 years old .23 For years, under California Business and Professionals Code 4052a.11 and 4052.8, pharmacists have been able to \"administer immunizat ion pursuant to a protocol with a [prescriber's authorization]\".4 In September 2016, the California Board of Pharmacy announced a new regulation (Title 16, California Code of Regulations) allowing pharmacists with specified training to provide vaccines on their own authority.5 The California Nurse Practice Act under Division 2, Chapter 6, Article 2 Scope of Regulation 2725, allows for the practice of nursing to perform immunization techniques and direct and indirect patient care services as ordered by and within the scope of licensure of a physician.20 LEVEL Interdependent SUPPORTIVE DATA This standardized procedure complies with the California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) Standardized Procedure Guideline and the CDPH's Immunization Branch authorization. ORDERING AND AUTHORIZING PROVIDER(S) This is a \" per protocol, no co -sign required \" procedure. If using HealthLink, enter order for monkeypox vaccine into the electronic health record (EHR) or on paper form as a \"per protocol, no co -sign required\" using Jesus Saucedo , M.D. as the authorizing provider.

A severe systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of Jynneos \u00ae. Do not vaccinate. Refer patient to an allergist -immunologist to assess risk versus benefits of administering a dose . 2. Persons who have developed monkeypox symptoms after exposure or have recovered from monkeypox. Currently there is no kno wn benefit for offering vaccination to this population . If indicated, anti -viral treatment is a more effective clinical approach . REASONS FOR DEFERRAL/ PRECAUTIONS8,10,26 For either PrEP or PEP: 1. History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) following gentamicin or ciprofloxacin: Discuss risk and benefits with patient. If vaccinated, complete a 30 -minute observation period. Alternatively, can defer patient to an allergist -immunologist for consultation, but impact of delaying vaccination should be considered. 2. History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to chicken or egg protein AND are currently avoiding exposure to all chicken or egg products: Discuss risk and benefits with pa tient. If vaccinated, complete a 30 -minute observation period. Alternatively, can defer patient to an allergist - immunologist for consultation, but impact of delaying vaccination should be considered. 3. Moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever: defer until symptoms resolved For PrEP: 1. Immunocompromised: Discuss with patient that there may be diminished immune response 2. Pregnancy: Available human data on Jynneos\u00ae administered in pregnant women are insufficient to determine vaccine -associated risk s in pregnancy. Animal models have shown no evidence of harm to developing fetus. Discuss risk s versus benefits with patient, using shared decision making. 3. Breastfeeding: It is not known whether Jynneos\u00ae is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effect of Jynneos\u00ae on milk production or the safety of Jynneos\u00ae on breastfed infants. However, because Jynneos\u00ae is replication -deficient, it is unlikely to present a risk of transmission to breastfed infants and can be administered to breastf eeding women if vaccination is critical. Discuss risk s versus benefits with patient, using shared decision making. 4. Drug and Vaccine interactions: a. Because of the unknown risk of myocarditis after Jynneos\u00ae, may consider waiting 4 weeks after Jynneos\u00ae befor e receiving an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, especially in adolescent or young adult males. However, if PrEP is recommended in the setting of an outbreak, no minimum interval between mRNA COVID -19 vaccination and Jynneos\u00ae vaccination is necessary.8 b. Jynneos\u00ae may be administered concomitantly with or 30 days apart from other live vaccines.

If a patient is recommended and accept s Jynneos\u00ae due to an exposure to monkeypox virus, the patient sh all be vaccinated regardless of concurrent illnesse s, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or weakened immune system unless otherwise instructed by a healthcare provider.10 PROCEDURE9,10 1. Confirm individual using two (2) identifiers. 2. Review patient's Screening Form and Eligibility Form for the indications for vaccination, previous immunization history, current health status, and medical history for previous hypersensitivity reactions and other adverse events related to the vaccine or similar vaccines. 3. Review Consent Form and ensure tha t it is fully completed and signed, and that the individual meets current vaccine eligibility criteria based on current CDC and CDPH guidelines. If consent is not available in the individual's preferred language, utilize an interpreter , preferably certifie d. If interpreter used, document in health record. 4. Review individual's date of birth and ensure that individual meets age criteria for vaccine being administered. Do not vaccinate if age criteria not met. 5. If vaccination is contraindicated, should be deferred, or provider order is required (hospital and clinic setting only) but not provided, do not vaccinate and advise individual to follow up with their primary care provider. 6. Screen individual for allergic reactions to the monkeypox vaccine components and prior allergic reactions to previous vaccine dose, if applicable. 7. Provide the most current federal Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact Sheet for Patients and Caregi vers to all patients22: a. Documentation of vaccine administration must include the date the patient received the VIS document and EUA fact sheet as well as the VIS publication date. b. If possible, try to ensure non -English speaking patients receive VIS documents in their preferred language; refer to www.immunize.org/vis for current and translated VIS documents. 8. Patient Education: a. The most common side effects seen are injection site re actions (pain , redness , swelling , induration, itching ) and systemic adverse reactions (muscle aches, chills, headache , fatigue, and nausea ). If vaccine is given intradermally, inform patient that prolonged duration of induration or erythema can occur. Side effects are usually self -limiting. b. Counsel patients on the benefits and risks of the vaccine , using shared decision making. c. Instruct to report any serious adverse reactions to their healthcare provider.

Educate regarding the importance of completing the immunization series. Full protection is achieved two weeks after completing vaccination series. 9. Prepare Monkeypox Vaccine: Table 3: Preparation Instructions for Monkeypox Vaccine9,13 Jynneos\u00ae 1. Allow vaccine to thaw and reach room temperature before use (if frozen, thaw time is less than 10 minutes) 2. Once the vial is punctured and a dose is withdrawn, if it is not used in its entirety, it should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and discarded withi n 8 hours of the first puncture. 3. Once thawed, the vaccine may be kept at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) for 8 weeks. Do not refreeze. 4. Jynneos\u00ae, when thawed, is a milky light yellow to pale white colored suspension. 5. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration. If either condition exists, do not administer vaccine. 6. Gently swirl vial for 30 seconds before use 7. Withdraw 0.5 mL for subcutaneous or 0.1 mL for intradermal injection into sterile syringe 10.

Report all vaccine errors to ISMP Vaccine Error Reporting Program (VERP) at www.ismp.org/report -medication -error . 3. For anaphylaxis following the administration of drugs, complete Anaphylaxis Response Form 4. Although anaphylaxis, an acute and potentially life -threatening allergic reaction, is rare every healthcare provider administering vaccine should be knowledgeable on the management of allergic reactions. Reaction Symptoms Management Mild Localized The injection site is swollen, sore, red, or itchy Recommend application of a cold compress or ice to the injection site. Recommend an analgesic agent or antipruritic medication. Ask the patient to be observed for 30 minutes if possible. If not further symptoms, send the patient home. Localized Slight bleeding Affix an adhesive bandage over the injection site. Psychological fear/syncope Fright, fear, or anxiety before receiving injection. Request the patient to lie down or sit during vaccination. Do not vaccinate if the patient is combative. Moderate Localized Continuous bleeding Place a thick layer of gauze pads over injection site, maintaining direct and firm pressure; elevate the bleeding injection site (e.g., ar m) such that it is above the heart level. Psychological fear and syncope Extreme pallor, sweating, cold extremities (hands, feet), nausea, dizziness, weakness, or disturbances in vision. Have patient lie flat or sit with head between knees for several min utes. Loosen any tight clothing and maintain an open airway. Apply cool, damp cloth to patient's face and neck. Fall, without loss of consciousness Examine the patient to determine if injury is present before attempting to move the patient. Place patient flat on back with feet elevated. Notify designated provider of the event. Severe Loss of consciousness Call 911 Assess the patient for signs of injury before any attempt to move the patient. If there is any indication DocuSign Envelope ID: E6E353C1-F7FB-4D50-8FD7-FD100A051BA2Assessment, Administration, and Ordering of the Monkeypox Vaccines, Standardized Procedure Page 13 of 22 Revised 0 8/31/2022 Reaction Symptoms Management of cervical spine involvement, DO NOT move the patient. Try to have the patient lying flat on their back with feet up, if pulse, respiration, BP are steady. Continuously observe and monitor until EMS arrives and the patient is transported to the ED for evaluation. Notify designated provider of the event. Anaphylaxis Sudden or gradual onset including: Respiratory: sensation of throat closing or tightness, stridor (high -pitched sound while breathing) , hoarseness, respiratory distress (such as shortness of breath or wheezing), coughing, trouble swallowing/drooling, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal itching; conjunctivitis; or swelling of eyes, lips, tongue, mouth, face, or extremities Neurologic: agitation; convulsions; acute change in mental status; sense of impending doom Other: sudden increase in secretions (from eyes, nose, or mouth); urinary incontinence IMPORTANT: Anaphylaxis should be considered when signs or symptoms are generalized (i.e. , if there are generalized hives or more than 1 body system is involved) or are serious or life-threatening in nature, even if they involve a single body system (e.g., Outpa tient clinic sites: Follow Ambulatory Service BRN 1, Anaphylaxis Standardized Procedure Community mass vaccination sites or clinic sites (May be initiated by the RN): Call 911 (preferably by another person). Initiate the following treatment at the first sign of symptoms. The first -line AND most important therapy in anaphylaxis is epinephrine. There are NO contraindications to epinephrine in the setting of anaphylaxis. In adults, administer epinephrine auto -injector (0.3mg/dose) IM, preferably in the mid -outer thigh through clothing if necessary. In pediatrics, follow the medication dosage chart for anaphylaxis for weight -based dosing. Epinephrine dose may be repeated 2 additional times every 5 -15 minutes as necessary if anaphylactic symptoms persist, whi le waiting for EMS to arrive. The number and timing of epinephrine doses should be recorded and communicated to EMS.
