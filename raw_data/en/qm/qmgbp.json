At FIU, the health of our university community is a top priority, and we continue to do everything we can to help our Panther family stay safe. COVID-19 cases are increasing in the United States and abroad as a result of the highly transmissible Delta variant. This makes it critical that all Panthers remain vigilant and take important steps to ensure we are protected. Get the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination remains the most powerful tool to prevent the disease and stop community spread. At FIU, we have vaccines available on campus for students, faculty, staff, retirees and eligible members of their households. Please look for email messages on how you can get vaccinated on campus or call 305-348-5100 for an appointment. [There are also multiple locations locally where you may receive a vaccine](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/initiatives/coronavirus/vaccine/home.page). Vaccination lowers the risk and severity of infection, but in an environment with significant amounts of virus, there is still a risk. Unvaccinated individuals continue to be at high risk of infection and should continue wearing face coverings at all times. [COVID-19 testing is available on campus](https://repopulation.fiu.edu/covid-19-response-team/covid-testing/index.html) at no cost, through our partnership with Curative. There are COVID-19 testing options widely available in our [community](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/initiatives/coronavirus/testing-locations.page). For your safety and that of everyone on campus, please get tested - whether you are vaccinated or not - if you feel sick or have been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Stay healthy. Please remember to continue washing your hands periodically throughout the day, stay home if you are sick, get tested and seek medical attention if needed. These are all basic health measures that should stay with us for the long term. And don't forget - complete the P3 app questionnaire before starting your day on campus. The P3 app is available from the app stores and is an important tool in keeping the Panther family safe. Completing the app helps stop the spread and prevents clusters on campus. Panthers Protecting Panthers. Each one of us must take personal responsibility for our health and the wellbeing of those around us. We are counting on every Panther to do your part. Please stay informed and make use of [information and resources](https://repopulation.fiu.edu/) on campus. "}
