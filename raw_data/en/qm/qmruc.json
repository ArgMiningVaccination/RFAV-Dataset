The use of metaphors and reference to fictional characters from multiple books makes this book an exciting read for everyone. Immunity is a topic that is continuously evolving and very difficult to understand. The author has done an excellent job in making it an enjoyable read with her impeccable writing skills. The concept of herd immunity is discussed in detail with multiple examples. \"This is why the chances of contracting measles can be higher for a vaccinated person living in a largely unvaccinated community than they are for an unvaccinated person living in a largely vaccinated community.\" The difference between the vaccination in the developed countries and the developing countries is discussed really well by the author. \"Wealthier countries have the luxury of entertaining fears the rest of the world cannot afford\" How capitalism is hindering our objective of vaccination and implementing herd immunity is dealt with in detail. It is dismal to see people's greed for money is killing many innocent people worldwide. \"That so many of us find it entirely plausible that a vast network of researchers and health officials and doctors worldwide would willfully harm children for money is evidence of what capitalism is really taking from us. Capitalism has already impoverished the working people who generate wealth for others. And capitalism has already impoverished us culturally, robbing unmarketable art of its value. But when we begin to see the pressures of capitalism as innate laws of human motivation, when we begin to believe that everyone is owned, then we are truly impoverished.\" - These are some other crucial topics discussed in this book - Vaccination and race. - Pros and cons of using hand sanitizers. - [Rachel Carson]'s [Silent Spring]and the good and bad changes it brought. - Why some communities are still not accepting vaccination. - Vaccination and technology. - Antibiotics and vaccination, and time travel. - Heroic Medicine. - Germ theory and mothers. - Vampires and Medicine. - Vaccination in acts of war. - Chickenpox parties. - Karl Max's Capital and vaccination. - Cynicism and doctors. - Stoics and vaccination. - AIDS and individualism - Narcissus and immunity. This is a brilliantly written book on immunity that everyone must-read, especially in this current pandemic situation we are facing right now. "}
