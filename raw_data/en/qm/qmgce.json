[View the South Dakota Monoclonal Antibody Treatment flyer](/media/sd2mgfay/monoclonalantibodytherapy_covid.pdf) What are monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the antibodies created by your immune system to fight off harmful viruses. Bamlanivimab + etesevimab and casirivimab + imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically designed to protect against severe COVID-19 infection. The antibodies bind to the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus to stop the virus from entering your cells and continuing the infection. - Who can get this treatment? Antibody treatment can be used by people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who: - Test positive for SARS-CoV-2; - Are within 10 days of the start of their symptoms; - Are age 12 or older and weigh at least 88 pounds; and - Are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 infection or of needing to be admitted to a hospital because of COVID-19. Examples of chronic medical conditions include: - Chronic kidney disease - Diabetes - Immunosuppressive disease - Currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment - Having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 (overweight or obese) - Pregnancy - Aged 65 years and older - Cardiovascular disease (including congenital heart disease) or hypertension - Chronic lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma [moderate-to-severe], interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension) - Sickle cell disease - Neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy) or other complex conditions (e.g., genetic or metabolic syndromes and severe congenital abnormalities) - Having a medical-related technological dependence (e.g, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation [not related to COVID-19]) Individuals who meet high-risk criteria and test positive should contact their primary care physician about a referral for antibody treatment within three days of a positive test result and no later than 10 days after symptom onset. Treatment for COVID-19 is available in many parts of the state. Check with your healthcare provider about the use of monoclonal antibodies or an antiviral. | | Avera Health Monument Health | | Sanford Health Independent Hospitals "}
