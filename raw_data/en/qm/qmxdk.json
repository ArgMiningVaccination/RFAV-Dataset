Why not standing orders? Recently, it has come to light that the use of protocols or standing orde rs is widely m isunderst ood in public hea lth immuniz ation progra ms. Many progra ms have bee n using \"standi ng orders\" for years -- but s tanding orde are patie nt-specific , and the public alth orders are not. The MDH Immunizati on Progra m has adde d to t his misundersta nding by di stributing a one-page document called \"Sta nding Orders for Local Publi c Health Agencies.\" The fact is that patient-specific order s are not an efficient mechanism for holding mas s immunizati on clinics without a physician on site. Public health nurses need another mec hanism to do this. That mechanis m was a dded to the Mi nnesota Nursing Practice La w in 1995. It is called \"pr escription by protocol.\" [Minnesota statue section 148.235, Subd.,(8) .] allows RNs to presc ribe and administer le gend drugs , including vac cines, based on conditions (as oppose d to being ba sed on spe cific patients.) Subseque ntly, t he law was a mended i n 2004 to include licen sed practical nur ses administering vacci nes [Subd. (9) ]. Need hel p developing or modifying your vaccine prot ocols to meet the legal requirement s? Call Mariclaire England Minnesota Board of Nursing 612-617-2274. The Minnesota Board of Nursing has published a series of ar ticles i n their newsletter and on their websit e at www.nursingboard.state.m n.us since 1995 explaining this law. Th e Board of Nursing is responsible for inte rpreting the nursing law -- not MDH. The bottom l ine is that our use of \"sta nding orders \" in public hea lth immuniz ation progra ms is not in keeping wit h the Minnesota nursi ng practice law. While sever al local publi c health agencies in t he state are already using separate vaccine prot ocols (previous called standi ng orders), mos t are not . Clearly, it is in the best in terest of nurses to work toward compliance with th e nursi ng practice law that has bee n in effect for a number of year s. In short, t his is an issue that needs work and we will all need to do our part i n correcting it. Why so many vaccine protocols? Yes, there are a lot of pr otocols; however, providing prescriptions is a necessary task of the m edical director in order for public health nurses to carry out their duties safely and legally. The Board of Nursing suggests th at vaccines with different schedules, ages, or dose indications need to have separate protocols. Do protocols need to be re-signed annually? Legally, no. There is no la w requiring that these protocols be re-signed annually by the licensed medical prescriber. However, the Minnesota Board of Nursing suggests, as a st andard of practice, that they be reviewed, updated if necessary, and re- signed annually. Next steps. The \"Gu idance for Ado pting Vacc ine Pr otocols\" and the protocols comple ted so far are av ailable on the MDH website at www.health.state.m n.us/imm unize , (click on Vaccine Protocols for Local Public Health under For H ealth C are Providers).

The following table d escribes each elem ent of the vaccine p rotocol tem plate and steps needed by lo cal public health to adapt a protocol. Guidance for Adopting Vaccine Pr otocols MDH Immunization Program (05/08) Page 2 of 4 Definitio ns Steps to take to adopt prot ocols Condition-specific protocol: The disease against which you are vaccinating is the specific condition tha t is used in each protocol. This has alrea dy been incl uded in the te mplates. Criteria: The param eters/boundaries b y which t he RN can proceed or not to vaccinate, based on the screening and her asse ssment. Criteria are organized b y indications, contraindicatio ns, and precautions. 9 Review and further delineate the criteria (see below). A licensed prescriber must review the criteria and a ctions and deter mine the appropriate action to be prescribed. Indications : Groups that are or are not reco mmended for vaccination. The ACIP recommended indications are included in the tem plates. 9 Make sure all the indications for which you give a vaccine are included in the protocols. Contraindications : Most standard contraindic ations foun d in the ACIP reco mmendations and described in the Guidelines to Contraindications and Precautions a re included on the tem plates. All templates wil l include the t wo common contraindications that result in a prescribed action to not vaccinate: anaphy laxis (sy stemic laxis (sy stemic rea ction) to a component in the vaccine. 9 Review this s ection to deter mine, accord ing to agenc y practice, if any additional contraindications need to be added or if any existing contraindications shoul d be further delin eated. Precautions : Conditions that usually result in a tem porary or permanent de ferral of vacc ination. The m ost common prec aution is acute moderate or severe illness. 9 Based on your nursing assessment skills and your experience deter mining when to proc eed or not with vaccination, work with your m edical director to clearly define m ild illness and m oderate to severe illness. 9 Once defined, include thes e same definitions in all va ccine protocols your agency adopts. The following factors influence how the illnesses are defined and what prescrib ed actions are taken: o The experience level of the nurses, o The specialty of the prescriber, o The availability of imm ediate medical care in the community , o Whether the nurses will be able to reach the medical prescriber with questions. 9 Discuss with your m edical director: o What is the tem perature thr eshold taken: oral-rect al-axillary Note: The Red Book uses 100.4 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) or gre ater as the defining boundary between low grade fever and fever in young chil dren. (AAP. Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases. 2006) o If a baby has a cold or a runny nose, what other sy mptoms should be clarified to diffe rentia te between acute mild and acute moderate to severe illness? (Unc hanging sy mptoms for 1 da y, 2 Guidance for Adopting Vaccine Protocols MDH Immunization Program (05/08) Page 3 of 4 days, 3 days? Presence of cough? Presence of any fever? Alert, active, eating well? Report of lethargy? Poor appetite?) o What gastrointestinal symptoms should result in deferral of vaccination? The presence of both of vomiting and diarrhea? Vomiting within the past 24 hours? Diarrhea alone that is liquid and occurring more than 6 times per day? Any diarrhea within the past 24 hours? o When a patient has a chronic illness, how comfortable are the nurses with proceeding to vaccinate? For influenza vaccination it may be clear, but what about other vaccines and their relationship to chronic health conditions? Are there specific conditions that would prompt a referral back to the person's primary care provider, for example, immune deficiency, cancer, or clotting factor deficiencies? If so, they should be listed as a precaution. Actions prescribed: Instructions for the nurse when the patient meets or does not meet the criteria. Those listed in the template are suggested actions that might be typical. Those in brackets [like this] may work for some and not for others and are included for consideration. 9 Review the list of prescribed actions with the medical director and determine which are appropriate for your agency. 9 Fill in the blanks. 9 Decide what the nurse should do beyond not vaccinating when there is a contraindication or precaution (e.g., call the medical director first, refer patient to a primary care provider, or set up an appointment with the agency's doctor or an allergist). 9 Insert this information into each protocol you adopt. 9 Decide prescribed actions based on resources in your community and agency. For example: o You may refer patients with allergies to a primary care provider, an allergy specialist, or to your agency's own clinic for further evaluation. o You may need to specify what to do if specific products can or cannot be given, e.g., refer patients who are allergic to thimerosal to a clinic that h as thimerosal-free vaccine if your agency doesn't have these products. 9 Decide what the nurse should do, besides deferring vaccination until resolution of symptoms, when m oderate to severe acute illness has been ascertained. Should the patient be referred to the primary care provider? Urgent care? Should the medical prescriber be called? 9 Decide how chronic conditions identified for referral should be handled. Should they be referred back to a primary care provider? A specialist? Should the medical director be called to determine whether or not to vaccinate? Prescription: Must include all the elements that any prescription would require. The templates include this information. 9 Verify that these elements are in cluded in protocol prescriptions: o The name of the drug o The dosage of the drug o The route of administration o The timing (schedule) of the drug o Any special instructions that apply to the drug Guidance for Adopting Vaccine Pr otocols MDH Immunization Program (05/08) Page 4 of 4 Medical emergenc y or anaph ylaxis 9 Determine which of the m edical em ergency /anap hylaxis directions on the tem plate is most appropriate for your agenc y: o If only RNs (PHNs) ar e giving vaccines , use the first state ment. o If LPNs or un licensed assistive personnel, such as MAs, are actually giving the vaccines, use the second statement. o Note: The two options are in separate rows of a table on the protocol tem plate, so you c an delete the whole row th at you are not going to use. 9 Fill in the name of y our agency 's emergency protocol docum ent.
