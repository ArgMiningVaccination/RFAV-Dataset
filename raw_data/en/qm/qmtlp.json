The ancient wisdom underlying Chinese Medicine is the understanding that everything is interconnected, that no single part can be understood except in the relation to the whole. Optimal health in Chinese medicine is defined as a state of harmonious balance in the body. When the relationship between yin and yang becomes disharmonised, unbalanced, blocked or stagnant symptomatic patterns of disease result. Unlike Western Medicine in which diagnosis is symptom and condition based, a [Chinese Medicine Practitioner](https://thedaohealth.com.au/chinese-medicine-practitioners/) will treat specific patterns of imbalance which can manifest as a number of symptoms such as back ache or period pain. It is likely in a consultation and acupuncture treatment for your chinese medicine health practitioner to view the tongue, check your pulse and ask about your diet and lifestyle for a condition such as insomnia. Research in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine, especially in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine is continuing to evolve, providing evidence based research in the west for confident prescription of Acupuncture as a complementary medicine in the biomedical framework of an integrative healthcare setting. The Benefits of Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine focuses on resolving the current condition and the prevention of further disease rather than symptomatic care. This benefits the body by treating the root of the cause and working in a preventative model of healthcare.
