April 18, 2019. 01 7 WHAT IS CHEMOTHERAPY? Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is one way to treat cancer and it may be used alone or together with surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal or immunotherapy. Chemotherapy works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells, which grow and divide quickly. But it can also harm normal cells in the body that are fast growing. Damage to normal cells may cause side effects. Often, these side effects get better or go away after chemotherapy is over. Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, chemotherapy can: Make a tumor smaller before surgery. This is called neo -adjuvant chemotherapy. Destroy cancer cells that may remain after surgery or radiation therapy. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Help radiation therapy and immunotherapy work better. Destroy cancer cells that have come back (recurrent cancer), or have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer). Your doctor will discuss your specific chemotherapy plan with you. You will have regularly appointments to assess the progress of the treatment. HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Most chemotherapy medicines are given by injections into a vein, called intravenous (IV). Some are taken by mouth. A few are given by injections under the skin or into a muscle. For IV chemotherapy, medication is given through a small needle inserted into a vein. The length of time for the infusion depends on the chemotherapy plan your oncologist has chosen for you. The type of cancer determines the type of treatment given. Other than the discomfort of the needle being inserted, chemotherapy should not be a painful experience. Some infusions take minutes while others may take several hours. You may receive other medicines through the IV line to prevent side effects (e.g. nausea). At the end of the treatment, the needle will be taken out. REDNESS OR BRUISING If redness or pain occurs at the chemotherapy injection site, call your doctor or nurse. Slight bruising at the site where blood is drawn, or where treatment is given, may occur but is usually harmless. April 18, 2019. 01 8 VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES These devices allow chemotherapy and other intravenous medications to be given without using a vein in the hand or arm. They often permit blood to be drawn more easily as well. The devices are usually removed when therapy is completed. If it is determined that you would benefit from such a device, a referral will be sent to the appropriate department for placement. Two different types of venous access devices are frequently used. The type of venous access device chosen for you is based on the therapies you will receive for your cancer . PICC: A PICC line is a long catheter inserted into a vein in your arm which ends in a large vein in the chest near the heart. It will have one or two lines sticking out of the skin. PICC lines require flushing and dressing changes every 7 days without exception. The PICC and its dressing cannot get wet so it will need to be covered when you bathe. Port: A port is a small, round disc made of plastic or metal that is placed under your skin in your chest. The port is connected to a catheter that ends in a large vein near your heart. Your nurse inserts a special needle into your port to give you chemotherapy or draw blood. The needle can be left in place for chemotherapy treatments that are given for more than 1 day. A port requires flushing every 4 weeks when not in use. Be sure to watch for signs of infection (redness, swelling, discomfort, or leaking) around your venous access device. Please call with any concerns or questions . Pumps : A portable infusion pump may be used to administer chemotherapy. These pumps are typically small and can be worn on a belt, in a pocket, or in a fanny pack. They are helpful when chemotherapy must be given continuously over a specified period, usually several days. They control how much and how fast chemotherapy goes into a PICC or port. The pump allows you to stay at home instead of being in the hospital for chemotherapy. April 18, 2019. 01 9 HOW CHEMOTHERAPY MIGHT AFFECT YOU Chemotherapy medications affect the rapidly dividing cells in the body. Cancer cells tend to form new cells more quickly than normal cells. However, chemotherapy can harm normal healthy cells in the body that are fast growing, such as those present in your hair follicles, mouth, skin, lining of the intestines, and bone marrow (where the blood cells are made). Damage to normal cells may cause unpleasant side effects, which usually get better or go away after chemotherapy is over. However an absence of side effects does not mean that the chemotherapy is not effective. Refer to your medication information sheets for a detailed description of common and uncommon side effects for each chemotherapy drug. EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY ON YOUR BONE MARROW Bone marrow is found at the center of bones, especially in the skull, sternum, ribs, backbone, and pelvis. Bone marrow produces red and white blood cells and platelets, which are all rapidly dividing cells. They are held there until they mature and then released into the bloodstream to perform their vital functions. Because chemotherapy acts on these rapidly dividing cells, their production may be interrupted when chemotherapy is given. As a consequence, the number of circulating cells in the bloodstream can become reduced over time, resulting in anemia (decreased red blood cell count), neutropenia (decreased white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (decreased platelet count). During the course of treatment, the term \"nadir \" may be used. This refers to the point when the cells in the body are at their lowest number. This is a predictable time, depending on the chemotherapy agent used. For example, one drug may have a nadir of 7 to10 days. This means that 7 to10 days after beginning chemotherapy, the red cells, white cells, and platelets will be at their lowest number in the bloodstream. After a period of time, the blood counts will begin to rise back to normal. WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND INFECTION The white blood cells (WBC) help the body fight infections. Chemotherapy kills both the cancer -producing cells and healthy, infection -fighting cells, which decreases your body 's ability to fight infection. Chances of infection are highest when white blood cell count drops below normal. The following hints will help prevent an infection: Avoid exposure to large crowds and people who are ill. Maintain good personal hygiene, including mouth care. If possible, take care of dental work before you start chemotherapy. April 18, 2019. 01 10 Wash your hands often with soap and warm water during the day, or use antibacterial hand sanitizers. This is especially important before eating and after using the bathroom. Good hand washing is one of the first steps for avoiding infection . Avoid getting small cuts or scrapes during the time when white blood cells are low, because the skin can harbor germs and infections can start. If cuts or abrasions occur, clean the area well with soap and water, then cover the area with a clean bandage to protect it. Call your doctor 's office for further directions if needed . Use gloves, potholders, sunscreen, and other items to protect your skin while performing necessary chores. Food safety is important. Wash all fruits and vegetables. Do not eat raw foods, including meats, shellfish, and eggs. Milk and juices should be pasteurized . Do not change cat litter or handle animal waste. In most cases, the lowered white blood cell count (WBC) will be mild and will correct itself as the bone marrow heals. Healing typically occurs between each chemotherapy course. In some instances, your doctor may recommend a medication called filgrastim -sndz (Zarxio\u00ae) to stimulate the bone marrow to make more white cells. You will be taught to give this medication so you can take it in the comfort of your home . Remember, during your nadir you will want to avoid exposure to large crowds and people who are ill. Unless instructed by your doctor or nurse, continue your normal activities (e.g. shopping, taking walks, going to the movies ). Important to Remember Keep a thermometer at home and know how to use it. Check your temperature anytime you feel hot or chilled. EARLY SIGNS OF INFECTION MAY INCLUDE Temperature of 101\u00b0F or a temperature of 100.4\u00b0F that is sustained over one hour Chills (or shaking) with or without a fever A new or worsening cough Sore throat More than 3 loose stools in a day Pain or burning with urination A sore that becomes red, is draining, or does not heal Be alert to these signs and notify your doctor at 415 -833-8821 if any of these occur. April 18, 2019. 01 11 PLATELETS AND BLEEDING Platelets are the blood cells that facilitate the clotting of blood and help stop bleeding from a cut or injury. Platelets can be destroyed by chemotherapy. Some of the first signs of a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are constant bleeding from a cut or unexpected (or sudden) bruising. Some people notice bleeding from their gums after eating a meal or brushing their teeth. Nosebleeds, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, and/or blood in the urine or stool may also occur. You may notice small, pinpoint spots, often in clusters, known as petechiae inside the mouth or elsewhere on the body, such as the arms or legs. To Prevent Bleeding Avoid injury to the skin when your platelets are low. Be careful to avoid bruises, cuts or burns. Blow your nose gently, and do not pick your nose. If a nosebleed occurs, apply gentle pressure to the nostrils while remaining in an upright position. Apply a cold compress to the nose, if necessary . When shaving use an electronic razor to prevent nicks instead of razor blades. Take care of your mouth. Use a soft bristle toothbrush. Continue to floss unless bleeding occurs or you are instructed not to floss . If you have dentures, make sure they fit properly to decrease irritation to gums. Rinse your mouth with a salt -water solution to help keep it clean and promote healing. It is important to avoid constipation, keep stool soft, and refrain from straining during a bowel movement. Straining can rupture tiny blood vessels in the rectal area and cause hemorrhoids. You may take laxative or stool softener to keep your bowels soft and regular . MEDICATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT PLATELETS AND CAUSE BLEEDING Aspirin and some non -aspirin pain relievers such NSAIDS, are blood thinners and make it harder for platelets to clot blood. These medications should be avoided unless prescribed by your doctor. Many over the counter medications contain NSAIDs. Make sure to read the labels of any over the counter medication to ensure it does not contain NSAIDS. If you are unsure of the ingredients in any medication, call your pharmacy . April 18, 2019. 01 12 Bleeding Symptoms You Should Tell Your Doctor About Bleeding that continues for more than ten minutes despite applying direct pressure. Gums that bleed excessively when you floss or brush. Excessive number of pads used during menstruation. SEEK MEDICAL HELP IM MEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: Severe headaches Blood in the urine or stool Coughing up blood Prolonged and uncontrollable bleeding RED BLOOD CELLS AND ANEMIA Chemotherapy may cause anemia by lowering the number of red blood cells (RBC). Anemia occurs when the blood has low hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cell that carries oxygen needed for your body. A test of your complete blood cell (CBC) count will show a decrease in hemoglobin if you have anemia. When your hemoglobin is low, try to get more rest and pace your activities. Eating nutrient -rich foods or taking iron and folic acid supplements can help with anemia. Please consult with your doctor prior to taking any medications, including over-the-counter supplements. Specific treatments for anemia may include blood transfusion, and taking iron supplements. Anemia Symptoms You Should Tell Your Doctor About Chest pain Dizziness, lightheadedness Shortness of breath Palpitations April 18, 2019. 01 13 HAIR LOSS Some, but not all every person who receives chemotherapy, will experience hair loss, also called alopecia. The amount of hair loss will depend upon the drug(s) and dose you receive and varies from person to person. Some people experience partial hair thinning, and others may lose their hair completely. Hair does not usually fall out right away after starting chemotherapy. Hair typically starts to thin or fall out about two to three weeks after the first chemotherapy treatment and increases about a month or two after starting treatment. Some people describe that their \"hair hurts \" just prior to falling out, and this is completely normal. Others report scalp itching or discomfort after hair loss, but this is temporary. If hair loss does not happen to you it does not mean that the chemotherapy is not working. Hair may also begin to regrow during chemotherapy, and this does not mean that chemotherapy has stopped working against the cancer. Hair loss from chemotherapy is reversible. Your hair will begin to regrow within a couple of months after stopping treatment and should be fully back after six to twelve months. When hair grows back it may have a different color or texture than your usual hair. It will usually regain the characteristics of the hair you had before chemotherapy. If you know that hair loss will be likely from your treatment, you may find a few of the following tips helpful. If you plan to wear a wig, shop for wigs before your hair loss so you can better match your normal hair color and style. Hats, scarves, turbans and caps are helpful to protect your head from the sun and keep you warm when it is cold. You may wish to cut your hair short for convenience. Do not use a razor to shave your head . Helpful Tips for Hair and Scalp Care Use mild or gentle fragrance -free shampoo. Apply gentle moisturizing creams or lotions if your scalp itches or feels tender. Gently use a soft bristled brush or wide toothed comb on your hair. Use the lowest heat setting possible on your blow dryer. Do not dye your hair or get a permanent during treatment . April 18, 2019. 01 14 MOUTH SORES Many chemotherapy medications can cause the lining of the mouth (including the lips) and throat to become dry, irritated, swollen, tender, and/or form sores. This is called stomatitis or oral mucositis. These can be painful and limit the kinds of food you can eat. Mouth sores generally heal within 3 to 7 days. You can prevent mouth sores by performing good oral hygiene (e.g. brushing, flossing, mouth rinses). This will help clear food particles and improve circulation, which keeps the mouth clean. It is also recommended to brush your teeth with a soft bristle toothbrush after meals and at bedtime. Floss twice a day unless bleeding occurs. Using a mouth rinse can help improve your taste and decrease bacteria. Consider applying a water -based moisturizer to your lips. If you have mouth sores, burning sensation or notice more than normal bleeding during brushing or flossing, rinse your mouth 3 to 4 times each day. Soft \"toothettes \" (foam toothbrushes) may be helpful if it is too painful to brush. If you wear dentures, make sure they fit properly. Make sure you clean them twice a day with a denture cleaner and rinse well. If you develop mouth sores, you will want to leave your dentures out until the sores have healed. Ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacists about a prescription mouth rinse to coat and soothe your mouth. Enhance Healing Maintain good nutrition focusing on high protein and high calorie foods that are soft and easy to chew (e.g. scrambled eggs, puddings, blended or puree foods). Liquid supplements (e.g. Carnation Instant Breakfast\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae, Boost\u00ae) may be another source of nutrition and calories . Avoid Items That May Irritate Your Mouth Hot, spicy, acidic, coarse, rough textured (crunchy) foods. Very hot or cold beverages and foods. Citrus juices or foods containing citric acid (e.g. tomatoes, oranges, lemons, grapefruit). Alcoholic beverages, caffeine, and tobacco products. Mouthwashes that are alcohol based. Liquid medications containing alcohol (e.g. some cough medicines) if not essential. Caffeine. April 18, 2019. 01 15 Helpful Tips for Mouth Sores Rinse mouth with water frequently (every 2 hours while awake). May add salt or baking soda (1/4 teaspoon baking soda and/or 1/8 teaspoon salt in 8 ounces of warm water). Prescription mouthwash [which may include: and simethicone (Mylanta\u00ae)] may be useful for discomfort. Running your toothbrush under warm water before brushing will soften it even more Food and fluids that are lukewarm, cold, or have been pureed may be easier to eat. Mix foods with gravy or sauces to make them easier to swallow. Supplement meals with high calorie and high protein drinks. Apply lip moisturizer often (i.e. lanolin ointment). Suck on hard sugarless candies. Floss gently with waxed floss at least once a day unless painful, bleeding occurs, or you are advised not to floss . Symptoms You Should Tell Your Doctor or Nurse About Pain not relieved by medications Temperature higher than 100.4\u00baF Difficulty eating New white patches or ulcers in the mouth Uncontrolled bleeding New swelling in the mouth NAUSEA AND VOMITING Nausea is an unpleasant, wavelike sensation in the back of throat that may lead to vomiting and is a common side effect of cancer treatment. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or cancer itself can aggravate it. Whether or not you experience nausea and vomiting depends on the type of chemotherapy drug(s) you are receiving as well as other factors . Large amounts of food can make someone anxious and possibly nauseated. The idea of sitting at a table for a large meal three times a day can be overwhelming. You may find that you develop a dislike for certain foods or that strong aromas which can trigger nausea. Fortunately, nausea and vomiting can be managed through a combination of medications and behavioral changes. Medications will be ordered based on April 18, 2019. 01 16 your individual risk and treatment plan. Always follow the recommendations of your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when taking anti -nausea medications. Not doing so may cause other side effects. Contact your nurse or doctor if you experience nausea or vomiting despite taking the medications as ordered . What to do when you are feeling nauseated: Take deep breaths and relax. Chew ice chips until nausea has passed. Sip small amounts of water or clear, flat soda (e.g. ginger ale). As you begin to feel better, slowly add other foods back into your diet. To prevent nausea and vomiting, it is helpful to eat a small, light meal one to two hours before chemotherapy. Helpful Tips During and After Treatment Use shakes or liquid nutritional supplements to help maintain nutritional needs if you are unable to eat. Eat your largest meal when you are least nauseated. For many it is the morning time. Ask friends and family members to cook for you so you can avoid aromas in the kitchen. Avoid overfilling your stomach. Try 5 -6 small meals throughout the day, instead of 3 large meals. Eat and drink slowly, and chew thoroughly for easy digestion. Avoid sweet, spicy, fatty or fried foods. Eat dry and bland foods, such as crackers or toast. Avoid reclining after eating, as it may trigger vomiting. Keep your room or house free of offensive odors. Cooking odors or strong smells can trigger nausea. CONSTIPATION Most often, constipation refers to infrequent bowel movements (BM). You may experience cramping, hard stools, feel a need to strain, a sense of incomplete evacuation, and/or need enemas, suppositories, and/or laxatives to keep regular. Constipation is very common in people with cancer, especially during treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs, poor food/liquid intake, use of pain medications, or decreased exercise. During times when the white blood cell count or platelets are low enemas and suppositories should not be used. April 18, 2019. 01 17 It is helpful to try and include fiber -rich foods into your diet. Limit foods that can contribute to constipation, such as cheese, meats, and white rice. Drinking 6 to 8 glasses of liquid (such as water, soup, juices or popsicles) each day can help keep your stool soft. Drinking a warm beverage about 30 minutes before the time of your usual BM can also help. Examples of fiber -rich foods Whole grain breads Bran cereal Fruits Vegetables Barley Brown rice Prunes Exercise helps stimulate bowel activity. Simple walking can be a big help. Try to establish a pattern of when you have a bowel movement. This will help train your body again. Be sure to act on any urge to have a bowel movement. You might want to consider taking a stool softener or laxative as a preventative measure if your stool is too firm and uncomfortable to pass. Avoid bulk laxatives such as psyllium (Metamucil\u00ae) polycarbophil (Fibercon\u00ae), and methylcellulose (Citrucel\u00ae), as they can make the problem worse. Important to Remember Simple exercise daily, such as walking, can help prevent constipation. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of liquid each day. If you are on narcotic pain medication, stool softener and laxative is recommended as a preventive measure. Types of recommended laxative: senna, suppositories should not be used when blood counts are low (white blood cells and/or platelets). April 18, 2019. 01 18 DIARRHEA Diarrhea is an abnormal increase in the number, frequency, or liquid (watery) stool. It can occur after chemotherapy because of its temporary effect on the lining of the intestine . Chemotherapy can sometimes cause diarrhea as a side effect. This could be a sudden change of watery bowel movements or an increase in the number of loose stools you normally have. Diarrhea can cause loss of nutrients and fluids because the foods and liquids you eat can pass too quickly through the intestine. You can become weak, dizzy and lightheaded. Avoid medications such as laxatives and stool softeners. You may need to alter your diet to help resolve this problem. A clear liquid diet works best. This diet helps decrease the amount of work your intestine needs to do. It will also help replenish the nutrients and fluids you need. Drink 8 to 12 cups of clear liquids each day. These include water, clear broth, ginger ale, diluted juice, or sports drinks such as Gatorade\u00ae. Drink slowly, and choose drinks that are at room temperature. Let carbonated drinks lose their fizz before drinking them. Carbonation can make diarrhea worse. Add extra water if drinks make you thirsty or nauseous. Avoid milk and dairy products, caffeine, alcohol, dairy, fat, fiber, prune juice, and spicy foods. When you are ready to eat solid foods again, it is best to go slowly. It is recommended to start with the BRAT diet. Foods and liquids are best tolerated if they are not too hot or cold . Constipation Symptoms You Should Tell Your Doctor About Dry, hard stools No bowel movement in five days despite laxatives Stomach pain or cramping Vomiting Fever Seek Medical Help Immediately If You Experience Severe stomach pain or swelling Vomiting brown, yellow, or green bitter -tasting emesis Significant rectal bleeding IF you don 't have a history of hemorrhoids or bleeding with constipation Passing black -tarry stools April 18, 2019. 01 19 BRAT Diet B: Bananas (ripe) R: Rice (white or plain) A: Applesauce (without cinnamon or other flavors) T: Toast (dry, no butter or jam) If you tolerate this well, without an increase in diarrhea, try adding some pasta, boiled or baked chicken and cooked vegetables. Avoid dairy products because they can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist may recommend medications such as loperamide (Imodium\u00ae) or atropine/diphenoxylate (Lomotil\u00ae) to stop diarrhea. Problems With Diarrhea You Should Tell Your Doctor About If you are unable to keep fluids down for 24 hours Diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours Rectal bleeding Temperature greater than 100.4\u00baF Painful or swollen stomach Dizziness PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY Chemotherapy can cause damage to your peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are found throughout your body and are responsible for helping you feel things. Symptoms of nerve damage may include: Change in sensation such as numbness or tingling (i.e. feeling of pins and needles) in your hands or feet Difficulty using your fingers to button your clothes, pick up, or hold things Increased sensitivity to cold or heat Muscle weakness, which may lead to balance problems Constipation Pain usually described as pinching, stabbing, or burning (which may come and go, or be constant) April 18, 2019. 01 20 In most cases, symptoms will decrease or resolve over time after the completion of chemotherapy. However, in some cases they may not. Please speak to your doctor or nurse about any symptoms you may be experiencing, as early management can delay symptom progression. SKIN SENSITIVITY Certain chemotherapy medications may cause your skin to be more sensitive to the sun. Your skin may become more likely to burn outdoors or with the use of tanning beds. We recommend routine use of sunscreen (SPF 30 or more) as well as keeping your head covered with a hat, turban, or hairpiece while outdoors. If you have questions as to the best practice for you, please check with your oncology doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. FATIGUE Fatigue is a feeling of being tired physically, mentally, or emotionally. It means having less energy to do the things you normally want to do. Cancer -related fatigue is defined as an unusual and persistent sense of tiredness that can occur with cancer or cancer treatment. It may be chronic and interfere with usual activities. Cancer -related fatigue is more severe and more distressing than fatigue occasionally experienced by most of us under normal living circumstances. Rest may not relieve it. Cancer -related fatigue can make being with friends and family feel overwhelming, and make it difficult to continue normal activities (e.g. work, hobbies). You may use more effort and energy to do your usual activities. Do not get frustrated with yourself for not being able to do your normal tasks. Education and counseling are part of treating fatigue, and can help you learn how to conserve energy, reduce stress, and use distraction to think about things other than fatigue and what is causing it. If the cause of fatigue is known, treatment will be directed to it (e.g. anemia, insomnia, nutritional problems). Helpful Tips for Dealing with Fatigue: Stay active with light exercise. This can help ease fatigue and help you sleep better at night. Talk to your doctor or nurse about ways you can be active during chemotherapy. Try relaxation techniques such as mediation, prayer, yoga or visualization. Eat well with 5 to 6 small meals each day and stay hydrated. Plan frequent rest breaks or naps during the day . April 18, 2019. 01 21 INSOMNIA Insomnia refers to difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. This can lead to fatigue, memory and concentration problems, as well as mood disturbances (e.g. depression). Certain cancer treatments and medications can contribute to insomnia. Treatment may include medications, exercise, and/or stress reduction. DEPRESSION Having a diagnosis of cancer and dealing with the effects of chemotherapy may make it seem like your life is out of control. It is very common to feel angry or depressed. Talking about your feelings can help. Sometimes, those close to you may also benefit from counseling. Please see the section on support groups and resources for more information (page 30 -31) or call the Psychology Department at 415-833-2292 . SEXUAL CHANGES Whether or not you have sexual changes during chemotherapy depends on if you have had these problems before, the type of chemotherapy you are getting, your age, and whether you have any other illnesses. Some problems, such as loss of interest in sex, are likely to improve once chemotherapy is over. In men, chemotherapy can cause changes in hormone levels, decreased blood supply to the penis, and/or damage to the nerves that control the penis, all of which can lead to impotence . They may experience : Not being able to reach climax Impotence (not being able to get or keep an erection) Being too tired to have sex or uninterested in having sex In women , chemotherapy may damage the ovaries, which can cause changes in hormone levels. Hormone changes can lead to problems like vaginal dryness and early menopause. They may experience: Symptoms of menopause (for women not yet in menopause) may include: Hot flashes Vaginal dryness Feeling irritable Irregular, or no, menstrual periods Feeling too worried, stressed, or depressed to have sex Bladder or vaginal infections April 18, 2019. 01 22 Vaginal discharge or itching Being too tired to have sex, or uninterested in having sex Tips for men and women: Sex. Ask your doctor or nurse if it is okay for you to have sex during chemotherapy. Most people can have sex, but it is a good idea to ask. Medications. Talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about medications that help with sexual problems. Be open and honest with your spouse or partner. Talk about your feelings and concerns. Explore new ways to show love. You and your spouse or partner may want to show your love for each other in new ways while you go through chemotherapy. For instance, if you are having sex less often, you may want to hug or cuddle more, bathe together, give each other massages, or try other activities that make you feel close to each other. Talk with your doctor, nurse, social worker, or counselor. If you and your spouse or partner are concerned about sexual problems, you may want to talk with someone who can help. This can be a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, marriage counselor, sex therapist, or clergy member. Talk with your doctor, nurse, social worker, or counselor. If you and your spouse or partner are concerned about sexual problems, you may want to talk with someone who can help. This can be a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, marriage counselor, sex therapist, or clergy member. Chemotherapy medications can also be excreted in body fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluid. To prevent exposure of these fluids for you and your partner, please follow the guidelines below. Use condoms during oral sex and intercourse for 72 hours after treatment. Effective birth control should be used throughout treatment to prevent pregnancy while on these medications and for several months or years after therapy. Chemotherapy can have harmful side effects to the fetus, especially in the first trimester. In addition, menstrual cycles can become irregular during and after treatment, so you may not know what part of your cycle you are in or if you are actually pregnant.

Eating a healthy, balanced diet is best. Often times, the side effects of cancer treatment can make good nutrition challenging. Here are some tips for handling these possible side effects. BASIC PRINCIPLES Eat small, frequent meals (4 to 6 times per day). Try to eat within an hour of waking up. If you wait longer than that, you may lose your appetite. Eat a variety of foods \u2014include various colors, textures and flavors. WEIGHT LOSS It is not a good time to try and lose weight during your cancer treatment. If weight loss occurs, try the following tips: Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day (5 to 6 times or every 3 to 4 hours). Make the most of the times of the day when you feel you best. Try eating foods high in calories such as natural peanut butter, eggs, yogurt, nuts, avocado and/or soups to boost your intake. This is a time when the fat content of food should not be of concern. Use sauces, dips, cheeses and whole fat dairy products (unless you are lactose intolerant) to help boost calories. Sometimes nutritional drinks or other shakes can help when you are not able to eat very much. DOES SUGAR CAUSE CANCER? Sugar is a form of energy for our body. Our body needs glucose (a type of sugar) to provide energy for all of our cells. It does not cause cancer or make cancer cells grow faster. However eating a lot of sugar including refined carbohydrates and sugar -sweetened beverages can cause weight gain and increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers. It is unclear how much simple sugar can be unhealthful. The most important thing to focus on is eating a healthy, balanced diet when you are feeling well. If you appetite is poor, eat what appeals to you . The goal is to maintain your weight during your treatment. SUPPLEMENTS You may be tempted to start taking supplements such as vitamins, herbs, or alternative medicines. Unfortunately, the Food and Drug Administration do not regulate most of these . supplements. Also, many herbs and supplements interact with some medications and may actually be harmful. It is best to avoid taking supplements while undergoing cancer treatment . April 18, 2019. 01 26 NAUSEA/VOMITING, POOR APPETITE Eat foods that sound good to you. Eat small meals often and drink fluids between meals to avoid the \"full\" feeling. Keep soda, sparkling water and crackers handy for times when you feel especially nauseated. Snack throughout the day so you always have a little food in your stomach. Often times, warm foods such as tea, warm milk, or soup can help. Even very cold foods such as frozen yogurt, sorbet or a milk shake can be appealing. (Note: if you are receiving oxaliplatin chemotherapy, avoid cold foods). Some people find that ginger helps to settle their stomach. Try ginger ale, ginger tea or ginger candies. DIARRHEA Make sure you drink plenty of liquid to help prevent dehydration. Good choices are water, weak tea, decaf coffee, diluted juices, and broth. Try low fiber foods such as white rice, noodles, white bread, potatoes without the skin, well-cooked vegetables, canned fruit packed in water or juice, bananas or applesauce. Lean chicken, turkey, ground beef, cooked fish, and eggs are good protein sources that may be better tolerated. FOOD SAFETY Your immune system may not be as strong when you are going through cancer treatment. Help reduce the risk of illness by following safe food -handling practices, such as: Avoid unpasteurized cheeses, honey, fresh -squeezed juices, or ciders Avoid the following foods when raw or uncooked: seafood, meat, eggs, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts, or cookie dough Choose fruits and vegetables that do not have bruises, spots, dents or mold. Do not keep leftovers in the fridge for more than 2 days. Reheat until steaming or freeze right away. When in doubt, THROW IT OUT !

SAFETY FOR MY FAMILY Continue to: Hug and kiss your partner, family members, and children .

If body fluids splash on the toilet, wear gloves and clean the area with soap and water before others use the toilet . April 18, 2019. 01 30 SUPPORT RESOURCES While your focus will be on your physical health and all your test and treatments, it is important not to forget about your emotional, psychological and spiritual health. They can affect your physical health and play an important part in your recovery. KAISER PERMANENTE 'S COMPLETE CARE SERVICES Along with medical treatment, there are other ways in which Kaiser Permanente and the community can lend assistance. Social Work: A medical social worker is available to assist you when you or a loved one is faced with a serious illness. Social workers offer education, information services, support and strategies for coping. Often times, a diagnosis of cancer can create other needs such as financial, transportation, advance directives and end of life planning. Social workers can assist or direct you to other appropriate resources within Kaiser Permanente or the community. If you would like to speak with a social worker, please feel free to contact the Oncology Social Worker with any questions or concerns. Counseling: Cancer can be a stressful time for patients and loved ones. Short -term counseling is available to help patients cope with a new diagnosis. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT Try to find someone you can reach out and open up to. It should be someone with whom you feel safe sharing your thoughts, fears, anger, and hopes. Support groups also offer a safe place to share your thoughts and emotions. Be sure to consult with your care team for recommendation. Find inspiration and hope in the things that bring you joy (i.e. reading, music, family, pets, etc.). Patients and caregivers both need to practice self -care during this time. What are the things you normally do during a stressful time to take care of yourself? FAMILY SUPPORT Family and Partner/spouse Issues: Every person has a different way of handling news that a loved one has cancer. Many people react with shock, disbelief, and even anger when they first receive the news. Keep in mind that there is no \"right way \" for you or your family to feel about your diagnosis. Sharing and being open with one another is one of the best ways for families to deal with their feelings. Telling your children: Many parents have questions and concerns (i.e. telling their children about their cancer diagnosis, treatment, concerns and how this will impact their children). Feel free to discuss concerns about talking to your children with your medical team and social worker. April 18, 2019. 01 31 Help from Family Members: Asking your family members for help during this time benefits you and them. Assign specific tasks to each family member. Do not hesitate to ask for help with everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, yard work, and driving children to school and activities. You might ask several people to provide different kinds of emotional support so that you always have someone to call on. KAISER PERMANENTE CANCER SUPPORT GROUP AND LECTURE SERIES Our bi -weekly support group provides a place to come together and find strength and hope in a community of people going through something similar.

April 18, 2019. 01 36 TAKING TIME OFF WORK Three government Disability Insurance programs have very similar names: SDI, SSDI, and SSI. State Disability Insurance (SDI) is a state program administered through the EDD that gives a cash benefit for up to one year to Californians who are disabled due to significant illness. You must have paid into the EDD during the base period (18 months) preceding your disability. Government employees do not typically pay into the EDD fund. Self - employed individuals would have had to proactively pay into the system quarterly prior to becoming disabled. SDI generally pays 60 -70% of your pre -tax wages. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a federal program that pays monthly cash benefits to people with long -term disabilities (over 12 months) who qualify because they used to work or have qualifying family members who worked and paid Social Security taxes for a long enough time. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal program that gives a monthly cash payment to people older than 18 but younger than 65, who are disabled and are not able to work. If you cannot work due to a significant illness, have no other sources of income, and have limited resources, you may be eligible for SSI. You do not need to have worked in the past to get SSI. You may be able to qualify for more than one of these programs at the same time. For example, you might get SDI at first and later start getting SSDI. Private Disability Insurance. Short -Term Disability (STD) is private insurance that replaces some of your income in an illness that prevents you from working. While you are away from work it pays you a certain percentage of your income for a certain period of time. Some employers provide group STD policies as part of their benefits packages. A STD policy can be purchased individually. Longer -Term Disability (LTD) is private insurance that helps people who cannot work because of a disability. If you have LTD insurance, it will replace some of the income you lose when you cannot work because of a disability or severe illness. Some people have LTD insurance from their employers. Others purchase it individually. Caregivers may be eligible for Paid Family Leave through the EDD and FMLA for job protection while taking time off to care for a family member. April 18, 2019. 01 37 HOW TO FILE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE (SDI) All applications (paper and electronic) require physician certification \u2014a Work Status Report with start and end dates of your disability.

April 18, 2019. 01 43 CHEMOTHERAPY CLINICAL TRIALS New cancer treatment, including new forms of chemotherapy and medicines used to treat adverse effects of chemotherapy, undergo clinical trials to see if they are safe and effective. Approval of a drug by the Food and Drug Administration depends on the results of these clinical trials. Your oncology team will discuss available research opportunities with you. When studying experimental treatments, researchers want to know: Does the specific treatment work better than other treatments already available? What side effects does the treatment cause? Do the benefits outweigh the risks, including side effects? Which patients will the treatment most likely help? During your treatment for cancer, your doctor may suggest that you take part in a clinical trial of a new treatment. Clinical trials are only conducted when researchers have reason to believe that the treatment under study may indeed be better than other treatments. You will not receive a placebo (sugar pill) if a standard treatment is already available. Ask your doctor or the Oncology staff if you have questions about a clinical trial.
