This document is published annually under the authority of the RMIT University Council. All fees in this schedule and appendices are subject to alteration by Council without prior notice. All approved changes will be recorded in the addendum of this document and posted on www.rmit.edu.au/fs/fees/schedules . Only fees that have been approved by the Vice-Chancellor (or delegate) can be charged to students or persons; fees not approved should not be either charged or collected . Only approved fees listed in this document (or its subsequent revisions) and appendices are configured in the University's student administration database. All student fees mu st be charged through the University's student administration database unless otherwise approved by Financial Services. All fees and charges listed in this docum ent and its appendices have been approved by the Vice- Chancellor, and endorsed by Financial Services. Any questions about this document should be referred to the Deputy Director, Business Advisory or Manager, Student Financials in Financial Services. In broad terms, there are four categories of fees charged by RMIT: 1. Tuition fees for Higher Education, TAFE and preparatory students, studying in a Commonwealth or State Government supported place, or as a full fee-paying domestic or international student. This includes student contributions or tuition contributions. 2. Student services and amenities fees for services and amenities of a non-academic nature, such as sporting and recreational activities, employment and career advice, childcare, financial advice and food services. 3. Material fees and charges associated with courses and subjects offered by the University. These include fees or charges associated with fiel d trips, goods or services which are used to produce items that become the physical property of students, lecture notes and reading material. In most instances, these charges are not compulsory and are optional at the student's discretion. 4. Administrative fees and charges include service fees for parki ng, library fines, penalties for late payment or late enrolment, graduation ceremonies, etc. The following sections provide a list of the fees and conditions that may apply to fees charged to students or persons for enrolment or other engagement with RMIT during 2013. Fee information is also provided on the RMIT website www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 5 of 49 2 Application of 2013 Approved Schedule of Fees and Charges All students or persons who enrol at RMIT for studies in the 2013 calendar year, or who otherwise engage with RMIT in 2013 (e.g. graduation, car parking, apply for admission, etc) are subject to the fees and charges detailed in this document. All students who undertake their studies at RMIT in the 2013 calendar year are required to enrol.. Completion of an enrolment form or online enrolment is a declaration that binds a student to the rules and obligations of this approved schedule of fees and charges (inclusive of amendments subsequently approved by Council). A student or person is liable for the resulting financia l obligation from the application of their enrolment or other action pursuant to this approved schedule of fees and charges. The financial obligation to pay tuition fees will remain unless withdrawal of enrolment is made via the approved process prior to the semester financial deadlines advised. 2.1 Creation of financial liability Financial liability for all Tuition and Administrative fees and charges are created at the point of enrolment. Students become liable for Material fees upon signed agreement and/or upon receipt of the corresponding goods or service. 2.2 Cessation of financial liability Financial liability only ceases upon payment or wit hdrawal from a course or program by the appropriate date. The only mechanisms to withdraw from a course are via Enrolment Online, an approved Enrolment Variation or Leave of Absence form. The only mechanism to withdraw from a program is lodgement of a Cancellation of Enrolment form with RMIT University or RMIT Training. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 6 of 49 3 Tuition fees 3.1 Annual fees Program and course tuition fees students who commence their program in 2013 are held constant only for the 2013 year. RMIT University reserves the right to annually adjust program tuition fees. Changes to program tuition fees will be applied at the beginning of each calendar year. In 2013, the annual tuition price increase is capped at 7.5%. This cap applies to local and international full-fee paying Higher Education students, and to international full-fee paying TAFE students. For Higher Education fees, tuition fees are rounded up to the nearest $10.00 per credit point increment, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%. Similarly, for VET/TAFE students the program annual fees are rounded to the nearest $250, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%. Students who commenced their program in semester 2, 2003 or earlier (term 0350 or prior) will continue to be charged according to the terms and conditions existing at the time of their initial enrolment in that program. In other words, these student fees will continue to be \"pipelined\" for the duration of their continuous enrolment in the program they commenced in semester 2, 2003 or earlier. 3.1.1 Cohort pricing Where the tuition fee for a given program exceeds the cap on annual tuition price increases, students who are currently enrolled will be entitled to complete their tuition at their current fee rate (subject to annual indexing), whilst newly enrolling students will be charged at the new fee rate. Any change of program is treated as a new enrolment. The list of the average annual 2013 tuition fees for all local and international undergraduate and postgraduate full-fee paying programs, and for all TAFE programs in appendices 1, 2 and 3 may therefore include two or more price streams for a single program. Where this occurs the \"program descripti on\" field will indicate the cohort by calendar year that corresponds to the annual fee price listed. Students are allocated to a cohort based upon their program admit date. 3.2 Standard or average load Annual tuition fees are based upon standard or average load (total program load program duration) and normal progression, with pro-rata fees applying to non-standard loads. The standard measure of a full-time student load in Higher Education is 48 credit points per semester. TAFE programs do not conform to a standard load per semester; the annual fees for TAFE programs are therefore based on a calculation of total program fees (at current year prices) divided by program duration. TAFE tuition fees are configured at the level of nominal hours and students are therefore invoiced according to their enrolled load at the program price set for the corresponding calendar year. To illustrate, a program requiring 1,500 nominal hours over two (2) years may require students to undertake 700 nominal hours in the first year and the balance of 800 nominal hours in the second year. Assuming full time enrolment, the student will therefore be invoiced for 700 nominal hours in the first year at the fee set for that calendar year and 800 nominal hours for the second year at the new calendar year rate. The fee invoiced for each semester may also vary between semesters as the enrolment requirements in TAFE Programs varies between semesters. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 7 of 49 Over the full duration of the program, the total program tuition fee will be the fee quoted (subject to annual adjustments). TAFE fees may be in excess of the total program tuition fees (including annual adjustments) if the student chooses non-standard electives or if a student enrols in subjects in addition to the normal program load. Due to their variable program structure, some TAFE programs may have a different fee depending on the student's chosen stream. 3.3 Higher Education - Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) A Commonwealth supported place (CSP) is a Higher Education place for which the Commonwealth Government makes a partial financial contribution. In addition to this Government contribution CSP students are required to pay a student contribution according to the units of study (courses) undertaken. Some CSP students may be eligible for HECS-HELP assistance to help them pay their student contribution amounts (see 3.4). A student is a CSP student only if they have receiv ed confirmation from RMIT that they have been offered a Commonwealth supported place, and the student accepts that place. Only students who meet citizenship requirements may be eligible for a CSP. That is, they are an Australian citizen who will undertake, in Australia, at least one course (subject) of study contributing to their course of study; a New Zealand citizen who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study; the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study; or the holder of a permanent residency visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study. The amount of student contribution a student is liable fo r per course (subject) is based on the load of study and the discipline of each course (subject). Each discipline falls within one of three student contribution bands (detailed below). Student contribution amounts are charged on a semesterly basis. After each published semester census date all CSP students are issued a Commonwealth Assistance Notice (CAN) after the published semester census date that details the student contribution amounts and any payments made upfront for each enrolled course. CSP students, if eligible for HELP (Higher Education Loan Programme), have the following payment options: Make a full up-front payment of 90% of the student contribution amount before the semester census date for all of their units or courses and receive a 10% discount; Pay part of their student contribution amounts up-front before the semester census date, receive a 10% HECS-HELP discount for any payments totalling $500 or more, and obtain a loan for the remainder; or Obtain a loan for the full amount of their student contribution amount. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - date: 21/12/2012 Page 8 of 49 3.3.1 Calculating the student contribution CSP students are required to pay a student contribution amount that, depending upon eligibility, may be paid upfront or deferred through the HECS-HELP scheme . The student contribution amount for a course is based on the student contribution band that the course falls within (see Table 1 below) and the (Equivalent Full-Time Student Load) EFTSL weight of the course as a proportion of a full-time study load (i.e. student contribution band x EFTSL course weight). The weight of courses is measured as a proportion of a full-time student load (1 EFTSL) and can also be measured in credit points. A full time load for Higher Education students at RMIT is equivalent to 96 credit points. Some programs, such as double degrees, may require the student to enrol in more than 96 credit points in some or all years of the program. It is important to note that the student contribution bands are determined by the individual unit of study (which RMIT defines as a course), not the program or degree. That is, if a student enrols in a nursing course and an accounting course as part of a Bachelor of Nursing program, the nursing course will be charged in Band 1 and the accounting course will be charged in Band 3. More detailed information regarding calculation of student contribution amounts is provided on the RMIT website www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees . Table 1: Maximum student contribution amount by student contribution band - 2013 Student Contribution Band Maximum student contribution amount for a place in 2013 (1 EFTSL or 96 credit points) Band 1: humanities, behavioural science, social studies, education (see Notes), clinical psychology, foreign languages, visual and performing arts, nursing (see Notes) $5,868 Band 2: mathematics, statistics, computing, built environment, health, other health, allied health, science, engineering, surveying, agriculture $8,363 Band 3: accounting, administration, economics, commerce, law, dentistry, medicine, veterinary sciences $9,792 Notes on Table 1: From 1 January 2013, all students enrolle d in accounting, administration, econom ic and commerce units can be charged the Band 3 rate and all students enrolled in mathematics, statistics and science units of study can be charged the Band 2 rate. For pre-2010 students, the maximum annual student contribution amount that may be charged for education and nursing units is $4,696. From 1 January 2010, the maximum an nual student contribution amount for commencing Commonwealth supported students undertaking education and nursing units of study has been increased from the 'n ational priority' rate to the Band 1 rate. The increased maximum annual student contribution amounts a ffect only students who commence t heir course of study at a higher education provider on or after 1 January 2010. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - Page 9 of 49 3.3.2 Pre-2010 students Effective 1 January 2010 the maximum annual student contribution amount for education and nursing units of study increased from the National Priority Band rate to the Band 1 rate. This applies to students who commenced their program of study from 1 January 2010. Continuing students will continue to be subject to the National Priority Band rate that applied in 2009, indexed for subsequent years ($4,696 in 2013). A person is a pre-2010 student for a unit of study if: the person commenced a course of study with a provider before 1 January 2010 and was a Commonwealth supported student in relation to a unit of study in that course; and the person did not complete the course by 31 December 2009, or if they completed the course, it was: - an enabling course undertaken in 2009; or - a related course for an honours course of study and they are undertaking the honours course of study; and the unit of study would have been included in Education in the funding cluster Mathematics, Statistics, Behavioural Science, Education, Computing, Built Environment, Other Health or the funding cluster Nursing repealed by of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Act 2009 . To be a pre-2010 student there is no requirement that the course a student was undertaking as a Commonwealth supported student prior to 2010 was a course in education or nursing or related disciplines or that the student has undertaken units of study in education and nursing or related disciplines prior to 2010. The pre-2010 arrangements apply to students who transfer from one course of study to another (including where one course of study is postgraduate and the other undergraduate), or who transfer between providers, as long as t hey meet the above requirements. Where a student commenced a course of study as a Commonwealth supported student before 2010, has not completed the course of study by the end of 2009, and takes a break from their studies by deferring, they are a pre-2010 student on their return to that course of study. There is no sunset clause for the grandfathering arrangements for pre-2010 students. Pre-2010 students enrolled in double or combined degrees A student who is enrolled in a double or combined degree program is a pre-2010 student if they completed the requirements of only one of the awards on or before 31 December 2009. A pre-2010 student enrolled in a single degree program and who transfers subsequently to a combined or double degree program remains a pre-2010 student even if they complete the requirements of one of the awards. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - Page 10 of 49 3.3.3 Pre-2009 students On 20 August 2012, the Australian Parliament passed the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As a result of this, from 1 January 2013 the Government will establish a single annual student course contribution rate for higher education students who study mathematics, statistics and science units, regardless of when they commenced their course of study. This means that from 1 January 2013, continuing students who commenced their program prior to 1 January 2009 will be subject to the same maximum student contribution amount (Band 2) for these units as students who commenced in other years. Previously, pre-2009 students were charged at the Band 2 rate, while other students were charged at a reduced National Priority Band rate. When is a person a pre-2009 student A person is a pre-2009 student if: they enrol on or after 1 January 2009 in a mathematics, statistics or science unit that forms part of a course of study that the student: - commenced prior to 1 January 2009; or - transfers into on or after 1 January 2009 from a course that they commenced prior to 1 January 2009, and the exception for non-NPS to NPS transferring students does not apply. HESA defines a combined or double degree program as a single course of study. A student is a continuing student until they complete the entire course of study. 3.3.4 End of Pre-2008 HECS arrangements As outlined in section 5.2 of the Administrative Information for Higher Education Providers (effective from 1 January 2012) , for students who commenced from 1 January 2008 the contribution amounts for units of study in accounting, administration, economics and commerce were changed to the same maximum as applies under HESA for law, medicine, dentistry and veterinary science (or Band 3). Students who commenced prior to 2008 continued to pay the previous maximum student contribution amount ($8,050 in 2012,) until the end of 2012. All students in these disciplines will be covered by the same maximum student contribution amounts in HESA from 1 January 2013. A person is a pre-2008 student for a unit of study if: the person commenced a course of study with a provider before 1 January 2008 and was a Commonwealth supported student in relation to a unit of study in that course; and the person did not complete the course by 31 December 2007, or if they completed the course, it was: - an enabling course undertaken in 2007; or 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 11 of 49 - the related course for an honours course of study and they are undertaking the honours course of study; and the period over which the person is undertaking the unit of study ends on or before 31 December 2012; and the person is not a pre-2005 HECS student in 2008; and the unit of study would have been in the account ing, administration, economics or commerce funding cluster repealed by Schedule 2 of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Act 2007. To be a pre-2008 student there is no requirement that the course a student was undertaking as a Commonwealth supported student prior to 2008 was a course in accounting or related disciplines or that the student has undertaken units of study in accounting or related disciplines prior to 2008. If a person meets the pre-2008 requirements for study undertaken after 1 January 2008 and then completes their course before the end of 2012, the pre-2008 arrangements still apply to that person for subsequent courses of study if they continue to meet the other pre-2008 requirements. 3.3.4.1 Pre-2008 students enrolled in double or combined degrees A student who is enrolled in a double or combined degree program is a pre-2008 student if they completed the requirements of only one of the awards on or before 31 December 2007. A pre-2008 student enrolled in a single degree programme and who transfers subsequently to a combined or double degree programme remains a pre-2008 student even if they complete the requirements of one of the awards. 3.4 Higher Education Loa n Programme (HELP) Through the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP), the Commonwealth government lends eligible students money to pay for their Higher Education fees. HELP is administered under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA). While some information about HELP is provided in this document to assist students, a student's official reference for HELP is the Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE) Study Assist website at: www.studyassist.gov.au and publications such as the FEE-HELP information 2013 booklet and the Information for Commonwealth supported students 2013 booklet. Changes may be made by the Government to the legislation for HELP at any time. The Australian Government's Study Assist website www.goingtouni.gov.au contains links to the Australian Government's myUniAssist database, which is designed to help students keep track of how much Commonwealth assistance they have used. Should any inconsistencies between this document and the official Australian Government website arise, then the information contained on the Australian Government website prevails. HELP loans provide eligible students with assistance to pay all or part of their tuition and amenities fees. The HELP loans available are as follows: 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - date: 21/12/2012 Page 12 of 49 HECS-HELP \u2014 for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places (CSP). HECS- HELP loans cover all or part of your student contribution only. The student services and amenities fee can NOT be deferred by HECS-HELP. FEE-HELP \u2014 for eligible full-fee paying students. FEE-HELP is a loan that covers up to the full amount of your tuition fees only. It is available to full-fee paying undergraduate and postgraduate coursework and research students. Undergraduate students (including Associate Degree students) are charged a 25% loan fee. The student services and amenities fee can NOT be deferred by FEE-HELP. OS-HELP \u2014 for eligible Commonwealth supported students who wish to study overseas. This loan is to assist with expenses such as accommodation and travel. SA-HELP - for eligible Higher Education students. SA-HELP loans are provided to cover all or part of your student services and amenities fee. Students must apply for this loan in addition to FEE-HELP or HECS-HELP in order to defer the student services and amenities fee. VET FEE-HELP \u2014for eligible TAFE students. VET FEE-HELP loans are provided to meet all, or some, of the costs of tuition incurred by: 1. Eligible full-fee paying TAFE students, who enr oll in a diploma, advanced diploma, vocational graduate certificate or vocational graduate diploma program; and 2. Eligible TAFE students subsidised by the Victorian State Government, who enroll in a diploma or advanced diploma program. A loan fee of 20 per cent applies to TAFE full fee paying places. TAFE students in Government subsidised places are not charged a loan fee. 3.4.1 Lifetime limits to HELP loans Over a student's lifetime a FEE-HELP limit applies for access to a FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP loan. The FEE-HELP limit is indexed annually. In 2013 the FEE-HELP limit is $116,507 for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science students and $93,204 for all other students. The FEE-HELP limit applies even if a person has partially or fully repaid their FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP debt. HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, OS-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and SA-HELP debts are treated as a single debt, which is known as the accumulated HELP debt. The options available for paying tuition fees or student contributions depend on the student's eligibility for a HELP loan. If the student has an approved loan you have the option to: pay the full tuition fee or student contribution up-front (Eligible Commonwealth supported students who make full up-front payments of 90% of the student contribution amount for all of their courses will receive a 10% discount. ) pay some of the tuition fee or student contribution up-front and request a loan for the remainder of their tuition fees (Eligible Commonwealth supported students who pay part of their student 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc date: 21/12/2012 Page 13 of 49 contribution amounts up-front will receive a 10% discount for any payments totalling $500 or more, and obtain a loan for the remainder.) request a HELP loan for the full tuition fee or student contribution amount. 3.4.2 HELP loan repayments: HELP debts are indexed on 1 June each year and repayments occur on one of two ways: Compulsory payments through the Australian taxation system: Students start repaying their HELP debt to the Federal Government through the Australian Taxation system once they reach the minimum income threshold level for repayment. The repayment thresholds are adjusted each year to reflect any changes in average weekly earnings. Voluntary repayments to the Australian Taxation Office: Students can make voluntary repayments to the Australian Taxation Office at any time and for any amount. Those who make a voluntary payment of $500 or more receive a bonus of 5% and their account is credited with an additional 5% of the payment. The bonus is 5% of the payment made, not 5% of the outstanding debt. It is important to be aware that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will no longer be sending out a yearly ATO statement to students. All students are responsible for keeping track of their debt at the ATO. For mor information please visit www.ato.gov.au 3.4.3 Provision of a Tax File Number If a student is applying for any kind of HELP loan for study at RMIT, they will need to supply a valid Tax File Number. If a Tax File Number is not su pplied on or before the census date, the student will need to pay the student contribution or tuition fee in full on or before the census date. If a CSP student does not pay the entire student contribution amount up-front and has not provided a valid Tax File Number on or before the census date, RMIT is required by federal government legislation to cancel the student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. If a CSP student who is not eligible for HECS-HELP assistance fails to pay their Student Contribution amount in full by the census date, RMIT is requir ed by federal government legislation to cancel the student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. 3.4.4 Eligibility for HELP programs To be eligible for HELP a student must be one of the following: an Australian citizen who will undertake, in Australia, at least one course (subject) of study contributing to their course of study; a holder of a permanent humanitarian visa who will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit; 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 14 of 49 a holder of a permanent residency visa who is undertaking bridging study for overseas-trained professionals and will be resident in Australia for the duration of the unit. 3.4.5 Ineligibility fo r HELP programs Other domestic students, such as New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents (other than holders of a permanent humanitarian visa), are not eligible for HELP. These students must pay their Student Contribution or Tuition Fee in full by the census date and are not eligible for a discount. If a CSP student who is not eligible for HECS-HELP assistance fails to pay their Student Contribution amount in full by the census date, RMIT is requir ed by federal government legislation to cancel the student's enrolment as a CSP student. RMIT does not have any discretion with this matter and cannot accept an up-front payment after the census date. 3.5 Higher Education - domestic and international full fee paying 3.5.1 Program fees and charges RMIT offers a number of undergraduate, research and postgraduate places to students that are not supported by the Commonwealth Government. The tuition fees for these programs are set on an annual basis and may be subject to change each calendar year. Under HESA, the tuition fees for all Higher Education full-fee paying programs must be greater than or equal to the current year's maximum 'Student Contribution Amount' for the program; the fees for all of RMIT's domestic fee-paying programs have been set above the respective maximum student contribution amount. Appendix 1 provides a list of the average annual 2013 tuition fees for all local undergraduate and postgraduate full-fee paying programs. 3.5.2 Capping of research tuition fees All students undertaking research programs at RMIT are levied tuition fees based on the nature of their program. Tuition fees for research programs use research EFTSL calculation, with tuition fees capped at 48 credit points per semester for full-time students and 24 credit points per semester for part-time students, regardless of enrolled credit point load. This applies to domestic, international onshore and international offshore non-partner enrolments. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - date: 21/12/2012 Page 15 of 49 3.5.3 Degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication Fees have been set and configured within RMIT's student administration system for domestic full fee paying candidates enrolled in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication as outlined in Appendix 1 of this Schedule. In accordance with RMIT Council Regulation 5.1.9 sections 5 and 6, candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Publication will normally be enrolled part-time for a duration of one year. As with section 3.5.2 above, the standard part time load for a research program is 24 credit points. 3.5.4 Changes to fee-paying do mestic undergraduate places From 1 January 2009, fee paying domestic undergraduate places are being phased out of public universities. Please note: Postgraduate programs are unaffected by this announcement and will continue to be offered to domestic students on a fee-paying basis. New domestic students With the exception of the Associate Degree in Aviation, there will be no full-fee places offered to new domestic students in undergraduate programs through VTAC (Victorian Tertiary Admission Centre). Current fee-paying Australian students Students who are currently enrolled in full-fee Australian undergraduate places can continue to complete their degree as a full-fee student. RMIT Univ ersity's scheme of allowing high achieving, full- fee paying, undergraduate students to transfer to CSP places is still in existence for any student who enrolled in 2008 or earlier (see 3.5.5). Exemptions There are some exemptions to the Government's prohibition on new full-fee undergraduate places which will affect a very small number of applicants and students. These include applicants who: are enrolling in a full-fee Spring or Summer School course are enrolling in a bridging course for overseas trained professionals are enrolling in a unit that forms part of a course of study that is subject to determination by the Minister specifying that a student cannot be enrolled as a Commonwealth supported student have commenced their course of study as an overseas student and become a domestic student part way through their course do not fall into the above categories but who wish to apply for a full-fee place Such applicants are required to apply directly to RMIT's admissions for a full-fee place. 3.5.5 Transfer of domestic fee-payi ng students to Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) Students may be eligible to transfer from a domestic fee paying undergraduate place to CSP funded place in the same program if they meet the criteria for a Guaranteed Transfer or a Discretionary Transfer. The procedure for Academic merit-based transfer of domestic undergraduate fee-paying students to commonwealth supported places can be located from the RMIT Policies and Procedures website www.rmit.edu.au/policies . 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - date: 21/12/2012 Page 16 of 49 3.5.6 International onshore students The Commonwealth does not contribute to educational costs for international students unless the students are in receipt of an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship. Furthermore, Commonwealth grant amounts provided to universities for the education of domestic students are not provided for the purpose of subsidising places or services for international students. The fees charged to international onshore students must be greater than or equal to a minimum indicative fee specified by DIISRTE. A ll RMIT fees have been set above these minimum requirements. Appendix 2 of this document lists the 2013 fees for international onshore students. 3.5.7 International off-shore students RMIT University does not set fees for international off-shore students. All tuition fees and charges for international off-shore students are established by the relevant off-shore partner. 3.5.8 RMIT International University Vietnam Australian and New Zealand citizens studying at RM IT International University Vietnam (RMIT Vietnam) are subject to the fees and charges detailed in the RMIT Vietnam schedule of fees and charges (www.rmit.edu.vn), and may be eligible for FEE-HELP. 3.5.9 Change in citizenship or immigration status International students who change residency during the course of their study, and become an Australian citizen or permanent resident, may be entitled to pay fees at the same rate as local fee-paying students (if they are not eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place or Victorian government subsidised place in respect of TAFE st udents), provided they can show evidence that the change in citizenship or immigration status was granted by the applicable census date and the student submits a Change of Citizenship/Immigration Status form to RMIT by the same applicable census date. Please note, depending on the established fees for individual programs, changing citizenship or immigration status may not necessarily result in a reduction in fees. Students may also incur a $500 administrative fee. 3.6 TAFE - State Government Supported Places 3.6.1 Refocusing vocationa l training in Victoria In 2009, the Victorian government announced major changes to TAFE education under the Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria reforms which took effect from 1 July 2009. Under this model TAFE tuition fees were dependant on the program level or qualification level, which were categorised as follows: Foundation Skills, Skills Creation, Apprenticeships, Traineeships, Skills Building and Skills Deepening. In May 2012, changes to the Victorian vocational education and training (VET) system were announced under the Refocusing Vocational Training in Victoria reforms. From July 2012, a new fees structure was introduced for students commencing a new program. Concurrent with the reduction of government funding for government-susbsidised TAFE places, providers were able to set their own fees for each individual program, rather than a fee for each qualification level. Annual fee maximums were also removed. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 17 of 49 From 1 January 2013, this new fees structure will apply to all government subsidised students, regardless of their commencement date, with fees varying according to each program. Appendix 3 provides a list of the average annual 2013 tu ition fees, as well as the amount per nominal hour, for all TAFE programs for government subsidised students. This information can also be found at www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe2013 Each program aligns to a nationally endorsed tr aining package which is developed by an external industry skills council, or enterprise requiring specific qualifications and training. Training packages are endorsed annually and reviewed regularly to ensure they continue to meet the needs of industry, students and the community. The industry skills council or enterprise may amend a training package during 2013 and RMIT may, in the interest of students, adopt a revised training package. Any variation may result in amendments to the nominal hours of a program, which will be documented in the addendum sheet in the file available at www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe2013 3.6.2 Eligibility criteria for government subsidised places 1. Citizenship Students must be: An Australian citizen; or an Australian permanent resident (holder of a permanent visa); or the holder of a Special Category visa (sub-class 444, New Zealandcitizen); or holder of a temporary Protection Visa; or an East Timorese asylum seeker 2. Age and prior education Applicants aged 20 years and over as at 1 January in the year of commencement - Government subsidised places will be ava ilable for successful applicants applying for a qualification higher than the Australian qualification they currently hold, and where the program is offering government subsidised places. From 1 July 2012, applicants whose existing highes t qualification is VCE, VCAL, International Baccalaureate Diploma or a senior secondary school certificate from other Australian jurisdictions, are eligible for a government subsidised training place in a qualification at Certificate II or above where the program is offering government subsidised places. Applicants aged less than 20 years as at 1 January in the year of commencement - Government subsidised places will be availabl e for all successful applicants satisfying the above citizenship criteria and where the program is offering government subsidised places. 3. Current year studies To be eligible for a government subsidised place you must not: Have commenced or be scheduled to commence more than two programs at RMIT (excluding foundation level qualifications) in that calendar year where you have been allocated a government subsidised place; and Be currently enrolled in two or more programs at RMIT (excluding foundation level qualifications) at the same time where you have already been allocated government subsidised places 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 date: 21/12/2012 Page 18 of 49 4. Apprenticeships If you are an apprentice you only need to provide proof that you meet the citizenship criteria and the current year studies criteria in order to be eligible for a government subsidised place. Note: If you are commencing an apprenticeship and have already commenced or are scheduled to commence in two programs in a government subs idised place, you will still be eligible for a government subsidised place if one of those two TAFE programs is included on the Victorian Government list of approved Pre-apprenticeship and Pathway Qualifications. 6. Criteria for Foundation Skills students If you are undertaking a Foundation Skills program you only need to provide proof that you meet the citizenship criteria in order to be eligible for a government subsidised place. Foundation Skills programs include general education, English language, literacy and numeracy programs up to Certificate IV level and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning - Foundation level, as defined on the Foundation Skills Category Course List. http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/training/learners/vet/2012coursecat.pdf 3.6.2.1 Asylum Seekers and Victims of Human Trafficking Asylum Seekers and Victims of Human Trafficking are exempt from the citizenship/residency eligibility requirement for a government supported place, fo r the duration of their program, or until they withdraw. They must meet all other eligibility criteria for a government supported place. Asylum Seekers must be confirmed as 'Asylum S eekers' by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC). Victims of Human Trafficking must be confirmed as 'Victims of Human Trafficking' by the Australian Red Cross (ARC.) The ASRC and ARC have been provided with a grant to cover the tuition fees levied to eligible students, so RMIT will invoice these organisations for the tuition fees. 3.6.2.2 Single and Teenage Parents Training Initiative Individuals referred to training under the Single and Teenage Parents Training Initiative as being in the Guaranteed Access Cohort only do not have to m eet the elibility criteria for a government subsidised place. Those referred as being in the Secondary Access Cohort must meet all eligibility criteria for a government subsidised place. All students referred under this initiative are eligible to enrol in training only at Certificate II level and above, and are entitled to a fee concession on programs up to Certificate IV level, regardless of whether they hold a relevant concession card. Students enrolled in Diploma and Advanced Diploma programs can only access the concession ra te if they commenced the program prior to 1 July 2012, otherwise they will pay the government s ubsidised rate regardless of whether they hold a relevant concession card.. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - Page 19 of 49 3.6.3 2013 TAFE tuition fees In 2013 TAFE tuition fees for a government subs idised place vary according to each program. Appendix 3 provides a list of the average annual 2013 tu ition fees, as well as the amount per nominal hour, for all TAFE programs for government subsidised students. 3.6.3.1 Calculating the TAFE student contribution for a program or course TAFE fees for government subsidised places are calculated based on the nominal hours of enrolment. To calculate a student's tuition fees, multiply the total nominal hours for the course or program by the fees per nominal hour for the appropriate program listed in Appendix 3. Example 1 : Tuition fee per nominal hour for one program A student is enrolled in a diploma program with 700 nominal hours. The tuition fee per nominal hour for the program is $3.57. Therefore, the tuition fee will be 700 x $3.57 = $2499 Example 2 : Tuition fee per nominal hour for multiple programs A student is enrolled in a Certificate IV program with 200 nominal hours and a Diploma program with 300 nominal hours. The fees per nominal hour for the Certificate IV is $3.50 and the fees per nominal hour for the Diploma is $4.00 Therefore, the tuition fee will be 200 x $3.50 = $700 (Certificate IV) 300 x $4.00 = Total fees: $700 + $1,200 = $1,900 3.6.3.2 Fee exemptions and concessions for students in government-subsidised places Some students in government-subsidised places may be entitled to an exemption or concession on their tuition fees. This includes students with a Health Care Card or who receive government benefits through Centrelink. The concession fee is 20 per cent of the hourly fee that a provider would have charged a non-concession student in the same government subsidised program. Applicants who believe they are eligible must submit an Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form and provide supporting evidence of eligibility before an exemption or concession can be provided. Forms are available fr om and can be submitted to any campus Hub. 3.6.3.3 Diploma and Advanced Diploma students From 1 July 2009, Diploma and Advanced Diploma students were no longer eligible for TAFE fee concessions. However, in 2011 the Victorian government reintroduced tuition fee concessions for people under the age of 25 enrolled in these programs. From 1 July 2012, these concessions are no longer available to commencing students. However, continuing students already studying under thes e arrangements can continue to access the concession until the completion of their program. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 20 of 49 Diploma and Advanced Diploma students may be eligible for the VET FEE-HELP loan scheme to defer fees through the tax system (as per section 3.4 Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) of this schedule). 3.6.3.4 Tuition fees for Indigenous Students The Indigenous Completions Initiative announced in 2004 has been extended to cover tuition fees for all enrolments of Indigenous students in 2013. Indigenous students who enrol in TAFE programs in 2013 are entitled to the concession tuition fee amount at all program levels. 3.6.3.5 What about New Zealand citizens? New Zealand citizens who are holders of a Special Category Visa (subclass 444) are entitled to apply for a government subsidised place for TAFE programs. Their application will be subject to the same Skills Reform eligibility checks as local students. A Special Category Visa (subclass 444) allows visa holders to live and work permanently in Australia so long as they remain citizens of New Zealand. New Zealand citizens are however not eligible for VET FEE-HELP (as per section 3.4.5 Ineligibility for HELP programs of this Schedule). For more information: www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe/nz 3.6.4 Eligibility for exemptio ns and concessions - TAFE If you are a TAFE student or preparatory (pre-unive rsity) student enrolled in a government subsidised place at RMIT University you could be eligible to apply for an exemption or concession on tuition fees if you hold a Health Care Card, Pension Card or Veteran's Gold Card. Many students are eligible for a Health Care Card, such as low income earners. You can apply for a fee concession each term for each program in which you are enrolled. The concession fee is 20 per cent of the hourly fee that a provider would have charged a non-concession student in the same government subsidised program. Concession fees are not available for diploma, advanced diploma, vocational graduate certificate and vocational graduate diploma programs. Indigenous students can access fee concessions for all TAFE programs. From 1 July 2012, fee concessions are no longer available for 15 - 24 year olds commencing a diploma or advanced diploma program. Students already studying under these arrangements can continue to access the concession until the completion of their program. 3.6.4.1 Concession, and exemption categories for tuition fees Concession categories: HC Health Care Card holder (or dependent spouse or child of the holder) PC Pension Card holder (or dependent spouse or child of the holder) VC Veteran's Gold Card holder OT University discretion ST Single and Teenage Parent Training Initiative ATSI Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 Page 49 Fee exemptions: XC Judy Lazarus Transition Centre/ Community-based order 3.6.4.2 Job seeker Concession As a result of agreed funding arrangements between the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government, job seekers undertaking training at Certificate I through to Certificate IV level have been exempt from paying tuition fees. This arr angement will conclude at the end of 2012. From 1 January 2013, a referred job seeker will be charged the same tuition fees as other students, but may still be eligible for a concession. A referred job seeker is an individual who holds a standard Job Seeker Referral Form. Two concession codes were created for this category: JJ Job Seeker with Concession JK Job Seeker without Concession These codes will continue to be used for reporting purposes but will no longer result in a tuition fee exemption. Job seekers may still be eligible for a fee concession if they hold a Health Care Card, Pension Card or Veteran's Gold Card. 3.6.4.3 Judy Lazarus Transition Centre/ Community based orders A TAFE provider must not charge a tuition fee for enrolment by a person who is: a) a prisoner within the meaning of the Corrections Act 1986 and from the Judy Lazarus Transition Centre; or b) required to undertake the program pursuant to a community based order made under the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 . 3.6.4.4 College Discretion (OT) Authority to grant a college discretion concession is delegated to the Academic Registrar. RMIT is permitted to grant a concession on a tuition contribution where RMIT considers that its collection in full would impose extreme financial hardship. This ma y include a further concession on, or exemption from, the concession charge. If RMIT grants a concession on a tuition contribution, this is done using the TAFE waiver code \"OT\" on the Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form. If RMIT grants an exemption from a tuition c ontribution, this is done by a waiver approved by the Academic Registrar. 3.6.5 Concessions for dependan t spouse/child of card holder For Commonwealth Health Care Cards and Pensioner Concession Cards concessions that apply to tuition fees apply equally to the holder of the card, their dependant spouse and/or child. Dependant child has the same meaning as in the Social Security Act 1991 of the Commonwealth. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - Page 22 of 49 3.6.6 Verification of exemptio ns and concessions - TAFE Students are required to complete and lodge an Application for TAFE concession, minimum fee and exemption form to request a concession or exemption of fees. Students must complete a separate application form for each TAFE program in which they are enrolled.The basis of the exemption/concession should be clearly indicated on the form. Evidence is required from the student to substantiate the application for a concession and must be sighted by the enrolment officer and a copy attached to the application form. 3.6.6.1 Applying for fee concessions To be assessed for TAFE fee concession eligibility, you are required to complete a 2013 Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form. The application form is available from the Hub on your campus. You must submit the form in person at the Hub with your valid Health Care Card, Pension Card or Veteran's Gold Card on or before your first census date in the term you are seeking concession. 3.6.7 Change in concession status Concession fees will only be applied during a term if the eligibility conditions are met (as per section 3.6.6.2 Health Care Cards above) and the 2013 Application for TAFE Concession, Minimum Fee and Exemption form is lodged at the Hub prior to or on the first census date in the term. If a student does not meet the eligibility criteria or the application form is not lodged by the relevant census date, the concession cannot be applied until the following term (subject to eligibility criteria being met for that term). Further information about concessions can be found at: www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/tafe/concession 3.6.8 East Timorese asylum seekers Students who are East Timorese asylum seekers are entitled to apply for state government funded TAFE places. 3.6.9 Interstate Appr entices and Trainees For interstate apprenticeships a contract signed between RMIT and the interstate State Training Authority must be in place (NSW has its own procedure for eligible students, see 3.6.9.1 below). The State Training Authorities provide their contract for RMIT to sign. Each apprentice must have a Training Contract signed by their employer that specifies the program and RMIT as the Registered Training Organisation (RTO). More information is available from the RMIT Apprenticeship and traineeships website: http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/apps-trainees or at: http://training.gov.au DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - date: Page 23 of 49 3.6.9.1 New South Wales Apprenticeships The Victorian and New South Wales Governments, through their respective State Training Authorities, have a Memorandum of Understanding that enables apprentices from either state to enrol at a TAFE institute in Victoria or New South Wales. To be eligible, a NSW apprentice must: a) be an apprentice whose training contract is current and registered with the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities; b) have approval from the relevant New South Wale s State Training Services Regional Office to undertake training with the RTO; and c) have commenced training under the apprenticeship with the RTO in 2013, or commenced training under the apprenticeship with the RTO prior to 1 January 2013 and be continuing under the same Contract of Training and same qualification in 2013. In 2013, NSW apprentices will be charged at the same rate as Victorian government subsidised students in the same program. Note: NSW State Training Services advises (for apprentices) that where TAFE NSW training exists, approval of interstate funding will not be granted. 3.6.10 Fee Maintenance: studen ts who commenced programs before 1 July 2009 In 2009, the Victorian government announced major changes to TAFE education under the Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria reforms which took effect from 1 July 2009. In line with the Victorian Minister for Skills and Workforce Participation's 2009 Ministerial Directions on fees and charges, under the 'fee maintenance' scheme, students who commenced their programs before 1 July 2009 were entitled to continue to be charged in accordance with the fee structure in place at the time of their initial enrolment in that program. This arrangement ended on 31 December 2012. From 1 January 2013, all students will be charged under a consistent fee structure, regardless of their commencement date. 3.7 Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Recognition of Current Competency (RCC) In the TAFE sector it is possible for students to gain formal recognition of their current skills or to receive further training to update or improve their qua lifications. RMIT offers two services under this scheme: 1. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process through which people can gain entry to, or credit in, recognised courses based on competencies gained. The competencies may have been gained through experience in the workplace, in voluntary work, in social or domestic activities or through informal or formal training or other life experiences. 2. Recognition of Current Competency (RCC) applies if a client has previously successfully completed the requirements of a unit of competency or module and is now required to be reassessed to ensure that the competence is being maintained. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - Page 24 of 49 RPL and RCC do not include any additional training at the unit of competency or module level. If a unit of competency or module has any training activity associated with it then it is not classified as RPL or RCC. Depending on availability, students who require additional tuition before they can achieve recognition for their chosen program may be offered as state government subsidised program or enrol in a fee for service program. At RMIT, RPL and RCC are offered as a separate m ode of study which will be available for all TAFE courses based on nationally endorsed units of competency and State Accredited units/modules. 3.7.1 TAFE RPL Fees for Government s ubsidised and full fee paying students RPL is available as a study mode in all RMIT TAFE courses. Students can apply for RPL for all of the courses in their program of study, from a minimum of one course to a maximum of all courses in the program. In 2013 TAFE RPL fees are equivalent to the standard tuition fees for the course(s) for which RPL is sought. 3.8 TAFE international and domestic full fee paying 3.8.1 TAFE international program fees Appendix 2 of this document tabulates the 2013 tuition fees applicable to students studying under a student visa arrangement (classified as international onshore students). 3.8.2 TAFE tuition fees for Au stralian Fee Paying Students RMIT offers a number of places in TAFE progr ams on a full fee paying basis. Students who are ineligible for a state government supported pl ace or who are repeating a government supported course may enrol as full fee paying students. The tuition contribution, concessions or exemptions outlined in section 3.6 do not apply to full fee enrolments. Appendix 3 provides a list of the average annual 2013 tuition fees for all TAFE programs for Australian fee paying students. 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 25 of 49 4 Student services and amenities fees (SSAF) With the passage of the Voluntary Student Union (VSU) bill in 2005, RMIT was required to cease charging Compulsory Non-Academic Fees (CNAF) to higher education students. For reasons of equity, RMIT opted to also cease charging Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) to TAFE and preparatory students. On 11 October 2011, the Australian Parliament passed legislation allowing universities and other higher education providers to again charge a fee for student services and amenities of a non- academic nature. The fee may be spent by higher education providers on items such as sporting and recreational activities, employment and career advic e, child care, financial advice and food services from 2012. With the re-introduction of this fee to the higher education sector, from 2013 RMIT will also re-introduce this fee for TAFE and preparatory students. Fee rates are determined by the Federal Government and set on an annual basis. In 2013, Higher Education students will be charged on a pro-rata basis at the rate of $2.85 per credit point for each course you are enrolled in, up to a maximum of $273 for the year. TAFE students will be charged on a pro-rata basis at the rate of $0.38 per nominal student contact hour, up to a maximum of $273 for the year. If you are a TAFE student and you are eligible for a concession on your tuition fees, you are also elig ible for a concession on the SSAF; the concession rate is $0.08 per nominal student contact hour. Eligible students will be able to defer payment of this fee via the SA-HELP scheme. For further information, refer to www.rmit.edu.au/programs/fees/ssaf 4.1 Students charged the SSAF in 2013 You will be charged the SSAF if you are an onshore student and are charged a tuition fee by the University. This includes: exchange students (i.e. RMIT students studying at an overseas institution with which RMIT has a formal reciprocal agreement) OUA students enrolled in a RMIT Commonwealth supported place 4.2 Students not charged the SSAF in 2013 Research students in a Research Training Scheme place Offshore students (i.e. students studying at an RMIT partner institution outside Australia) Exchange students coming to RMIT from another institution Cross institutional outbound students (i.e. RMIT students studying at another institution in Australia) 2013 Schedule of Fees and Charges Status: FINAL Version: 1.0 DocRef: Document: RMIT12 - 2013 SOFC_1205-bb.doc Save date: 21/12/2012 Page 26 of 49 Study Abroad students, including: o inbound students studying at an RMIT campus in Melbourne, and o outbound students attending an overseas institution with which RMIT has no formal reciprocal agreement OUA students enrolled in full-fee places ELICOS students enrolled through RMIT English Worldwide Industry sponsored students pursuant to the terms of their individual agreements 5 Material fees Material fees and charges are for goods and services associated with a program of study, such as field trips or lecture notes, reading material or course readers and laboratory or workshop equipment retained by the student after they have completed their program. These fees are not compulsory and students may choose to purchase these items independently. The material fee schedule is made available at the time of enrolment and material fees may only be levied with a student's signed consent . The fees approved for 2013 have been reviewed to ens ure consistency with the above principles. Appendix 4 provides a list of the course (material) fees for 2013. Material fees are also published on the website http://www.rmit.edu.au/fs/studentfees/material . 5.1 Higher Education and TAFE sector Material fees for VET/TAFE courses eligible for VET FEE-HELP are now required to be compliant with identical fee provisions to those that govern Higher Education under the Higher Education Support Act (HESA). The general principle governing material fees is that students must be able to complete their chosen award without paying additional course related charges. Schools are authorised to charge material fees if the charge falls under one of the following categories: 1.

In addition, a number of fees have been approved that can be levied against a student's account as a fine or penalty when university regulations are br oken, or borrowed goods are not returned. These fees are principally levied as a disincentive. Al though the majority of fees and charges are levied via the student administration system for practical reasons, some Administrative fees are levied outside of this system (ie. car parking fees and fines). Appendix 5 details a full list of administrative fees and charges. Administrative fees are also published on the website http://www.rmit.edu.au/fs/studentfees/admin . For some administrative fees and charges, information about how they will be levied is noted below. 6.1 Late enrolment fee 6.1.1 Higher Education sector Students who enrol after their scheduled re-enrolment date may be charged a late enrolment fee. Failure to enrol by scheduled time/date : Unless prior alternative arrangements have been negotiated with the relevant College/School, Higher Education students who fail to enrol by the specified time and date, and who subsequently receive approval to re- enrol late, will incur a late enrolment fee of $175. The late resolution of any outstanding debts will not be considered as justification for waiving the late enrolment fee ($175). Appeals against the $175 late enrolment fee must be directed to the Academic Registrar in writing with documentary evidence (e.g. medical certificate) in support of the student's application.

RMIT reserves the right to provide student details to an external agent for the purpose of collecting any debts. Any additional costs associated with this process are payable by the student. 8.1 Fees for late payment 8.1.1 Overdue charges penalty Students are invoiced on a monthly basis, with invoices for domestic higher education students issued more frequently in the lead up to the Semester 1 and Semester 2 census dates. The invoice schedule can be found at www.rmit.edu.au/students/taxinvoiceschedule. Invoiced fees must be paid in full by the due date as prescribed on the invoice.

These rules apply equally to all new and re-enrolling students unless otherwise stated. These rules are based on the following assumptions: The funds for the refund must be available (cheques are cleared, telegraphic transfers have been received); and Any fines or other incidental fees incurred during enrolment or engagement with RMIT must be paid in full. The acceptance of the refund rules, and the availability of complaints and appeals processes, does not remove the right of the student to take action under Australia's consumer protection laws. 12.1.1 Refund application process Students who lodge their application to withdraw on or before the census date for a course (unit of study) will be withdrawn or granted a deferral without penalty and will not incur a HELP debt for that course (unit of study). Local or re-enrolling international students who have paid their fees up-front and wish to have their tuition fees refunded must do so by lodging an Application for Refund of Fees and supporting documentation at one of RMIT's Student Hubs (this form can be obtained from the Hub). A commencing international student must lodge an Application for Refund form for International Students at International Services. If a refund is to be provided to a third party, this mu st be specified in or with the student's application. Enrolled international students must also submit an authorised Leave of Absence, Cancellation of Enrolment or Change of Program for International Students form, with supporting documentation. International students who are not in Australia must lodge an Application for Refund form for International Students with International Services. 12.1.2 Payment of refund Applications for refunds may take 2 - 3 weeks to process (earlier, if specifically required by legislation). Refunds must be requested in writing under the applicant's signature, and supported by production of a valid offer letter.

A student is defined as a returning student if they are re-enrolling in a program in which they have already undertaken study at RMIT. 12.1.4 Refunds for domestic students an d returning internat ional students This section outlines the refund rules that apply to all domestic students, and to returning international students. (The next section 12.1.6 outlines the refund rules for commencing international students.) Census date The census date is a predetermined date for a course (unit of study). Students who lodge their application to withdraw on or before the census date for a course (unit of study) will be withdrawn or granted a deferral without penalty. All associated tuition fees will be refunded in full. Students who withdraw from a course (unit of study) on or before the census date will not incur a HELP debt for that course (unit of study). Compliance with this deadline is necessary for RMIT's funding and legislative reporting.
