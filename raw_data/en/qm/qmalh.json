A 1999 statewide survey of Medi-Cal beneciaries showed 56 percent reported difculty nding physicians willing to seethem, and a 1998 survey of California physicians found that nearly half of all physicians donot accept Medi-Cal patients. Low participation levels mean that even though Medi-Cal andHealthy Families participants may be able to afford care because their coverage eliminates theprice barrier, they still might not be able to actually get care from their physicians of choice, toreceive the care in a timely manner, or to access care at all. Less understood is how participation issues arise and how important they are, not only in Medi-Cal, but also in the Healthy Families Program. Because more than half of Medi-Calbeneciaries and all Healthy Families beneciaries are in managed care, participating healthplans and health plan \"look-alikes\"\u2014county or other organizations that act in a plan capacityto establish and maintain physician networks\u2014are uniquely positioned to provide informa-tion on physician participation and the pressure points for change. In spring 2002, Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) conducted a telephone survey of all health plans and look-alikes participating in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families about their ex-periences developing and sustaining physician networks, the nature of any access problems,and what can be done to remedy these problems. Of the 35 health plans in the sample, 33 completed the survey, representing 94 percent of Medi-Cal managed care enrollment and99 percent of Healthy Families enrollees. Some 72 percent of all health plans surveyed partic-ipate in both the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs. Because of this overlap, the proleof health plans participating by program is fairly similar.2Medi-Cal Policy InstituteKey Findings Physician Participation Plans reported that they generally have not had problems developing and maintaining primary care networks. More than three-quarters of plans (representing more than 80 percent of en-rollment) agree strongly or somewhat that it is easy to develop and retain primary careproviders. While turnover exists, it is relatively low in most plans, and even when it is not,plans have been able to retain access through individual contracts with physicians and use ofother primary care providers such as nurse practitioners. Specialist participation is more prob-lematic. Recruitment and retention problems with orthopedists and neurologists are especiallypervasive. For example, 64 percent of plans reported difculty in recruiting and retainingorthopedists and 56 percent reported similar problems with neurologists. Health plans havealso had substantial difculty with ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians, dermatologists,and pediatric subspecialists. Health plans said these problems stem from two key factors: (1) undersupply; and (2) unwill- ingness to participate. Undersupply. Undersupply occurs because there are not enough physicians in some areas and because shortages appear to exist in some specialties. Some 78 percent of plans said that it is particularly difcult to develop and maintaintheir physician networks in specic locations within their service areas. Plansserving rural areas were more likely to report either no physicians or fewphysicians with whom to contract, and availability was found to be worse forparticular specialties. Some urban and semiurban areas suffer from shortagesbecause physicians nd certain locations unattractive. Unwillingness to participate. Health plans perceive that physicians' unwilling- ness to participate is a function of low payment, more hassle compared withother lines of business, and the belief that beneciaries are difcult and non-compliant. In areas where supply does not meet demand, physicians havemore power to be choosy about the contracts they will accept. Health plans said they experience these problems in both programs, but the problems are somewhat worse for Medi-Cal. Health Plan Assessment and Response The survey ndings suggest that there are moderate problems with physician networks. Health plans have been trying to address the issues through a number of measures, such as: Increasing payment to some hard-to-get specialists; Subsidizing local hospitals' or clinics' physician recruitment costs or salaries; 2Medi-Cal Policy InstituteBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 3Buying blocks of appointments; Providing transportation for members; and Educating members about treatment compliance. Plan strategies differ for network formation, and some plans have a greater preference for tra- ditional providers. Composition of networks, however, has been constrained by physicianlocation and willingness to participate. Although plans have limited data, most thought accesshad been at least maintained since the time before managed care. Many health plans thoughtthat access had improved, and some reported a decline in emergency room use. While health plans' physician contract renegotiations were unremarkable in the year before the survey\u201470 percent said they were \"not a problem\"\u2014many expressed concerns about futurenegotiations in light of the state's proposed cuts to payment rates. In fact, the six health plansin Medi-Cal and ve in Healthy Families that have been experiencing difculties with contractnegotiations said that the issue is almost exclusively over low payment rates. Health plans havebeen particularly worried about specialist participation because they perceive that specialistsare more sensitive to payment levels and that there is more competition for specialists' services.This apprehension comes from health plans' experience that \"once [physicians] leave, it's reallyhard to get [them] back into the program.\" Because California's budget crisis has worsenedsince the survey, health plans' concerns have likely intensied. Conclusions and Policy Implications Having coverage does not necessarily ensure adequate access to care. For this reason, it is im- portant to encourage sufcient physician participation in managed care under Medi-Cal andHealthy Families. Survey results show mixed success. While health plans' efforts to encouragephysician participation have had some good results, problems exist geographically and for cer-tain specialties. Remedying existing problems and preventing growth of new ones can only be achieved through long-term collaboration among physicians, health plans, and the state. The surveyndings highlight what health plans are doing to support physician participation, but the stategovernment has at least an equally important role. The state plays a crucial role in ensuringequitable payment to health plans (who then pay physicians) and in following good businesspractices that encourage and protect access to physicians (such as, eliminating duplicate re-quirements and paperwork). Policymakers facing difcult decisions should consider how payment cutbacks influence managed care. Budget cuts run counter to the desired message: \"We want you to participate.\"Cutbacks resulting in lower payment rates for Medi-Cal and Healthy Families managed caremay generate short-term savings, but they can destabilize the delicate balance of cooperationthat the state, health plans, and providers have achieved so far in support of managed care andoverall program participation.4Medi-Cal Policy InstituteBeyond physician payment rates, there are other ways to encourage physician participation in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families managed care: Through effective marketing and by educating physicians about how the pro- grams work, the state and health plans can minimize frustration, confusion,and negative perceptions of the programs and their beneciaries. Explaining the programs to beneciaries can be challenging, but it is essential for both health plans and the state to help them to learn how their coverageworks and how to comply with treatment. Federal and state governments can help improve supply and distribution (for example, by providing incentives for physicians to practice in underservedareas or supporting telemedicine initiatives). With California's budget crisis showing no signs of abating, it is more important than ever to sustain an open dialogue about common concerns. A concerted effort by the state, healthplans, and physicians working together is needed to protect current levels of physician partici-pation and access in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families.I. Introduction Having health insurance is critical for ensuring access to health care. Research shows that the insured have substantially greater access to care than the uninsured.1The expansions of state Medicaid programs in the 1980s and the creation of the State Children's Health InsuranceProgram (SCHIP) in the late 1990s were important steps in getting care to low-income popu-lations. Unfortunately, however, coverage alone does not necessarily ensure adequate access tocare. State Medicaid programs have long had trouble generating sufcient physician participa-tion in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program. These problems appear to have carriedover to the more recently implemented managed care programs. 2Low physician participation levels mean that Medicaid and SCHIP participants may be able to afford care because it is es-sentially free, even though they still might not be able to actually get care from their physiciansof choice, to receive the care in a timely manner, or to access care at all. Physician participation in Medi-Cal\u2014California's Medicaid program\u2014is a recognized prob- lem. A 1999 statewide survey of Medi-Cal beneciaries showed 56 percent reported difcultynding physicians willing to see them; virtually all respondents (94 percent) said getting morephysicians in the program was important. 3A 1998 survey of California physicians found that nearly half of physicians do not accept Medi-Cal patients. On average, two-thirds as many pri-mary care physicians and half as many specialist physicians were available to Medi-Cal patientsin 1998 as were available to the population as a whole. 4This same survey showed participation in Medi-Cal varied widely by physician specialty and geography.5Less understood is how par- ticipation issues arise and how important they are currently, not only in Medi-Cal, but also inthe Healthy Families Program (California's SCHIP program). Health plans and health plan look-alikes\u2014county or other organizations that act in a plan capacity to develop physician networks\u2014are uniquely positioned to provide information onphysician participation in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families because they are responsible forestablishing and maintaining provider networks to serve these programs. After an inauspicious Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 56Medi-Cal Policy Institutestart, which led to federal limits on Medicaid managed care, managed care has come to play an important role in California's Medi-Cal program.6Health plans have played a major role in Medi-Cal since the mid-1990s, when the state implemented managed care programs in 23 ofthe state's 58 counties. Healthy Families was implemented with a managed care model acrossthe entire state in July 1998. Currently, a little more than half (51.1 percent) of Medi-Calbeneciaries and all of Healthy Families beneciaries are in managed care. 7As a result of devel- oping physician networks for these two programs over time, participating health plans have aunique perspective about the trends in physician access in California and opportunities toeffect change. The 2002 survey of health plans and look-alike organizations delves deeper intoissues of physician access to understand from the health plans' perspective if there are prob-lems encountered in developing or sustaining physician networks. Toward that end, the surveywas designed to reveal what the problems are with regard to physician networks, where theproblems exist, why there are problems, and, ultimately, what can be done to remedy theseproblems. The research presented in this report was conducted as part of a larger initiative sponsored by the Medi-Cal Policy Institute. In total, the project is made up of four diverse studies that ex-amine data from beneciaries, physicians, and health plans about access under the Medi-Caland Healthy Families programs. Health plans and look-alike organizations in Medi-Cal andHealthy Families were surveyed to assess their experience with contracting and managingphysician networks to provide access to care. Together, these projects provide a multifacetedprole of access to physician care in Medi-Cal and the Healthy Families Program.II. Background: California Program Context Medi-Cal California's Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) has two primary delivery systems: fee-for-service and managed care.8In January 2003, about half of the 6.3 million Medi-Cal beneciaries were enrolled in managed care through one of three models operating in 22 of California's 58 coun-ties. These include the T wo-Plan Model, Geographic Managed Care (GMC), and CountyOrganized Health System (COHS). 9These three models account for virtually all of Medi-Cal managed care enrollment: 73 percent of Medi-Cal managed care beneciaries were enrolled inthe T wo-Plan Model; 10 percent were in GMC; and 16 percent were in COHS. 10Four small counties have other types of managed care models that account for about 1 percent of Medi-Cal managed care enrollment: primary care case management, FFS managed care, prepaidhealth plans, and special projects to manage high-cost beneciaries in FFS, such as benecia-ries with AIDS. 11The rest of the Medi-Cal population (48 percent) is served through the tra- ditional FFS program. Those in FFS include the generally small and rural counties that cannotsupport managed care and those in Medi-Cal eligibility groups for whom enrollment in man-aged care is not mandatory (for example, those covered by Supplemental Security Income). Medi-Cal provides a relatively comprehensive set of benets that applies regardless of whether a beneciary is enrolled in managed care. The program covers physician visits, hospital inpa-tient and outpatient care, nursing home care, laboratory tests, and x-rays; there is very limitedcost sharing. 12At the time of the survey (2002), California's Medi-Cal program covered 32 of 34 optional benet categories, including dental and vision care for adults, and prescriptiondrugs. 13In January 2003, the Governor proposed to reduce the number of optional benets covered to 19 to help reduce the state budget shortfall.14 State contracts for managed care do not necessarily include responsibility for all of Medi-Cal'sbenets. Rather, certain Medi-Cal benets are carved out of the main package and continue Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 78Medi-Cal Policy Instituteto be delivered separately by providers and paid for by the state, as they are under the traditional program. For example, preventive examinations and diagnostics required under the Early andPeriodic Screening, Diagnostic, and T reatment (EPSDT) program are covered by the state'sChild Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) program, and mental health services (with a few exceptions) are provided by mental health managed care plans that contract with theTwo-Plan Model In this model, Medi-Cal beneciaries are enrolled in one of two managed care plans: (1) a public entity (known as a local ini-tiative); or (2) a commercial plan. (In some counties, the modeloperates with just two commercial plans.) The Two-Plan Modeloperates in 12 counties that are among the largest in the state,including Alameda, Contra Costa, Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles,Riverside, San Bernardino, San Francisco, San Joaquin, SantaClara, Stanislaus, and Tulare Counties. Geographic Managed Care (GMC)In Sacramento and San Diego Counties, the state contracts with a number of commercial managed care plans to deliver care on acapitated basis. County Organized Health System(COHS)In the COHS model, a county-run plan provides Medi-Cal ser- vices. There are currently ve COHSs that provide services ineight counties, including Monterey, Napa, Orange, San Mateo,Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Solano, and Yolo Counties. Thecounty plan is paid on a capitated basis and contracts directlywith providers. (Orange County also contracts with health plans.) Prepaid Health Plan (PHP)The PHP model is used in counties where Medi-Cal beneciaries may voluntarily enroll in a managed care plan. The PHP model isactive only in Marin and Sonoma Counties. Primary Care Case Management(PCCM)Under this model, primary care providers contract with the state to provide primary care and specialty services on a capitatedbasis. This originally was intended to be a transitional model tofull-risk managed care and is currently active only in Los AngelesCounty. Fee-for-Service Managed Care(FFSMC)In the FFSMC model, Medi-Cal beneciaries are assigned a primary care provider for case management. These providers are paid on an FFS basis. This model is used in Placer andSonoma Counties. Special Projects A few special projects pay health plans to provide medical case management for select high-cost Medi-Cal beneciaries (such asAIDS patients or elderly who are at risk of entering long-termcare) in the FFS environment.Medi-Cal Managed Care Delivery ModelsBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 9Department of Mental Health (although each county operates its own mental health plan). Children with specied serious illnesses and conditions, including cancer, severe injury,chronic illness, and disability, have related care covered by the California Children Services(CCS) program. 15 In cases where there are carve-outs, health plans are only responsible for assuring access to asubset of providers and services. Coordination issues may arise when benets are includedand/or excluded under managed care contracts, especially when health plans are capitated(nancially at risk). Because this study focused on health plans, information is not available onaccess to certain physicians\u2014such as those delivering mental health\u2014that are carved out ofmanaged care programs. Payment rates are known to influence whether physicians participate in a program. Medi-Cal's payment rates are among the lowest in the country. The FFS payments, upon which the capi-tation payments are based, were increased only marginally until 2000, when rates wereincreased by an average of 16 percent. 16The 2000 increase was the rst major increase in 12 years. Even with the increase, however, Medi-Cal rates remain well below rates paid byMedicare and the private sector. Medi-Cal's payment rates for FFS physicians rank 42nd outof 51 Medicaid programs nationwide, averaging only 65 percent of what Medicare pays for thesame services. 17Medi-Cal's capitation rates average 83 percent of Medicare rates.18 In 2002, when the MPR survey was elded, California was facing a $23.6 billion budgetshortfall, which was about 30 percent of the state's General Fund budget. The Governor's pro-posed reductions to Medi-Cal totaled $1.3 billion for FY 2002-03 and were distributedroughly evenly across ve areas: eligibility and enrollment, benets, provider payment rates,county administrative funding, and purchasing and management. 19These cuts were being debated at the time when the survey was elded, and they generated comments from thehealth plans. Ultimately, the budget signed on September 5, 2002, concentrated the cuts incounty administrative funding and purchasing and management, eliminating cuts to providerpayment rates. Cuts to provider payment rates of 10 to 15 percent have resurfaced in the Gov-ernor's proposed FY 2003-04 budget (released January 2003) to help close the $35 billionbudget gap (reflecting the $10 billion shortfall of and the $24 billion shortfall ofFY 2003-04). 20These provider payment rate cuts have implications for health plans and their physicians because the capitation rates are based on FFS payment. Healthy Families The Healthy Families Program is California's SCHIP . Implemented in 1998, the Healthy Families Program provides health insurance for children in families with incomes too high forMedi-Cal but below 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Statewide, HealthyFamilies beneciaries receive their care from managed care plans; there is no FFS option inHealthy Families. The program is administered entirely by the Managed Risk Medical Insur-ance Board (MRMIB), whereas Medi-Cal is administered by the California Department of10 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteHealth Services and individual counties. As of January 2003, there were 621,291 children enrolled in Healthy Families.21 The Healthy Families benet package is somewhat narrower than Medi-Cal's, with no benetcomparable to EPSDT. There are some differences in coverage of physical therapy, mentalhealth, vision, and dental care as well. Under Healthy Families, mental health services are notcarved out to counties as they are in Medi-Cal. Healthy Families requires payment of pre-miums ranging from $4 to $9 per child per month (up to a maximum of $27 per family), and$5 copayments for all services except preventive care (with an annual maximum out-of-pocketcontribution of $250 per year). Managed care plans are responsible for providing almost allcare covered by Healthy Families, with the CCS program being the major exception.III. Methodology Survey This report is based on Mathematica Policy Research's 2002 statewide survey of health plans and county organizations responsible for developing physician networks for the Medi-Caland/or Healthy Families programs. The 2002 MPR survey included many of the same itemsfrom the 2001 MPR survey of Medicaid and SCHIP plans' experience with access to providersin 11 states, including California. 22Also used were 2002 Medi-Cal enrollment data from the state's Medi-Cal Managed Care Statistics Section in the Department of Health Services; g-ures for subcontractors from health plans were obtained directly. Healthy Families 2002 en-rollment data were received from the Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board. Survey Sample The 2002 survey included a census of health plans and county organizations responsible for developing and maintaining physician networks for Medi-Cal managed care and HealthyFamilies as of March 2002, regardless of size (Appendix A). 23Medi-Cal health plans were iden- tied using the January 2002 Medi-Cal County Data Book ; state, county, and health plan Web sites; and through other research.24Healthy Families plans were identied primarily from the Healthy Families Web site.25 Because the goal was to understand the state of physician access across all forms of managedcare, not only were the traditional managed care organizations that accept full risk included,but also the partially capitated physician-hospital consortia that act as plans in Orange County,the FFS managed care plans, and COHS sponsors. These sponsors are organizations respon-sible for overseeing the delivery of care for Medi-Cal in the county, but they may or may notactually provide direct delivery of care (for example, CalOptima in Orange County). The sur-vey also included health plans that subcontract to other plans, which are primarily found in Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 1112 Medi-Cal Policy Institutethe T wo-Plan Model (particularly in Los Angeles County) and in Orange County's CalOptima model. Because of their very targeted care focus and limited reach, Medi-Cal managed careSpecial Project plans were excluded. These criteria identied 35 health plans and organizations eligible for the survey (see Appen- dix A). For simplicity, the entities surveyed are referred to collectively as health plans through-out this report. Because their products are managed separately, treated distinctly, and havemutually exclusive service areas, Blue Cross and Blue Shield were surveyed separately for theirhealth maintenance organization (HMO) and exclusive provider organization (EPO) prod-ucts. This means that Blue Cross HMO is considered one plan and Blue Cross EPO another.The same is true for Blue Shield. We provide further detail and discussion of health plancharacteristics later in this chapter. Survey Content and Design The project employs a semistructured survey instrument of 90 items, split almost evenly be- tween closed-ended and open-ended questions (see Appendix B for survey instrument). Priorexperience with surveys about access issues shows that closed-ended questions are important indescribing health plan features and policies and the factors shaping them. However, healthplan structures are complex; therefore, open-ended questions are invaluable to capture theseorganizations' infrastructures, policies, and their rationales for decisions. A semistructuredstrategy was well suited to providing an understanding of provider participation and the pres-sure points for change. To support this perspective, health researchers knowledgeable aboutthe Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs, managed care, and physician access issues con-ducted the interviews. The survey questionnaire elicits information on the structure of the health plans' physician networks, their experience recruiting and retaining providers, and the techniques used to iden-tify and respond to problems. The instrument covered a number of explicit areas, including: Network structure and responsibilities, including use of a gatekeeper and rules for accessing specialty care, and patterns of care before and after managed care; Provider participation, including experience developing and maintaining net- works; problems with provider recruitment, retention, and contract renego-tiation, and reasons; recent experience with physician turnover; and rules forparticipation, especially in plans sponsored by commercial networks; and Plan action and other suggestions to remedy network problems, and plan activities to monitor access. Throughout the survey, health plans were asked to compare their experience and requirements across products, including commercial, and to highlight particular geographic issues. The abil-ity to document how issues vary geographically was constrained by the fact that many healthBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 13plans\u2014particularly large ones\u2014serve multiple counties. To keep respondents' burden reason- able, health plans serving multiple counties were typically asked to respond in general toclosed-ended items and to elaborate on geographic variation in their open-ended comments.Such elaboration provides a sense of how problems vary across the state but not the degree ofcounty-by-county measurement that would exist if it had been feasible to get county-specicanswers from each of the health plans. Survey Implementation and Response Rates The survey was pretested in the beginning of May 2002 and elded from the end of May through mid-July 2002. To encourage a high response, a solicitation letter came from theMedi-Cal Policy Institute that highlighted the role of this study in the broad access initiative.The letter conrmed that individual plan responses would be condential. The health planswere told that the study was being done by MPR and that it would require about 30 minutesof time from someone knowledgeable about the health plan's efforts to develop physiciannetworks and improve access to care. Within a week of the survey, an MPR researcher calledthe ofce of the health plan CEO to conrm his or her ability to participate, to identify theappropriate respondent, and to schedule a time for the interview. Health plans were informedthat they would receive a copy of the nal report. Thirty-three of the thirty-ve health plans in the sample completed the survey (representing a 94 percent response rate). Responding plans enroll 94 percent of all Medi-Cal managed careenrollment and 99 percent of Healthy Families enrollees. The two health plans that did notcomplete the survey were Family Choice and Care 1st Health Plan. Each of these plans is asubcontractor to another health plan included in the survey. Family Choice is one of the threephysician-hospital consortia in the study and participates only in Orange County as a subcon-tractor to CalOptima for Medi-Cal services. Family Choice accounts for 9 percent of Medi-Cal enrollment and 4 percent of Healthy Families enrollment in Orange County. Care 1stHealth Plan participates as a subcontractor to L.A. Care Health Plan for Medi-Cal services inLos Angeles County. In Los Angeles, Care 1st enrolls 10 percent of Medi-Cal beneciaries and3 percent of Healthy Families beneciaries in managed care. In both Los Angeles and OrangeCounties, where these refusals occurred, there were a large number of other health plans thatparticipated, and responses were received from both CalOptima and L.A. Care Health Plan. The survey received nearly 100 percent item response. The cases are noted in which health plans refused to answer a question, were not responsive to a question, or should have answereda question but did not because the interviewer mistakenly skipped it. Characteristics of Responding Health Plans Table 1 shows the distribution of the surveyed health plans that responded in each program by selected characteristics, with and without weighting for size (by respective programenrollment). 2614 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteTable 1. Characteristics of Participating Plans Percent of Plans Share of Enrollment Medi-Cal Healthy Families Medi-Cal Healthy Families Program Both Public Medi-Cal and Healthy Families Plans. *In Medi-Cal, the state and plans treat San Bernardino and Riverside counties as a single Two-Plan county. Thus, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties are presented as one county for analytic purposes. This only affects the classication of one plan whose service area is only San Bernardino and Riverside; this plan is classied as participating in one county rather than multiple counties. Plans are represented in only one MSA category. If a plan is in more than one MSA but not enough counties to be statewide, the plan (and its total enrollment) are put into the MSA category of their greatest enrollment. This only affects ve plans in Medi-Cal and three in th e Healthy Families Program.Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 15Health plans participating in one of the public programs under study tended to participate in the other. Some 72 percent of all health plans surveyed (24 of 33) reported participation inboth the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs. Health plans that serve both programsaccount for 95 percent of the Medi-Cal managed care enrollment and 73 percent of HealthyFamilies' enrollment. Because of this overlap, the prole of health plans participating by pro-gram is fairly similar. The differences that do exist tend to be consistent with the greateruniformity of the statewide structure for Healthy Families versus Medi-Cal, which varies bycounty. These differences are particularly apparent in the enrollment-weighted statistics. Most health plans in each program (more than 70 percent) are dened for the purposes of this report as \"public program-dominant,\" which means that 75 percent or more of their total planenrollment consists of Medi-Cal and/or Healthy Families enrollees. Public program-dominanthealth plans tend to have smaller total enrollment than other health plans (for example, com-mercial health plans). As a result, they do not have a majority of enrollment in either program.Commercial health plans account for 55 percent of Medi-Cal enrollment and 73 percent of Healthy Families enrollment. Commercial health plans are more likely to be in multiplecounties or statewide. Of the nine commercial health plans in the sample, only two havesingle-county service areas. All statewide health plans (two for Medi-Cal and six for HealthyFamilies) are commercial. More than 60 percent of surveyed health plans in each program operate in a single county. In Medi-Cal, most of the other 40 percent are in health plans that operate in two to ten counties.Enrollment is split almost evenly across plans that operate in a single county, two to ten coun-ties, and statewide (dened as eleven or more counties). 27In contrast, almost 70 percent of Healthy Families enrollment is in plans that participate statewide. The greater multicountyand statewide representation is not surprising, given that Healthy Families operates a managedcare program in every county (unlike Medi-Cal), and the program model, administration, andrules do not vary by county (which is also different from Medi-Cal). Geographic distribution is important in California not only because the state is large but also because it is exceptionally diverse at the regional and county level in terms of population,urbanization, and health delivery infrastructure. To assess the geographic distribution of healthplans, we used Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) groupings. Single-county health planswere assigned to the relevant MSA. Health plans that serve two to ten counties were assignedto the MSA with the largest share of the plan's enrollment. Statewide health plans were notassigned to any MSA because of their range. In Medi-Cal, the Los Angeles-Riverside MSAaccounts for 34 percent of health plans and 44 percent of enrollees. San Francisco accounts for 28 percent of health plans but only 11 percent of enrollees. The San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose MSA accounts for 28 percent of health plans and 21 percent of enrollees. Statewidehealth plans are particularly relevant in Healthy Families, where they account for 30 percent ofhealth plans and 69 percent of enrollees.16 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteMedi-Cal plays a more important role than Healthy Families in total health plan enrollment. In Healthy Families, all but one health plan reported that the program accounts for less thanone quarter of total plan enrollment. This result was expected, given the shorter history andsmaller size of the program compared with Medi-Cal and other products. Consistent with thepublic program-dominant prole, 62 percent of Medi-Cal health plans reported at least three-quarters of total plan enrollment from Medi-Cal. 28 About two-fths of all surveyed health plans in Medi-Cal began participating in some form ofMedi-Cal managed care before the 1990s. Nearly all of the other health plans joined the man-aged care program in the mid-1990s, when the current (and more aggressive) incarnation ofthe managed care program was implemented. In contrast, all health plans in Healthy Familiesbegan participating after 1998, which was the year of the program's inception. Finally, because there is only a small number of health plans participating in either Medi-Cal or Healthy Families (but not both), the characteristics of these plans are not shown as distinctfrom those of health plans participating in both programs. In general, the ve Medi-Cal-onlyhealth plans look very much like their counterparts: four of the ve are public program-dominant, participate in one county, and joined the program in the mid-1990s. In addition,these ve health plans play a small role in the program, accounting for only 4 percent of allMedi-Cal managed care enrollment. In contrast, the four health plans that participate in onlythe Healthy Families Program represent 26 percent of Healthy Families enrollment. Three ofthese four health plans are commercial and participate statewide. In addition, two of theHealthy Families-only plans are EPOs, which is a looser form of managed care in whichenrollees must seek care within the network but can also self-refer all services. These are theonly two EPOs participating in either program. Approach to Analysis The analysis presented in this report is descriptive. Because all health plans were surveyed and response rates were very high, data were not weighted to account for sampling error or re-sponse bias. Characteristics of Medi-Cal and Healthy Families plans in California have impli-cations for the analysis. For this survey, 35 health plans were identied across the state that are participating in either one or both programs. Thirty-three health plans responded to the survey, with 29 in Medi-Caland 28 in Healthy Families. Although the sample frame essentially represents the universe ofhealth plans participating in these programs, it is inherently difcult to identify how healthplan characteristics influence response because of the limited number of organizations in-volved and the correlation among many of their characteristics. Most participating healthplans, for example, are public program-dominant, which means that the number of commer-cial health plans available for analysis was limited. In Appendix C, data are provided on howresponses vary by plan characteristics, but we discuss this variation only in a limited way in thetext. (Appendix C is available for download at www.medi-cal.org).Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 17The fact that enrollment is skewed across health plans in ways that vary with their character- istics means that the average health plan experience may not be the same as the health planexperience that is relevant to the average enrollee. To show both these perspectives, data arepresented in two ways: (1) as a percentage of health plans (where each plan has equal weight);and (2) with health plan answers weighted by the plan's Medi-Cal and/or Healthy Families en-rollment. Weighted estimates more accurately reflect the share of enrollees represented byhealth plans. The text focuses mainly on unweighted data to describe health plan experiences;however, experiences are highlighted when they differ from enrollment-weighted estimates. The fact that many health plans in both programs (and especially large ones) serve more than one county constrains the ability to present detailed data on how access varies by county. Instructuring the instrument, it was decided that asking multicounty health plans to report thesame information for each county they serve would be unduly burdensome. Instead, healthplans were asked to respond in general about their experience (particularly for closed-endeditems). Where geography was of particular concern, we asked health plans to describe in anopen-ended fashion whether and how experience varied across the state. These responses pro-vide a feel for geographical variation but not the detail that would otherwise be feasible if thehealth plans and counties or geographical areas were more closely aligned. Specic responsesare listed in Appendix D, which is available for download at www.medi-cal.org. Finally, the fact that most health plans participate in both Medi-Cal and Healthy Families means that the survey can illuminate differences by program but not distinguish variation forjoint participants versus single participants.18 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteIV. Building and Sustaining Physician Networks To provide access to contracted benets, managed care plans and look-alike organizations (county or other organizations that act in a plan capacity) need to develop and maintain anappropriate and adequate provider network. With respect to medical care, key issues involveselecting physicians, negotiating contracts and payment rates, and implementing and moni-toring program requirements. The exceptions to these responsibilities are the two FFS man-aged care plans. These two plans have each developed a physician network, but the physiciansare paid directly by the state on the Medi-Cal FFS schedule, and the plans are not responsiblefor the same level of monitoring. 29 In this section, survey ndings related to physician participation in participating health plansare presented. To gain insight into the current provider environment and the degree to whichthis environment is an obstacle to physician participation, health plans were asked about theirability to develop and sustain physician networks. The survey focused on specic types ofphysicians that are problematic, plans' relationship with physicians, and their ability to rene-gotiate contracts for each program. Challenges with Specialist Networks Health plans stated that they generally have not had problems developing or sustaining primary care networks (Table 2). More than three-quarters of plans (representing more than80 percent of enrollment) agree strongly or somewhat that it has been easy to develop and re-tain primary care providers, with only one plan strongly dissenting in either program (repre-senting 1 percent or less of enrollment). However, the story is not the same for specialist networks. Health plans have found it more difcult to secure and preserve specialist participation. Some 65 percent of Medi-Cal plans Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 1920 Medi-Cal Policy Instituteand 53 percent of Healthy Families plans disagree with the statement that it is easy to develop and retain specialists (Table 2). Among those who strongly disagree, there are large differencesbetween Medi-Cal and Healthy Families plans, but the differences are muted when responsesare adjusted for enrollment. In fact, when health plans were asked directly about whether it hasbeen a problem to sustain an adequate network of specialists overall, a majority said it has beena problem in both Medi-Cal (76 percent) and Healthy Families (62 percent). Health planswere more likely to report problems with specialists for Medi-Cal than for Healthy Families,although the difference probably reflects only a small number of the health plans. Health plans experiencing problems retaining specialists reported that the difculties stem from a shortage of specialists and/or an unwillingness on the part of specialists to contract withplans for the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs, primarily because of low paymentrates. A number of health plans cited physician perceptions of Medi-Cal patients as being lesscompliant and more difcult (including having more complicated needs), adding to special-ists' reluctance to participate in Medi-Cal. None of the Healthy Families plans mentioned pa-tient compliance as a factor related to difculty in retaining specialists.Table 2.

Although the preponderance of health plans(71 percent) participating in both programs perceive that, overall, physicians do not prefer oneprogram over the other, 17 percent said physicians are somewhat more willing to participate inHealthy Families, and 12 percent said physicians prefer Medi-Cal. Of the four health plans that indicated Healthy Families is the preferred program, two attrib- uted the preference to higher payment rates, and two to the negative perception of Medi-Calbeneciaries as noncompliant. One of these plans said, \"Even though physicians get paid morein Healthy Families, [the issue of] patient compliance in Medi-Cal is more important tophysicians than payment.\" Another plan added, \"Medi-Cal patients have greater noncom-pliance issues. They do what they want and miss appointments. They can be difcult to dealwith. And physicians don't want Medi-Cal members mixing with their commercial patients.\"One health plan said Medi-Cal is somewhat more attractive to physicians because of higherpayment, another said lack of copayments, and another said simply it is \"a known fact of life.\" Reasons for Problems with Specialists Health plans gave three reasons for problems with specialists: (1) supply, for example, lack of providers in the area and/or current providers are at capacity; (2) unwillingness of physiciansto contract because of low payment rates in comparison with other payers; and (3) unwilling-ness to contract because of perceived undesirability of Medi-Cal patients, in particular. Withregard to supply, health plans said that some specialists are just not available in certain areas,and even when they are, plans reported that these physicians choose to see higher payingpatients and patients that they perceive to be more compliant and otherwise desirable. Re-spondents said that, with a limited supply of certain types of physicians, they have been able to\"pick and choose who they want to see,\" and to \"demand higher prices and pick the lot of pa-tients they are willing to serve.\" Others added that these physicians see Medi-Cal patients as\"not compliant and hard to manage\" and as an unfavorable addition to the physician ofcemix. Plans perceive that some physicians still see Medi-Cal patients as \"those people.\" Whetherit is mostly the low payment rate levels or other desirability factors, one respondent said,\"Medi-Cal is at the bottom of the food chain.\" Types of Specialists Found to Be Most Problematic To learn which types of physicians are particularly problematic in terms of recruitment and re- tention, health plans were asked to rate the level of difculty faced in getting 11 types of spe-cialists to participate. At the end of the survey, plans were asked to volunteer additionalinformation about which specialists have been most difcult to recruit and retain. By far, orthopedists and neurologists were reported as most difcult to recruit and retain, fol- lowed by ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians, pediatric subspecialists, and dermatologists22 Medi-Cal Policy Institute(Figure 1).30When asked to identify the type of specialist most difcult to recruit, health plans overwhelmingly cited orthopedists. T welve health plans cited orthopedists as the most difcultto recruit and retain, and an additional three identied orthopedists along with neurologists,ENTs, or dermatologists. \"There is absolutely no way [orthopedists] will contract with us,\"one health plan lamented, and others agreed that \"orthopedists are the hardest because thereare a limited number of them,\" and, as a result, they \"are able to demand higher prices andpick the lot of patients they are willing to serve.\" Many health plans said orthopedists do notlike the reimbursement structure and were \"the least interested in serving low-income pa-tients.\" One plan noted that because of the rate differentials between Medi-Cal and HealthyFamilies and other lines of business, \"it becomes a signicant loss of revenue to orthopedists ifthey are not seeing another patient in order to see a Medi-Cal patient.\" T wo to three health plans each cited neurologists, ENTs, dermatologists, and pediatric subspe- cialists as the specialists most difcult to recruit and retain (or tied with orthopedists). Onehealth plan each said gastroenterologists and radiologists are the most difcult. Again, health Figure 1.

Note: Omitted in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 23plans said a big part of the issue is an undersupply and/or poor distribution of specialists, so physicians can choose to serve the more attractive patients, payers, and service lines. In re-sponse to the question of why these specialties are the most problematic, nearly all health plansresponded with a variation of the following comment: \"If there are limited providers of a par-ticular specialty in an area, these providers are swamped with other [better paying] insured pa-tients, so they will drop lower-paying patients, such as Medi-Cal [beneciaries].\" One healthplan said stated plainly that these specialists \"don't need us.\" A few health plans noted thatdermatologists are increasingly focusing on cosmetic procedures, which are more lucrative. With regard to specialist types, there are no notable differences in difculties according to pro- gram or plan type. In fact, commercial health plans have generally had the same problems withthese hard-to-get specialists across their products. As one commercial plan said, \"There is astatewide shortage of some specialists\u2014orthopedists, dermatologists, general surgeons, andgastroenterologists. This specialist shortage is not unique to our plan.\" Geographic Distribution of Problems Because California is a large state with diverse geographic and socioeconomic characteristics (for example, urban/rural and climate variation, economic structure, population distribution,income distribution, physician supply, and so on), health plans were asked if it has been par-ticularly difcult to build and maintain physician networks in certain areas, where the prob-lems are occurring, what the problems are, and why health plans believe these problems exist.Only seven health plans said that no specic locations have been particularly difcult. Al-though the seven health plans are not concentrated in a particular set of counties, most are inmore urban areas, and all but one serves one or two counties. We suspect that because of thesmall size and probably other idiosyncratic characteristics of these service areas, most of thesehealth plans did not feel as if they could differentiate within the service areas. For example, onehealth plan said, \"Our service area is seven miles square, so this question is moot.\" It is note-worthy that the responses of these seven plans do not indicate that they have had no problemswith physician participation. In contrast, 25 health plans (78 percent of the 32 that answered) said that they have had problems in at least part of their service areas. These health plans generally highlighted geo-graphic slices and pockets of their service areas as problematic. Particularly noteworthy (interms of the number of mentions) are the southern part of Orange County, southeast or west-ern San Fernando Valley, and northern San Diego County. However, these are areas with alarge number of plans, so an increased number of mentions is likely. Desert areas across thestate have also been problem spots. The health plans specically mentioned the \"high desert\"in Butte and Lake Counties and Imperial, Pomona, and Antelope Valleys. Unfortunately, thesmall number of plans, large proportion of single-county plans, and diversity of service areaslimited a more specic analysis of problem variation by area.24 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteSupply problems typically differ in urban versus rural areas. Reports of no physician availa- bility or few physicians in the area with whom to contract (sometimes overall, and more oftenfor particular specialties) were much more likely among health plans serving rural areas.Health plans lamented that physicians do not locate in rural areas, especially outside of pri-mary care. As one health plan said, \"In the remote [rural] areas, specialists just don't exist.ENT, neurology, orthopedists, and dermatology are the worst. Also, there aren't that manyPCPs (primary care physicians) overall either.\" Supply problems were also reported outside rural areas. Health plans pointed out that some regions and localities are much more attractive to physicians. As a result, even some suburbanor semiurban areas suffer from a lack of physicians. For example, one health plan said, \"Many[physicians] want to live in particular areas within Southern California, for example OrangeCounty, San Diego, and Los Angeles. Many like beach communities.\" Commenting on an-other location in Southern California, one health plan said, \"In Lompoc, for example, physi-cians don't want to go there because they want to make more money. It's . . . windy and foggy;it's not attractive.\" On the other hand, some attractive areas, such as the San Francisco BayArea, have a high cost of living that may deter physicians' decisions to locate there. Otherhealth plans noted problems with growing suburban areas. One plan said, \"We have problemsin the 'fringe areas' between urban and rural areas. Sometimes there just aren't doctors there.\"On this same note, another health plan said a few communities in its area have become moreattractive and the \"population is growing faster than services can keep up.\" In areas where supply does not meet demand, physicians have more power to be choosy about the contracts they'll accept. As noted, most health plans said that neurologists, orthopedists,ENTs, and dermatologists have been the most difcult to recruit and retain. There arecertainly other specialists that are less willing to provide services to Medi-Cal and HealthyFamilies beneciaries, although these specialists have not been reported to be quite as prob-lematic. However, as health plans pointed out, geography and its affects on supply is only onereason behind the unwillingness of some particular specialists to contract with health plans.Other factors include one or more of the following: public program stigma; availability ofother, better paying, and \"easier\" patients; and, for a few, aversion to managed care. As onehealth plan put it, problems reflect \"a combination of demographics, economics, and physi-cian attitudes [that are often grounded in] a culture of nonparticipation in managed care andlow-income programs.\" These other factors are discussed later in greater detail. Relationships with Physicians It was hypothesized prior to the survey that one reason health plans may have difculty sus- taining networks is that they do not develop close collaborative relationships with the physi-cians they depend on to see patients and deliver care. However, the plans surveyed did notperceive such problems. Only one health plan surveyed said its relationships with physiciansare adversarial, and this plan attributed the conflict primarily to low payment rates (Table 3).Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 25Within the Medi-Cal program, 57 percent of plans said relationships are strongly collaborative and 39 percent said they are somewhat collaborative. In Healthy Families\u2014a newer program\u201430 percent reported a strongly collaborative relationship and 39 percent a somewhat collabo-rative relationship. Health plans also reported that any changes in their relationships withphysicians have been positive. More than half characterized their relationships with physiciansas stable, and others said it is getting better. Health plans attributed their success to efforts over time to build supportive working relation- ships and create goodwill. Specically, health plans pointed to efforts to: involve physicians indecision making on quality and medical management issues (often through a committee struc-ture); streamline administrative requirements and provide administrative support; pay as fairlyas possible; make a good faith effort to negotiate; work collaboratively over the years; and de-velop long term relationships through health plans' commitment to \"stay in the market\" andserve Medi-Cal beneciaries. The fact that Medi-Cal managed care has a longer history maycontribute to the ostensibly greater success reported in building successful relationships withphysicians under this program than Healthy Families. The responses obviously reflect planperceptions, and physician perceptions may not necessarily be congruent. At the time of the survey, most health plans foresaw maintaining or improving their rela- tionships with physicians by continuing to work collaboratively with them. Of the two dis-senting health plans, one predicted its relationships would become worse because theadministrative burden would frustrate its commercial providers, who are inexperienced withthese public programs. The other health plan saw its relationships deteriorating in Medi-Cal asa result of proposed provider payment rate cuts related to the state budget. Although proposedTable 3.

While it did not emerge on this question, most health plans voluntarily commented on the state budget cuts later in the survey. They emphasized that their relationships withphysicians have certainly been threatened by these cuts, even though most of the health planswere developing strategies to minimize the \"pass through\" effects to physicians, at least for therst year. More were skeptical about their ability to cushion the blow beyond the very shortterm, and this was a paramount concern in maintaining relationships with physicians. In theend, the state budget for FY 2002-03 did not include the physician rate cuts, but they havebeen proposed again for the FY 2003-04 budget. Physician Retention To discover how well health plans feel they are retaining physicians, plans were asked about their experience with renegotiating contracts and physician turnover in the previous year. Ashighlight below, none experienced anything they viewed as out of the norm or particularlyalarming during the past year, although a few had some longer term concerns about physicianparticipation in the programs overall. Health plans' experience renegotiating contracts was relatively unremarkable in the year before the summer 2002 survey. More than 70 percent of health plans in both programs said contractnegotiation is not a problem (Figure 2). 31For the six health plans (29 percent) in Medi-Cal that experienced difculties, the issue was almost exclusively concerning low payment rates.These difculties affected about half of all Medi-Cal enrollees. In Healthy Families, the vehealth plans with problems (21 percent) were equally split between payment\u2014\"physicians al-ways want more money\"\u2014and inexperience with the program (for example, lack of knowledgeabout administrative requirements, especially with carve-outs\u2014such as CCS\u2014and negativeperceptions about beneciaries). However, these problems only affected 7 percent of HealthyFamilies enrollees. Only two health plans said their problems with renegotiations have been\"major,\" with the core issue being payment levels. Both health plans participate in Medi-Caland one in Healthy Families, and neither has signicant enrollment in either program. Health plans reported that physician turnover was in line with their expectations and previous experience. Physician turnover was low in most health plans. Of the 26 health plans that re-ported individual physician turnover rates, 58 percent had 3 percent or less turnover in thepast year; 15 percent had 4 to 7 percent turnover; 19 percent had 8 to 10 percent turnover;and 8 percent reported more than 10 percent turnover. 32The two health plans making up the last category said they have expected higher turnover because they are university-based planswith members cycling through. A total of six health plans reported that they lost big groups of ten or more physicians in the 2001-2002 year. Most said this was due to group dissolution. However, health plans seemedunconcerned because they said these physicians had either joined up with other participatingBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 27groups or signed individual contracts with the plan after the dissolution. In effect, health plans did not lose their participation. In addition, all six health plans reported that the number ofMedi-Cal and Healthy Families plan members affected by the change was less than 1 percent. Health plans were also asked about the main reasons for the loss of physicians\u2014individual and group. In response, plans indicated that their networks are fairly stable. The turnover reportedwas attributed primarily to natural attrition (or the result of death, retirement, or moving)followed by low payment rates. The payment issues were primarily focused on Medi-Cal rela-tive to commercial rates, but sometimes the issue was low payment rates and/or salaries relativeto the area's cost of living. Although health plans believe that these economic concerns areongoing issues, many are not too concerned because the physicians lost are often replaced, orthe networks are big enough that the losses are perceived to be on the margins. Interviews with health plans revealed serious concerns about the future of their physician net- works. As mentioned, most health plans were very concerned about the implications of statebudget cuts on sustaining physician networks. The FFS payment cuts directly affect those inthe traditional program. And, because these payments are part of the formula for payment tohealth plans, any cuts will affect physician participation in managed care. Health plan pay-ment would be reduced, as would the amount health plans can pay their network providers.Health plans were especially concerned about specialist participation because they perceivespecialists to be more sensitive to payment levels and there is more competition for specialtyservices. A few health plans reported already feeling that they were at the minimum paymentFigure 2.

Ultimately, state budget cuts could threaten health plans' abilityto maintain adequate networks and threaten their participation in the Medi-Cal and HealthyFamilies programs. While the state budget for FY 2002-03 did not implement provider pay-ment rate cuts, proposed cuts have resurfaced for the FY 2003-04 budget. 33Health plans' re- actions show that, despite the \"stability\" of the networks, provider payment rate reductions,should they occur, could destabilize participation fairly quickly. The other key concern reported was from health plans that are serving areas with physician supply problems. These plans were apprehensive about being able to replace physicians wholeave the area, and some health plans in high cost-of-living areas were concerned that phy-sicians will retire or move and not be replaced. Some health plans were involved in or wereexploring initiatives to help ensure physician availability through funding for clinics and othersubsidies. More detail on what health plans are doing is discussed later in this report.V. Physician Network Strategy and Access to Care Together, the structure of provider networks and the requirements set by the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs and health plans can have an important affect on enrollees' accessto physicians. To better understand these structures, health plans were asked about two keyareas: (1) health plan policies regarding PCPs and direct referrals to specialty care; and (2) net-work overlap across products, including the different roles of commercial and traditionalproviders, and any participation requirements. Finally, health plans were asked to assess if ac-cess has changed with the implementation of managed care, and data was requested to supporthealth plans' views. PCPs and Referrals for Specialty Care Research suggests that access to care is improved when individuals have a PCP or a \"medical home.\" 34One of the key reasons Medi-Cal turned to managed care more aggressively in the mid-1990s was to improve continuity of care by emphasizing primary care. Survey results indicate that, in Medi-Cal, almost all enrollees must choose a PCP (Table 4). Exceptions include a few health plans that operate under FFS managed care models with smallMedi-Cal enrollments. Health plans in Healthy Families also typically require enrollees tochoose a PCP . However, while 89 percent of health plans in Healthy Families require enrolleesto choose a PCP , only 72 percent of Healthy Families enrollees are in health plans that havethis requirement. The difference stems from the fact that Healthy Families includes several\"looser\" managed care models\u2014particularly exclusive provider plans, which have substantialenrollment. When a PCP is required, issues sometimes arise as to which physicians may serve in this ca- pacity. A narrow list of specialists allowed to serve as PCPs may encourage enrollees to choose Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 2930 Medi-Cal Policy Institutephysicians who have broad training consistent with this primary care role. For example, previ- ous studies have shown that most health plans allow general and family practitioners, generalinternists, obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs), and pediatricians to serve as PCPs. 35On the other hand, narrower denitions may not reflect enrollee preferences or historical patterns andmay preclude some enrollees, such as those with chronic conditions, from selecting physiciansmost skilled in their care. Health plans vary as to whether they allow other specialty physicians to serve as PCPs. In both the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs, arrangements are more likely for enrollees withspecial needs relative to the average enrollee (Table 4). In pediatrics, for example, twice asmany health plans allow pediatric subspecialists to serve as PCPs for enrollees with specialneeds versus any enrollee. Only 15 percent of Medi-Cal and 8 percent of Healthy Familiesenrollees are in health plans that allow any enrollee to have a pediatric subspecialist PCP; how-ever, roughly 44 percent of enrollees can do so if they have special needs. The same patternexists for internal medicine subspecialists, although the distinctions in policies for enrolleeswith special needs versus others are less dramatic on some measures. Survey results also show that health plans typically complemented physician care by drawing on the skills of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The state allows nonphysicianmedical practitioners, such as nurse practitioners, certied nurse midwives, or physician assis-tants to provide primary care under physician supervision for Medi-Cal participants. 36Some 46 percent of Medi-Cal health plans and 52 percent of Healthy Families plans reported theseproviders are allowed to be PCPs. Additional health plans did not feel comfortable saying thatthese practitioners were used as PCPs, but reported instead that they provided primary careunder the supervision of physicians to whom they are formally assigned. When these healthplans were counted, 61 percent in Medi-Cal and 68 percent in Healthy Families said that theyeither use nurse practitioners and physician assistants as PCPs or that they allow them to per-form the same role indirectly under a physician's supervision. The PCP gatekeeping function could create barriers to the appropriate use of specialty care, even though gatekeeping policies may be motivated by the desire to better coordinate care.About 90 percent of health plans participating in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families require theirPCPs to authorize some referrals to specialists, representing 97 percent and 71 percent ofenrollment, respectively. 37Again, the difference in the percentage of enrollees affected stems from the fact that several of the Healthy Families products with a large share of the enrollmenthave looser forms of managed care that don't require referrals. Health plans allow enrollees to self-refer for some services\u2014a policy that can minimize access barriers (Table 4). For example, nearly all Medi-Cal and Healthy Families enrollees are in plansthat allow for direct referral for eye care, but only 15 percent or less are allowed to direct referfor ENTs. 38Almost all health plans (and virtually all enrollees) said enrollees can self-refer for family planning, well woman care (almost all OB/GYN services are direct referral by stateregulation), and \"sensitive services,\" such as HIV testing. A few health plans also mentionedchiropractic and acupuncture services as self-referral services.Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 31Finally, health plans were asked if their PCP or referral policies varied geographically across their service areas, and plans reported no such variation. Network Overlap and Participation Policies There has been considerable debate and mixed ndings on which type of provider\u2014 commercial or traditional safety net\u2014most improves enrollee care and access.39Some argue that attracting commercial plan participation to Medicaid or SCHIP , in particular, will pro-vide greater access to physicians who may not be participating now in public programs or whoare doing so only on a limited basis. Indeed, such programs as Healthy Families in Californiaare specically structured to reflect commercial practice in part to reduce the stigma of publicprograms and potentially to attract commercial health plans to participate in serving enrolleescovered under public programs. The argument is that such participation will not only broadenthe base of providers available (improving access) but also result in quality improvementsTable 4.

Two Medi-Cal and one Healthy Families plans did not provide valid responses to this question. One to four plans did not provide valid responses to various subquestions. \u00a7Plans were asked to volunteer specialties or services for which they allow direct referral. The primary ones named were family planning, well woman care, and \"sensitive services,\" such as sexually transmitted disease or HIV testing.32 Medi-Cal Policy Instituteattributable to a large share of commercially insured individuals that may demand and expect more and thus raise or maintain the level of quality across the programs. However, not all agree with this perspective. Even those who do agree question whether it is of more than theoretical interest if public program enrollees live in different areas from thosewith commercial insurance. Some also believe that traditional providers are better equipped tomeet the needs of Medicaid enrollees, and potentially SCHIP enrollees as well (who tend tohave higher incomes and health proles more consistent with commercial practice). T radi-tional providers are believed to be more familiar with the needs and preferences of publicprogram beneciaries and, thus, better able to specialize in meeting their needs. Support fortraditional providers may also be viewed as important in maintaining support for the safetynet, which is available to serve those with no insurance at all. This latter philosophy is evidentin California's T wo-Plan Model, which explicitly protects traditional providers through thelocal initiative health plans. Survey results show only limited differences in the physician networks developed for Medi-Cal versus Healthy Families, with mixed results about how commercial plans' networks for thesepublic programs differ from those available to their commercial members. Health plans were asked how much overlap there is between their Medi-Cal and Healthy Families physician networks. Of the twenty-four health plans participating in both programs,nineteen reported that their physician networks are \"nearly identical\" or are \"virtually thesame\" for both programs; three health plans volunteered that there is a 90 percent overlap; andthe nal two reported an 80 percent overlap. The most common difference was the exclusionof adult-only practitioners, particularly specialists, for Healthy Families, which does not serveadults. For a few health plans, Medi-Cal networks were different from Healthy Familiesnetworks because the plan subcontracts with other plans to serve Medi-Cal members. Thesesubcontracting health plans participate in Healthy Families on their own. Thus, the physiciansavailable to participants of each program in the area may not differ, though they may be asso-ciated with different health plans. Only nine of the thirty-three plans in the survey are commercial health plans, meaning that Medi-Cal and Healthy Families make up less than 75 percent of their total enrollment. Threeof these nine reported that their physician networks are the same for commercial, Medi-Cal,and/or Healthy Families members. Of the remaining six health plans, four said that theirphysician networks are larger for commercial enrollees; one reported that its commercial andHealthy Families networks are the same because the state specically requires it to be, and thatthis network is larger than the Medi-Cal network; and the last plan did not provide answers tothese questions. Health plans with larger commercial networks said for the most part that the difference in physician network make-up stems from a choice by commercial providers to not participate inMedi-Cal or Healthy Families because of lower reimbursement or program hassle (for ex-ample, administration and carve-outs). Many physicians have told the health plans they \"justBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 33don't want to deal with it.\" One health plan in this group decided to have one large, university- based medical group that is part of its larger commercial network serve all its Medi-Cal mem-bers because it believed such an approach would be more cost-effective. Participation in public programs by physicians in the commercial network is primarily a deci- sion made by physicians. Only two health plans require their physicians to participate in anyparticular product as a condition of doing business: one is a staff model, and physicians auto-matically participate in all products; the other is the health plan that reported a state require-ment that Healthy Families and commercial networks be the same. T wenty-two health plans(69 percent of plans and about the same percentage of enrollees) allow their physicians to limitparticipation in the Medi-Cal or Healthy Families programs. 40The mechanism by which this occurs is predominantly by permitting physicians to set their own limit or cap on panel size.When these physicians reach their limit, the practice may be closed entirely to new membersor modied versions of this policy may be put in place (for example, policies limiting new en-rollees to existing patients of the provider). The Roles of Traditional and Commercial Providers Health plans appear to be split between having a strong preference (42 percent) and having no special preference (45 percent) for providers experienced in serving Medi-Cal beneciaries(Table 5). The remaining 12 percent of plans have a mild preference for traditional providers.Those with a strong preference have larger enrollments and include a larger share of Medi-Calenrollees than do those with no preference (66 percent versus 24 percent). Those health planswith a mild preference for traditional providers account for the remaining 10 percent ofenrollees. Plans with a strong preference for providers experienced in serving Medi-Cal beneciaries at- tributed their preferences to the fact that such providers: Know the population and are more sensitive to patients' needs, including being more culturally and linguistically sensitive; Know the program, its rules, and how to navigate the carve-outs, which facili- tates care giving and minimizes the need for training; Promote access because they are often located \"where the beneciaries are\"; and Are familiar to beneciaries, as the physicians that beneciaries are \"used to seeing\" and \"are comfortable with.\" In addition, many of these health plans reported that it is part of their mission or philosophy to support the safety net.34 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteFor some health plans, the absence of a preference appears to reflect a function of physician supply, rather than the stance of plans themselves. For instance, for six of the fteen healthplans (representing 6 percent of all enrollees) without a preference, the ability to be choosy is aluxury. These plans said that \"beggars can't be choosers,\" and that a health plan must \"takewhat it can get,\" which means anywilling provider, whether s/he is experienced with Medi-Cal beneciaries or not. These six health plans are all public program-dominant. Four of these fteen health plans (5 percent of all enrollees) with no preference attributed their stance to two factors, which are related to plan design or network strategy: (1) the health planshave an exclusive relationship with a particular network and, thus, use the physicians in thatnetwork; or (2) the health plans use existing networks developed for other products as the basefor the Medi-Cal and/or Healthy Families networks. These networks may include traditionalproviders, but the primary contracting strategy does not explicitly pursue them. The re-maining ve health plans (12 percent of all enrollees) did not clearly specify why they have nopreference for providers experienced in serving Medi-Cal beneciaries. Of the four health plans with a mild preference for providers experienced in serving Medi-Cal beneciaries, two said that it is part of their mission to support traditional providers. Theother two said they neither explicitly prefer traditional providers nor recruit specically byproduct. However, they said that they do need to attract enough providers to meet overallmembership needs, which includes Medi-Cal and Healthy Families members. Interestingly, commercial and public program-dominant health plans' views did not vary from those overall or from each other, although the larger public program-dominant health planshad less preference for traditional providers and the large commercial health plans had more.The large commercial health plans with a strong preference for using traditional providers re-emphasized these providers' experience with the program, citing their ability to meet the needsof members and to navigate program rules and requirements, notably the carve-outs, such asCCS. The public program-dominant health plans were more apt to have no preference: six ofthe eleven plans (accounting for about 40 percent of the enrollment in this category) said theirno-preference stance stems from the fact that they have to take any physician they can get. Theother ve plans were not clear about why they do not prefer traditional providers.Table 5. Preference for Using Traditional Providers All Plans Public Program-Dominant Commercial Percent of Share of Percent of Share of Percent of Share of Plans Enrollment Plans Enrollment Plans Enrollment Strong of Medi-Cal and Healthy Families Plans. Note: Breakouts are not shown by program because plans overwhelmingly use the same networks across programs and so differences are minimal.Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 35Impacts of Managed Care on Access to Care Theoretically, managed care plans are supposed to improve access for public program bene- ciaries by providing them access to more providers and more locations. Plans were asked iftheir current Medi-Cal and Healthy Families members receive care from the same or differentproviders than before the implementation of managed care. Because care delivery structuresand patterns of care can vary by county, health plans were asked to respond for the countywith the plan's largest program enrollment. In both the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families pro-grams, about half the plans said members receive care from the same sources, and the otherhalf reported different sources. (About one-third of health plans in each program said mem-bers receive care from mostly the same provider sources; one-sixth said sources are somewhatthe same; and roughly one-quarter reported somewhat and mostly different sources of care.) Those health plans that said care sources had changed pointed to a shift in care from clinics and emergency rooms to PCPs and private providers (although clinics and emergency roomsare still a major sources of care). Health plans said, \"[Members] have access to the privatephysicians, and so they choose them over the clinics.\" Plans also reported, \"There's a lot less use of the emergency room [now] than before. Now enrollees go to private physicians.\"Plans were enthusiastic about the shift from emergency rooms and reported having datashowing the changes in utilization: \"Our plan has monitored emergency room use, and it hasbeen cut in half\"; \"Our plan found that 40 percent of our Medi-Cal beneciaries sought carein our medical center emergency room before managed care\"; \"The emergency room usedropped 60 percent in the rst three months after the implementation of managed care\"; and\"Our emergency room use rates dropped 35 percent pre-live in 1996 and 1.5 years post-managed care implementation.\" All of these numbers are drawn directly from each healthplan's analysis. While health plans overall appeared to perceive no major differences between programs on how members accessed care before and after the implementation of managed care in theclosed-ended questions, a handful of health plans singled out Healthy Families in the open-ended questions as having experienced \"a greater change\" than Medi-Cal. The reason giventhat Healthy Families members \"were not receiving care before [the introduction of theHealthy Families Program] . . . they were uninsured.\" This alludes to the positiveimpact that health insurance has on access and use, rather than that of managed care per se(which is appropriate because Healthy Families was implemented as a managed care programfrom its inception). For both programs, health plans said managed care programs give bene-ciaries greater access to private practices because there is increased physician participation insome areas, and members realize that they can go to these physicians. Health plans said:\"While [private] physicians may have been available in the past, these enrollees did not thinkthey could access them\"; and \"We PCP , and enrollees canchoose from medical groups and not just feel like they have to go to the emergency room orclinics. They have more options.\"36 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteAside from their analysis of emergency room utilization, health plans were unable to cite other research or analysis (either by the health plan or by outside sources) related to changes inaccess. Some spoke of health plan tracking of performance measures, such as primary carevisits per 1,000 members and immunization rates, and others pointed to member surveys andfoundation research about physician participation. Despite the apparent lack of data, the ma-jority of health plans volunteered that access is better. Some health plans were condent in say-ing, \"I have no doubt access is better\"; \"I know it's better\"; and \"Access is better under managed care\u2014that's why the state went to mandatory managed care.\" Other comments were moretempered: \"I think access has improved and would be really surprised if it has not, especiallyfor primary care. Access isn't necessarily better for specialty care, though\"; \"I think that aMedi-Cal Policy Institute report found that access to specialists is better in some ways\"; and \"Iknow that doctors are available to more people, but I don't know if access is better.\"VI. Health Plans' Approaches to Problems and Future Concerns This section addresses what health plans have been doing to encourage network adequacy and access through measurement and monitoring and more direct interventions. These strategiesare important to understand because health plans typically have more current and detailedinformation on performance than that which is available externally. Well-targeted internalmonitoring by health plans can identify problems early and potentially resolve them beforethey grow or cause more damage. This section also covers health plans' biggest concerns re-garding access to physicians\u2014many of which have already been referenced in earlier sectionsof this report\u2014and what health plans said can be done to alleviate problems. Efforts to Ensure Network Adequacy and Access Health plans reported using a variety of mechanisms to ensure network adequacy and access to physicians, many of which are set in their contracts with the state. Generally, the state requiresparticipating health plans to maintain an adequate number and type of facilities and primarycare and specialist physicians to meet member needs. More specically, the state requireshealth plans to meet specied provider-to-member ratios in specic areas, as well as time anddistance standards for primary care physicians; to conduct member satisfaction surveys annu-ally; and to monitor and analyze grievances. 41 Health plans were asked the primary way that they know their physician networks are ade-quate. More than half of the health plans that answered (20 of the 32) said that they used geo-access mapping, which includes calculating physician to member ratios. Monitoring com-plaints and grievances was cited by ve health plans, although it clearly is an important mech-anism because another nine health plans volunteered it as a second mention. Among the rest Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 3738 Medi-Cal Policy Instituteof the health plans, three pointed to monitoring appointment waiting times, two cited refer- rals from the prior authorization/case management department, one reported conductingmember surveys, and another physician surveys. 42Obviously, such tools reflect health plans' perceptions of adequacy, and their reported use does not provide an evaluation of any plan'sactual network adequacy. This open-ended question was followed by asking health plans to go through a checklist of likely activities. The checklist (question E2 in the survey instrument, Appendix B) asked aboutthe use of stafng ratios, appointment waiting times, secret shopper programs, distancestandards, member surveys, complaints and grievances, and any additional activities. Virtuallyall of the health plans reported conducting the state-mandated monitoring noted above. Inaddition, 50 percent of health plans said they have a secret shopper program where health planstaff call and try to make an appointment to see how long it takes. T wo-thirds of health plansvolunteered that they are engaged in additional activities to monitor adequacy, including pro-vider surveys, member focus groups, and monitoring of physicians' panel capacity and closings. Addressing the Needs of Beneciaries To understand how serious potential problems of physician participation could be in affecting beneciary access, health plans were asked how difculties in developing and retaining spe-cialists affect care delivery and what is being done to address these issues. Health plans agreedthat problems with sufcient physician participation affect care in two ways: (1) by delayingcare; and (2) by requiring greater travel distances to receive care. When shortages exist in thenetwork, health plans said that members either have to wait for appointments or the planhelps arrange for care. Among health plans that said members often have trouble with trans-portation, about half viewed travel-related issues as important, citing problems with availabil-ity, affordability, and convenience\u2014especially in nonurban settings. Other health plans didnot perceive travel to be as much of an obstacle because the health plan or other communityresources provide transportation assistance. Lesser concerns expressed by health plans werethat constrained networks limit members' choice of provider and that arranging for care cre-ates substantial administrative burdens for the health plan. To address the primary issues related to delays in care and travel to care, health plans reported using a variety of strategies. First, many health plans said they \"intervene to get the patientseen\" by helping to identify providers and appointments. Health plans said, \"Our [staff] worksvery hard to get patients into care, looking across [all our providers] to just get them the carethey need in a timely way\"; and \"[Our staff] makes a lot of phone calls begging for appoint-ments.\" Along these lines, at least four health plans have been helping members with transpor-tation issues by providing some transportation directly, by providing transportation subsidies,or by helping members connect with community resources. One health plan told us that itsprovider directory helps facilitate access by noting the bus stop(s) closest to each physician.Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 39Health plans also reported subsidizing specialist positions or buying blocks of physician time, mostly at clinics. Eight public program-dominant health plans with strong county ties\u2014including those under the COHS, FFSMC, or T wo-Plan (local initiative) models\u2014were pro-viding funding to recruit and support specialist positions at clinics. T wo of these plans havepurchased blocks of time for specialists to see their members, and another was trying toarrange for specialists to visit specic clinics on a regular basis to provide care in return for pay-ment, with the health plan taking care of all the administrative details. These strategies aretargeted at specialists and subspecialists, particularly orthopedists, neurologists, ENTs, derma-tologists, and gastroenterologists. These health plans reported working closely with the publichealth departments and county hospitals and clinics to develop and implement an effectivestrategy, drawing on their ties to the county infrastructure. Five additional health plans specif-ically mentioned that they have special reimbursement arrangements involving higher rates forparticularly hard-to-get specialists. (In the course of the survey, many more health plans saidthey pay higher rates to some hard-to-get specialists, most often orthopedists.) These effortsrepresent a broader strategy cited by many plans to educate and recruit physicians. Finally, onehealth plan was helping provide care to its rural members through a telemedicine initiative. Among tactics they are considering for the future, two health plans with IPA and group providers were considering mechanisms to improve members' access to hard-to-get specialistsby creating what one plan termed a \"super panel\" that all members would have access to, re-gardless of what IPA they are in. The rationale is that individual IPAs would not have to worryabout recruiting particular specialists if they could access this planwide super panel. Theoreti-cally, the super panel would be attractive for these hard-to-get specialists because they wouldbe guaranteed a certain volume. A third health plan reported implementation of a related pro-gram, contracting for certain special services\u2014such as open-heart surgery\u2014at the plan level toserve members of all the IPAs. The health plan said, \"This has minimized the issues that usedto come up ve to ten years ago [with accessing specialized services].\" Another health planproposed providing loans to physicians to help physicians locate in their county, and addi-tional health plans said they were considering ways to help members with transportation. Concerns for the Future At the conclusion of the interviews, health plans were asked to speak about their biggest con- cern with regard to access and what it would take to address this concern. Health plans'responses were relatively consistent. Specically, health plans had two top concerns: (1) theimpact of the proposed state budget cuts in provider reimbursement rates on access to phy-sicians overall; and (2) both related to and separate from the proposed cuts, access to spe-cialists. T wenty-three of the thirty-three health plans mentioned at least one of these issues,and several went out of their way to mention the other, even though they had only been askedto name a single concern. State budget cuts were the rst response for thirteen health plans,and problems with specialists was the rst response for nine health plans; the remaining ve40 Medi-Cal Policy Institutehealth plans that brought up these issues believe they are important but mentioned them after other issues. Survey interviews were conducted concurrent with the 2002 debate over the state budget, and health plans' concerns about the potential adverse effects of pending changes in payment rates,and the importance of sufcient payment, dominated many of the interviews. Many healthplans were worried that payment reductions would \"discourage physicians from serving Medi-Cal patients\" by \"making this population a lot less attractive than others.\" Health plans werealso concerned that specialists would stop participating altogether, and that even primary caremight not be immune. One health plan said, \"Cuts in rates could seriously jeopardize primarycare access for physicians whose practices are predominantly Medi-Cal.\" Another health plannoted, \"There eventually comes a point where physicians say that they are not being paidenough and will leave. It won't be next year, but how long can this go on?\" To that effect, a ma-jority of health plans were developing strategies to manage the cuts, but most did not foresee a scenario that would allow their plan to absorb any of the decreases for more than one year.While the state did not enact the discussed payment reductions for FY 2002-03, the January2003 projections for the state's budget shortfall have caused this proposal to be reintroducedfor FY 2003-04. Health plans' fears about this issue are thus still relevant. The second big concern reported by health plans was access to specialty care (also identied by health plans earlier in the survey). Health plans reiterated their problems with specic special-ties, such as orthopedics, and their concern with \"making sure that members get access tothose services\" because they feel the issues with these specialties \"are not easily resolved.\" Therewas somewhat less urgency in health plans' discussion of this issue, perhaps because it is moreof an ongoing problem. Also, as health plans pointed out, much of the problem with specialistavailability is attributed to overall shortages and distributional problems that are out of their control. When asked what could be done to successfully address problems with physician participation and access, health plans focused primarily on nancial issues. For example, one health plansaid, \"Money: We need more money [from the state because], with physicians, money is thebiggest driving thing.\" Other health plans appeared to agree. T wenty-one of the thirty-threehealth plans responded to this open-ended question by saying increasing payment to providersis the single most important factor in maintaining and improving access. One health plancommented, \"Patients with the gold standard insurance can be just as cantankerous, noncom-pliant, and have as many problems as Medi-Cal patients\u2014but physicians will put up with itbecause they get paid for it.\" While most plans agreed that payment currently dwarfs otherissues, few thought it was the only thing that is important to physicians. The second most popular response to this open-ended question was related to streamlining administration and reducing hassle for physicians: six health plans mentioned this issue im-mediately, and another eight mentioned it somewhere in their responses. Health plans dis-cussed the number of requirements, some of which are not required by any other payers; theBuilding and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 41awkwardness of complying with many of the regulations; the burden of completing the mul- tiple and reportedly duplicative required forms; and problems associated with timely paymentto physicians for those services that are carved out to other programs (and paid directly by thestate). One health plan said, \"[T]he state is genuinely concerned about care for Medi-Cal andHealthy Families members, so they want to write all their wishes and dreams into regulation.But, it's hard because these programs are separate and apart [for example, carve-outs], and theservices don't all t together.\" Most health plans echoed this sentiment and said that a lot ofphysicians' confusion and frustration stems from the specialized requirements and processesfor all of Medi-Cal's programs. One health plan was particularly vehement, saying, \"Medi-Calis the only program that overregulates, and it goes from the plans onto the physicians. Medi-Cal is the only program that requires facility site reviews. Plus, all the forms physicians have touse . . . and translation on demand. Where is the money [to support these requirements]?Medi-Cal is paternalistic when we should be on our knees being grateful that these physicianswill see these individuals for such a low payment rate. Right now, [our plan has] physiciansthreatening to leave over the requirement that they must hire an outside contractor to calibrateand certify their scales. No one has left yet, but [we] worry about what is the breaking point?Once they leave, it's really hard to get physicians back into the program.\" Because the surveyonly included health plans, the degree of flexibility or discretion health plans have to change orreduce administrative requirements is unclear. Other health plan suggestions addressed underlying physician supply and issues of poor distri- bution, such as efforts to encourage medical students to pursue understaffed specialties and tolocate in underserved areas. Some specic suggestions included subsidizing housing, puttingCCS back into health plan capitation, and nding ways to increase the volume to specialists.Generally, however, health plans acknowledged the supply issue is a system issue that is biggerthan what they can affect in any meaningful way. A few health plans also mentioned it wouldbe helpful to further dismantle program stigmas. Health plans gave few specics on how thismight be done, but a handful mentioned that delinking Healthy Families with Medi-Cal forpublic awareness campaigns would be helpful so negative perceptions of Medi-Cal would notspillover onto the Healthy Families Program.42 Medi-Cal Policy InstituteVII. Conclusion Is Physician Participation an Issue in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families? Survey ndings present a mixed picture. On the one hand, it appears that it has been relatively easy for most participating health plans to attract and retain primary care physicians. Further,while turnover exists, it has been relatively low in most health plans. Even when it was high,health plans typically reported that physicians terminating contracts remained available topatients, either because they already were in other health plans or because they negotiated anindividual contract with the plan to replace a lost group contract. However, specialist partici-pation is a more problematic issue. Problems with orthopedists and neurologists are pervasive,and health plans have also had substantial difculty with ENTs, dermatologists, and pediatricsubspecialists. According to the surveyed health plans, these problems stem from two key factors: (1) under- supply; and (2) an unwillingness to participate. Undersupply occurs because there are notenough physicians in some areas and because shortages appear to exist in some specialties\u2014atleast in some areas. Poor geographic distribution particularly affects rural and less desirable (inphysicians' minds) urban and suburban locations. Yet, the undersupply issues have not beenspecic to the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs. As one health plan said: \"The lack ofphysicians is an 'everybody problem'\u2014not just our plan's or Medi-Cal's. The cost of living ishigh, and it's a problem for physicians to bring in sufcient revenue.\" Undersupply issues haveaffected both public plans: \"[For us,] it's not thatthe physicians are recalcitrant, it's that there aren't any providers at all.\" Health plans reported that physicians' negative perceptions about the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs and their participants\u2014more so for Medi-Cal than Healthy Families\u2014affects their willingness to participate. These sentiments do not appear to be geographically Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 4344 Medi-Cal Policy Institutespecic, but rather a function of what is perceived to be a combination of low payment rates, more hassle (as compared with other lines of business), and the belief that these beneciariesare noncompliant. Health plans have experienced problems in both Medi-Cal and Healthy Families, although problems have been a bit more extensive in the Medi-Cal program. Similarity in problemsacross programs probably reflects the substantial overlap in health plans and physician net-works among health plans participating in the two programs. In both programs, a large ma-jority of participating health plans depended heavily on public programs for most of theirenrollees. What Can Health Plans Do to Improve Participation? Health plans identied a number of factors and mechanisms influencing physician partici- pation, including supply and distribution, level of payment rates, administrative burden andhassle, lack of physician understanding of the programs, and problems (real or perceived) withpatient compliance. Health plans can affect some of these factors more than others. Supply, for example, is largely a system variable that the programs can influence only to a limited extent. It is an issue that is bigger than the health plans, Medi-Cal, or the HealthyFamilies Program. Health plans discussed what they have been doing to attract or maintainphysician participation in particular locations\u2014for example, by subsidizing recruitment costsand funding slots at clinics or hospitals. Other health plans have been offering access inundersupplied locations by hiring specialists to come to certain areas for half of a work dayeach week, and by providing beneciaries with transportation directly or through subsidies.Another health plan has been involved in a telemedicine initiative to provide access to exper-tise in rural areas. And one health plan was exploring options to help physicians with loans forhousing in areas with a high cost of living. However, these efforts deal primarily with distribu-tional problems, rather than underlying supply problems, which need to be addressed at ahigher level. Health plans have somewhat more flexibility with payment rates. Plans were found to have the ability to pay certain types of physicians more to attract them to the program, and many havedone so for certain hard-to-get specialists. Other health plans have subsidized salaried posi-tions at clinics or hospitals, or they have purchased blocks of physicians' time to ensure access.And some have explored ways to ensure enough patient volume to make it economicallyworthwhile for hard-to-get specialists to participate. Many health plans said that they wereactively strategizing about ways to shield physician payment rates from the expected state bud-get cuts for at least the rst year. This is being done because health plans believe payment ratesare very important to their ability to sustain physician participation, as is maintaining good re-lationships with the physicians. However, health plans' ability to increase payment rates is ultimately constrained by state capitation rates, and by their ability to cross-subsidize the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families pro-Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 45grams or to extract other savings from administration and care delivery and management. The opportunity to cross-subsidize is limited because many of these health plans are publicprogram-dominant. Opportunities to nd savings from administrative efciency and caremanagement exist but are limited, the latter, in particular, by enrollment turnover. Administrative burden is also a deterrent to physician participation. Yet, while the burdens are mainly a function of state requirements, health plans do have some ability to help reduce ad-ministrative hassle and facilitate compliance. While the state determines the number and typeof requirements that health plans and providers must meet, health plans may attempt to maketheir processes as simple as possible to encourage increased physician participation in the plannetwork. Survey results show that some health plans are making such attempts. For example,some health plans reported the current or planned use of electronic billing. In a more extremecase, one health plan has offered to be responsible for all administrative duties for physicianswho agree to visit specic understaffed clinics. To help reduce frustration, health plans wereeducating physicians and their ofces about how the Medi-Cal and Healthy Families pro-grams work and were trying to help them navigate the system. Health plans noted that this isespecially important for physicians who have not traditionally served Medi-Cal and HealthyFamilies members and those who are unfamiliar with the programs and the members. Still,health plans said they are constrained by the state-determined requirements. All of these initiatives are part of health plans' efforts to increase participation by building good working relationships with physicians. In addition to those efforts already mentioned,health plans spoke about their attempts to involve physicians in decision making on qualityand medical management issues (often through a committee structure); to show commitmentto staying in the market (and with Medi-Cal); and to make a good faith effort to negotiate andwork collaboratively with physicians over time. Health plans' focus on sustaining participationis important because, as one health plan said, \"Once they leave, it's really hard to get physi-cians and groups back into the program.\" Finally, health plans can do some work to address the real and perceived patient noncom- pliance that physicians nd unattractive. Again, some health plans have been purchasingblocks of appointments, which guarantees payment even if patients don't show up. Otherplans have been helping with transportation issues, which should help members avoid missingappointments. Neither of these efforts attempts to change members' behavior in complyingwith treatment; nor do the efforts necessarily addresses some physicians' preferences to nothave Medi-Cal and/or Healthy Families beneciaries mix with their commercial patients inthe waiting room. While all health plans provide some member education, enrollmentturnover makes long-term initiatives or incentive programs inefcient. Still, one health planmentioned that it is doing member education about complying with treatment. Health plans are experimenting with a variety of approaches to sustain physician networks and program participation, but they cannot solve these issues on their own. The state plays acrucial role in enabling and facilitating physician participation by controlling payment tohealth plans (who then pay physicians) and in setting the regulations and rules that plans 46 Medi-Cal Policy Instituteand providers must meet. The state government is at least an equally important actor in guaranteeing access. Which Issues Are Likely to Require Broader Solutions? On balance, the survey ndings suggest moderate problems with health plan physician net- works in Medi-Cal managed care and Healthy Families. Yet, ndings also signify considerablefear among participating health plans that these problems will grow in the future, especially ifbudgets remain constrained and cuts are made to physician payment rates. Because Califor-nia's budget crisis is severe and ongoing, health plans' concerns are likely to be even strongernow than when the study was conducted. Policymakers facing difcult decisions may want toconsider how cutbacks influence managed care\u2014not just today but in the future. One healthplan said that policymakers must consider that many health plans have worked hard to getphysicians to participate and build good relationships with them, and the budget cuts runcounter to the desired message, \"We want you to participate.\" Toward that end, the California government plays an important role in encouraging provider participation. Both the federal and state governments can affect physician supply and helpwith distribution\u2014for example, by providing incentives for physicians to practice in under-served areas or by supporting telemedicine initiatives. The state, in particular, is responsible forensuring equitable payment to health plans and for following good business practices\u2014including assurance for reasonable requirements\u2014that encourage and protect adequate net-works and access to physicians. With the increased complexity added by separate programs forcarved-out services, the state must remain aware of how administrative rules and regulations ttogether so that physicians can navigate the system. Although the state establishes rules toensure access and protect members, it may otherwise be discouraging physicians from partici-pating. Therefore, the state should look for ways to simplify paperwork and eliminate dupli-cate requirements. In addition, assuming that payment and administrative requirementsaddress some threshold of reasonableness, the question of whether physicians should beencouraged to do their share of care for the underserved is an issue that could be debated. The state (and even the federal government) also has a role in marketing publicly funded health programs and educating physicians about how the programs work to minimize frus-tration, confusion, and negative perceptions of the programs and their beneciaries. Whileeducation of members can be challenging, it is essential to teach members how the programswork and the importance of complying with treatment. Finally, maintaining a good dialogue and continued communication among the state, health plans, and providers about common and distinct concerns as policy evolves is likely to be im-portant in retaining as much goodwill and participation as possible. Each stakeholder plays animportant role in assuring access to care.Appendices A. Health Plans Participating in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families B. Survey InstrumentC. Data Tables*D.

Fee-for-service refers to the traditional method of paying health care providers for a particular service at a rate established by the Medi-Cal program. Under a fee-for-service system, beneciaries can see any providerparticipating in the Medi-Cal program. Managed care refers to a method of delivering and nancing carethat seeks to control costs by coordinating an individual's health care. Managed care plans typically receive aprepaid rate for each member enrolled in the plan. (Medi-Cal Policy Institute. Understanding Medi-Cal: The Basics .

Orange County's arrangements are complicated: CalOptima not only contracts with HMO plans but also with physician hospital consortia. Three of the eight PHCs are included in the sample. The ve PHCs thatwere not included are small, accounting for 16 percent of Medi-Cal and Healthy Families enrollment. 24. Medi-Cal Policy Institute. Medi-Cal County Data Book . Oakland, CA: January 2002. 25. See www.healthyfamilies.ca.gov.26. When a plan has a subcontractor, the enrollment is divided between the primary plan and subcontractors so that each plan's weight in the weighted analysis is proportionate to its total enrollment. 27. San Bernardino and Riverside Counties operate as one T wo-Plan Model under Medi-Cal. As a result, for analytic purposes San Bernardino and Riverside are counted as one county for Medi-Cal. This only affectsthe classication of one plan, which is counted as a single-county plan rather than 2 to 10 county plan. 28. The discrepancy from the public program-dominant gure and the percent of total plan enrollment for both programs is that public program-dominant is dened to include both Medi-Cal and SCHIPenrollment. With the combined enrollment, more plans are public program-dominant than by individualprogram. 29. The FFS managed care plans did not answer questions about renegotiating contracts, but they did respond to questions about specialist networks because, even though neither plan includes many specialists, both dointerface with them. 30. Seventy-seven percent of plans volunteered additional specialist types that were very hard to get. Plans most often mentioned pediatric subspecialists (primarily neurologists, but also gastroenterologists, allergists, andophthalmologists) rheumatologists, neurosurgeons, general surgeons,plastic surgeons, and radiologists. Other specialists that were reported only by one plan each were:endocrinologists, gynecologists for the developmentally disabled, oncologists, cardiologist subspecialties,surgical urology and transplant), pathologists, physicians, urologists,and podiatrists.Building and Sustaining Physician Networks in Medi-Cal Managed Care and Healthy Families 6331. Some plans do not renegotiate contracts with physicians each year. Some, for example, have evergreen contracts with no end date. The contract remains valid as long as the physician agrees to each year's newpayment rate. Only plans that renegotiated contracts in the past year were asked the two questions aboutrenegotiation. This includes 21 health plans for Medi-Cal and 24 plans for Healthy Families. 32. When plan answers straddled more than one category, the answer was counted in the highest applicable category (for example, an answer of 10 percent or less was counted in 8 percent to 10 percent). 33.

In plans where provider groups or independent practice associations (IPAs) accept full responsibility and set their own referral policies, they were asked to answer the questions about referrals for the dominantpractice. 38. During development of the survey, concerns were raised about access to eye care and ENTs, and so plans were specically asked about members' ability to direct-refer. 39.
