Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. Verdict: Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the rst sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identi ed. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benet used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents. Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months. When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-in flammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a signicant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As an herbal medicine, Echinacea has been the subject of signicant researchover the past century, particularly with respect to its role in the treatment and prevention of respiratory illnesses. It is one of the most popular natural health products purchased worldwide, with the majority of commercially available products containing E. purpurea and/or E. angustifolia [1]. Many naturopathic doctors recommend Echinacea supplements for immune support. A wide range of reports have described its immuno-modulatory proper- ties including macrophage activation and effects on cytokine expression. Because signicant effects on cytokine levels have been observed in response to Echinacea use, there is a theoretical* Corresponding author at: Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Aucoin et al. / Advances in Integrative Medicine 7 (2020) 203- 217 209concern about its contribution to cytokine storm (also known as cytokine release syndrome) (1). Cytokine storm is a poorly understood phenomenon involving excessive, rapid release of pro-in flammatory cytokines [2]. In COVID-19, cytokine storm can lead to ARDS which carries a 40 % mortality rate [3]. Cytokines associated with other cytokines, such as IL-10, have established anti- inflammatory effects and a role in downregulating excessive immune activity [2]. In COVID-19 speci cally, cytokine storm is a signicant factor in driving a more severe clinical course with patients requiring Intensive Care Unit admission showing higher levels of cytokines TNF and IL-6 [3]. 2. Search strategy 2.1. Research questions 1) What is the role of Echinacea in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections? 2) Is there any evidence suggesting that Echinacea supplementa- tion could increase the risk of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients based on the changes in cytokine levels observed in human clinical trials? 2.2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria 1) Studies were included if they reported human prospective intervention studies sampling adults (aged 18 and over), and assessed the effect of Echinacea supplementation on the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections. Studies including pediatric populations were excluded. 2) Studies were included if they reported human prospective studies sampling adults, and assessed the effect of Echinacea supplementation on levels of cytokines which have been identi ed as playing a role in cytokine storm (interferons, interleukins, chemokines, colony-stimulating factors, tumor necrosis factors) or the incidence of cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome. 2.3.

Three additional studies were identi ed through a bibliography search. A total of 17 studies underwent data extraction (Table 1). Ten studies were conducted in the World Health Organization (WHO) region of the Americas, with ve in the European region, one in the Western Pacic region and one in the South-East Asia region. All 17 studies were double-blind, placebo-controlled, random- ized clinical trials. One study had additional arms using open-label Echinacea and no treatment [4] and several studies had multiple arms comparing different Echinacea species, commercial formulas or doses [5-8].

Six studies assessed the impact on prevention: four in normal daily life (duration 6-16 weeks), one in response to a strenuous exercise challenge (duration 4 weeks) (9) and one in response to long- distance air travel (duration 4 weeks) (10). Two studies assessed the impact of Echinacea 7 days before and 5-7 days after a viral challenge [8,11]. Nine studies assessed the use of Echinacea for 5- 14 days in the treatment of a new onset respiratory tract infection, one in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were administered antibiotics concurrently and the remaining were conducted in healthy adults [5]. In all 17 studies, participants were located in the community (i.e. not in-patient settings). In total, the 17 studies included 3363 participants with a mean sample size of 224 participants (SD = 229, range: 32-755). Eleven studies used intervention formulas containing E. purpurea , two used E. angustifolia , four used a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia, and one used E. pallidae radix. Echinacea dose and method of extraction across all of the included studies were quite variable. Studies used different parts of the herb, including root, whole plant and aerial parts, as well as different methods of preparation. Echinacea interventions were delivered in the form of pressed juice, hydroalcohol extracts, capsules of dry herb and infusions. The lowest dose used was 100 mg of herb [12] while other studies used as much as 10.2 g per day in capsules on the rst day of treatment [4]. Five studies reported using formulas that were standardized to include a speci c amount of active constituent [6,12-14]. The studies assessed for ARI, viral respiratory infections or the common cold. The two studies that used a viral challenge administered rhinovirus 39 and monitored for the common cold [8,11]. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 assessment tool was used to evaluate the included studies. Of the six studies assessing prevention, four were rated low risk of bias [7,10,13,15] while two were rated high risk [9,16]. Among the two studies testing prevention and treatment in response to a viral challenge, one was rated high risk of bias [11] and one low risk of bias [8]. Among the nine studies assessing treatment of new onset infections, four were rated low [4,14,17,18], four rated high [5,6,19,20] and one was rated as having some concerns [12]. Reasons for a high risk of bias included per-protocol analysis [6,16], lack of description of dropouts [9], incomplete reporting of data [5,19], and lack of baseline data comparing the treatment groups [20]. One study terminated the study before recruiting the sample size needed todetect signicance based on a power calculation completed midway through the study [11]. These judgments should be taken into consideration when interpreting the ndings of this review. 3.2. Cytokine search The search identi ed 100 results, including 26 duplicates. 74 citations were screened. After title and abstract reviews, 18 citations remained and 56 citations were excluded as these did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full-text of the remaining 18 articles were assessed for eligibility and six were excluded (protocol only n = 1, incorrect outcome n = 2, duplicate data from included publication n = 1, unable to locate full text n = 1). A total of 12 studies underwent data extraction (Table 2). Of these, ve included healthy participants who consumed oral doses of Echinacea before blood levels of cytokines were measured [21-25]. Three studies included participants with respiratory tract infections [4,5,8] and four included healthy participants whose ex vivo blood samples were stimulated and immune response observed [26,27,28,29]. The studies assessed cytokines including of ndings 3.3.1. Clinical efcacy The six studies that administered Echinacea to healthy participants for two to four months and assessed prevention of naturally acquired upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), measured the frequency and/or duration of infections [7,9,10,13,15,16]. Five of these studies assessed infection frequency and of these, two reported a statistically signicant reduction [10,13]. Three studies assessed duration of illness and of these, one reported a statistically signicant decrease [9]. In the two studies that provided Echinacea supplementation before and after study-administered viral challenge, one reported no difference in infection frequency or severity compared to placebo [8]. The nine studies assessing the use of Echinacea at the onset of a URTI measured infection duration and symptom severity [4-6,12,14,17-20]. All studies assessed for impact on symptom severity and ve reported statistically signicant reductions in symptom severity [4,6,14,19,20]. A sixth study, that included participants with COPD experiencing an acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, found a reduction in severity in response to Table 3 Number of studies reporting increased or decreased levels of cytokines following Echinacea use.

Seven of the studies using Echinacea at URTI symptom onset assessed the duration of symptoms and ve reported a statistically signicant reduction in duration compared to participants receiving placebo [4,14,18-20]. With respect to risk of bias, of the ten studies that reported a positive outcome, ve were rated as high risk of bias [5,6,9,19,20] and ve were rated as low risk of bias [4,10,13,14,18]. Among the 13 studies that reported intervention dose with an equivalent dose of dry herb (or a liquid extraction and extraction strength), the mean dose was calculated. In cases where a range or variable doses were given, the highest doses was selected. The mean dose used in studies reporting bene t was 7.3 g per day (SD 6.4) and the mean dose used in studies that failed to detect bene t was 1.7 g per day (SD 2.1). The studies reporting bene t used E. purpurea (n = 6) or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia (n = 3) or E. pallidae radix (n = 1). Of the ve studies using extracts with a standardized level of active constituents, four reported benet. These active constituents included dodecatetraenoic acid, isobutylamide, Cytokine search Table 3 presents the number of studies showing statistically signicant increases or decreases in different pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supple- mentation in 12 clinical trials. None of the clinical trials included in this review reported occurrence of cytokine storm or other immune or inflammatory disturbance which could be attributed to the Echinacea intervention. While seven studies did not report adverse events, the remainder reported few adverse effects, in most cases similar to the control group. One reported a serious reaction involving generalized erythema which resolved with anti-histamine treat- ment [5] and mild adverse events of which insomnia was the most common. Another reported primarily gastro-intestinal side effects [8] and another reported one case of anxiety and nervousness and a recurrence of bilateral arthritis symptoms which the patient had previously experienced [22]. 3.4. Clinical signi cance Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of ARI and the common cold, particularly when administered at the rst sign of infection; however, no studies have been identi ed which use Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19. When taken at the onset of symptoms, Echinacea may decrease the severity or duration of ARI. Because the vast majority of studies involved participants who were free from serious or chronic illness, and without known issues related to immune function, it is not possible to infer what the role of Echinacea spp. could be in those at highest risk of COVID-19. With respect to the impact of Echinacea on cytokine levels, the majority of evidence suggests a decrease in levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines associated with cytokine storm. While the potential for Echinacea to provide a clinical therapeutic bene t is speculative, animal studies using pharmaceuticals that decrease production of IL-1 , IL-6 and TNF cytokines have increased survival of infected with severe influenza [2], and SARS-CoV [3]. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, is being studied in the treatment of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with elevated IL-6 levels [3]. Research of the use of Echinacea in cytokine storm may be warranted.Disclaimer This article should not replace individual clinical judgment.
