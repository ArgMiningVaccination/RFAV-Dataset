The poll found 27% of parents of children under 12 and 25% of parents of older children say they will not get their children vaccinated. Their reasons include wanting to wait for more research on vaccines' safety and effectiveness in children, not thinking Covid-19 is serious enough in children to warrant vaccination and general anti-vaccine sentiment. A further 11% of parents of children under 12 and 12% of parents of children 12 and up say they will only have their children receive one of the two recommended doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. One vaccine dose has been shown to be far less effective against the [Delta variant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/06/14/delta-variant-fueling-uk-covid-surge-could-become-dominant-us-strain-here-are-the-places-most-at-risk/?sh=61e555744e31) first identified in India\u2014which could soon become the dominant strain in the U.S.\u2014with Public Health England [reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/15/the-covid-delta-variant-how-effective-are-the-vaccines) one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provides only 36% protection against symptomatic disease. A majority of parents said they are very or somewhat strict about having their children social distance in public spaces regardless of whether it's required, but the fact most statewide mask mandates have now been [dropped](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/05/24/new-jersey-one-of-the-last-states-with-a-mask-mandate---drops-it/) does not stop them from bringing their children to public places or activities\u2014though most parents would only feel comfortable doing so if their child wore a mask. Big Number 26%. That's the percentage of Americans ages 12-15 who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, [according](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with 40% of 16- to 17-year-olds, who became eligible for the shot sooner. Only 12.8% of 12- to 15-year-olds and 29.6% of 16- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. Contra While those who haven't contracted Covid-19 will not get full protection from only one dose of the vaccine and face an increased risk of infection, [studies](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2021/april/penn-study-suggests-those-who-had-covid19-may-only-need-one-vaccine-dose) suggest one shot may produce a sufficient immune response to protect those who have already recovered from the disease. That does not explain most of the Harris poll respondents who said they would only have their child get partially vaccinated, however, as only 1% of respondents said their child has already contracted Covid-19 and therefore they believe they only need one dose.

The CDC continues to [recommend](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) everyone ages 12 and up receive the Covid-19 vaccine, given that contracting Covid-19 poses a far greater risk, and notes that of the patients who did suffer heart inflammation, \"Most patients who received care responded well to medicine and rest and quickly felt better.\" Key Background The Harris poll reflects a larger trend of widespread vaccine hesitancy in the U.S., with [other](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/05/05/a-quarter-of-americans-still-unwilling-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-poll-finds-but-some-could-be-persuaded/?sh=7493c0e67473) [polling](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/06/04/31-of-americans-still-hesitant-about-covid-19-vaccine-poll-finds---heres-how-that-measures-up-against-other-countries/?sh=2243e42425e8) similarly [showing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/06/07/nearly-80-of-vaccine-hesitant-americans-wont-get-the-shot-poll-finds---but-us-can-still-hit-bidens-70-goal/?sh=1514bc132fbe) that approximately 25%-30% of Americans are unwilling or hesitant about getting the Covid-19 shot.

State and local officials have pushed a wide variety of vaccine incentives to help encourage Americans to get the shot, including incentives targeted toward teenagers like lotteries for [college](https://www.wcvb.com/article/1-million-college-scholarships-offered-in-new-covid-19-vaccine-lottery/36737720) [scholarships](https://www.governor.ny.gov/programs/vaccination-scholarship-incentive) and special teen-oriented vaccine [events](https://kttc.com/2021/05/19/walz-hosts-teen-vaccination-event-at-mall-of-america/).
