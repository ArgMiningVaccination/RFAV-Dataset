Many have medicinal and even magical properties. If you are looking to bring prosperity and abundance into your life, look no further than your own spice pantry. Here is a list of the magical six. Allspice Conventionally used for seasoning meats, cooked fruits and pies, this spice is also known to bring good luck, money and healing. When you use it in cooking, send out the intention that you are adding wealth to your life as you add allspice to your meals. Talk to your food, it's listening Aside from kitchen use, make a little sachet and fill it with some allspice. Slip it in your purse or pocket to attract wealth. You can also sprinkle some in the four corners of your home, office or business. It will help bring success to your work. Cinnamon Often a favorite used in desserts, this pleasantly pungent spice packs a punch with its spiritual vibrations. It will not only help you attract success; it is wonderful for bringing healing, protection and love into your life. It can even help you enhance your psychic powers. A great versatile spiritual spice! To unleash its power, you can put a pinch in your food, tea or hot cocoa. It has been said to be good for bringing quick cash. Try putting a pinch in your wallet or your spare change jar. You can also keep a cinnamon stick handy as a reminder. Attach a dollar bill to it and watch your money grow! Clove is another powerhouse spice that has a variety of spiritual uses. It can enhance love and sexual feelings, while providing protection and clearing negativity. Bringing money is another added bonus! Some people choose to burn cloves on charcoal, but it's easier to carry a few around in a sachet or an envelope. If you have the time, you can create a pomander (clove studded citrus) with cloves. Cloves are naturally attached to an orange using their spiky ends, cover as much of the surface as possible. Following an old tradition, hang the clove studded orange on a ribbon in your kitchen and your cupboards will always be full. Ginger Mentioned in the ancient Hindu Kama Sutra text, ginger is often known for its love enhancing properties. However, it also works for attracting wealth, success and power. You can buy it in various forms: fresh, powered, crystallized or even candied. As with the other spices, you can use the powered form in a sachet or sprinkle it around the house. If you ingest it as part of your food, set an intention that you are bringing wealth into your life while you bring ginger into your body. Mint Technically an herb and not a spice, mint is too important to leave off the list. It is readily available in both fresh and dried forms. Mint leaves have a wonderfully energizing fragrance and power. They bring protection and strength so your wealth and investments will always be safe. Their green leaves can also be symbolic of green money. Keep a dried mint leaf or two in your wallet, purse or checkbook. According to ancient folk magic, rubbing the bills in your wallet with fresh mint leaves will help your money multiply. Try it and visualize more money coming to you every time you spend. Poppy Seeds They make bagels and muffins look inviting and delicious, but these little seeds can bring you prosperity too. Carrying a few in your pocket or purse can attract luck and money.
