Book an appointment for the mpox vaccine and learn what to do if you develop symptoms. About mpox Mpox is a disease caused by the mpox virus. Mpox cases have been reported in Canada but the risk of exposure is low. Nova Scotia is working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada to monitor the outbreak. Generally, mpox doesn't spread easily between people, but anyone who has close contact with an infected person (including household members or sexual partners) is at risk of infection. People who have multiple or frequent anonymous sexual partners are at higher risk of infection. Most reported infections are among men who identify as gay or bisexual, or men having sex with other men, but anyone can get mpox regardless of their sexuality.

People can experience symptoms differently. The first stage of symptoms can include: - fever - chills - swollen lymph nodes - headache - muscle pain - joint pain - back pain - exhaustion The second stage of symptoms starts 1 to 3 days after the first stage and can include a rash or sores that usually starts on the face, legs or arms and can affect other parts of the body (including hands, feet, mouth and genitals). Mpox sores can last 2 to 4 weeks. The sores will change appearance over time until they eventually form a scab and fall off.

Imvamune is approved in Canada as a 2 dose vaccine series and can help protect against mpox. You need to wait at least 28 days between doses. You can get the vaccine if you identify as a cisgender or transgender queer man, a two-spirit person or a non-binary person who has sexual contact with a cisgender or transgender queer man, a two-spirit person or a non-binary person, and you: - had 2 or more sexual partners since May 2022 (or are planning to) - have a diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (since May 2022) - attended, worked at or volunteered at a venue for sexual contact (like a bath house or sex club) since May 2022 (or are planning to) - had anonymous sex since May 2022 (or are planning to) - engaged in sex work as a worker or client since May 2022 (or are planning to) You can also get the vaccine if you have sexual contact with someone who meets this criteria. You can only get the vaccine if you live in Nova Scotia (including people who are living here for prolonged periods of time, like students). If you received 1 dose of the vaccine in another province, you can get a second dose in Nova Scotia.
