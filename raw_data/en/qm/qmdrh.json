Participants will be offered an optional BD of mRNA-1273 lower than the dose chosen for primary series, 6 months after Dose 2. After protocol amendment (PA) 9, participants who have not yet received a BD will be offered a BD with mRNA-1273.214. Part 2: Participants will receive 2 IM injections of mRNA-1273 at dose selected from Part 1 on Days 1 and 29. Participants (6 to <12 year) will be offered an optional BD of mRNA-1273 lower than the dose chosen for primary series, 6 months after Dose 2. After PA 9, participants who have not yet received a BD will be offered a BD with mRNA-1273.214. Part 3: Participants will receive 2 IM injections of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 as primary series then 1 IM injection as Dose 3, on Day 149 3 months and 5 months after receipt of Dose 2 of primary series. All 3 injections will be administered at lower dose than that of Part 1. | Biological: mRNA-1273 | Sterile liquid for injection Biological: mRNA-1273.214 Sterile liquid for injection | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Part 2 only: Participants will receive 2 IM injections of mRNA-1273-matching placebo on Day 1 and Day 29. Participants (6 to <12 year old) will be offered an optional BD of mRNA-1273 at a dose lower than the dose that was chosen for the primary series for this age group, at least 6 months post-cross-over Dose 2. After PA 9, participants who have not yet received a BD will be offered a BD with mRNA-1273.214. | Biological: mRNA-1273 | Sterile liquid for 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection Biological: mRNA-1273.214 Sterile liquid for injection - Number of Participants with Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions (ARs) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 156 (7 days after each injection) ] - Number of Participants with Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 177 (28 days after each injection) ] - Number of Participants with Medically-Attended AEs (MAAEs) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 514 (1 year after booster dose) ] - Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 514 (1 year after booster dose) ] - Number of Participants with Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), Including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis [ Time Frame: Up to Day 514 (1 year after booster dose) ] - Number of Participants with AEs Leading to Discontinuation From Study Post-Booster Dose Through the Last Day of Study Participation [ Time Frame: Day 149 (booster dose Day 1) through the last day of study participation (Day 514) ] - Number of Participants with Serum Antibody Levels that Meet or Exceed the Threshold of Protection From COVID-19 [ Time Frame: Day 57 (1 month after second injection) ]Threshold of protection as predefined for study. - Geometric Mean (GM) Value of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Specific Serum Antibody [ Time Frame: Day 57 (1 month after second injection) ] - Seroresponse Rate of Vaccine Recipients [ Time Frame: Day 57 (1 month after second injection) ] - GM Value of Post-Booster Dose SARS-CoV-2 Specific Serum Antibody [ Time Frame: Day 149 (post third dose) ] - Seroresponse Rate of Post-Booster Dose of Vaccine Recipients [ Time Frame: Day 149 (post third dose) ] - GM Value of SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein-Specific Binding Antibody (bAb) [ Time Frame: Day 1, Day 57, Day 209, Day 394, booster dose Day 1, booster dose Day 29, booster dose Day 181, and booster dose Day 366 ] - GM Value of SARS-CoV-2- Specific Neutralizing Antibody (nAb) [ Time Frame: Day 1, Day 57, Day 209, Day 394, booster dose Day 1, booster dose Day 29, booster dose Day 181, and booster dose Day 366 ] - Number of Participants with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Regardless of Symptomatology, as Assessed by Serology and/or Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 394 ]Clinical signs indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection as predefined for the study. - Number of Participants with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Measured by RT-PCR and/or bAb Levels Against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein in Participants with Negative SARS-CoV-2 at Baseline, in the Absence of Any COVID-19 Symptoms [ Time Frame: Up to Day 394 ] - Number of Participants with a First Occurrence of COVID-19 [ Time Frame: Up to Day 394 ]Clinical signs indicative of COVID-19 as predefined for the study.
