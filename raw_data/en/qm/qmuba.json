Good progress was made in research, and strong efforts continued in out reach. Thousands of residents received answers to their questions, reporters published articles on new discoveries, and the Station received assistance from the Governor and legislators. Governor Rell facilitated th e appropriation of special st ate funds to increase the ability of plant pathologists to diagnose Ramorum blight (forme rly known as Sudden Oak Death). Funds were provided for technical help, equipment, and supplies. Three laboratories have been renovated to meet the increased needs of diagnostic testing, including the use of molecular techniques. G overnor Rell also appointed F. Philip Prelli to be Commissioner of Agriculture, a post which also carries th e assignment to be a member of the Station's Board of Control. Public interest in Station research pr ograms remains high. There were numerous inquiries on mosquitoes and encephalitis viruse s, ticks and tick-borne pathogens, invasive plants, forest pest problems, food safety issues, and plant dise ases. Three Station publications: Identification Guide to the Mos quitoes of Connecticut, Tick Management Handbook, and a Guide to Aquatic Invasive Plan ts have attracted national attention and are in great demand. This Record of the Year reports on scientific advancements, staff member interactions with the public, and comments received from residents of Connecticut. Louis A.

The Connecticut Agriculture and Natural Resour ces Association made the presentation. Gotta's Farm was founded in 1898 by John Gotta who immigrated from northern Italy. He purchased the initial 20 acres of farmland, a barn, and a 10 room house for $1,100 with money he saved while operating a fruit st ore in New York City. Initial crops grown were fruit and tobacco. Dairy cows and chicke ns were also raised on the farm. Gotta's is presently owned by Richard Gotta, great gra ndson of John Gotta. He lives on the farm with his wife Jackie and their son Richard a nd daughter Elizabeth. Richard also has a son Christopher who is a local landscaper. Rich ard's grandfather Leo took over the farm around 1918 and began growing a variety of vege tables. Richard's fa ther Robert, uncle Jim Kane and aunt Jennie Kane became partners with their father in the late 1940s. Their first farm stand was built in 1947, and the co w's were sold in 1951. Richard's father became the sole owner of the farm in 1968. When he died in 1973 Richard and his mother, Helen became the operators. This di versified and well operated farm of 85 acres near the Connecticut River has 50 acres of sw eet corn, 13 acres of apples, peaches, pears, plums, and nectarines, and 11 acres of tomatoes, peppers, cu cumbers, melons, pumpkins, strawberries, and cut flowers. Pick-your-own is a feature for customers interested in fruit and strawberries at appropria te times during the year. Annual bedding plants, perennials, hanging baskets, and potted plants are grown under the 35,000 sq. feet of greenhouse space. A new farm stand with a bakery was co mpleted in 2002. A satellite farm stand is located on Route 66 in Portland. Richard Go tta is a member of several Connecticut agricultural organizations including the Connecticut Pomological Society, the Connecticut Farm Bureau, and the Conn ecticut Greenhouse Growers Association. Following the presentation of the Century Farm Award, Otto Schaefer, President of the Experiment Station Associates addresse d the crowd and invited people to join. Plant Science Day 2004 was a very successful day. From the preparation of Lockwood Farm by the farm crew, the setting up of tents and equipment by the farm and maintenance crews, and the manning of exhibits and field plots, information tables, and refreshment stands by professional, technical and clerical staff, all did their part to make the day enjoyable and educa tional for all who attended. 13 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 EVENTS HELD AT THE STATION HOSTING OF SUMMER PROGRAM ON PLANTS AND ANIMALS On July 13, 2004 Dr. Sharon Douglas organized and hosted a visit to the Station for a group of students from Wintergreen Magnet Sc hool in Hamden who are in the summer program on plants and animals.

Your discussion on how Neonectria galligena infects black birch and the economic impact of cankers on black birch was most appropriate for my students. Y our discussion vindicated my insistence on understanding the importance of pathogenic fungi. It is important that students learn that applied, practical research is just as impor tant as pure research. Because biology today emphasizes molecular research, it has become my mission to expose my students to the world of organisms. Exposure to serious plan t science research is a crucial segment of my botany course. Thank you again fo r your talk to my botany students.\" On November 29, 2005 Daryll C.

Biology today is emphasizing molecular research almost to the exclusion of organisms; therefore exposure to serious plant science research is a crucial segment of my botany course. Your discussion on how mycotoxins pose a seve re risk to human and animal health was an eye-opener. Your talk about the effect s of Fusarium on our food and flower crops really brought home to my students how knowle dge of organisms is equally important as knowledge of molecular biology. Our students live mainly in an academic world of molecular biology and seldom appreciate that world of plants. Your comments on the fact that there is no effective fungicidal treat ment of Fusarium, and that the only way to combat Fusarium is by developing resistance, got the message across that there isn't a quick fix to all of our problems. Your talk on your research was very meaningful. Thank you again for your presentation to my botany class.\" On November 29, 2004 Dr. Daryll C. Borst wrote the following to Dr. Sharon Douglas. \"I would like to thank you for taking time th is year to speak to my botany students about your work with plant diseases. Unfortunatel y, a thirteen week semester does not allow me to spend much time on every aspect of botany, and pl ant pathology is only superficially covered. Your presentation provides my students with an excellent overview of the importance of plant pathol ogy, and how your work specifically provides this valuable service to the citizens of the St ate of Connecticut. The statistics of the inquiries to your section emphasi ze this. Your talk about the historical impact of plant pathogens such as late blight of potatoes a nd coffee rust, underscored to my students how relevant plant science is to their daily lives. Your explanation of the interrelationships of the plant disease \"triad\", and the steps for di sease prevention and cont rol, clearly showed the complexities and importance of plant pa thology.

Compared to some of the other over-weighted agencies that we have in C onnecticut, this one 27 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 provides excellent value and a very important service. I recently dealt with the agency in trying to have what I thought was a tick iden tified. The person who answered the phone knew exactly where to direct my call. After I left a voice mail message, I received an almost immediate response by a staff member who researched my request while I was on the phone. I know that the Experiment Station does much more than test ticks for Lyme disease, but with this disease so rampant in Connecticut I believe that this would be reason enough to justify a state agency. I know that Attorney General Blumenthal is concerned enough about Lyme disease to have held numerous hearings on it, but the problem seems to be under the radar of most of the citizenry. Because the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is in the bus iness of protecting the health of Connecticut citizens, it is much more wort hy of funding than the special in terest groups that I see in the roster of Connectic ut state agencies.\" On March 11, 2005 Dr. Victoria L.

Thank you for all of us.\" On April 4, 2005 David Kittredge of the Univer sity of Massachusetts, Amherst wrote the following to Dr. Victoria Smith. \"Greetin gs workshop speakers, and thank you very much for traveling to Enfield, Connecticut during some very wintry weather on 10 February to participate in the Yankee Divisi on SAF's continuing forestry education event on Stand Development. There were approxi mately 150 people in attendance, and when you review the enclosed evaluation results , I think you will agree that the audience considered it a worthwhile experience. ... The fact that the turnout was so strong, and the comments and participation of the audience so engaging, is a firm indication that the workshop successfully met the overall goal of bringing practitioners up to speed on a variety of subjects that they may have not ha d exposure to since they were in forestry school. ... Thank you again very much for travel ing to Enfield and participating in the workshop. Excellent speakers are the cornerst one of any continuing forestry education event, and the evaluations indicate that we were successful in inviting a talented and effective group this time.

Fearon, Pres ident of the Garden Club of Woodbridge, wrote the following to Michael Last. \"On Wednesday, April 6, Richard Kiyomoto presented a superb slide presentation on iris es at a joint meeting of the Bethany and Woodbridge Garden Clubs. His comments, res ponse to questions and wonderful array of plants provided an excellent educational oppor tunity for our joint membership. At the request of Richard Kiyomoto, each Club is making a contribution ... to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. As Gard en Club members we appreciate the important work being done by the CAES and also the oppo rtunity for the members of the Federated Garden Clubs of Connecticut to meet at your facility.\" On April 12, 2005 Dr. Thomas F. Draper, Co-Cha ir of the Lyme Disease Task Force and Director of the Office of Co mmunity Medicine at Danbury Ho spital, wrote the following to Dr. Kirby Stafford. \"Please accept this donation to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station from the Danbury Hosp ital Medical Staff to help further your research in the prevention of Lyme Diseas e and related tickborn e infections. Your presentations at the Hospital have been an enormous assistance in the education of our physicians and our communities.\" On April 13, 2005 Rob Rork wrote the following to Dr. Jeffrey Ward. \"Thanks for doing a \"Great\" presentation for the forestry porti on of the Connecticut Envirothon. Several teachers said that you were excellent and that they learned a lot. (I'm sure the students did too!) Sorry that there were so many date changes - I really appreciate your flexibility.\" On April 22, 2005 Seton O'Reilly of the Litchfield Garden Club wrote the following to Dr. Sharon Douglas. \"Very simply, you were wonderful yesterday! All our members and guests left being much more knowledgeable about the threat to our beloved oaks, and hopeful that thanks to the perseverance of CAES and you, we can keep on top of it. All your hand outs were scooped up, and we'll make some more copies of the triage fact sheets to distribute further. You were so ge nerous with your time, as well as your talent, and Jane Hinkle and I are endl essly grateful. You made us look good! Our club is giving the CAES Library a $100.00 honorarium in your name . It is the very least we can do in thanks for your speaking to us yesterday. Ag ain, Jane and I thank you. We feel sure that the large turnout was more due to your we ll established reputati on than our efforts.\" On April 28, 2005 Edmund B. Tucker, Presiden t of the Orange Land Trust, wrote the following to Dr. Kirby Stafford. \"Thank you so much for participating in our Annual Meeting last night by presenting your speci alty, the non-medical side of the Lyme Disease program. We feel th at the program served a public need and that the attendance confirmed the interest in the subject. I am continually surprised at the number of people who have had one or more bouts of Lyme Di sease. Our past Annual Meetings have tended to concentrate on some aspect of c onservation or open space preservation and yet the turn out last night justif ied our choice of a program c oncentrating on a local health problem relating to the great outdoors. A nu mber of the attendees approached me after the meeting and thanked us for sponsoring th e presentations. It was a very successful evening. ...\" 31 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 On May 1, 2005 Mr. Julian J. Grossman wrote th e following letter to Governor M. Jodi Rell. \"I recently had the pl easure of taking a five session co urse under the auspices of the Institute for Learning in Retirement at th e Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven. All the scientists who spoke to us on their area of specializa tion did a superb job of providing important insi ghts at a level which was a ppropriate for us. Among the topics were Lyme Disease, various plant di seases, and West Nile virus. Dr. Magnarelli and his staff are consummate professionals w ho do very important work in research and in public health enhancement. They provide superlative service in enhancing our lives by helping to protect us from a host of diseases , as well as providing ways of maintaining the aesthetics of our natural environment.\" (Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis, Dr. John Anderson, Dr. Sharon Douglas, Dr. Louis Magnar elli, and Dr. Kirby C. Stafford, III all participated in the course). On May 4, 2005 Nancy Worthington wrote th e following to Dr. Sharon Douglas. \"On behalf of the Hadlyme Hall Garden Club, I would like to thank you for your slide show and discussion on fruit and fruit trees. It was very interesting and I know we all learned a lot. Thank you once again.\" On May 6, 2005 Bonnie Schoelzel of the Litchf ield Garden Club wrote the following to Dr. Sharon Douglas. \"This is a very belated thank you for the program on the threat of Sudden Oak Death you presented to the Litchfie ld Garden Club in April. The news is indeed chilling, but making the public aware of Ra morum blight is part of the battle. The work done by scientists at CAES is so importa nt in discovering plant and pest diseases - and finding ways of combating those threats. Public awar eness is key - and you have helped get the word out through your program . Thank you for your important work, and good luck with your continued research on Ramorum blight.\" On May 16, 2005 Tom Malley, Chief of Public Health and Immuni zations at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, wrote the fo llowing to Dr. Kirby Stafford. hing \"Tick Handbook\". The document was very readable, interesting, and informative.\" On May 18, 2005 Cindy Barry, Assistant Director of the Ledge Light Health District in Groton wrote the following to Dr. Kirby Sta fford. \"Thank you so much for being my guest on Health Watch. Here is a copy for your library. I think th at the viewers will appreciate your ability to share information in an easy to understand way. Your expertise and your willingness to always be there is something I really admire! Thank you as always for your support of our local project.\" On May 19, 2005 Nadine Vaspasiano, a teach er at Momauguin School in East Haven, wrote the following to Vickie Bomba Lewandos ki. \"I just want to thank you for the wonderful field trip on May 18. The children really enjoyed themselves as you can see by their letters. The guides were excellent, ve ry helpful. Thank you for all the generous goodies for the students.\" Eighteen of Ms. Vaspasiano's stud ents also wrote to Vickie to thank her for the field trip. 32 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 On June 10, 2005 Gwen Thaxter wrote the foll owing to Dr. Kirby Stafford. \"Thank you for responding so quickly, Dr. Stafford. It's always a pleasure asking you for information.\" 33 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 THE PRESS SPEAKS On July 6, 2004 The Day carried the article \"War Against Lyme Disease Moves to the Backyard,\" by Judy Benson. The article repor ted on the efforts being made to educate the public in keeping the numbers of ticks dow n in their own yards, and educating them about Lyme disease. Dr. Kirby Stafford's research and his lead ing training sessions about tick control were reported on. On July 11, 2004 Northeast Magazine carried the article \"Tick Talk\" by Robert J. Miller. The reporter spent the better pa rt of the day following the three people who work in the tick lab (Bonnie Hamid, Beth Alves, and Mi chele Guidone) and writing down what they did and their thoughts on the research they were doing. On August 11, 2004 the Hartford Courant carrie d the article \"Weather May Hold Clues to West Nile: Mosquito study shows link to summer cycles,\" by William Hathaway. For the sixth straight year West Nile virus showed up in birds and mosquitoes across Connecticut. Dr. Theodore Andreadis who m onitored and completed an analysis of mosquito trapping in the state noted a dramatic difference in the statewide distribution of mosquitoes that tested positive for the viru s in 2002, a hot and dry season, compared with 2003, which was very wet and cool. On August 16, 2004 the Record Journal carri ed the article \"Recent trend of rugged winters is taking toll on hemlock pests,\" by Trudy Tynan. A downward trend in the numbers of hemlock woolly adelgid, an inse ct pest destroying huge numbers of hemlock trees from Maine to Georgia, is being attr ibuted to harsh winters with extremely low temperatures. Dr. Carole Cheah said the wint er kill in Connecticut has been so severe that adelgids have been brought in from Pe nnsylvania to continue research programs. She stated that these lower numbers were \"a message of hope.\" On September 6, 2004 the New Haven Register carried the article \"Area weather has had its share of ups and downs through year\", by Abram Katz. Dr. Sharon Douglas was interviewed about the extremes in weather and its effect on pl ants. The temperatures and rainfall varied drastically all year. Dr . Douglas stated \"We've had really unusual conditions this year. We're seeing conditions we don't usually see. Last winter was extreme. The snow blanket protected plants, but the extremely cold temperatures made them more vulnerable to f ungi and bacteria. Now people are beginning to notice.\" She went on to describe various fungal and bact erial infections plants can get from the extremes in temperature and rainfall. On September 28, 2004 the Journal Inquirer carried the article \"Nature's laboratory: The Connecticut Agricultural Expe riment Station unlocks myster ies of the plant world\", by Christine McCluskey. The article showcas ed the Valley Laboratory. Dr. James LaMondia described the research that is pe rformed there, and the number and types of inquiries answered per year for farmers, th e public, garden clubs, and anyone else who has a question about agriculture. 34 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 On October 3, 2004 the New York Times carried the article \"West Nile is down, but is it a Trend?\" by Jeff Holtz. A decline has been noted in West Nile vi rus in the Northeast region of the US for the first time since th e virus was detected in 1999. Dr. Theodore Andreadis said cool and wet conditions th is summer may be the reason for less bird mortality, fewer mosquitoes carrying the virus, and no humans acquiring the virus locally in the state.\" He also stated that conti nued surveillance and testing was important in determining whether there is a pattern of decline. On October 7, 2004 the New Haven Register carried the article \"Company faces $55G fine in contaminated soil case\" by Michael Ga nnon. It reported that contaminated soil taken from a school clean up site was disposed of illegally. Dr. Brian Eitzer and William Iannucci-Berger did the testing on the soil to determine the am ount of contaminants in the soil for the EPA. The Hartford Courant of December 3 carried th e editorial \"Get Plant Tracking System.\" A fungus-like organism found on rhododendron pl ants shipped to Connecticut from a nursery in Oregon is posing a se rious threat to the state's oa k forests, along with other types of trees and plants. Dr. Louis Magnare lli stated that this fungus spreads quickly and will kill more than 60 speci es of trees and plants. It is being suggested that the nursery industry should be re quired to affix bar codes to la bels on plants so that their origin can be easily identified. This will enab le officials to track where infected plants came from and may make it easier to track wher e they were sold and who they were sold to. The New York Times of December 5, 2004 carried the article \"A Kille r of Oak Trees Has Surfaced in the State\" by Jeff Holtz. Sudden Oak Death, a new to Connecticut fungus- like pathogen found its way into the state in a shipment of rhododendron plants from Oregon. Dr. Louis Magnarelli stat ed that there was no evidence that any trees in the state had been affected yet. He also stated that the Station would con tinue to examine trees and nurseries for signs of the organism, a nd the public would be educated about it. The New Haven Register of December 28, 2005 carried the article \"Fatal Oak Disease Threatens State\" by Calli Planakis. The ar ticle reported that te n thousand rhododendron plants shipped from Oregon had been expos ed and possibly carried Sudden Oak Death disease, a condition that has the capability to kill not only oak but dozens of other species of plants and trees. The plants were impossibl e to track as they had been sold throughout the state with no tracking system in place. Dr . Magnarelli stated that the few plants that were tracked tested positive for the disease. He also stated that the Station had the personnel with the expertise to test for the di sease, but lacked funding for equipment. Dr. Jeff Ward stated that the nursery and lands caping industry would be badly affected if Sudden Oak Death spread throughout the state. The Connecticut Post of March 2, 2005 car ried the article \"Endangered Labs: Agriculture Station Fears Budget Cuts, Lost Abilities\" by Peter Urban. The article described how research programs at the Stati on would be cut if the Federal formula funds were eliminated. Dr. Louis Magnarelli stated \"There would be definitely a diminished 35 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 reaction time to address problems\". President Bush's plan to eliminate formula funds and put that money into competitive grant progr ams would be cumbersome. It would take months or years to get a grant to start up new research programs . Formula funds are readily available for starting new research. Many successful research programs such as studying West Nile virus, Lyme disease, Sudden Oak Death, responding to problems in the food supply and others would not have been possible if it weren't for formula funds. In March, 2005, the Hartford Courant carried the article \"New Name, Same Concern: Scientists unsure if Sudden Oak Death will ra vage state\" by Steve Grant. The article reported that since the organism called S udden Oak Death affects many more species than just oak, it will be called by its scientific name, Phytophthora ramorum from now on. It was brought into Connec ticut first on camellia plants in 2003, and then again in rhododendron plants shipped to Connecticut from Oregon. Dr. Louis Magnarelli stated \"There are a couple of big questions. One, is it established? Two, is it going to jump into the trees?\" There is a question of whether the organism can survive the climate in Connecticut. While it flourishes in a microc limate of fog and warmth on the west coast, we don't have those conditions in Connecticut. The organism can either perish or adapt and spread. The impact of the pathog en will not be known for several years. The Connecticut Post of April 14, 2005 carri ed the article \"Figh ting the Elements: Beehives facing more obstacles, deadly resu lts\" by Charles Walsh. The article reported on problems facing beekeepers. Steve Sandrey stated that \"there are 370 beekeepers in Connecticut, both amateur and commercial, and they have 2,375 hives. If last year's 70 percent hive mortality rate is repeated this spring, it will mean only 713 hives will have survived. Bees die for several reasons. Ira Kettle stated \"Varroa's a really big problem here\". It gets into the larv ae shell and even can ruin the honey. Tracheal mites are also a big problem in our area. The mites lodge in th e windpipe of the bee a nd eventually kill it. Agriculture is vital to Connect icut. Bees are vital to agriculture to pollinate crops. The health of the bees in the state is crucial to achieve healthy crops. Beekeepers are trying to strengthen their hives by importing European st rains of bees that are more resistant to Varroa and tracheal mites. The New Haven Register of April 21, 2005 car ried the article \"Weed growth plagues lake\" by Peggy Schenk. The weed problem in Lake Quonnipaug in Guilford was reported on. The lake has a vegetation pr oblem, making swimming, boating and fishing difficult and unpleasant. The ar ticle reported that the Experi ment Station has been called in to help control both native and invasive species of weeds in the lake. In the last five years the Station has helped control weeds at the town's beach, work is now being done in other areas. A News Release was sent out from Eden space in Atlanta, GA on April 21, 2005. The release was to announce that at the Inte rnational Phytotechnologies Conference sponsored by the US Environmental Protec tion Agency, Edenspace Systems Corporation was awarded a six-month Small Business Innov ation and Research grant to explore new methods for remediating persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in soil and excavated 36 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 sediments. It will be doing the work in coope ration with the Station. Dr. Jason White is their partner for the project at the Station. The Connecticut Post of April 24, 2005 carried the letter \"Celebrating our Mother Earth: Experiment Station is State's Jewel\" in its Forum section. The letter was written by Terry Jones, a fifth generation Shelton farmer and Chairman of Working Lands Alliance. The letter gave a historic background of th e Station and then went on to describe the present day research that is going on at the Station and how Station scientists and staff reach out to the public to help with all aspe cts of agriculture. He also described the Station's involvement with Homeland Secu rity with the Food Emergency Response Network - the Station was chosen as one of only 4 locations in the country to do food surveillance work. The author also describe d how he has been coming to the Station and events held here since he was a very young boy and how he has never tired of it. He stated \"The achievements of the Connecticut Ag ricultural Experiment Station read like a litany of the progress and bette rment of life in Connecticut and beyond. ...The scientists are here today as they have been for ove r 130 years making Connecticut and our nation a better place.\" The New Haven Register of April 26, 2005 carried the article \"Voluntee rs can help track invasive plants\" by Gretchen Zonas. The ar ticle described the research work of Dr. Robert S. Capers in controlling invasive a quatic plants in Connecticut Lakes. He is looking for volunteers to collect and identify samp les of aquatic plants in state lakes. Dr. Capers stated that \"aquatic plants provide food and habitats for wildlife and help regulate the nutrient cycle within the body of water. Invasive plan ts threaten the ecological health of lakes and ponds by displacing the native plants and interfering with boating and swimming, blocking flood-control canals and irrigation ditches and increasing sediment accumulation. The damage causes lakes to fill in and age at a faster rate.\" Volunteers would be trained during a two hour session including hands-on practice identifying the invasive plant species. The Hartford Courant of May 26, 2005 carried the article \"New Focus in West Nile Fight. Study Finds Officials Chasing Wrong Mos quito Breed\". The article stated that the mosquito that health officials had been tracki ng and trying to kill is not the real threat in spreading West Nile virus. Culex pipiens, a mosquito that dwells in storm drains and catch basins, was the mosquito that was bei ng focused on. It has been discovered that Culex salinarius , a swamp dwelling mosquito, is the main source of infection. The new information was discovered by Dr. Theodor e Andreadis and Dr. Gourdarz Molaei. The Hartford Courant of May 26, 2005 carried the article \"Will Weather Gloom Spell Garden's Doom?\" by Anne Farrow. May, 2005 was the third coldest since 1917. By the end of the month the soil was still cold and wet. The conditions were expected to set plant growth back by two week s. Warm weather crops that had been planted during the cold conditions were either dying or barely growing. Dr. Donald Aylor stated that \"Generally what happens is th at the development of the plan ts is really slowed down by the cold. But plants can catch up.\" 37 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 The New Haven Register of June 3, 2005 carri ed the article \"Weep Not for Huge Tree\" by Robert Varley. The article described the efforts of Dr. Nickolas Nickou, a lifetime Branford resident, to save a 100 year ol d Sargent weeping hemlock tree from being destroyed to make way for a sewage pumping station. Dr. Nickou and several other long time Branford residents had been tending to the tree for almost 50 years. The town of Branford stated that had no intention to cu t the tree down and the tree will remain. Experts had been called in to examine the tree. Dr. Jeffrey Ward was one of the experts called in and declared the tree to be \"healthy a nd a beautiful specimen\". He also stated \"I tell you, I wanted it in my back yard. It l ooks like a beautiful bonsai . That's what adds character to a neighborh ood, trees like that\". The Hartford Courant of June 15, 2005 carried the article \"Tick Control System a Success\" by Garret Condon. He reported th at a study on tick c ontrol done on Mason Island was so successful that residents of the island plan to pay for continuing the control efforts themselves now that the experiment is over. The use of bait boxes (Maxforce Tick Management Systems) which douse mice with insecticide that kills ticks were placed around the island. A marked reduction in ticks was noted. Cases of Lyme disease fell also. Dr. Kirby Stafford stated that wh ile the Maxforce devices are potentially useful, they are no panacea. The Hartford Courant of June 15, 2005 carried the article \"Two New Weapons In Battle Against Mosquitoes\" by Garret Condon. Th e article reported large populations of mosquitoes in the 2005 season. Dr. Theodore Andreadis stated \"People are certainly going to be bothered with them, certainly at dawn and dusk. The weather we're having this year is perfect for mosquito activity.\" Two new ingredients for repellents were now available on the market to ward off biting mo squitoes. The new ingredients approved by CDC were Picaridin and Oil of lemon eucalyptus. The New York Times of June 26 carried th e article \"He Minds Everyone's Beeswax\" by Carolyn Battista. The article described the work done around the stat e by Ira Kettle, state apiary inspector. He has kept bees for over 30 years. His work takes him to every corner of the state. In summer he sometimes travels 2000 miles a month, inspecting hives, consulting with beekeepers, at tending agricultural fairs, school events and meetings, disseminating the latest information and a dvice on keeping bees and dealing with problems that arise in beekeeping. The July 2005 issue of Wethersfield LIFE carried the article \"Can lady Beetles from Japan Save Wethersfield's Hemlocks? By Joyce Rossignol. The ar ticle described the research with Lady Beetles that was started by Dr. Mark McClure. Dr. Carole Cheah has continued the research, breeding more beetles and introducing them into the environment onto hemlock trees to control the advance of hemlock woolly adelgid. One of her efforts was in a stand of hemlocks in Wethersfield where she said she thought the beetles would be beneficial as the trees were n't that infested yet. The b eetles are very tiny and she and her crew need to painstakingly put the b eetles onto the branches of the trees with paintbrushes and tweezers. 38 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 SCIENTIFIC OFFICERSHIPS AN D MEMBERSHIPS ON STATE, NATIONAL, OR REGIONAL COMMITTEES DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHE MISTRY AND GENETICS NEIL MCHALE Doctoral Research Committees for Jalean Petricka/Tim Nelson (Yale University) Chairman, Institutional Biosafety Committee Member, American Society of Plant Biologists RICHARD PETERSON Secretary, Quinnipiac Chapter Sigma Xi Radiation Safety Officer Member, American Society of Plant Biologists NEIL SCHULTES Steering Committee at Yale University for Bioe thics section of the Institute for Social and Policy Studies Masters Research Committee for a student advised by Dr. George Mourad at the University of Indiana/Purdue DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY LOUIS A.

The activities are concentrated chiefly into two broad categories relevant to the mission of the institution and sustaina ble for the foreseeable future: food safety and environmental monitoring. Service functions include the analysis of samples submitted by State agencies, other Stati on departments, municipal agencies, and health departments throughout Connecticut. The research which we pursue is primarily service-driven, initiated, for the most part, by the required analyses of submitted samples. It consists of a variety of applied studies in Analytical Chemistry; in addition we are pursuing fundamental research in Environmental Chemistry. Beyond the service and research activities re ferred to above, all scientists provide information to the citizens of Connectic ut via telephone inquir ies, tours of our laboratories for students, teachers and other inte rested citizens, and assistance directly to Connecticut businesses. More and more often inquiries from citizens in other states and nations are directed to us for response via th e Internet. There are other examples of our outreach activities. On 18 April 2005 the Depa rtment participated in \"Plant Science Day in the Spring.\" We presented several gr oups of attendees, ranging from elementary school age to senior citizens, a slide introdu ction to the techniques of chromatography and spectroscopy. Each group then toured our la boratories to see dem onstrations of these techniques, as well as the in strumentation based on these te chniques used by our staff to conduct analyses. Our staff participates in many activities direct ed primarily to the surrounding, greater New Haven community. Fo r example, Station Analytical Chemists have served as both mentors for student partic ipants and judges for student projects as part of the New Haven Public Schools Scie nce Fair. We have continued our expanded interaction with the New Haven Public Schools Science Fair beyond mentoring and judging activities to a summe r internship program for two science fair student participants\u2014Nick Olsen and LeeLyn Chong. Fu rther, Drs. Eitzer and Stilwell serve on the Advisory Committee for the Sound School in New Haven. Dr. Brian Eitzer gives a demonstration to a group of grade school students touring the Station A noteworthy recognition of the quality of the an alyses conducted by our Department was accorded to us this past ye ar. By invitation of USDA and FDA, Dr. 84 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Mattina participated in the formation and implementation of FERN, the Food Emergency Response Network. This is a national initiat ive, established in response to terrorist activities, and Dr. Mattina re presented one of only four state laboratories across the nation to participate in its formation. In addition, along with a state colleague from New York and two colleagues representing federal labs in the Northeast, she organized a meeting for Northeast laboratory participants; this is the first such regional meeting within the FERN organization and will serve as the paradigm for the four additional FERN regions in the future. In a similar example of our participation in activities directed toward the security of our nation's food supply, Dr. Mattina has been participating in monthly meetings of the Laboratory Preparedness Advisory Committee chaired by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. The Department is headed by Dr. Mary Jane Incorvia Mattina and the staff consists of Drs. Brian D. Eitzer, Walter J. Krol, David E. Stilwell; Terri Arsenault, William Iannucci-Berger, Craig Musante, Mamie Pyles. During part of the period covered by this report, Dr. Mehmet Isleyen se rved as a post-doctoral affiliate in our laboratory. Summaries of the Department's service and research activities a nd other highlights for the past year are described in detail below. SERVICE ACTIVITIES ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment St ation traces its origins to 1875. That year it was established as the nation's first e xperiment station for the analysis of feed and fertilizer products on behalf of the ag ricultural community, a function envisioned by Agricultural Chemist, Dr. Samuel Johnson. Dr. Johnson was a scientist of national prominence, serving as an expert witness in several high profile criminal cases and one of the first presidents of the American Chemical Society. The Analytical Chemistry Department continues to conduct these state- mandated feeds and fertilizer analyses in order to assure that such products sold in Connecticut are in compliance with the label guarantees printed on the products. These an alyses are performed by Craig Musante and Mamie Pyles under the supervision of Dr. David Stilwell. Feeds: Feed samples analyzed include products for both household pets and agricultural operations. The samples are colle cted by the Department of Agriculture and submitted to the Analytical Chemistry Department for analysis. From 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed 106 samples for parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, and fiber. We continue to analyze an increas ed number of feed samples for micronutrients such as calcium, copper, selenium, molybdenum , etc. Deficient samples, which totaled 37 (34.9%), are reported based on the analytical variations specified in the Official Publication of the Associ ation of American Feed Control Officials. Fertilizers: For the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed 253 fertilizer samples collected by the Connecticut Departme nt of Agriculture. This includes products intended for both commercial and residential applications. Analytical results for 85 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 macronutrients, such as nitrogen, availabl e phosphoric acid, and potash, and increasingly for micronutrients, such as boron, sulfur, coba lt, magnesium, and iron, are compared with label guarantees. Samples with deficienci es in macronutrients or in one or more micronutrients numbered 58 (22.9%). Deficiencies are determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the O fficial Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials. IMPACT: The staff in Analytical Chemistry has an established reputation for accurate and rapid analysis of agricultur al products. With the height ened potential for attacks on the nation's economy and the well-being of its citizens, this capabi lity is of renewed importance. These analyses provide a route for our chemists to contribute to assuring protection from those persons focused on contam ination of animal feed products and the concomitant injury to the agricultural industry. ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION FOOD and STANDARDS DIVISION Pesticide residues in food: During the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 inspectors from the Food and Standards Di vision submitted 196 samples of fresh and processed foods for pesticide residue analys is. The majority of samples represent Connecticut grown produce, although produce grown in other states, foreign grown produce, and organically labelled samples are also collected. Processed foods, such as juices, ciders, and baby food, are included in our survey as well. Dr. Walter Krol is assisted by Terri Arsenault in conducting these analyses. The results of our pesticide residue program are published in an annual St ation Bulletin which is available online on the Station's web site. The most recent Bulle tin presents an interesting summary of the data and a discussion of organic labeling laws. The scope of our marketbasket survey pr ompted various research projects over the past several years. In addition this wo rk, which forms the core of our food safety activities, was an essential stimulus for our laboratory's inclusion in the formation of FERN. During the preceding twelve months Dr. Krol has detected and reported to the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection and the US Food and Drug Administration 2 violations of misapplications of pesticides . In addition, in June our Department was called upon under emergency c onditions to analyze several strawberry samples for possible contamination associated wi th pesticide drift from a fire in a storage shed adjacent to the strawberry field. Drs. Eitzer and Krol coordinated the work and we were able to report out ou r findings within eight hours of receipt of samples. Other samples: In addition to the above food samples analyzed for pesticide residues, we received 165 samples from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. Many of these samples originate from consumer complaints to the Department of Consumer Protection and involve potential product tampering or filth. Although most of these samples represent single incidents, some are i ndicative of widespread problems with the manufacturing or packaging processes. In one such complaint a yogurt product was 86 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 found to contain a compound formed by the inadve rtent omission of preservative . After our determination similar findings were reported in other states. For those samples containing foreign materi al such as plant or fungal substances, we rely frequently on the expertise of Dr. Sharon Douglas and Mary Inman of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. Mr. Kenneth Welch and his associates of the Department of Entomology assist on a rout ine basis for identificat ions resulting from insect infestation. PRODUCT SAFETY DIVISION During the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed 59 samples for the Product Safety Division. Most of these sa mples were imported children's jewelry and were found to contain lead. LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION During the period covered in this record our department analyzed 2 samples to determine the authenticit y of a product for potential mis-br anding. The officers of this division have come to rely on our labo ratory for information of this type. IMPACT: The rapid and accurate response for the analysis of samples submitted to our laboratory is consistent with th e level of training and experien ce of the staff in Analytical Chemistry. The eight-hour turn around time de scribed above for the analysis of several strawberry samples associated with a pesticid e storage fire indicates the type of response we can bring to emergency samples. Such response becomes critical in cases of intentional contamination or terrorist activities. ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU PCBs and pesticides: The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection is charged with compliance monitoring in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (F IFRA) within the state. In support of these activities, for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 our laboratory analyzed 124 samples on behalf of the Connecticut DEP, including foliage, wa ter, fabric, and air samples. Of these samples, 19 consisted of wipes, soils, water, and transformer oils, and were submitted for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) analysis. These analyses were performed by William Iannucci-Berger under the supervision of Dr. Brian Eitzer. IMPACT: Rapid and accurate reporting of polychl orinated biphenyls in the environment can be critical to clean-up and health issues. Our scientists have been able to provide analytical results to the appropriate staff at Connecticut Environmental Protection to assure the safety of s ites accessible to the public. 87 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE SERVICES EXCISE & PUBLIC SERVICES TAXES SUBDIVISION Beer and Wine: Distributors of alcoholic beverages must pay a tax on all sales of such beverages within the State of Connecticut . To assist Revenue Services with the levy of the tax, Dr. Walter Krol determines the alc ohol content of beers, wine coolers, ciders, distilled liquors, and other alc oholic beverages sold in the St ate. From 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed a total of 267 samples for alcohol content. It should be noted that several samples were submitted by brew pubs , microbreweries, and importers operating within the State of Connecticut. We have ma de a special attempt to complete and submit determinations for these start-up Connecticut businesses as rapidly as possible. Such accommodation has been duly noted by a number of such businesses, as well as out-of- state facilities which have made requests to our laboratory for particularly rapid determinations. ANALYSES FOR OTHER MUNICIPAL AGENCIES In the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed 4 samples for municipal agencies. These samples were from a parcel intended as a ball fi eld for the Town of Killingworth. ANALYSES FOR OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS We actively support work done principally in other Station Departments. In the twelve month period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 we analyzed 22 samples submitted by other departments. Samples were submitted by the Departments of Soil and Water, Entomology, and the Valley Laboratory in Winds or. Several of these samples were soils from planned community gardens in urban lo cations with potential contamination from heavy metals such as lead. Dr. Eitzer is working with Claire Rutledge of the De partment of Entomology with her research to find chemicals that attract the Bronze Birch Borer. We continue to provide on-going assistance to other departments, in particular to the Department of Soil and Water, in rela tion to the operation of several pieces of analytical instrumentation in operation in their laboratories. ANALYSES OF CHECK SAMPLES The value of the data generated by th e staff of the Analytical Chemistry Department depends on their accuracy and pr ecision. While each scientist makes sure that the analyses for specific analytes as described in our in-hous e Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) contain ade quate quality control such as spiked and blank samples, we also participate in a variety of form al check and performance evaluation sample programs. Primary among these is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's performance evaluation samples, for which the check samples are purchased from a commercial source. We also participate in the Southern States Check Sample program. Analytical results from these programs confirm the reliability of our analyses. 88 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Studies of Persistent Organic Pollutants and Terrestrial Plants\u2014Mechanisms of Uptake. In 1990 we were intrigued by our observati on of persistent orga nochlorine pesticide (POP) residues in certain crops. POPs such as DDT, chlordane, and heptachlor have not been permitted for use on food crops in the United States for more than 20 years. Nevertheless, trace residues of these com pounds have been found by us and others in produce, including some produce grown on farms which have not used any pesticides for more than a decade. The sources of the pr oduce contaminated with POPs comprise not only Connecticut-grown crops, but crops from other states, as well as imported crops. Our marketbasket data anecdotally suggested that specific crops se lectively uptake POPs from soil while other crops do not contai n POPs in their edible tissues. In 1997 we initiated experiments to inves tigate issues suggest ed by the anecdotal observations. Several components of our inve stigation have been completed and several new lines of research are in progress. We began with a survey of chlordane concentrations in Connecticut soils including residential lawns/ga rdens, residential foundations, and agricultural soils. We have also used a site on the New Haven campus of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station with a well-documented hi story of technical ch lordane application. In 1999 these studies and their implications for the environmental fate of technical chlordane, including its weathering profile, its vertical and horizont al mobility, and its half-life in soil, were published. We continued our studies of plant uptake of POPs in the fall and winter of 1997 and 1998 with greenhouse trials to elucidat e the pathway of chlordane uptake by a selective uptaker, zucchini, and with fiel d trials during the summer of 1998 on our New Haven campus at the site re ferred to above on which tec hnical chlordane had been applied in high concentration in 1960. Ou r detailed study of the translocation of weathered technical ch lordane from soil into twelve f ood crops was published in 2000. We are continuing and greatly expanding our investigations into the cycling of chlordane through biotic and abiotic processes in the e nvironment through several new approaches, including chiral gas chromatography with ion trap mass spectrometry detection. In July 2000 we received a comp etitive grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to pursue our enhanced study of the cycling of chlordane in the environment. As part of this grant, Dr . WenYee Lee was hired as a post-doctoral associate. Together with William Iannucci-B erger they completed a study of the concentrations and chiral profile of chlordane residues in bot h commercial and municipal composts, which was published. The work continued with a nother post-doctoral affiliate, Dr. Mehmet Isleyen, who recently completed his tenure in our laboratories and returned to his native Turkey.. During the past year we have studied in detail the mechan isms of plant uptake of POPs. To facilitate these st udies our experiments have moved from field to rhizotron based experiments which allow us to study proc esses within the rhiz osphere of plants. We have examined whether plant root exuda tes such as low molecular weight organic acids facilitate the up take of POPs. The first published data from the rhizotron studies 89 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 appeared in issue two of a new journal, Environmental Chemistry . Several additional manuscripts are ready for submission to peer -reviewed journals. This recent work is directly related to phytoremediation. Phytoremediation remains a long term goal for the treatment of organic pollutant contaminated soil as it has the potential to be a less expensive in-situ treatment process. Achieving phytoremediation will require a gr eater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of plant uptake of POPs. We are currently conducti ng studies to enhance our knowledge of these mechanisms. We are studying the uptake of POPs from soil by Cucurbitacea in greenhouse rhizotrons. These mesocosms allow us to examine the rhizosphere soil, porewater, organic acid plant root exudates, xylem sap, and plant tissues on a very detailed basis. We have found that there are some correla tions between low molecular weight organic acid plant root exudates and the release of POPs to the soil but these correlations do not appear to be causative. Once released to the soil porewater different species of Cucurbitacea have vastly different capabiliti es regarding the uptake and translocation of contaminants. We have recently found that Arabadopsis thalinia can translocate POPs from soil to aerial tissue. This species is very well ch aracterized genetically. It is therefore hoped that by studying the uptake of pollutants by different ecotypes of this species we can learn which genes are important in the uptake of pollutant chemicals. This in turn could lead to enhancements in the ability of plants to uptake and transl ocate pollutants, which could subsequently make phytoremediation a trul y viable alternative for the treatment of contaminated soil. Non-dietary pesticide exposure routes: Most of our pesticid e studies to date have focused on the dietary impact of pesticide resi dues. Dr. Walter Krol together with Terri Arsenault has studied dermal exposure to pes ticides. Working in collaboration with an inspector from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, we examined dermal exposure under pick your own strawber ry conditions. To simulate hand exposure during the act of harvesting st rawberries, nylon glove liners are worn. Gloves from 28 separate pickings have been analyzed. A manuscript on this study has been accepted for publication in the Bulletin of Environmental C ontamination and Toxicology. Environmental Studies on the Use of Pressure Treated Wood : This project focuses on the environmental effects of the use of wood whic h has been pressure tr eated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) preserva tive. The pressure treatmen t causes the preservative to penetrate deeply into the wood, typically, in concentrations of be tween of between 0.1- 0.2 percent. As of January 2004 this formul ation was phased out for residential uses. However, massive amounts of CCA wood are ex pected to remain in-service for many years, raising concerns that dispersal of th ese additives could impact the environment. Arsenic uptake by plants grow n near CCA wood structures is an area of potential concern. In gardens CCA treated wood is used for borders, raised beds, posts and stakes. Typically, plants are also grow n around the perimeter of deck s, patios and porches, all of which may contain CCA wood. Dr. David Stilwe ll is in the process of determining the major factors influencing plan t uptake of arsenic from CCA contaminated soil. 90 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 During this twelve-month period trials we re begun on the effect of coatings on leaching and subsequent arsenic uptake by pl ants. Planting boxes constructed using CCA wood were coated with various finishes, filled with soil, weathered for two years, and then planted with leafy vegetables. Opaque, film-forming finishes were found to form an effective barrier to arsenic leaching and subse quent plant uptake. The reduction in plant As ranged from 50-84% in plants grown next to the opaque finished wood, and by growing plants 6 cm away from the wood the reduction in arsenic ranged from 55-84% compared to plants grown next to the wood. This ongoing work on the many aspects of the impact of the use of CCA-treated wood has been widely recognized. Dr. Stilwe ll served on the EPA scientific advisory panel (SAP) on the risk assessment of CCA wood, by invitation during 2001, 2003, and 2005, and presented a paper on this work (by invitation) at a symposium on the environmental effects of wood preservatives. Dr. Stilwell is assisted in this project by Craig Musante. Heavy Metals in Community Garden Soils: David Stilwell along with a New Haven Public Schools summer intern, LeeLyn Chong, conducted a survey on the amounts of lead and other heavy metals in community ga rden soils. Ninety samples from 10 gardens were analyzed. About a third of the samples were elevated in lead, and about 8% were elevated in arsenic. The other elements (cadmium, copper, chromium, nickel, and zinc) were not present in levels of concern. Extraction experiments showed that the bioavailable lead in these soils decreased with increasing phosphor us content. These results point to the need for a soil analysis program to be carried out prior to conversion of vacant urban land into garden use. PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive frequent calls from the public requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and in the environment, lead in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances we refer the caller to a more appropriate Station Departme nt or State agency. We typically handle over 1000 such inquiries each year. As more persons gain access to the Internet , inquiries are coming from beyond Connecticut. Station Bulletins : Station Bulletins are typically published annually by our Department These bulletins are available in printed form and on the Station's web site. They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. Fact Sheets : Listed on the Station's web site und er \"Publications\" are several articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest. These are also available in printed format. De partment members also cooperate with the Connecticut Department of Public Health in producing fact sheets published by them. New Haven Sound School : Two members of our Department, Drs. David Stilwell and Brian Eitzer, serve on the advisory council of New Haven Public School's Sound School. 91 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 New Haven Public School Science Fair : During the summers of 2002, 2003, and 2004, we hosted New Haven high school students for su mmer internships in our laboratories. The students worked with our staff, in part icular Dave Stilwell, Craig Musante, Brian Eitzer, and Walt Krol. They presented posters of their work at Plant Science Day in August 2004, and at their schools. DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHE MISTRY AND GENETICS Leaf development : Dr. Neil A. McHale in collaboration with Dr. Ross E. Koning (Eastern CT State University) continued work on the molecular bi ology of leaf development, with technical assistance provided by Regan Huntley. The cu rrent emphasis is on a recently discovered group of small, mobile RNA molecules which regulate the expression of developmentally important genes at the post-t ranscriptional level. MicroR NAs induce gene silencing in plants by guiding a ribonucleas e complex to specific target mRNA molecules, resulting in their cleavage and subsequent degradat ion. Our focus has been primarily on the HD- ZIPIII family of transcription factors. Recent work on a semi-dominant mutation (phv1) disrupting miRNA regulation of the ZIP ge ne PHAVOLUTA (NsPHA V) revealed that the HD-ZIPIII/miRNA interaction is critical not only in the establishment of front/back polarity in emerging leaf primordi a, but also in the formation of vascular tissue. Spatial regulation of three closely related HD -ZIPIII genes (PHABUL OSA, PHAVOLUTA and REVOLUTA) controls of leaf midveins, and s ubsequent vascularization of leaf blades, along with the eventual connect ion of leaf vasculat ure to the vascular cylinder of the stem. What this suggests is that silencing of HD-ZIPIII genes by miRNA molecules is a long sought regu lator of the auxin pathway. If correct, this carries a broad set of implications for the ev entual engineering of agricult urally important plant traits, including flowering time, fruit development, growth ha bit, and root formation. To extend our knowledge of how and wh ere miRNA molecules operate in the plant, we have designed a set of reporter transgenes that f acilitate visualization of miRNA activity. The approach hinges on introducti on of a miRNA recognition site from the NsPHAV gene into a GUSPLUS reporter gene which is driven by a constitutive 35S CaMV promoter. Normally, this 35S::GUSPL US transgene is e xpressed throughout the plant, but introduction of the NsPHAV miRNA s ite leads to destruction of this mRNA in any location where the miRNA pathway is active. By inserting this 35S::GUSPLUS-miRNA transgene (pRH178) into wild-type pl ants, and then staining for GUS activity (dark blue precipitate), doma ins of miRNA activity are read ily identified (colorless) throughout the plant at any stage of development. At the seedling stage, GUS staining in pRH178 transgenics indicates that miRNA activ ity is present throughout the cortex of the root and hypocotyl, where it presumably rest ricts HD-ZIPIII expression to the vascular tissue. In young leaves, miR NA activity eliminates GUS staining on the underside of the midrib, but there is strong GUS staining throughout the vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) and in upper cortex of the rib. A lthough there is evidence in Arabidopsis and maize that miRNAs are transported through the phloem, our results sugg est that they are 92 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 not actually active in that loca tion. Leaf blades show a ve ry similar pattern of up/down polarity for miRNA activity; GUS staining is ne arly in all lower layers of spongy mesophyll and epidermis, whereas there is no evidence of mi RNA activity in the middle mesophyll layer that generates blade vasc ulature. There is also no evidence of miRNA activity in the upper mesophyll (palisad e) or in the upper epidermis. We are currently crossing the pRH178 transgene into several mutant backgrounds to look for alterations in domains of miRNA activity rela tive to wild-type. The focus here is on mutant strains with ectopic expression of the class I homeobox genes, where it appears that HD-ZIPIII expression is abnormally low. We are testing the possibility that this results from the movement of miRNA molecules beyond their normal boundaries in emerging leaf primordia. Photosynthetic Genes: Dr. Richard Peterson on the relation be tween function and structure of the 22- kilodalton photosystem II ( gene product (PSII-S), in collaboration with Dr. Neil Schultes and assisted by Carol Clark. Chlorophyll (Chl) a bound to PSII-S may divert excess excitation from the PSII antenna complex to the bound carotenoid zeaxanthin, sa fely converting the energy to heat. Removal of such essential Chl(s) should result in a loss of nonphotochemical in two domains of PSII- S were replaced both individually and in co mbination. Specifically, two Glu-Arg ion pairs [Glu(195)-Arg(95) and Glu(90)-Arg(200)] that span helices I and III in PSII-S, and known to bind Chl in the structurally homo logous PSII light-harvesting proteins LHCII and CP29, were replaced with non-binding Va l-Leu. A stably transformed line of Arabidopsis (mut-2) was discovered in which Ch l binding to the A1 site has been blocked. A near total loss of NPQ capacity was observed in th ese leaves. Current efforts are focused on isolation of His tidine-tagged versions of the mu tant proteins to facilitate purification by affinity chromatography. In a related approach, use of the tobacco rattle virus vector system successfu lly silenced expression of psbS in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana . This deletion phenocopy will greatly en hance efforts to screen effects of psbS mutation on NPQ capacity. Application of multiple probes to systems that carry specific mutations provides a powerful means for studying how known regul ators of light util ization interact in vivo . Two lines of Arabidopsis thaliana were studied, each carry ing a unique lesion in the nuclear psbS gene encoding a 22-kilodalton pigmen t-binding protein (PS II-S) essential for full photoprotective, rapid-phase, nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). The PS II-S protein is absent in line npq4-1 due to deletion of psbS . Line npq4-9 expresses normal levels of PS II-S but carries a single amino acid substitution that lowers NPQ capacity by about 50%. A prior report [Peterson RB and Havir EA (2001) Planta 214: 142-152] described an altered pattern of redox states of the acceptor side of photosystem II (PS II) and donor side of photosystem I (PS I) for npq4-9 suggesting that interphotosystem elect ron transport may be restricted by a higher transthylakoid pH in this line. In vivo steady state fluorescence and absorbance measurements (820 nm) confirmed these earlier observations for line npq4-9 but not for npq4-1 . Thus, the prior results cannot be correlated simply to a loss of NPQ capacity. 93 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Likewise, the kinetics of the 820-nm absorb ance change did not indicate a substantial effect of psbS genotype on electron flow from plastoqui nol to PS I. A simple model was proposed to relate linear elec tron transport rate (measured ga sometrically) to a parameter (based on fluorescence) that provides a relati ve measure of the density of excitation available for photochemistry in PS II. Surpri singly, analyses using this model suggested that the in vivo midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor in PS II (Q A) is lowered in both psbS mutant lines. This heretofore-unsuspected role for PS II-S is discussed with regard to: 1) numerous prio r reports indicating pl asticity of the redox potential of Q A and 2) the basis for the contrasting regulation of quantum yields of PS I and II in npq4-1 and npq4-9 . Plant Metabolism Manipulating plant metabolism is central to future genetic enhancement of crops for increased yields and more efficient use of fertilizers. By reducing fertilizer use production costs will be lowered and the impact on the enviro nmental through excess nitrogen runoff will be lessened. Membrane bound transporter proteins act as metabolite-specific gatekeepers regulating traffic of metabolites between compartments in the cell. Understanding how plant trans porters function is an important goal for eventual enhancement of crop productivity. Nucleobase-Ascorbate Transporters Dr. Neil Schlultes assisted by Regan H untley investigates the transport and biochemistry of nitrogen based nucleobases (pur ines and pyrimidines) in plants. At least six different families of transporters (cont aining some forty-two members) are involved in the movement of nucleobases. Two transporter families - nucleobase/ascorbate transporters (NAT) and the 8-azaguanine-like tran sporters - are the focus of our research. NAT proteins transport purines, pyrimidines or vitamin C and are present in most living organisms. A large number of processes ut ilize nucleobases or ascorbate house-keeping metabolite synthesis, plant/pathogen interactions, oxygen radical bioc hemistry and carbon or nitrog en storage and transport. In particular purine metabolism and transport is central for ureide production. Ureides are the major nitrogen transport molecule in trop ical N2-fixing legumes such as soybeans. The Arabidopsis genome contains twelve NAT loci. We hypothesize that NAT proteins have distinct but overlapping solute transport specificities and that NAT loci have unique expression patterns. Such function/expressi on combinations often address sink-source relationships throughout the plant as has been shown for multi-gene sugar and amino acid transporter family members. Our long term research goals aim at determining the expression pattern and function of plant NAT genes and proteins. Studies reveal NAT sink/source expression patterns We routinely use four independent methods to monitor gene expression to ensure accurate spatial and temporal expression patter ns. Superior spatial resolution is achieved through analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis harboring NAT promoter- -glucuronidase (GUS) fusions. Northern blot and RT/PCR were used to monitor endogenous NAT gene expression in different tissues and stag es of plant development. In addition in situ 94 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 hybridization analysis was employed to monito r tissue-specific expression of NAT genes and verify the spatial expression patterns observed with transgenic reporter plants. We have gene expression data for ten of the 12 NAT loci. During the past year we have generated NAT promoter/GUS constructs in plant binary vectors for three of the four remaining NAT loci. Putative transgenic Arabidopsis lines ex ist for two of these constructs. Our results confirm that each NAT locus has a unique expression pattern. These patterns support the hypothesis that NAT proteins move nitrogenous compounds throughout the plant to serve the needs of deve loping \"sink\" tissues such as pollen, eggs and seed. The expression profiles display a preference for vascul ar localization and expression in 'sink' tissues (e.g. flowers). NAT loci heterologous expression constructs One method for determining NAT trans porter function is through heterologous complementation studies in yeast. This procedure involves engineering arabidpopsis NAT genes for expression in yeast. These c onstructs are then mobilized into mutant yeast lines deficient in the transport of va rious nucleobases. Transport function is monitored by the ability of these yeast lines to be grown on nucleobases as sole nitrogen sources or as gaining sensitivity to growth on toxic nucleobase analogs. We have obtained or isolated full-length cDNA clones for seven of the twelve NAT loci. Each of these cDNAs was engineered into yeast expre ssion vectors. We have been unsuccessful in generating full length cDNA sequence for two NAT loci (At1g65550 and At5g25420), but are renewing our efforts to obtain these genes. Other expression data on these genes show that they are expressed at a very low leve l in floral tissues. We plan to engineer a total of ten NAT loci into y east vectors. In collaboration with Dr. Mourad (see below) we will test these constructs in yeast systems. Uracil transport in Arabidopsis For1- an arabidopsis uracil transporter We have an active collaboration with Dr . George Mourad in the Biology Dept. at the University of Indiana/Purdue at Fort Wayne Indiana. He has isolated and characterized a mutant arabidopsis line - called for1- that is resistant to higher concentrations of 5-fluoroorot ic acid (5FOA). 5FOA is a toxic analogue of uracil. for1/for1 plants take up of uracil at approxima tely only 25% the rate or wild type arabidopsis. This locus may represent a NAT gene or a gene th at regulates uracil transporter genes. Our collaboration aims to find the locus responsible for the for1 phenotype. Linking genetic phenotype with molecular genotype Using molecular markers (simple sequ ence length polymorphisms (SSLP) and CAPS) the for1 locus has been mapped to an 81 kb in terval on chromosome V. None of the six transporter loci on chromo some V that were candidates for For1 - including three NAT loci FUR4 -like transporter (At5g03555) - map within this interval. Of the 21 loci in the 81kb interval several encode for transcription factors, which may regulate the expression of uracil transporters. We will 95 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 obtain T-DNA insertion \"knock-out\" lines in these loci from the ABRC and test for ability to germinate and grow on 5FOA media as do for1 mutant plants. 8-azaguanie-like transporters A further collaboration with Dr . Mourad involves two Arabidopsis loci that encode for transporters very similar to the transporter in Aspergillus nidulans Dr. Mourad has generated 8-azaguanine resistant mutations in Arabidopsis. Our hypothesis is that his mutant lines have genetic deficiencies in one of the two 8-azaguanine -like transporter loci (At3g10960 and at5g50300) by homology in the Arabidopsis genome. We have placed the full le ngth cDNAs from both At3g10960 and At5g50300 into yeast expression vectors and will test th eir ability in yeast he terologous systems for 8-azaguanine transport. In addition, we have obtained independent T-DNA insertion mutant Arabidopsis lines in each of thes e loci. Currently, we are identifying and generating homozygous mutant lines and will test their ability to grow on 8-azaguanine containing media. Genetic Engineering of Paenibacillus Organisms Dr. Douglas W. Dingman, assisted part -time by Cindy Musante, uses molecular techniques to investigate the disease pr ocesses utilized by the insect pathogen Paenibacillus popilliae . A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will provide insight into ways to better us e this organism as a biological control agent against harmful insects. A genomic map of P. popilliae NRRL B-2309 has been enhanced by the addition of several new genetic markers (i.e., catalase, superoxide dismutas e, and aconitase). These new markers were isolated the genome using shotgun PCR amplification and TOPO cloning. Southern hybridization analysis using the isolated gene markers has been performed on I- CeuI restriction blots to place the ge netic markers on the genomic map. Continued enhancement of the genomic map will be performed as new genetic markers are identified and mapped. This map provi des a genetic organizational foundation on which to direct focus on regions a ssociated with disease processes. Of the 43 P. popilliae and 3 Paenibacillus lentimorbus strains obtained from different insect hosts and geographical locations, 4 clearly separated phylogenetic clusters have been identifie d. The clustering indicated that P. lentimorbus and P. popilliae are different varieties of the same or ganism and not different species. An understanding of phylogenetic grouping provide s insight into the evolution of the bacterium and helps to explain how disease causing traits were obt ained and modified within this bacterium. A DNA fingerprinting prot ocol to help identify P. popilliae and P. lentimorbus has been developed using PCR amplificat ion of the 16S-23S rDNA ITS regions and agarose gel electrophoresis of this amplified DNA. Other Paenibacillus species, tested by this PCR-ITS DNA fingerprinting procedure, were found to have unique fingerprint patterns. This procedure can be used for differential identification of all Paenibacillus species. Utilization of this procedure will help scientists to rapidly and accurately identity P. popilliae and P. lentimorbus . DNA fingerprinting will prevent identification 96 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 mistakes; as has occurred in past scientific reports by investigator s inexperienced with these organisms. DNA sequence analysis of the P. popilliae plasmid pBP68 is in progress. Production of a complete DNA sequence for th is plasmid will help explain how this plasmid contributes to the overall physiology of the bacterium. Additionally, sequence information will be needed for the development of this plasmid as a shuttle vehicle for genetic exchange experiments. Collaborative work with Dr. Neil P. Schu ltes on development of genetic exchange and insertional mutagenesis procedures are in progress. This invest igation is using the Tn916 conjugative transfer capabilities of P. popilliae to develop genetic exchange procedures and tools for randomized insertiona l mutagenesis. Insertion of the antibiotic marker for erythromycin resistance ( erm) has been placed into the transposon Tn 5 and this construct has been randoml y inserted into the plasmid pBP68. The green fluorescent protein marker, fused to a P. popilliae promoter and ribosome binding site, has been linked to erm for placement into a suitable shuttle vehicle. Developm ent of procedures for genetic exchange and in sertional mutagenesis for P. popilliae allow for the full armament of molecular techniques to be avai lable for molecular i nvestigations on this bacterium. DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY Hemlock woolly adelgid and soil-inhabiting insects: Field and laboratory studies continued on the control of hemlock woolly adelgids and soil-inhabiting insects. Accomplishments are reported in the Valley Laboratory section. Community Program for the Prevention of Lyme Disease : A community-base program is being conducted for the preventi on of Lyme disease in the Torrington Area Health District (TAHD) and th e Ledge Light Health District (LLHD). Research elements continue in the Westport Weston Health Di strict (WWHD), the location of the first national Lyme disease community project which formally ended in September 2004. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these local intervention projects are a cooperative effort of the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH), Dr. Kirby Stafford of the Connecticut Agri cultural Experiment Station, and the local health districts. Working closely with the lo cal health districts, Dr. Stafford provides technical advice, site visits, and lectures on tick manageme nt for the projects. In the TAHD, research efforts are focused in the to wns of Canaan, Cornwall, and Salisbury. In the LLHD, tick control studies have been focu sed in the community of Mumford Cove in Groton. With the assistance of Heidi Stube r and J.P. Barsky, and summer research assistants Christina Stoehr, Bert Nwadukwe, Sharon Cardona, and Angela Penna in 2004, Dr. Stafford is responsible for collecti ng data on tick abundance, determining the prevalence of infection in both the vect or and reservoir ho sts, and evaluating interventions in the community. The majority of Lyme disease cases (75%) are acquired in the residential la ndscape, primarily through the nympha l stage of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis . The blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (commonly known as the deer tick) is the vector for the Lyme disease spirochete ( Borrelia burgdorferi ), the protozoan 97 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 that causes human babesiosis ( The long term evaluation of the mouse-targeted, fipronil- based bait box in residential communities is an important aspect of Dr. St afford's current research in the targeted communities. This research provides homeowners with information on the effectiveness of a commercial alternative to broadcast spraying for controlling blacklegged larval and nymphal I. scapularis and are the principal reservoir for the tick-borne pathogens. The Eastern chipmunk ( Tamias striatus ) is also an important host reservoir for the tick, the Lyme spirochete and B. microti . A fipronil-based rodent bait box system for treating white-footed mice a nd chipmunks to control ticks, initially tested by scientists from the CDC in c ooperation with the Conn ecticut Agricultural Experiment Station on Mason's Island, St onington, CT, is available commercially. Fipronil is the active ingredient in some flea and tick control products for dogs and cats (Frontline\u00ae). The commercial ve rsion of the bait box (Maxforce \u00ae Tick Management System, Bayer Environmental Science, Res earch Triangle Park, NC) continued to be evaluated in conjunction with the Lyme dis ease community intervention projects in the WWHD and TAHD. Working closely with the local health districts, Dr. Stafford established trials of the fi pronil bait box in 2001 in inland residential neighborhoods in Westport and Weston, and with J.P. Barsky's a ssistance in 2002, in Litchfield County in Salisbury, Canaan, and Cornwall. The commer cial Maxforce TMS box was used at all sites from 2002-2004. In spring 2004, the commerc ial boxes were distributed to the same homes used previously. A few additional hom es were added in Westport and Weston in spring 2004. The impact of the boxes was eval uated by: 1) opening or weighing samples of the bait boxes to determine bait and box us age 2), tracking host-se eking populations of larval and nymphal I. scapularis at treated and control home sites, and 3) live trapping white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks and monitoring feeding larval and nymphal I. scapularis . In Westport and Weston in 2004, 78 homes received 1,861 boxes distributed in two neighborhoods (36 in West on and 42 in Westport) in two installations with half placed in May to c ontrol nymphal ticks on the rodent s and half placed in July to control larval ticks feeding on the rodents. The same residences in the two untreated neighborhoods, one each in Weston and Westport, continue to serve as the control. Like 2003, good to excellent control was obtained on Peromyscus and chipmunks in most areas in 2004, despite some dest ruction of bait boxes by squirrel s due to a change to more aromatic bait in the Maxforce boxes. Dest ruction by squirrels was scattered in the WWHD with only a few homes losing all or most of the boxes (CAES replaced 33 destroyed boxes with new boxes in WWHD during 2004). In the WWHD, 98.9% of a sample of undamaged bait boxes opened and examined (n = 187) were fully empty of bait. Mice were trapped at 12 bait box a nd 9 control properties 5 to 6 times, roughly biweekly, from mid-May through August in th e WWHD. Of 67 animals captured in the WWHD control areas, 28 (41.8%) were infested with larval I. scapularis and 6 (8.9%) were infested with nymphal I. scapularis . By contrast in the ba it box sites, only 4 of 50 (8.0%) trapped rodents had larval ticks and no nymphs were detected. This represents a highly significant (z-test, P < 0.001) reduction (80.3%) in the proportion of hosts infested with larval ticks (compare d with a 72.5% reduction in 2003). Similarly, there was 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 significantly (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney Test) fewe r larvae per rodent host with a mean of 2.4 larvae per rodent in the control a nd 0.08 larvae per rodent in the bait box treated sites. Host-seeking nymphal ticks will be mon itored in summer 2005 to see if there is a reduction at the treated properties relative to the untreated properties resulting from the significant larval reductions on host animals in 2003 and 2004. In the three towns of the TAHD (Canaa n, Cornwall and Salisbury), 70 homes (19 in Salisbury, 16 in Canaan, and 35 in Corn wall) received 1,826 boxes (two installations, one in May (n = 924) and one in July (n = 902)) in 2004. Unlike previous years, fewer ticks were recorded for all rodents cap tured in the TAHD bait box sites in 2004. Box usage was high with the majority of boxes opened and examined empty of bait. Mice were trapped at 17 bait box and 15 contro l properties 5-6 times through the season. Overall, 51.4% (of 74) and 34.4% (of 93) rodent s were infested with larval ticks in the control and bait box treated si tes, respectively - a signifi cant difference at P < 0.04 (z- test). Due to low numbers, there was no si gnificant difference in the proportion of animals infested with nymphal I. scapularis (13.5 and 10.7%, control and bait box, respectively). Viewed over time, there has be en a steady decline in the prevalence of infestation by larval ticks on rodents in the bait box sites (77. 8% in 2002, 61.3% in 2003, and 34.4% in 2004), while infestation levels in the control have been more consistent (45.5, 58.1, and 51.4% for 2002-2004, respectivel y). Again there was a significant difference in larval numbers on the rodents be tween the control and bait box sites (Mann- Whitney Rank Sum Test, P = 0.044), with a mean of 3.5 vs. 2.2 larvae per rodent in the control and bait box sites, resp ectively. In an analysis by to wn, the number of larvae on hosts were lower in the towns of Canaan a nd Cornwall, but the diffe rence was significant (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, P = 0.022) only for Canaan. The mean number of larvae per animal remained higher in the treate d sites (1.72/animal) than the control (1.05/animal) in Salisbury, although th e difference was less than in 2003. Tick abundance and deer reduction: The study in Mumford Cove is examining the impact of deer reductions in the community conducted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection in co mbination with some individual residential spraying for tick control. With the deer re ductions in the commun ity through controlled hunts, the proportion of mice infested with larval I. scapularis was lower in 2004 (40%) than 2003 (85.7%). However, the sample si ze in 2004 was small and infested rodents were recovered at areas within the residential community rath er than just the forested area between Mumford Cove and Groton Long Poin t. No rodent bait boxes were placed in Mumford Cove in 2004. Entomopathogenic fungi for tick control: Postdoctoral scientist Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on the survival and efficacy against I. scapularis and of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 with Dr. Stafford in 2004. The fungus is now being developed commercially in both an oi l-based emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and granular formulation for the control of a va riety of pests, includi ng the blacklegged tick under the label Tick-Ex\u00ae (Ear th BioSciences, Inc., New Haven, CT). The purpose of the initial studies is to determine optimum dos age and length of viability under different conditions in the field. Earlier small scale field trials with a laboratory produced oil formulation of the fungal spores by Dr. Stafford in Westport and Weston in 2002 provided greater than 80% reduction of I. scapularis relative to the untreated sites in the same community. With new product provided by Earth BioSciences, bioassays of leaf 99 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 and grass material treated in w oodlands and grassy areas with M. anisopliae in 2004 showed the fungus was viable for approximately 47 days under cooler fall conditions. However, high mortality in the bioassay was observed only from woodland samples for this length of time. Bioassay tests and germin ation tests began in Ju ly 2005 to determine fungal viability in the field under summer condi tions when nymphal ticks are active. To date, laboratory tests with I. scapularis walking on a treated surface have been conducted with adult ticks for both the EC and granular formulations and with nymphal ticks with the granular formulation at different concentrations and exposure times. Against adult I. scapularis , a 30 minute exposure to 2.6 x 106 cfu/cm2 (= field rate of 2.3 x 1012/1,000 ft2) of M. anisopliae in the EC formulation for 30 minutes resulted in a mortality of 90.9% within 2 weeks. While a 10 fold higher concen tration resulted in 100% mortality within 2 weeks at both a 3 minute and 30 minute exposure, the higher rate is probably not a realistic field application rate. Mortality with the current granular material was more variable. These and upcoming studies will provide information needed for the application guidelines for commercialization of M. anisopliae as a tick biopesticide. A commercial product with M. anisopliae will provide the first practic al biological alternative to broadcast insecticides for resident ial control of th e blacklegged tick. Tick abundance and Lyme disease incidence: In 2004, Dr. Stafford continued to monitor populations of I. scapularis nymphs on the lawns and adjacent woods at several residences in Lyme, Old Lyme, and East Haddam, Connecticut, by dragging the vegetation with a square meter cloth 'tick dr ag'. Ticks have been collected at these residences since 1989. Tick activity was up slig htly for June and July in 2004 in these three communities (97.1 nymphs per hectare) compared with 66.2 nymphs per hectare in 2003 and 132.5 nymphs per hectare in 2002. Howe ver, only 11.3% (of 62 available to be tested) were infected with B. burgdorferi . The risk index based on the abundance of infected ticks was only 11.0 vs. values in the 30s to 70s through the 1990s and 13.8 in 2003. Only 10 cases of Lyme disease were re ported in East Ha ddam, Lyme and Old Lyme in 2004, just slightly more than in 2003 (7), and substantially less than in 2002 (54 cases). Statewide, the number of reported cases dropped to only 1,348 cases in 2004 from the earlier low of 1,403 in 2003. This is largely because of the dropping of required laboratory surveillance by the DPH in 2003. Comp arisons on long-term trends in tick activity and prevalence of infection with re ported incidence of Lyme disease will permit a better understanding of the relationshi p between tick abundance and disease. Tick-borne infections : Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, a ssisted by Tia Mastrone, and in collaboration with Dr. Erol Fikrig of Yale University, investigated antibody responses of horses to the bacterium that causes Lyme borreliosis. Utilizing highly specific recombinant or whole-cell antigens in enzy burgdorferi ) were detected in 82 (84%) of the 98 serum samples tested from ill animals. Of the 9 recombinant antigens evaluated in diagnostic analyses, protein 37 and VlsE antigens were partic ularly useful in confirming current or past infections. Th erefore, antibody tests with eith er of these antigens can be used with conventional tests to improve la boratory diagnosis. Efficient diagnosis can lead to proper antibiotic treatm ent and improved health of horses. With the assistance of Tia Mastrone, Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, Dr. Sandra L. Bushmich of the University of Connecticut, a nd Drs. Jacob W. IJdo a nd Erol Fikrig of 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Yale University confirmed Lyme disease and anaplasmosis infections in ill cats. New antibody tests were developed to measure anim al immune responses to key outer surface proteins of both disease orga nisms. As found earlier in an alyses of human and horse serum samples, VlsE and protein 44 antigens were suitable for laboratory diagnoses of cat infections. These new tests can be used with other methods to determine causes of certain tick-associated diseases. With im proved diagnostic testing, there will be more effective antibiotic treatment and improved health of cats. Emerald Ash Borer: In a 2004, Dr. Maier and his assist ants, Julia Daigler, Steven Struble, and Shalyn Zappulla, surveyed for the exotic emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis , in Connecticut. In the Midwest, this eastern Asian beetle has killed about 6- 7 million ash trees. The survey team visually inspected more than 6,200 ash trees in high-risk locations in 167 towns distributed in the 8 Connecticut counties. Inspectors also examined sticky traps on healthy and gird led ash trees for adults. Fortunately, none of the inspected ash trees had emerald ash borer s. In 2005, the survey for this destructive beetle is continuing. Small Japanese Cedar Longhorned Beetle : Dr. Maier and his assistants, Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, are studying the seasonal abundance the small Japanese cedar longhorned beetle, Callidiellum rufipenne. The exotic cedar longhorned beetle, which was first found in Connecticut in 1998, bores into dead or stresse d cedar and related plants in nurseries, garden centers, yards, a nd forests. Based on captures on sticky bands placed on the trunks of girdled eastern red cedars at Middletown, adults are actively seeking mates and laying eggs from mid-April to early June. Knowledge of the seasonal activity of adults is important for detecti ng and controlling this beetle of regulatory concern. feed upon the needles of spruces, causing cosmetic injury in most cases. Dr. Maier fi rst discovered this moth in Connecticut in 1997; this was the first record from North America. Based on a 2004 survey with wing traps baited with a two-compound pheromone, th e moth is widespread in the northeastern United States, being captured in New Engl and, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. In 2005, a distri butional survey with pheromo ne traps is being conducted in other states and provinces in North Ameri ca to determine additional localities with this pest. In Orange, Connecticut, the adult males of B. pinicolella were captured in pheromone traps between early June and late July 2004. Knowledge of the distribution and flight times should assist st akeholders in developing strate gies to cope with this new potential pest of Christmas, landscape, and forest trees. Other Alien Insects : During 2004 and 2005, Dr. Maier and his assistants searched the state for new exotic insects to determine if and where they occur. They found that the European oak-bush cricket, Meconema thalassinum (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), is widespread wood-boring beetle, Agrilus cyanescens (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), al so from Europe, similarly o ccurs throughout the state where its larvae bore into the wood of hone ysuckles. The European snipe fly, Rhagio tringarius 101 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 (Diptera: Rhagionidae), inhabits forests throughout the state. In the collection at the Experiment Station, Dr. Maier discovered a specimen of R. tringarius that was collected in 1915 by Max Zappe. This specimen is apparen tly the first collected in North America. Another new find was the European barberry fly, Rhagoletis meigenii (Diptera: Tephritidae), a widespread fly that is on the wi ng from late June or early July until mid- August. Larvae of this exotic fly eat the be rries of pestiferous ba rberries; thus, this picture-winged fly may be a useful biological control agent for these invasive plants. Other surveys in Connecticut revealed the presence of two exotic bees. The giant resin bee, Megachile sculpturalis (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), was found in 6 of 8 counties. In Connectic ut, the eastern Asian M. sculpturalis foraged (sea-lavender, Limonium carolinianum , and goldenrod, Solidago sp.) not previously reported in the literature. The second foreign bee, Anthidium manicatum , occurred at two localities in New London Co. This Old Worl d bee has the largest distribution of any species of Anthidium , having accidentally been introduced into several continents. In North America, adults are associated mainly with species of mints (Lamiaceae), although they sometimes use floral hosts in Aste raceae, Lythraceae, and Scrophulariaceae. The impact of these bees on native bees and on pollination of crop plants has yet to be determined. Exotic Parasitic Wasps in Apple Orchards: In cooperation with Dr. Christer Hansson of Sweden, Dr. Maier determined th at two common parasitic wasps, named by North American taxonomists, are actual ly the widespread European species, Sympiesis acalle and S. gordius . These two eulophid wasps, accidentally introduced from Europe, help to control exotic apple leafminers, Phyllonorycter spp. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), now established in Palear ctic encyrtid wasp, Holcothorax testaceipes , 1988, c ontinues to parasitize up to 20% of the tentiform leafminers in an unspraye d apple orchard at Lockwood Farm. The next phase of the research is to determine how to use H. testaceipes effectively to bolster biocontrol in low-spray orchards. Case Studies of Organic Farms in the Northeast : As part of the Northeast Organic Network (NEON) projec t, Dr. Kimberly Stoner, working with scientists at Cornell University, the New England Small Farm Institute, and the Northeast Organic Farming Association chapters of New Yo rk and New Jersey, was responsible for collecting pest management information for all 11 exemplary, established organic farms studied, and for compiling the complete case studies for the 3 farms in New England (1 each in CT, MA, and VT). The case studies include the story of the farmer and the history of the farm, key dis tinctive issues for each farm, a nutrient budget of organic soil amendments and nutrients leaving in crops. Fo r at least 3 focal crops on each farm, there are detailed analyses of pract ices and field measurements of results for soil fertilization and managing weeds, insects, and diseases; measurements of yield; and, for the 3 New England farms, economic analyses of produc tion costs, break even points by price and production, and actual revenues by focal crop. These case studies are currently being used for training Cooperative Extension agents and other agency personnel from acr oss the Northeast in a Professional 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Development Program on Organic Agriculture funded by the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program. Role of cover crops in pest management: In order to evaluate pest and beneficial insects and microbes in the soil and rhiz osphere, Dr. Kimberly Stoner and Dr. Wade Elmer, assisted by Erin Amezzane, Tracy Zarr illo, and Elizabeth O'Dowd, grew a set of cover crops over three winter and spring seasons : planted in the fall were wheat, rye, rye + hairy vetch, crimson clover, oats, and, in one year, rape; planted in the spring, following fall oats, were annual ryegrass, spring oats, spring oats + field peas, and in one year, spring-planted rape. We also left an unplanted control for bot h the fall and spring plantings. The survival of the cover crops over th e winter and performance the next year varied depending on the minimum winter temper atures. Wheat and rye were consistent each year, producing 1-2 tons of dry matter per acre, over 50% ground cover, and suppressing weeds. Rye + vetch also consistent ly did well each year, but in the spring of 2002, after an unusually mild winter (low te mperature of 11 degrees F), grew more vigorously than in the cold years, with cl ose to 100% ground cover and 4 tons of dry matter per acre. Crimson clover varied gr eatly, with 97% ground c over and 4.7 tons dry matter per acre after a mild winter, but 46% ground cover and only 0.4 tons/acre after a colder winter (low temperature -5 F). Oats also varied, produci ng a good, winter-killed mulch in spring 2001, surviving the winter and re-growing after mowing in 2002, and dying and breaking down with no dead mulch in 2003. The attempt to follow oats with spring-planted cover crops was not successful, partly due to the variable performance of the oats. Rape did better when planted in th e fall than in the spri ng, but this was over the mild winter, so it should be tested over a series of winter conditions. In 2001, we studied insect populations as the cover crops re-grew during the month of June after mowing in mid-May. U nder those conditions, th e rye + vetch cover crop was attractive to the adults of two importa nt species of vegetabl e pests, the tarnished plant bug and potato leafhopper, and also pr oduced a substantial number of tarnished plant bug nymphs. Thrips (mixed species) we re also active and ca ught in large numbers in wheat, rye, rye + vetch, and annual ryegrass plots. In 2002 and 2003, we studied insect populat ions earlier in the season, from April through mid to late May, with the idea that most farmers would be killing and incorporating their cover crops by the end of May. In this part of the season, we found much lower numbers of potential pests, with tarnished plant bugs on rape in early to mid- April (but not producing nymphs) and thrips on wheat in one year in mid-May. We also found a surprisingly high level of activity of parasitic wa sps during this period, and we are studying our collections of wasps in more detail to analyze what families and genera were present. Sorting and analysis of vacuum samples, pitfall samples, and additional sorting of sweep samples is still continuing, so additiona l information about this experiment may be available in the future. We did not find consistent patterns among potentially beneficial groups of microbes in the rhizosphere of th e cover crops. In general, th e numbers of bacteria of all kinds were higher in the roots of the grasses. 103 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 The most apparent impact of these results will be for farmers to consider carefully the consequences of allowing rye/vetch cover crops to re-grow after mowing. There have been several prominent organic farmers speaki ng about this practice as part of a system of weed management, but the information we have collected suggests that this practice might increase numbers of tarnished plant bugs and potato leafhoppers , both very serious pests on organic farms. Cedar Beetles: Dr. Claire Rutledge investigated two aspects of C. rufipenne 's chemical ecology in collaboration with Dr. La wrence Hanks of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Jocelyn Millar of th e University of California, Riverside and their students. Callidiellum rufipenne is native to eastern Asia and was discovered in live arborvitae in Connecticut in 1998 by Gale Ridge, Carol Lemmon and Dr. Chris Maier. The borer has since established in the southern half of Connecticut. C. rufipenne is found most frequently on plants in the familie s Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae. We confirmed that the beetles follow the typical mating strategy of Cerambyc idae; males recognize females by means of a contact pheromone in the female's epicuticle. The contact pheromone appears to consist of a single hydrocarbon. We also discovered that male C. rufipenne produce a volatile pheromone. This phero mone is consistent in chemical structure with recently discovered aggreg ation pheromones produced by males of two ash additi on, the pores which release the volatile pheromone, and the glands wh ich produce it were identified, and were consistent in location and stru cture with those of the othe r two cerambycids. The function of this volatile pheromone for C. rufipenne is under investigati on, but could potentially be exploited as a monitoring tool. Bronze Birch Borer - Dr. Rutledge examined the strategies by which the Bronze Birch Borer, Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, locates its hosts. The beetles require stressed living trees to deve lop, and thus, frequently att ack birches in landscape and nursery settings. The beetles cause consider able aesthetic and financial damage to homeowners and nurserymen in Connectic ut. In summer 2004, 27 pairs of Jaquemontii birches, one girdled and one h ealthy, were tested for attract iveness to naturally occurring birch borers. All borers chose gi rdled trees over healthy tree s, suggesting that borers can discriminate between stressed and healthy tree s. I have begun to sample and analyze the air surrounding healthy and stre ssed birches in cooperation wi th Dr. Brian Eitzer, CAES, to attempt to isolate the attractive compounds. In a sepa rate assay, 3 commercially available birch extracts, tested for attractiveness to birch borers. None of the compounds were attractive. In spring 2005, 40 birch trees were received from nursery owners to establish an orchard at Lockw ood Farm to facilitate future research. Soybean Aphid in Connecticut - The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumara, was first found in the United States in Wisconsin in the summer of 2000. Since that time it has spread to 21 states, primarily in the u pper Midwest, and 3 Canadian provinces. The predicted range of soybean aphid includes a ll of New England, but it had not yet been 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 reported from Connecticut and Massachusetts. I surveyed two sites in each state during the summer of 2004: Hamden, CT on 4 August, Cromwell, CT on 1 September, and Plainfield, MA and Conway, MA on 10 Septembe r. Soybean aphids were present at all four sites. This is the first report of s oybean aphid for Connecticut and Massachusetts. Surveys are underway for summer 2005 to esta blish if the aphid is over wintering in Connecticut or migrating fr om out-of-state each year. Requests for information : Kenneth Welch, Gale Ridge, and Rose Bonito answered questions from the public. The insect i nquiry office served 4,109 people through the year, and 693 different insect and spider sp ecies were identified. Ants, termites, bees, wasps, hemlock woolly adelgids, and pantry pests continue to be the leading pests of concern. The office served private citizens, th e pest control and real estate industries, nurseries, arborists, health departments a nd other medical professionals, museums, municipalities, libraries, stat e government, and the news media. Inquiries were made through 2,342 telephone calls (57% ), 1,233 visitors (30%), 53 4 mail submissions (13%), and other miscellaneous submissions. REGULATORY ACTIVITIES Apple scab maturity evaluation: During primary scab infection season, samples are taken every week, starting at half-green-ti p, consisting of at least 50 apple leaves that have overwintered on the orchard floor at Lockwood Farm. From these leaves, 50 pseudothecia of Venturia inequalis are dissected, mounted on mi croscope slides in acid fuchsin, and examined using a microscope. Im mature, mature, and empty ascospores are counted and tallied each week. Degree-days, using a 32-degree baseline and accumulated from half-green-tip, are determ ined. Weather data are taken from the weather station at Lockwood Farm. Phenology of the trees is also determined every week. Data on scab ascospore maturity, degree-day accumulation, and tree phenology is reported weekly to Lorraine Los at UConn, who broadcasts this information on her pomology list-serve. In 2005, the epidemic of apple scab progressed slow ly, due to cool relati vely dry conditions early in the primary scab season, and cool ni ght-time temperatures la ter in the season. Department personnel (Tim Abbey, Erin Amezzane, Jeff Fengler, Ira John Kettle, Gale Ridge, Stephen Sandrey, and Peter Tren chard) performed inspections and surveys during the past year under the su pervision of Dr. Victoria Smith. NURSERY INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION Three-hundred and twenty-eight nurseries were certified to conduct intra- and interstate business. Ther e were 880 nursery inspections during the growing season. Eight-thousand, seven-hundred and thirty-eight acres of nursery stock were examined as well as plants growing under 32,587,875-sq. ft. of greenhouse space. The majority of plants were grown in hoop houses (28,264,900 s q. ft.), followed by plastic greenhouses (2,802,143 sq. ft.) and glass gr eenhouses (1,519,000 sq. ft.). 105 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 NURSERY INSECTS The most abundant pests found in nurseries were mites on various trees and shrubs, lacebug on Pieris and Rhododendron , aphids on various trees and shrubs, black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) on Taxus and Rhododendron leafminer on Rhododendron. JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIFICATION We observed treatments of 260,623 plants at two nurseries and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with states that quara ntine nursery stock from Connecticut because of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica . One nursery, which met the containeri zed nursery stock accreditation program requirements of the United States Japane se Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 22,012 plants to other states in 2004. Four nurseries met other requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 1,573 plants to states that quara ntine plants from Connecticut. JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIF ICATION TO CANADA Three Connecticut nurseries, which me t the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Pl an, shipped 50,634 plants out of state in 2004. NURSERY DEALER PERMITS Nursery dealer permits were issued to 180 firms. One-hundred and fifty-nine of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 464 outlets. INSECT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS We assisted nurseries and private citi zens with the following problems in 2004: 1. Helped four nurseries to solve shipping and certif ication problems. 2. Inspected Rhododendron plants for 5 homeowners worr ied about the Ramorum blight problem. 3. Inspected wood lots in East Haddam, Wate rford, and Bridgewater for woodland pests. 4. Inspected furniture for a private homeow ner in Durham for insect exit holes. 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATES Three-hundred and forty-five phytosanitary inspection certificat es were issued covering the shipment of the following plant ma terials to destinations outside the United States: Plants Number Apples Gladiolas) 619 Chestnut (Unrooted cuttings) 36 Chinese tree peonies (plants) 26 Greenhouse plants 25,861 Nursery stock (containers & plants) 25,634 Orchids (plants & flasks) 1,653 Perennials (plants in tissue culture) 100 (bare root plants) 26 (plants) 8,363 Seeds (Packets) 10 Rice Plants 145 Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 110,756 SPECIAL INSPECTIONS 1. Thirty-eight inspections were made for 542 individual plants a nd bulbs to assist homeowners moving out of state. 2. One-hundred and fifty-seven inspections we re made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate: Plants Number Nursery stock (containers & bare root plants) 24,960 Perennials 254,506 Greenhouse plants 311 Christmas trees 2 Geraniums 841 107 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 3. Three tobacco growers had 173 acres insp ected for the aerial application of pesticides. 4. Ten post-entry inspections were carried out on 7,128 plants at 3 locations. At one site, 126 plants were released from quarantine. INSECT AND DISEASE SURVEYS: FOREST HEALTH SURVEY During the summer of 2004, we examined 51 permanent, one-acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluate d signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches , limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increasi ng damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to mon itor the forests over several years to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or ar e declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. GYPSY MOTH Our annual aerial survey for gypsy moth de foliation was conducted in early July 2004 and covered 1.8 million acres of urban/suburban forest in all eight Connecticut counties. Six-hundred and twenty-six acres of gypsy mo th defoliation were found in two counties. In November and December, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7 -mile grid ( 102 sites) throughout C onnecticut. At three sites, egg masses were found in numbers la rge enough to be considered a potential problem for the spring and summer of 2005. ASIAN LONGHORNED BEETLE The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis , first discovered to be attacking trees in August of 1996 in New Yo rk, has spread to within 25 miles of Greenwich in southwestern Connecticut. There is risk for beetle entry in ports because of the transportation of solid wood packing material on ships coming from areas of the world where this beetle is found. We, therefore, concentrated additional survey efforts in Connecticut in the areas of Bridgeport, Groton, New Haven and New London as well as their surrounding parks that contain a high percentage of maple, a favorite food source of the Asian longhorned beetle. All surveys and identifications, thus far, were negative.

The cuttings were sent to rooting stations in the United States and then sent to greenhouses throughout the country. Ralstonia is a bacterium which causes wilt disease. It can be transmitted through soil, contaminated irrigation water, equipment, or by personnel. Some races of Ralstonia solanacearum are present in the U.S., but the Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 is considered a serious pathogen that could affect other im portant agricultural crops. Ralstonia wilting symptoms are similar to other pathogens on geraniums such as Xanthomonas pelargonii (the agent of Bacterial Blight). The primary symptom of the disease is wilting of leaves and/or abnormal yellowing (or \"scorched\") leaves. Th is disease is deadly to geraniums. Four greenhouse growers in Connecticut received 1,600 rooted geranium cuttings from the growing stations that ha d shipped plants infested with Ralstonia. The USDA and Connecticut Agricultural Expe riment Station jointly inspected these plants. Twenty-six inspections were carried out on the greenhous es that had received the plants. Two greenhouses decided to incinerate the suspect and associated geraniums on site. The USDA and the Connecticut Agricultural Expe riment Station observe d the incineration of 1,832 plants. The other two greenhouses decided to take the suspect and associated plants to a landfill for burial. A tota l of 3,132 plants were taken to the landfill and the burial was observed. ORANGE-STRIPED OAKWORM The Orange-striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria , is a native moth that ranges from eastern Canada southward to Georgia. It is a common pest of oak species in Connecticut. Occasionally, local infestations occur when oaks have been stressed by other factors such as drought or gypsy moths. Serious defoliation can occur when this happens. The moths lay up to 500 eggs on the undersid es of an oak leaves in earl y summer and are attracted to artificial light. The caterpillars feed on the foliage, and then they burrow into the soil and build an earthen cell, where it pupates and passes the winter. On September 30, 2004, an aerial survey was conducted over Windha m, New London, Tolland and Hartford Counties. Defoliation was found in Ca nterbury (261.5 acres) in Windham County. 109 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 PINE SHOOT BEETLE One-hundred and five Christmas tree farms in 52 Connecticut towns were inspected for pine shoot beetles, Tomicus piniperda , during 2004. The inspections encompassed 1,238 acres of trees and the individual examin ations of 70,608 Christmas trees. The trees were examined by walking along the rows looki ng for damage. Pine shoot beetles were not found in Connecticut. In late November and December, we examined 35,652 Christmas trees owned by 137 dealers in 61 towns. The trees were inspect ed for over-wintering pine shoot beetle adults in the base of tree trunks or beetle dama ge. We were especially concerned about Christmas trees that were shipped in to Connecticut from states with Tomicus piniperda infestations. Pine shoot beetle s were not found in Connecticut. Fifteen inspections were carried out on pine trees shipped from infested states to housing developments in Connecticut. DAYLILY RUST A rust fungus ( Puccinia hemerocallidis) was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first time in the summer of 2000. It was found in Connecticut in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies owned by private citizens. It is now confirmed to occur in three counties. During 2004, we surveyed daylilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of this rust. One-hundred and thirty-one inspec tions were carried out on 493,393 plants. No signs of Puccinia hemerocallidis were found. HEMLOCK ADELGID The hemlock woolly adelgid , Adelges tsugae , remains an important pest of hemlock in Connecticut, spreading north ward since its coastal detec tion in 1985 and infesting all 169 towns in the state. During 2004, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woo lly adelgid. Two nurse ries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our inspectors observed treatmen ts and issued phytosanitary certificates to cover 812 plants in these shipments. RAMORUM LEAF BLIGHT Ramorum Leaf Blight is a serious plant di sease that attacks many types of plants and trees common to Connecticut. It is currently known to occur in th e Pacific Northwest on oaks, azaleas, big leaf maples, huckleberry, California bay laurel, Pacific madrone, Douglas fir, rhododendrons, and viburnum. It does not affect humans and is not a food safety concern. Sudden oak death is caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora ramorum . The pathogen is not a fungus or a bacterium, but a member of a unique group of organisms called Oomycetes. Oomycetes share some char acteristics of fungi but are biologically different. 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 During 2004, we surveyed for symptoms of Ramorum Leaf Blight. We inspected plants in nurseries and garden centers and plan ts being shipped to interstate and Canadian destinations. A total of 227 insp ections were carried signs of sudden oak death were found. As part of the National Nursery Surv ey we inspected 20 nurseries during the Spring 2004. During this survey 35,500 plants were inspected and leaf samples from symptomatic plants were submitted for lab analysis. Nine samples were ELISA positive for Phytophthora ramorum. Positive samples were sent to Beltsville for PCR confirmation; all samples were found to be negative by the Beltsvi lle lab after gene sequencing tests were performed. A nursery forest environs survey was done in conjunction with the US Forest Service. The perimeter survey was done on three larg e wholesale nurseries. One woodland plot was also surveyed. Four one hundred mete r transects were measured using GPS along nursery perimeter. The starting and ending trees marked with GPS readings and tape. The woodland plot transects measured from one st arting point tree. All host species along the transects were examined for possible symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. No infected leaves or tree cankers were found. RAMORUM LEAF BLIGHT - Trace forwards During 2004, our office investigated nine different trace forwards: Trace Forwards First Notified Last Activity Number of sites Number of Plants Imported Number of Plants remaining Number of Plants Destroyed 1 3/12/04 111 116 50 0 2 3/13/04 4/13/04 2 79 55 0 3 5/4/04 7/22/04 2 6/23/04 7/16/04 5 5,244 3 0 9/16/04 9/21/04 1 5 5 0 6 9/16/04 9/24/04 1 350 0 0 7 10/25/04 55 7,305 161 1,380 2 40 0 0 Totals 179 13,139 274 1,380 CHRYSANTHEMUM WHITE RUST During 2004, we continued to survey for Chrysanthemum white rust disease, caused by the fungus, Puccinia horiana . We inspected 965,011 chrysanthemums raised by 446 growers and dealers for the presence of chry santhemum white rust. No chrysanthemum white rust was found. SMALL JAPANESE CEDAR LONGHORN BEETLE Based on surveying with trap-logs and on r earing insects from dead wood, the exotic small Japanese cedar longhorned beetle, Callidiellum rufipenne , is established in 58 111 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Connecticut towns distributed in Fairfiel d, Hartford, Middlesex, New Haven, and New London Counties. The beetle successfully de veloped on 9 species of ornamental and wild plants in the family Cupressaceae. In the wild, the principal host was dead eastern red cedar, but Callidiellum rufipenne also infested dead co mmon juniper and Atlantic white cedar. In garden centers, the ma in hosts were stressed balled and burlaped arborvitae and other cupressa ceous landscape plants. During 2004, we inspected 27,346 plants for Callidiellum rufipenne at 77 nurseries in 52 Connecticut towns. No in fested plants were found. WAREHOUSE SURVEY FOR WOOD BORING INSECTS In early 2004, we conducted a trapping su rvey of 15 Connecticut warehouses in 5 counties to detect the possible presence of exotic wood boring insects. Lindgren funnel traps, with a chemical lure, were placed in the warehouses and checked bi-weekly for insect activity. A bark beetle predator, Thanasimus formicarius , was found for the first time in Connecticut at a New Haven County lu mber storage yard in April 2005. A single adult beetle was captured in a Lindgren funne l trap at the warehouse during a survey for exotic bark beetles and longhorned beetles. The beetle was collected by Erin Amezzane (Sturgis) and Gale Ridge and identification was confirmed by Dr. Chris Maie r, all from The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station This occurrence represents new state and county records for Connecticut. Data have been submitted to the was first found in the United States in 1967, and since then, it has spread rapidly and extensively thr ough the butternut ( Juglans cinerea The fungal spores are aerially dispersed long dist ances during cool temp eratures and overcast skies, thus having the ability to reach isolated trees. The fungus infects the tree through any openings in the bark, such as leaf s cars, natural bark cracks, and wounds. The resulting cankers can expand to the point that they girdle branches, and as more cankers develop and coalesce, they can even girdle the main trunk, which kills the tree. The fungus is usually spread on an already infected tree by rainfa ll, which washes the spores to new openings in the bark. There is still no known cure for this disease. During Summer 2004, we visited the 100 larg est butternuts in our survey and took diameter measurements. We are going to cont inue the survey with just these trees, measuring the diameter growth and health. APIARY CERTIFICATION Three-hundred and six beekeepers regi stered 2,374 colonies in 2004. Our bee inspector opened and inspected 759 colonies in areas known to have foulbrood disease. American foulbrood was found in 7 colonies and European foulbrood was found in one colony. These colonies were destroyed.112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 County Colonies Opened & Inspected Varroa Mite Positive American Foulbrood Positive European Foilbrood Wax Moth Dysentery Windham 199 20 New London 104 4 2 1 2 New Haven 215 1 Hartford 69 5 3 5 Middlesex 67 27 2 Litchfield 3 Fairfield 88 15 Tolland 14 2 Totals 759 74* 7 1 2 5 *Varroa mite totals represent infestations that were not controlled. These colonies were in the final stages of their existence. Varroa mites are present in all colonies, treated or untreated. During 2004, 400 honeybees from 3 apiaries in the towns of Easton, Wethersfield and Fairfield were examined in the laboratory for the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi . Two apiaries in Wethersfield were infested with tracheal mites. DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut has a strong link to the fore st. Approximately 60% of Connecticut's land area is classified as forest. In addition to valuable non-commodity amenities (watershed protection, w ildlife habitat, passive recreation), the forests are a valuable part of the local economy. Connecticut ha s a $500 million wood product industry of 350 firms that provide employment to 3,600 logge rs, millworkers, and others. Many of these forests were established around 1900 and have become economically valuable assets. The unbalanced age class distri bution of the oak-hickory fo rest, and most individual forest stands, presents a chal lenge to both private and public forest landowners wishing to implement sustainable forest management. Three factors are driving the necessity of developing innovative alternatives to \"high-grading\" or initiat ing regeneration harvests in these stands: obtaining a more ba lanced age-structure, increa sed public desire for partial cutting, and increased parcel ization of ownership. Crop- tree management has been proven successful in younger oak stands and c ould be a viable altern ative in older oak 113 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 sawtimber stands where maintaining high fore st cover and non-comm odity attributes are important considerations. Crop-tree management : In 1995, Dr. Jeffrey Ward began a study of crop tree management for black birch ( Betula cooperation with CT DEP-Divi sion of Forestry, Northeast Utilities, Regional Water Authority, and the Metropolitan District Commission. Black birch is an increasing component of the southern New England. In Connecticut, black birch cubic-foot volume has increased 64% since 1972. Because it had been a minor component of the forest until recently, there have been few studies that have examined its growth rate following release. Five black birch sta nds were selected for this st udy. The stands were from 20-99 years-old, and mean crop-tree diameters range d from 4.8 to 13.8 inches. Growth of crop- trees was monitored for eight years. Over the eight-year period, diameter and volume growth of completely released poles ( 4.6-10.5 inches diameter) was twice that of unreleased poles. Increased growth was noted the first year after release and showed no indication of decreasing after ei ght years. Release did not affect diameter growth of small sawtimber crop-trees (10.6-13.5 inches diam eter) until the third year after release. However, after eight years, diameter and vol ume growth was nearly forty percent greater than for unreleased trees. Release had negligib le effect on diameter and volume growth of large sawtimber crop-trees (> 13.5 inches diameter). If crop-tree management was initiated in young stands of black birch pol es (mean diameter of upper canopy trees was 4.5 inches), then the time require to grow thos e trees to diameters of 13.5 inches could be reduced by nearly 50%. The oak crop tree study found that comple te crop-tree releas e increased annual volume growth of younger northern red oak sawtimber trees by 3-9%. It is unknown whether crop tree release would also increase growth of older sawtimber oaks. A modest 1% annual increase would increase the value of the older oak sawtimber stands by nearly $7 million per year. This would provide forest owners with an incentive to retain large sawtimber while simultaneously providing a number of additional benefits including increased habitat diversity and aesthetic appeal. A new study was begun in 2003, with the additional partnership of the Torrington Water Company, to determine if crop tree management would increase growth of large, mature oak sawtimber (> 18 inches diameter) without a loss in bole quality and stand growth rates. Six study sites have been established in fully-stocked, mature oak forests. Each study site has three treatment ar eas of approximately 5 acres. Treatments are 1) an uncut control; 2) crop trees released from upper ca nopy competition on three or four sides, no other trees cut; and 3) crop trees released on one or two sides as part of a crown thinning to 60 ft2/acre of basal area. Treatments were randomly assigned after crop tree selection. At least twenty-five crop trees (~10/acre) were selected on each treatment area. Selection criteria for crop trees was: red oak group ( Q. coccinea ), codominant or dominant crown class, at least 17 ft to first fork, diameter > 18 inches, and potential grade 1 buttlog. Crop tr ees were banded with orange paint. Tree measurements were completed following the 2004 growing se ason. A 50x50m plot was located within each treatment area to monitor changes in st and volume growth. All trees with diameters > 4 inches were banded with red paint. A total of 2613 trees have been measured. Harvesting has been completed on four of the study areas. Tree measurements will be 114 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 completed following the 2005 growing season an d it is anticipated that preliminary results should be available in 2009. Behavior and influence of prescribed burning : The near-elimination of the historic fire regime (occasi onal to frequent low-intensity surface fires) of the mixed-oak forests of Connecticut has wrought several undesirable changes to ecosystem function. One of these is the inability of oaks to re generate themselves, especially on productive sites. There is growing interest in restoring fire to some semblance of its past regime in mixed-oak forests to help restore ecologica l function, especially the oak regeneration process. However, there is a lack of basi c fuels and fire behavior knowledge/information for this forest type. This dearth of basic in formation also impacts wildfire control efforts, especially in the expanding ur ban/wildland interface. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing hardwood fuel models to these fuel conditions through a series of computer simu lations and intensely monitored prescribed fires. By doing so, some of the fuels/fire behavior knowledge gap will be filled, making prescribed fire planning/implementation and w ildfire control more effective and safer. Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward and J.P. Barsky establis hed eight prescribed bur n sites on state lands in cooperation with CT DEP - Division of Forest ry. The sites represent a wide variety of fuel conditions that typically occur in mixe d-oak forests such as: blueberry, huckleberry, and mountain laurel thickets, recent and older logging slash in both clearcuts and shelterwoods, and dense fern glades. One site was burned in 2002. Fuels and regeneration data were colle cted in eight stands prepar atory for the 2002 spring fire season. Four of these sites were burned duri ng the spring of 2003. Three additional sites were burned during the spring of 2004. Te mperatures ranged upwards of 1000oF. Inventory of regeneration that returned following the fires was completed in 2005. Impact of prescribed fire on residual trees : While prescribed fire may be beneficial to enhance oak regeneration, little information is available on damage to larger trees by a fire. In 2004, we tallied all woody species (ex cept brambles) that were at least 140 cm tall were tallied within plot corners. The invent ory was delayed for one full year after the fire because many stems, although completely gird led, had live tops the first growing season after the fire. Nearly all stems less than two meters tall, and all stems with diameters > 1 cm, were still present. A tota l of 862 stems were examined. Not unexpectedly, the hotter the fire the highe r the mortality. Mortality decreased with size classes - nearly 100% of stems with di ameters less than 1 cm (~0.4\") died in all fires, and nearly all stems > 30 cm (12\" dbh) su rvived. It appears that mortality follows as a logistic mortality model. In other words, for a fire of a given intensity, mortality is near 100% until a critical diameter is reached. Mo rtality then falls sharply and very little mortality is noted for stems slightly larger than the critical diameter. This will be explored further after mortality for the 2004 fires are examined. For a given diameter, there was little difference among species in the amount of girdling. There was little difference in the proportion of oak and red ma ple that sprouted in response to severe girdling (very few birch sprouted). Heights of oak and maple sprouts were similar. These results suggest that the interaction between oak and fire is co mplicated. Perhaps, repeated fires would ultimately decrease overstory maple densities as multiple wounding increases basal rot and mechanical collapse. Relative to oak, maple is poor at compartmentalizing wounds. 115 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Each year, more and more Nutmeggers ha ve the opportunity to watch deer in their own backyard and gardens. Unfortunately, this increasingly comm on sight has a cost. Many gardeners knows the frustration of waking up to find prized roses, perennial plant beds, or vegetable gardens damaged by deer browse. In 2001, it was estimated that deer nationwide were the cause of $407 million in lo sses to field crops, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Little research has been done on th e total losses of orna mental and landscape plantings due to deer browsing statewide, but these numbers are likely to be substantial. Deer damage is not limited to plants. Deer ar e a host species for the ticks that transmit pathogens that cause Lyme disease. Connec ticut also reports a pproximately 3,300 vehicle collisions with deer annuall y, but the Department of Envi ronmental Protection estimates that the total number is cl oser to 10,000. Nationwide, an estimated 1.5 million vehicle collisions with deer occur a nnually and result in approxima tely $1.1 billion in damages, 29,000 human injuries, and 200 human fatalities. Severe browsing by large deer herds has seriously impaired natural regeneration of some Connecticut forests. Forest unde rstories have become dominated by browse resistant species such as hophor nbeam, blue beech, and stripe d maple along with exotic invasives, such as Japanese barberry, ailanthus, oriental bittersweet, and winged euonymus. Unfortunately, these browse resi stant species often have lower economic, aesthetic, and wildlife values than the sp ecies they displace. The damage caused by browsing is not limited to trees. At least 98 th reatened or endangered plants are browsed by white-tailed deer. Many spring wildflowers ( lilies, trilliums, orchids, lobelias, and buttercups) and flowering shrubs (dogwoods , viburnums, roses, and rhododendrons) are favored by deer. Change in forest structure caused by deer browse can have a negative impact on bird species that nest in the understory. White-tailed Deer and Forest Regeneration : Scott C. Williams and Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward have been conducting a study on white -tailed deer as dispersers of exotic seeds. A total of 514 deer pellet groups have been collected over three years (2002-2004) in the towns of Guilford, North Branford, Cheshire, and Norf olk. Each pellet group was collected and placed in individual sampling bags that were vernalized at 5\u00b0C for 60 days. After 60 days, pellets were removed and placed on, a nd lightly covered with, a growing medium. Planted samples were kept in a temperature controlled greenhouse with a minimum temperature of 21\u00baC. Samples were watered as needed, fertilized to encourage flowering for identification purposes, a nd retained in the greenhouse for approximately six months. Germinants were allowed to grow until they co uld be identified, at which time they were removed from the tray and discarded. Sp ecies exotic to Connecticut included 7,648 germinants of 37 species. Some of the mo st exotics included purslane with seeds, ( Plantago major ) with 29 germinated seeds. We determined deer on the research site had the potential to disper se approximately 2,000 exotic seeds per mile 2 per day throughout summer and autumn. As wh ite-tailed deer numbers in Connecticut continue to grow, so will the number of e xotic seeds dispersed into woodland settings, altering forested ecosystems by displacing native species. Another method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of ve getation protected from deer br owse to unprotected plots. 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 As part of a new cooperative research proj ect with Connecticut Chapter - The Nature Conservancy, four deer exclosure plots were expanded in 2005. Deer exclosures are six- foot tall wire mesh fences that prevent deer from browsing vegetation. Short-term observations suggest that both woody and herb aceous vegetation within exclosures has increased growth rates without th e pressure of browsing deer. Fertility Control of White-tailed Deer : The Connecticut landscape is a quilt of medium to high-density housing, fields, and forests. This fragmented landscape has created ideal conditions for white-tailed d eer and their population has exploded over the past few decades. Hunting to control deer populations in many, if not most, areas of medium to high-density housing is not feasible because of resident's safety concerns and the general opposition to any form of lethal control. In response to this conundrum, research was initiated to examine al ternative, non-lethal methods of controlling deer populations by Dr . Uma Ramakrishnan and Scott Williams in 2001. A novel technique to sterilize male deer (b ucks), injecting a scarring agent directly into each cauda epididymis, was tested us ing thirty-seven captured bucks. Treatment involved the capture of animals with a dart rifle and a subsequent hand injection. Little medical equipment was necessary for treatment as it requires a simple injection through a syringe, which is beneficial as postoperative care would not be possi ble on a free-ranging animal. Analysis of semen from previously tr eated animals indicated the procedure led to azoospermia (sterility) in animals the year of treatment and one year post-treatment. Animals remain in the population, grow and shed antlers annually, and continue to engage in mating behavior. The procedure appears to be permanent. Analysis of Deer/Vehicle Collisions : Information from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's Deer Kill Incident Reports is be ing entered into a database for 2003. This information will be added to a database containing similar information for 2000, 2001, and 2002. Location of accidents is indicated on reports; latitude and longitude coordinates were obt ained using DeLorme Street At las USA. Analysis of data thus far indicates collisions are most lik ely to happen in October, November, and December. Collisions often occur during morning and evening hours, corresponding to peak traffic and animal activity. Using spat ial analysis of data in the geographic information system ArcView 3.3 and extens ion CrimeStat 2.0, it was determined that male deer are more likely to be involved in collisions in urban a nd suburban areas rather than female deer. Further analysis will ex amine the influence of land use, vegetation cover, and regional deer popul ation densities on predicting hotspots for deer/vehicle collisions. This will assist in taking measur es to increase human health and safety. Effect Of Shade On Fertilizer Use And Composition Of Greenhouse Tomato: Farmers produce tomatoes in greenhouses to capitalize consumer demand for fresh, native vegetables with improved taste and nutri tive qualities. Typically plants are started in spring, but much of the production occurs during the hottest months of summer. Dr. Martin P. N. Gent began experiments in 2003 to compare the yield and quality of various cultivars of tomatoes grown in greenhouses th at were cooled by cove ring with reflective aluminized shade cloth. Houses that were co mpared had either no shade, or the shade cloth reduced light transmissi on into the greenhouse by 15%, 30% or 50%, compared to greenhouses only covered with the usual double- layer of clear polyethylene film. These 117 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 treatments are referred to as 0, 15%, 30% or 50% shade, respectively. The shade was applied in early June, corresponding to the st art of fruit production, and the start of the first warm weather. The houses remained shaded for the rest of the summer, and fruit was picked into August. The tomato plants were grown from seeds germinated in January, and the seedlings were transplant ed into the greenhouses in March. Shade tended to increase the fraction of fruit that was marketable in these experiments, Total yield was reduced by shade, but marketable yield was affected less. Cracked skin was the defect most affected by shade. About one third of the fruit produced in non-shaded greenhouses had cracked skin, wh ereas only one quarter of the tomatoes from greenhouses with 50% shade had cracked skin. Increased shading also slightly decreased to proportion of fruit blossom end rot. Shade is likely to also affect the composition of the fruit, because it will alter plant growth and transpiration, and the uptake of water and nu trients. These aspects were examined to see if the supply of water and/or nutrients should be al tered for plants grown under shade, in order to improve or modify composition and quality of tomato fruit. Tissues were sampled a month or more af ter the application of shade in 2003 and 2004 and analyzed for elemental composition, carbohydrates, and dry matter content. The primary effect of shade on composition of fruit was to decrease the soluble solids, i.e., the fraction of fruit weight in dr y matter. When analyzed as a linear trend, dry matter content of the fruit decreased from 6.0 percent in a house with no shade, to 5.7 percent in a house with 50% shade. When anal yzed as a linear trend, there was no effect of shade on the various elemental nutrients in the fruit such as potassium, calcium, or magnesium. Fruit from the intermediate shade treatments had the highest concentration of phosphorus in both years. In summary, shade de creased slightly the dry matter percentage of fruit tissue, but it did not affect the elemental composition. Shade is likely to have greater effect on composition of leaf blades, compared to other tissues, as leaves are the chemical factory of th e plant; the site of photosynthesis and transpiration. Shading the gr eenhouse affected the concentration of most elements in leaf blades. The concentration of total nitr ogen, nitrate nitrogen, and potassium increased in leaves in proportion to the degree of shad e. Although the general trend was an increase of magnesium and phosphorus with shade, in both years the unshaded treatment resulted in higher concentrations than 15% shade. Sh ade affected nitrogen differently in the two years; the increase of nitroge n with shade was much greater in 2004 than in 2003. In part this was because there was substantial change fr om year-to-year in concentrations of total nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium in leaf blad es. Concentrations of these elements were 25% greater in 2004 than in 2003. This could be due to the use of different cultivars, sampling at a different time in the crop cycle, or a choice of leaves of slightly different physiological age in the two years. The petiole is the part of the transport pathway in the plant that connects the leaf to the stem. It is likely to be sensitive to the concentration of nutrients moved in the transpiration stream from roots to leaves. Shade affected the c oncentration of total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, potassium, and magne sium in petioles. Petioles had about half the total nitrogen found in leaf blades, and the concentrati on in petioles in creased only slightly with shade, by 10 percent over the unshaded condi tion. Petioles had about three times as much potassium as leaves, and the potassium increased with shade far more in petioles than in leaves. Magnesi um in petioles decreased sli ghtly with shade. It is 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 interesting to note that shade had no effect on calcium in either leaf blades or petioles. Movement of calcium is known to be affected by rate of transpiration, which presumably was affected by shade. Total nitrogen, pota ssium, calcium, and magnesium in petioles varied from year to year. Potassium a nd total nitrogen decreased from 2003 to 2004, while magnesium increased. Within each year, there were variations in nutrient content by cultivar. In particular, there was less potassium in fruit of Buffalo than in fruit of Quest in each year. Quest also had a high amount of calcium in fr uit. In 2004, the concentration of nitrogen in leaf blades was less in Buff alo and Quest than in Cabernet and Jet Star. Leaf blades of Buffalo had more calcium and phosphorus than di d leaf blades of the other cultivars. One would expect shade to affect the uptak e of water and nutrients into plants, as it affected the composition of the vegetative ti ssues. We kept records of the daily supply of water and the volume of solution drained from each trough of plants. We also measured the concentration of nutrients in th e solution supplied to the plants, and in the solution drained from the troughs. The daily average volume of solution supplied and drained was calculated over the period of sh ading in each year. This corresponded to the months of June and July in 2003. In 2004, it corresponded to the period from mid-June until the end of August. The uptake per plant pe r day of water or nutrients was calculated from the difference between the amount suppl ied and the amount lost in water drained from the plants. The duration of each wateri ng was modified for each shade condition so the supply of water matched the uptake by the plants. Increasing shade decreased the uptake of water per plant in both years. There was no effect of shade on electric conductivity, a measure of the sum of salts dissolved in solution. This indicated that the plants had a similar ratio of water to nutrient uptake under all shade treatments. Shade decreased the uptake of both nitrogen and potassium in both years, and in both years shade had a gr eater effect on uptake of potassium than on uptake of nitrogen. The uptake of water and nutrients varied from year to year. Plants took up more water and nutrients in 2003 than in 2004. The wa ter supply per plant per day varied from 2.4 to 1.9 L in 2003, and from 2.4 to 1.7 L in 2004, depending on the shade treatment. The uptake of water per plan t per day varied from 2.1 to 1.7 L in 2003, and from 2.0 to 1.5 L in 2,004. The nitrate concentration in the solution supplied to the plants was higher in 2003 than in 2004, and the uptake of nitrogen was slightly higher in 2003 than in 2004. Nitrogen uptake per plant per day ranged from 0.28 to 0.23 g in 2003, and from 0.24 to 0.18 g in 2004, depending on the shade treatment . Potassium uptake ranged from 0.40 to 0.33 g in 2003, and from 0.39 to 0.30 g in 2004. In part, plant uptake differed between years because the schedule for measurement of the drainage and slab solutions differed between years. In 2003, the analysis was restrict ed to the months of June and July when the plants were still growing vigorously. In 2004, the analysis continued into August when there was less vigorous growth, and plan ts took up less water and nutrients due to declining sunlight. There are about 50 growers in Connectic ut who use greenhouses to extend the production season of tomatoes. Whereas they ca n sell unblemished tomatoes at retail for up to $3/lb, those fruit with cracked skin or othe r defects have to be discarded or sold at a low price. The effort to pick the crop incr eases with the total yi eld, regardless of how marketable it is. Labor for picking is the mo st significant single cost of production for 119 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 greenhouse tomatoes in the summer. Shading will decrease this labor cost to the extent that it decreases the amount of fruit that is picked but unmarketable. Thus, shading will reduce the labor cost of picking and culling a crop of tomatoes, in proportion to the decrease in the fraction of unmarketable fru it. From my experience, shade could reduce by 10% the cost of picking greenhouse tomatoes. The New Crops Program: The network of farmer's markets in Connecticut's major cities and densely populated suburbs, and the numerous roadside stands that dot the Connecticut landscape, continue to provide oppor tunity for growers to sell directly to the consumer and receive higher retail prices for their produce. The \"New Crops Program\" continues to provide growers with informa tion about profitable pr oduction of niche crops, especially those that are prized by the burgeoning immigrant population. In 2004, emphasis was placed on onions, leeks, heirloom tomatoes, ca uliflower, jilo, calabaza, Japanese plums, and pawpaws. Sheet Composting of Oak and Maple Leaves : Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are tu rning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer und ecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf d ecomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting operati on. This is also a situ ation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predomin ance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr. Ab igail Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2003 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. Yields of lettuce, peppers, and edible soybeans were compared to yields from the control plots where no leaves were added. All plots received the same amount of 10-10-10 fertil izer applied at the recommended rate for vegetable production (1300 lbs/A). In 2004, le ttuce yields were virtually the same, averaging 1.3 lbs/head, for pl ots amended with oak leaves and the control plots. Plots amended with undecomposed maple leaves averaged 1.2 lbs/head. The greatest pepper yields were from plots amended with oak leaves (5.4 lbs/plant) compared to plots amended with maple leaves (5.2 lbs/plant) and the control plots (5.0 lbs/plant). Plots amended with maple leaves and the control plot s averaged the greatest soybean yields (16 lbs/plot) compared to plots amended with oa k leaves (15 lbs/plot ). It appears that applications of oak or maple leaves are not deleterious to vegetable production but the experiment will be continued to determine the effect of repeated applications of oak or maple leaves. Utilization Of Compost In Onion And Leek Production: Previous studies have shown that soils amended with compost incr ease onion yields as much as 40%. However, little research has been done determining the effectiveness of compost when used as a mulch. Compost mulch could eliminate the need for herbicides for weed control or reduce the need for mechanical cultivation. In leek production, soil is usually mounded to 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 blanch the lower portion of the shank. Using compost would blanch the leek and also improve the soil. In this experiment, conducte d at Lockwood Farm and at the Valley Lab in Windsor, Dr. Maynard determined the e ffectiveness of compost (incorporated and surface mulch) in onion and leek producti on. The four treatments included: compost incorporated into the soil, compost as a surface mulch, incorporated compost plus compost mulch, and an unamended control. All plots received the same amount (1300 lbs/A) of 10-10-10 fertilizer. Yield of both crops from the various compost treatments were compared to the unamended control plot s. In addition, the le ngth of the blanched shank in the leeks was measured. Two cultiv ars of leeks (Jersey and Primor) and two cultivars of onion (Corona and Daytona) were grown. At Windsor, in 2004, plots amended with compost plus a compost mulch and plots amended with compost and no mulch averaged 14 oz/leek (cv. Jersey) compar to 12 oz/leek for plots mulched with compost. Leeks from the unamended control plot averaged 11 oz/leek. For cv. Primor, plots with compost incorporated and no mulch had the greatest yield (12 oz/leek) compared to plots mulched with compost a nd the unamended control plots (11 oz/leek). Plots amended with compost plus compost mulch averaged 10 oz/leek. The longest blanched shanks of cv. Jersey were from the mulched plots (som e with incorporated compost, some without) (7.5 inches) compared to 7.4 inches from the incorporated compost plots and the unamended control plot s. For cv. Primor, the longest blanched shanks were from plots mulched with compost (10.7 inches) to plots mulched with compost with incor porated compost (8.8 inches) and plots amended with incorporated compost only (8.5 inches). The unamended control plots averaged 8.2 inches. There were no differences in the av erage diameter of the leeks between the treatments. For onions (cv. Corona), the greatest yields were from plots amended with compost and compost mulch (8.3 oz/onion) co mpared to 7.7 with Plots amended with inco rporated compost averaged oz/onion compared to 6.8 oz/onion from the uname nded control plots. For cv. Daytona, the greatest yields were from the compost mu lch plots (14.8 oz/onion) compared to the incorporated compost plots plus mulch (12.3 oz /onion) and the incorporated compost plus mulch plots (12.0 oz/onion). The unamended control plots averaged 10.8 oz/onion. For both cultivars, the mulch treatments had a hi gher percentage of the marketable Jumbo and Colossal sizes (> 3 inches in diameter) comp ared to the incorporat ed compost plots and the unamended controls. Results from Lockwood Farm followed the same trends. Thus, the mulch treatments could increase in come from onion production by increasing production of higher quality, marketable onions . To determine any cumulative effects of the compost additions, this experiment will be continued annually on the designated plots for one additional year. Heirloom Tomato Trials: Interest and sales of heirl oom tomatoes have increased dramatically in the past 10 years. More and more consumers are willing to forego appearance for that real old-fashioned tomato taste. Knowledge of high yielding cultivars and cultural details would be nefit growers, especially those who serve inner city consumers who purchase these vegetables at local farmers markets throughout the Northeast. But growing heirloom tomatoes can be a challenge. Heirlooms tend to have poor disease resistance and ha ve lower yields when to compared to hybrid tomatoes. They are also more susceptible to cracking due to their tender skin. In 2004, Dr. Maynard 121 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 evaluated ten cultivars of ethnic heirloom to matoes for yield and quality at Windsor and Mt. Carmel. Average yield at Windsor was 34.8 lb /plant compared to 21.4 lb/plant at Mt. Carmel. At Windsor, yield of Mo rtgage Lifter was greatest ( 41.2 lb/plant) with Pineapple, Giant Belgian, and Old German exceeding 38 lb /plant. At Mt. Carmel, yield of Pineapple was greatest (26.5 lb/plant) with Old Germ an, Giant Belgian, and Abraham Lincoln exceeding 22 lb/plant. Omar's Lebanese produced the largest fruit at both sites, averaging 13.8 oz at Mt. Carmel and 27.0 oz at Winds or. These trials will continue in 2005. Cauliflower Trials: Recent developments in the fast-food industry to provide low- carbohydrate foods to diet-cons cious consumers, prompted a replacement of mashed potatoes with mashed cauliflower. Res earch between 1986-1994 tested forty-seven cultivars of cauliflower for yield and quality. Most of the cultivars tested are no longer available from seed companies. To evaluate yield and quality of cauliflower cultivars, released since 1988, Dr. Maynard evaluated 19 cultivars for spring and fall harvest at Windsor and Mt. Carmel. In spring, average yi eld of 19 cultivars at Windsor was 9.1 T/A compared to 5.6 T/A at Mt. Carmel. At Winds or, spring yield of Attribute was greatest (14.1 T/A) compared with Freedom, Wentworth, and Sy mphony (11 T/A). At Mt. Carmel, spring yield of Freedom was greatest (9.2 T/A) with Attribute, Cumberland, and Wentworth exceeding 7.5 T/A. In fall, average yield of 10 cultivars at Windsor was 10.2 T/A compared to 7.6 T/A at Mt. Carmel. At Wi ndsor, fall yield of Freedom was greatest (14.0 T/A) with Minuteman, Attribute, a nd Rovella exceeding10.9 T/A. At Mt. Carmel, yield of Minuteman was greatest (11.3 T/A) with Freedom, Majestic, and Early Dawn exceeding 9.8 T/A. In spring, plants of all cul tivars required tying of leaves to insure blanching of the rapidly expanding curd. In fall, most cultivars had tightly furled wrapper leaves that did not require ty ing. In fall, plants of late-maturing Absolute, Apex, Artica, Cumberland, Phoenix, and Wentworth produced le ss than 30% marketable heads at both sites. This suggests than an earlier planting date in mid-July for late-maturing cultivars would be required to ensure matu rity rather than the August 1st planting date for the 2004 crop. Jilo - Moisture Conservation Trials: Jilo ( Solanum gilo a solanaceous plant to eggplant. This tropi cal vegetable is grown principa lly in Nigeria. Its culture was transported to central and southern Br azil where it has become a minor crop. Its principal use is in a vegetable stew (ratat ouille) and sweet and sour mixes with chicken and pork. In 1998, a Bethel grower obtained seeds from a member of the Brazilian community in the Waterbury-Danbury area (estimated population 4500). The Connecticut Department of Agriculture obtained some of the seeds and sent them to the Experiment Station for further testing. We found that jilo grows well in Connecticut's climate and can produce up to 11 lb/plant when mulched with black plastic to warm the soil. We also found that jilo flowers abort when subjected to moisture stress. In this experiment, use of plastic mulch or drip irrigation to improve the moisture content of the soil throughout the growing season to prevent fruit abortion was compared to untreated controls. Average yield of fruit from cv. Comprido Verde Clar o was 10.6 lb/plant in plants grown with black plastic mulch and 9.7 lb/plant with dr ip irrigation compared to 8.6 lb/plant in control plots. Black plastic mulch not only significantly increased total yield/plant compared to the controls, but also increased early yields in the first 4 weeks of the harvest period. 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Calabaza - Selection for Early Maturity: Calabaza squash, also known as tropical pumpkin, is mostly grown in tropical and semi tropical climates. Calabaza is highly prized by Hispanic consumers. It was iden tified by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture as one of the most sought-after vegetables at Conne cticut's 65 farmers' markets. In 2003, one plant of La Estrella produced mature fruit in only 90 days on twelve foot long vines. Early maturing fru it are generally found on the vine within two feet of the planting site. Fruit that mature in 90 days is appealing to northern growers because the majority of fruit can mature befo re frost. With a traditional maturity of 120 days, some fruit that form late on the vine do not reach maturity. We saved the seeds from the fruit planted them at Mt. Carmel and Windsor in 2004. At Windsor, 38% of the plants produced early-maturing fruit (90 days), while only 4% produced early fruit at Mt. Carmel. The greater success at Windsor ma y be due to an adjacent cover crop of buckwheat, a known bee attractant, which help ed to pollinate early forming female flowers. At. Mt. Carmel, the adjacent cove r crop of soybeans did not attract bees. Specialty Fruit Variety Trials : As wholesale marketing of major tree fruits becomes unprofitable, many Connecticut growers ar e turning to retail sales of their fruit. For a retail operation to be successful, there must be a diversity of products. Thus, many growers are interested in adding minor specialty fruits to their operations. In response to this grower interest, Dr. Maynard in 2001 expanded the New Crops Program at the Station to include fruits. This trial, also repeated at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, includes 12 cultivar/rootstock combinations of Japanese plum and 4 cultivars of pawpaws. In their first year of production, the Japanese plum Shiro had the greatest yields (3.2 lb/tree) with Fortune averagi ng 2.9 lb/tree. In addition, in Spring 2003, 210 beach plum seedlings were planted at Lockwood Farm and 96 at the Valley Lab. These seedlings were raised at Cornell University from seeds collected from 35 sites from Maine to Delaware. The trees will be evaluate d annually and select elite individuals will be propagated as possible cultivars in th e future. In their second growing season, seedlings from Broadkill Beech, Delaware aver aged the greatest growth (24.8 inches) at Lockwood Farm while seedlings from Cape May, New Jersey averaged 22.4 inches. At Windsor, seedlings of a named cultivar (Ocean Side) averaged the greatest growth (29.7 inches). Wine Grapes: Studies were initiated by Dr. William Nail in 2004 and 2005 to help determine cultural practices for growi ng high quality wine grapes profitably in Connecticut. The wine grape industry in Conn ecticut has rapidly e xpanded since the first Farm Winery in the state opened in 1979. Ther e are currently 17 wineri es with a Farm or Commercial Winery license, with 2 or 3 mo re scheduled to open in 2005. The existence of these wineries adds substantially to local economies, as local re staurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts, and others close to wineries receive increased busin ess. The Connecticut Wine Trail brochure, published by the Connec ticut Farm Wine Council, is the most popular brochure in Department of Tourism travel offices. Wine grape growers and Farm Wineries face several challenges. Farm Wineries are required to include a minimu m of 25% state-grown fruit in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard. Cons ecutive very cold wint ers in 2003 and 2004 123 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold hardy varieties, and ha ve driven up prices for purchasing out of state fruit. Little in formation is available to growers regarding cultural information for growing more cold hard y and disease resistant hybrid varieties in Connecticut. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The i ndustry requires incr eased production via better management practices in existing vi neyards and improved variety selection in newly planted vineyards. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera : Dr. Nail established a planting of 300 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summer 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tolerance to severe wi nter freezes. The first (small) crop of grapes from this plot is anticipated in 2006, and vari ous cultural experiments will be initiated to determine better strategies for optimum yield and fruit quality. Spacing and training in hybrid varieties . A new planting of the hybrid varieties St. Croix, Cayuga White, and Traminette wa s established in May, 2005 at a private grower's vineyard. St. Croix and Cayuga White are among the most widely planted red and white varieties, respectively, in the state. Traminette is a relatively new release from the Cornell breeding program that shows much promise. Hybrid varieties have different growth habits and management issues than V. vinifera , which may involve fundamental issues both before and after planting. Plants of all three varieties we re planted at six and eight foot spacings, and will be grown on differe nt training systems: low wire, Vertically Shoot Positioned (VSP), Hudson River Umbrella (HRU), Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), and another divided canopy system such as Scott Henry. Those on six foot spacing will also be pruned to both cane and cordon systems. The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help maxi mize their production, as well as possibly demonstrating that some systems are not efficient in Connecticut. A planting of Seyval Blanc, Chambourcin, Villard Blanc, and Villard Noir at Lockwood Farm was rejuvenated in 2004, and vi nes were either cordon or cane pruned in 2005 to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Yield and fruit quality parameters will be determined beginning in the 2005 harvest season. Cultivar and clonal evaluation: Previously established e xperimental plots at two private grower's vineyards and the Valley La boratory were evalua ted beginning in 2004. One vineyard had been established to comp are Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cabernet Sauvignon has displayed high vine mortality and poor fruit quality due to lack of ripeness. Cabernet Franc and Merlot both produced good quality fruit, although yields in Merlot were slightly lowe r. There may be differences in performance of different clones and/or root stocks for these two varieties, but data will have to be collected through the 2006 growing season before any conclusions can be drawn. Another vineyard compared several V. vinifera and hybrid varieties. Hybrids yield more than most vinifera varieties. Data from this vineyard will also be collected through the 2006 growing season. In 2004, Riesling fruit was c onsiderably less mature at harvest than any other white variety, indicating the need to harvest it later than other varieties or, if all varieties are treated the same to consider not planting it. 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 A new study will be established at Lo ckwood Farm to compare cultivars of V. vinifera and hybrids. This study will be coordinated with rese archers from other states throughout the country, which should help answer the questions \"What are the criteria for selecting a particular variety?\" and \"What cultivar(s) is most suited to my situation?\" PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Ramorum Blight/Phytophthora ramorum : In collaboration with Dr. Sharon Dougl as, Dr. Marra has been performing the USDA-mandated assays for detection of P. ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Oregon, or Washingt on. The process begins with a serological test called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. If a sample tests positive by ELISA, DNA is extracted from it and then analyzed for P. ramorum -specific nucleotide sequences using a the real-time PCR assay that will su pplant it, are used to determine whether or not the Phytophthora species detected in the ELISA is P. ramorum . Although the nested and real-time PCR assays are currently done at a USDA facility in Beltsville, Maryland, we are in the process of havi ng our labs certified by USDA for P. ramorum diagnostics. Dr. Marra has also routin ely attempted to culture P. ramorum from ELISA- positive material, and as a result of th ese efforts, he succeeded in isolating P. ramorum from three rhododendrons that had been samp led from Connecticut plant centers in November 2004, constituting the first isolation of P. ramorum in New England. Perhaps more importantly, P. ramorum was successfully re-isolated from the same infected plants in January 2005, after the plants had been out side and exposed to night-time temperatures as low as -15\u00baC. This constituted the first evidence suggesting that P. ramorum may be able to overwinter in the northeastern United States. Drs. Douglas and Marra have been successful in obtai ning USDA-APHIS-PPQ permits for limited handling of P. ramorum cultures. Dr. Marra is awaiting results from an application for a permit to use P. ramorum for research purposes, including performing leaf inoculations. Dr. Marra has worked with Dr. Douglas in readying their labs , in addition to a new lab (see below), for inspection and certi fication by USDA-APHIS-PPQ as a regional laboratory for P. ramorum diagnostics. This has involved the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), conforming to guidelines outlined by PPQ in order to guarantee the veracity of results and minimi ze the potential for accidental escape of the pathogen. Central to this effort has been the creation of a ne w laboratory, designed by Dr. Marra and adjacent to his current laborator y, that will be used for nested PCR, real- time PCR, and electrophoresis. This \"Mol ecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory\" will incorporate state-of-the-art equipment, a nd along with Dr. Marra's and Dr. Douglas' current labs, will be equipped with air-handling equipment that will minimize the chances for pathogen escape. In the past year, Dr. Marra has pr ocessed 185 nursery samples for the 2004 National Survey and 56 nursery samples for the Trace Forward survey. While none of the ELISA positives from the National Survey proved to be due to P. ramorum , five of 125 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 the ELISA positives from the Trace Forward survey were confirmed by USDA to be P. ramorum , based on the nested PCR a ssay. Dr. Marra cultured P. ramorum from three of these nested PCR positives. Nursery inspectors obtained perimeter soil samples from the infected nurseries, but none could be shown to harbor P. ramorum . Impact : P. ramorum is a pathogen of growing con cern in Connecticut because of the many species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this concern centers on C onnecticut's significant nursery industry, which at over $1 billion in annual production ranks Connecticut am ong the ten largest in the country. Nurseries found to ha ve plants infected with P. ramorum are effectively quarantined until rigorously demonstrated to be clear of the pathogen, a process that can take several months. Therefore, Ramorum Blight, independent of its impact on our forests and landscapes, can have a significan t impact on the state' s economy. Many of the most susceptible hosts\u2014eastern red oa k, rhododendron, lilac, mountain laurel, and viburnum, to name a few\u2014are significant pa rts of the nursery industry as well as Connecticut forests and lands capes. Given that the eastern United States, including Connecticut, is considered at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the po ssible release of the pathoge n into the environment is warranted. Through the new Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laborator y, Dr. Marra's goal is to accelerate and refine our ability to id entify infected plants in the nursery, garden center, forest, and landscap e, greatly increasing our ch ances of averting a Ramorum Blight epidemic. Additionally, developm ent of a laboratory fully equipped for P. ramorum and Ramorum Blight diagnostics, as well as the experience gained from working with and studying Phytophthora species, including P. ramorum , will permit Dr. Marra to competitively participate in extramurally funded research on P. ramorum as well as other important plant pathogens. Chestnut research: Pamela Sletten pollinating chestnut trees. Nutrients in chestnuts: Dr. Anagnostakis has found that nut weight of chestnuts is determined by the genotype of the female (nut bearing) parent, and we ight varies little no matter what the pollen source. However, when she analyzed nuts from controlled crosses of chestnut trees for protein, total fat, car bohydrate, and fatty acid content, she found that none of the levels of any of these nutrien ts were dependent on the female parent. Amounts were different in recipr ocal crosses, indicating that the pollen parent strongly influences these components. Other studies ha ve reported that fat a nd protein levels are important in food acceptance, and levels of i ndividual fatty acids affect food storage life and flavor. American chestnut s had the most unsaturated fats and the most oleic acid 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 (reported to be a flavor com ponent), but also had high leve ls of linoleic acid which reduces shelf life. The hybrid combination with the most oleic acid had little linoleic acid, which would be desirable for marketing. Impact: The Connecticut (and the national) chestnut industry has been steadily growing, providing additional income for farmer s with small and large orchards. Finding ways to increase nut value is important for maximizing income. These results will provide growers with information to help th em make decisions about which cultivars to plant or graft in their orchards and which to plant as pollenizers. Butternut pathogen studies: Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum is the fungus that kills butternut trees and is now widespread within the U.S. range of the tree. Dr. Anagnostakis has grown eight strains of this pathogen in the laboratory and tested th em for the presence of viruses that might affect their virulence. The strains (from MN, WI, AR, TN, and NC) were quite different in their temp erature requirements for growth, and seven of them had viruses. These will now be tested for virule nce in butternut seedlings in the greenhouse. In addition, 55 seedling butter nuts from Tennessee were plante d in the Mattatuck State Forest under three large (diseased) native butte rnut trees. These will be monitored for presence of the disease. Impact: Although few butternut trees have su rvived in Connecticut, a biological control such as that used against chestnut blight disease could allow this important hardwood species to be re planted in our state. Aerobiology: Corn pollen dispersal: The recent introduction of genetically modified (GM) corn into agricultural production has sparke d renewed interest in quantifying the aerial dispersal of corn pollen. Off-site moveme nt of pollen makes possible crosses of GM varieties with corn in non-GM organic and conventional production fields. Maize is a wind-pollinated, outcrossing species for which the transfer of genetic information via pollen depends on several processes including: pollen production, atmo spheric transport, deposition on silks, and successf ul fertilization. Of central importance is the ability of pollen grains to reach the silks and fertilize the ovules, which will become the kernels of corn. Drs. Aylor and Boehm are developing a mathematical model for maize gene flow that incorporates all of the majo r biological and physical processes. Data were collected during 2003 and 2004 to help validate the transport part of the model. Maize pollen was sampled at altitudes up to 80 m above ground level (AGL) over cornfields using airborne, radio-controlled, remote-piloted vehicles (RPVs) outfitted with remotely operated pollen samplers and at 3, 5, and 9 m AGL near the center of the fields using tower-based Rotorod samp lers. Usually, two RPVs were flown simultaneously at heights of about 30 m a nd 60 m AGL, while a third RPV was flown upwind of the source to sample for incoming pollen. Maximum measured maize pollen concentrations at 30 m and 60 m AGL were 24.6 and 2.5 grains m -3, respectively. The 127 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 LS model was used to calculate pollen movement in the corn canopy and adjacent atmospheric surface layer. Wind statistics used in the LS model were based on Monin- Obukhov similarity theory. To compare predic ted and observed concentrations across all sampling days, values of C were normalized by u* and Q to form the dimensionless grouping Cu*/Q. The agreement between mode led and measured values of Cu*/Q was highly significant ( r = 0.41, P < 10-5, n = 136). The high degree of variation indicated by the correlation coefficient larg ely reflects the natural variability in the pollen release and atmospheric transport processes. Overall, the mean modeled value of Cu*/Q was only 3.4% greater than the measured mean, and there was no significant difference between them. These results indicate that the LS model can accurately predict maize pollen transport on the on-farm scale. In addition, th e model can serve as an important tool for deriving realistic boundary conditions for modeling longer distan ce transport using models of the convective boundary layer. The LS model described in the preceding paragraph is limited to the atmospheric surface layer, which involves altitudes of about 100 m AGL. The entire atmospheric boundary layer is frequently unstable during periods of pollen release, when pollen transport above the crop canopy will be dominated by convective updrafts and downdrafts in which altitudes of 1,000 to 2,000 m AGL are important. Drs. Boehm and Aylor are developing a Lagrangian stochastic (LS) model of transport in the convective boundary layer (CBL) to be combined with our current surface-layer model to study pollen transport over a broad rang e of distance scales. In the CBL model, the trajectories of a large number of individua l particles are simulated base d on the turbulence properties of the CBL, as represented by a vertically varying probability dens ity function (PDF) of vertical velocity. We have modified the tr ansport equations in an existing CBL LS model for weightless tracer particle s to allow simulation of par ticles with non-negligible fall velocity, such as corn pollen. The modificati on involves: 1) subtra cting the fall velocity in the calculation of the vertical particle displacement, and 2) making a new adjustment to the deterministic acceleration term in the vertical velocity increment equation to account for the effect of the fall velocity i nduced change in particle altitude on the calculation that maintains a particle's relative position along the ve rtically varying vertical velocity PDF. These modifications significantly affect the model results compared with previous LS models of the CBL that ignore these processes. In particular, near a source at the bottom of the CBL the ve rtically integrated particle concentration decreases rapidly as a significan t number of particles are deposited before they have a chance to enter an updraft. In addition, the importance of the local minimum in near- surface concentration found at downwind dist ances on the order of several km is increased. Our current data cover only very short downwind distances and low altitudes, and measurements at greater distances and higher altitudes are required. This coming summer, we will be collecting data from near-surface sensors and aircraft-based instruments at greater downwind distances and higher altitudes than we have previously employed. Due to the intrinsic variability of turbulent transport in the atmosphere and the relatively small pollen concentrations at higher altitudes, we will require long averaging times involving many replications to validate of our CBL LS model. Effective pollen transport (gene flow) depends on viable pollen reaching and fertilizing the ovules on target plants. Our earlier studies have shown that maize pollen can survive in the atmosphere for 2 to 3 hr. Therefore, pollen survival does not appear to 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 be a major limitation to gene flow for di stances up to several km, but may enter significantly into future calcu lations based on convective bo undary layer (CBL) models. Pollen deposition is the primary process lim iting transport in the surface layer, which underscores the importance of coupling an accura te surface layer model, such as the LS model presented herein, with a CBL model to examine pollen transport over longer distances important for off-farm (trans- boundary) gene flow. The LS model being developed will give a method for doing this and, thus, should be an important part of an overall model of gene flow in maize. Impact: Maize ( Zea mays L.) is one of the world's most important crops, with 80 million acres, annually worth about $21 billion do llars, grown in the U. S. alone. Several useful traits have been incorporated into th e genome of corn usi ng genetic engineering, and today more than 40% of the U.S. corn acreage is planted to GM corn (mostly BT corn and Roundup-Ready corn). The widespread adoption of these engineered crops has sparked interest in quantifying th e potential for gene flow in the environment. Maize is a wind-pollinated, outcrossing species for which ge netic information is transferred between maize plants via pollen dispersal in the atmosphere. The mathematical model of aerial dispersal of corn pollen and maize gene flow being developed by us will allow for objective evaluations of the risks of off- site pollen movement, and will provide a framework for improving strategies for regul ating off-site gene flow, estimating the potential off-target effects of GM pollen, and determining the impact of off-site movement of GM pollen on the potential market ability of non-GM corn. Applications of the model include establishment of isolation gui delines for field testing new genetic traits incorporated into open-pollinated plants and evaluation of regional cropping plans where conflicts might arise between conventional and organic fa rm communities. Having the means for a better resolution of gene flow in maize will have an impact on expanding U. S. exports to foreign markets and on the im proved purity of hybrid seed produced by U. S. companies. Asparagus disease management: Biocontrol with earthworms: The failure to re-estab lish asparagus in abandoned fields is a worldwide phenomenon called the \"r eplant problem.\" Thr ee factors have been identified as causal to the replant pr oblem: 1) high soil densities of the Fusarium pathogens that cause Fusari um crown and root asparagi and F. proliferatum ), 2) decaying residues from the old crowns and roots that are toxic to young plants and cause stunting and poor growth, and 3) the toxic effect that these residues have on beneficial microbes such as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) and fluorescent pseudomonads. Through their feeding, earthworms have the ability to quickly break down crop residues and concentrat e beneficial microbes in their castings. Dr. Elmer established greenhouse experiments to determine whether or not earthworms cohabitating in the soil with asparagus transpla nts could affect diseas e in replanted soil. In the first greenhouse study, cohabitating earthw orms with asparagus plants in infested soil resulted in a 42% increase in fresh we ight, a 70% increase in root weight, a 50% reduction in root lesions, and a ten-fold increase in fluorescent pseudomonads in the 129 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 rhizosphere. Field plots have been planted to examine the role of introduced earthworms under field conditions. Role of earthworms in increasing biocontrol agents: Earthworms concentrate naturally occurring beneficial microbes in th eir castings, and it has also been suggested that they can distribute and increase the num ber of introduced biocontrol agents (BCA). Plantshield\u00ae, a commercial nonpathogenic F. oxysporum (CWB 318) can reduce Fusarium disease. Our objective was to determine if the earthworms could more effectively dist ribute the BCA. Earthworms increased the fresh weight of the tomato plants by 108% and reduced vascular discol oration in the stem by 55%. No further benefit was obtained with the BCA. The study will be repeated in 2005-2006. Impact: Fusarium diseases are extremely difficu lt to control when host resistance is absent. The fungus persists in soil for long periods and can be re-introduced at any time on seeds and infested transplants. At present, only repeated applications of expensive fungicides and fumigants are effectiv e in suppressing the disease. Given the lack of practical management options, effort s to enhance soil hea lth, and thus disease suppressiveness, remain the most viable solution for long-te rm management of Fusarium diseases. The long-term use of specific wint er cover crops grown in infested soils can affect disease severity. Similarly, the introduction of earthworms and earthworm compost (vermicomposts) holds much promise for promoting plant health in infested soils. The current research is designed to demonstrate the usefulness of cover crops with earthworms in infested fields to reduce damage from Fusarium disease. In addition, efforts to decipher the mechanism(s) for disease suppression will enhance our understanding of the possible action of bioc ontrol and/or induced resistance. Recent technological advances in rearing earthw orms have increased the likelihood of implementing this practice on a commercial basis. Fusarium ecology: Basil herb studies: Fusarium oxysporum is a very common strain in soil. One strain can be pathogenic on one host, but not on another, while other strains may not have a known susceptible host and are labeled as nonpathogenic. Ve ry little is known about the ecology of Fusarium oxysporum in soil because the species comprises so many morphologically identical but ot herwise diverse strains, it is difficult to follow any one specific population. To follow specific populations, Dr. Elmer introduced F. oxysporum f. sp. basilici in soil in June 2001 and planted basil seedlings. All plants became symptomatic. Plots were seeded with canola, crimson clover, rye/vetch, or left bare for the winter cover crop and then with nonsusceptible herbs during the summer. In 2005, all plots will be planted to basil to determine if densities have dropped sufficiently to allow a healthy crop of basil to be grown. Corn stubble survey: Fusarium head blight of wheat is caused by Fusarium graminearum , a fungus that produces carcinogenic my cotoxins in grain. The fungus can infect other hosts, most notab ly corn. Since wheat is no t grown in Connecticut, Dr. 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Elmer questioned whether F. graminearum would persist at levels reported for regions where wheat and corn are cropped in close prox imity. Six corn farms were selected and sampled using a fractal sampling scheme. Betw een 45 and 50 pieces of corn stalks were removed in March 2004 from each farm. Five pieces of tissue were surface disinfested and placed on selective agar. Colonies we re subcultured and identified. Of the 1465 pieces assayed, 1289 (88%) were colonized by Of 1289 colonies, single conidia were subcultured from 770 colonies (6 0%) and identified to species. The total distribution was 33.5% of the colonies were F. graminearum , . Dr. Ferrandino will analyze the spa tial arrangement of these species in and among the six fields. The study was repeated in 2005, but one field was deleted and another one was added. Over 850 colonies were subculture d and identified to species. Although the study is still in progress, the trends reflect th e 2004 distribution. Dr. Ferrandino will analyze the spatial arrangement of th ese species in and among the six fields. Sixty isolates of F. graminearum have been sent to Dr. Kerry O'Donne ll (USDA scientist in Peoria, IL) for molecular analysis to determine whether the Connecticut isolates represent a group capable of producing more toxic compounds th an the isolates from the Midwest and Northwest regions. Wade Elmer sampling corn stubble Impact: Toxigenic Fusarium species can affect human and animal health by contaminating grains and producing toxins. Outbreaks resulting in levels harmful to humans are very rare, but the majority of corn acreage grown in Connecticut is for animal feed and knowledge of whether or not toxigenic Fusarium species occur regularly on corn stubble was not known. A two-year surv ey of Connecticut farms sampled in early spring revealed that corn st ubble is heavily colonized by Fusarium species and that 30- 40% of the species are toxigeni c, however, analysis of the over-wintered stubble revealed no detectable toxins. Surveys and analysis of the grain during the growing season will complement these data to determin e the potential threat of toxigenic Fusarium species in Connecticut on grain and silage corn. Ornamental disease research: Fusarium wilt of China asters: Seeds of 44 cultivars of China asters were evaluated twice in the greenhouse for resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. callistephi . 131 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Dr. Elmer found that most plants were suscep tible to some degree, but eight cultivars were not significantly different from the cont rol plants grown in noninfested soil. These eight cultivars are being eval uated along with susceptible cu ltivars in field plots at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Lab in Windsor for their resistance to Fusarium wilt. Plots were either inoculated w ith the pathogen or left untreat ed to serve as non-inoculated controls. Disease severity rating and flow er production will be determined in August 2005. Fusarium corm rot of gladiolus: Fusarium corm rot of gladiolus is caused by Fusarium oxysporum and is the most destructive root di sease of gladiolus. To determine if disease could be suppresse d by combining a product that activates defense mechanisms (acibenzolar-S-methyl (Actigard 50 WP)) with chemical fungicides as a corm dip, Dr. Elmer conducted an experiment at Lockwood Fa rm with ten treatmen ts. Symptoms of stunting and yellowing became evident in mid-Ju ly. There were significant interactions (P < 0.02) among the fungicides and Actigard 50 WP treatments for the variables area- under-the-disease-progress-curve (AUDPC) and percent vascular di scoloration (%VD). Plots treated with Heritage 50WP emerged poorly and never recovered, but if Heritage 50WP-treated corms were simultaneously treated with Actigard 50WP, then all deleterious effects of Heritage 50WP on the AUDPC and %VD did not develop. Conversely, the inclusion of Actigard 50WP with Cleary's 3336 50WP exhibited a trend and %VD than with Cleary's 3336 50WP alone . Averaging across all treatments, both fungicides and Actig ard 50WP decreased the AUDPC and the %VD while only Actigard 50WP increased the numbe r of flower spikes. The number of flowering spikes was inversely co rrelated with the AUDPC (R = -0.70, P < 0.001) and with %VD (R = -0.55, P < 0.001). While no sing le treatment was significantly greater than the control, the AUDPC value was lowest, %VD was among the lowest, and quantity of flower spikes was greatest when Actigard 50WP was combined with Terraguard 50WP. This treatment combinati on might provide signifi cant protection from Fusarium corm rot in soils with less disease pressure than in the current study. In 2005, the role of Actigard 50WP with biological a nd chemical fungicides is being reexamined at Lockwood Farm. Fusarium wilt of cyclamen: Dr. Elmer evaluated acibenzolar-S-methyl (Actigard 50 WP \u00ae, Syngenta Inc.) in the greenhouse for its ability to suppress Fusarium wilt of cyclamen. Increasing concentrations of acibe nzolar-S-methyl were inversely correlated with AUDPC values and dry weights were pr oportionally increased. Disease symptoms were never eliminated, however. When inoculum concentrations of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis were increased, plants treated w ith 50 \u00b5g/ml had significantly less disease and had dry weights th at did not differ from untr eated controls. The major benefit of acibenzolar-S-methyl was that it delayed the onset of wilt symptoms for up to 3 weeks. Foliar sprays had no visible phytot oxicity up to 50 \u00b5g/ml, but fresh weights declined proportionately. Acibenzolar-S-met hyl may be useful as a component in an integrated management program that include s other strategies for disease control. Impact: Commercial floriculture has increa sed in Connecticut over the past 20 years, but root diseases caused by species of Fusarium have caused major losses for many 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 growers. Crops such as China asters, cy clamens, and gladiolus are so damaged by Fusarium pathogens that many growers ha ve discontinued thei r production. Several growers will \"finish off\" near-market plants produced out of state for considerably less profit. Regaining the ability to produce qual ity cut and potted flowers is essential to maintaining the economic health of many grow ers. Identifying sources of resistance in the commercially acceptable germplasm has revealed several promising cultivars of China asters. Furthermore, our efforts to determine specific combinations of biological control agents with fungicide s and with compounds that i nduce disease re sistance have improved management for production of cyclamen and gladiolus. Spatial patterns of disease : Dr. Ferrandino has examined a number of procedures for sampling disease. These include samples on a regular grid, randomly selected samples, and samples specified by a nested fractal design. The pe rformance of these various sampling schemes was examined using simulated binary epidemics with varying degrees of spatial aggregation over different length scales. A m odification of spatial correlation analysis specifically geared to bi nary epidemics was shown to be equivalent to a Chi-square test which compared the numbe r of infected plant-pairs to that expected from a spatially random epidemic. This anal ysis was used to analyze the data obtained using the various sampling patterns. For the same number of sampling points, the fractal design is most efficient in the detection of contagion and provides spatial information over a larger range of distance scales than the other sampling schemes tested. However, the regular grid sampling scheme consistently yielded an estimate of average disease incidence which had the smallest variance. Sampling patterns c onsisting of randomly selected points were intermediate in behavior between the two extremes. Dr. Ferrandino also demonstrated that the current quadrat-based methods of evaluating the spatial aggregati on of disease are strongly depe ndent on the relative size of the quadrats used and the inherent length sc ale of disease spread. This length scale cannot be determined once the disease data ar e bulked. This bri ngs into question the practice of fitting quadratted disease data to a beta-binomial distribution since the resultant fitted parameters are highl y dependent on relative length scales. Impact: Sampling fields for the presence of pe sts or disease is becoming a critical aspect of the monitoring of the spread of i nvasive organisms. Currently, the spread of two introduced plant diseases, soybean rust and Ramorum blight, threaten potentially great economic losses. Monetary and time c onstraints limit the number of plant samples that can be obtained. Thus, a detailed knowledge of the nature of th e statistical behavior of data obtained by different sampling strate gies is necessary to make an informed decision as to where to place sample points and under what circumstances such data should be pooled. Milk as a biocontrol for pow dery mildew of cucurbits: Dr. Ferrandino has shown that weekly foliar applications of a 50% by volume aqueous solution of either whole, skim milk, or prepared powdered milk delaye d the onset and severity of powdery mildew on pumpkins and muskmelon. Milk sprays we re twice as effective as 1% baking soda sprays but lactose sprays had no effect on disease. In additi on, in-field and postharvest 133 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 fruit rot of pumpkin was reduced from 20% of the harvested fruit to less than 8% by the use of either milk spray. Impact: The use of alternate environmenta lly-friendly powdery mildew controls can reduce the number of chemical sprays n eeded to maintain yield and quality under moderate disease pressure. This is especi ally important for organic growers and home vegetable gardeners for which the chemical cont rol of disease may not be an alternative. Black birch canker: Black birch ( Betula lenta ), highly prized for use as a veneer, is becoming an increasingly important compone nt of Connecticut forests (~27% of the stems). However, deformations along the trunk caused by Nectria cankers ( Nectria galligena ) can effectively render the lumber va lueless for anything but firewood. Dr. Ferrandino is working in concert with Drs. Ward (Forestry an d Horticulture) and Anagnostakis (Plant Pathology and Ecology) to understand the ep idemiology of this disease and to estimate the present impact of th is disease on Connecticut forests. In late April 2001, seven infected trees out of sixt y in a 0.4-hA plot on Water Company land near Lake Saltonstall were cut down and fort y cankered logs were left on the ground. In addition, 20 of the infected trees were gird led. Monthly observations of perithecia development have been made for over 200 cankers from June 2001 to May 2005. No fruiting bodies were observed in hot summer months (mid June - mid September). For the first two years, cankers on cut and girdled trees conti nued to produce 2-3 times the perithecia as cankers on contro l trees. After 28 months, th ere was a sharp reduction in the production of fruiting bodies on cut stem s as logs became colonized by various rotting organisms. Sporulation within cankers on girdled trees con tinued for 36 mos. but by 47 mos. there was a marked decline in pe rithecia production as girdled trees died and became infected with other wood-rotting fungi. Impact: Black birch is an ever-increasi ng component of Connecticut forests, comprising 25% of the total wood volume a nd representing over 50% of the trees less than 12\" in diameter. Nectria canker defaces birch logs and reduces the value of the birch timber to that of firewood. It is comm on practice among foresters to girdle or cut- down infected birch trees. The results of our study may have a major impact on these control strategies since girdling has been shown to be counterproductive due to the resultant increase in the amount of disease inoculum produced. Neonectria ditissima (previously N. galligena ): The species delimitation, natural history, and population structur e of the ascomycete fungus causing target canker black birch ( Betula lenta ), is valued for its use in producing veneers, although cankers caused by N. ditissima can render the tree and its wood virtually useless in this regard. Black birch has become the dominant hardwood in eastern forests, including those in Connecticut, and concurrent with the tree's increasing frequency is the increasing frequency of Neonectria canker. Dr. Marra's research on Neonectria canke r focuses on the ecology and genetics of this fungal pathogen, with the goal of gaini ng a fuller understanding of the evolution and population biology of the organism and its inte ractions with its hosts, and using this 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 knowledge to develop effective biocontrol stra tegies. The groundwork for this research involves developing a system of genetic marker s that will permit fine-scale analysis of mating patterns and population structure. It al so requires the ability to routinely extract high-quality DNA from cultures, a goal which Dr. Marra achieved this past year. Developing informative genetic markers requ ires a set of isolates from as wide a distribution as possible. Ther efore, in addition to sampling cankers from a variety of locations within the state, Dr. Marra is al so obtaining from colleagues cultures from Canada, Europe, New Zealand, a nd other parts of the U.S. In October and November of 2004, Dr. Marra sampled Neonectria cankers fr om trees in the following areas in Connecticut: Housatonic State Forest, Meshom asic State Forest, Mohawk State Forest, Nipmuck State Forest, Pachaug State Forest, Pootatuck State Forest , Rocky Neck State Park, Saltonstall Lake (Regional Water Au thority), Seth Low Pierrepont State Park, Tunxis State Forest, and West Rock Ridge State Park. A total of 103 canker samples were taken, the majority of them from B. lenta , with a small number from B. alleghaniensis one sample from sassafras ( Sassafras albidum ). Under the assumption that these isolates represent maximum genetic diversity, they will be used to screen candidate genetic markers for thei r usefulness in distingui shing heteroallelism from homoallelism. A thorough understanding of Neonectria's population biology also requires an understanding of its mating system. To th at end, Dr. Marra has made two kinds of isolations from the canker samples mentione d in the preceding paragraph. Cultures obtained from infected bark and wood are being grown to pure cu lture and analyzed microscopically for key morphological charact ers microconidi a, macroconidia). These bark samples constitute the \"maternal\" isolates, i.e., parents to the ascospore progeny contained in the fruiting bodies f ound in nearly all canker samples. The ascospores are used for identification purposes (the red fruiting bodies and their contents distinguish the genus, though not the species), but their DNA will also be analyzed using the aforementioned markers, in order to determ ine (1) if they are the result of outcrossing or self-fertilization, and (2) if outcrossed, the extent to which they are inbred or outbred. Understanding this aspect of the mating sy stem will also shed light on the fungus' dispersal patterns, and will be critical to development of a biocontrol program. Dr. Marra is coordinating his work on Neonectria with fungal systematists at USDA in Beltsville, who are revisiting the en tire Order Hypocreales, to which the genus Neonectria belongs. During 2004, Dr. Marra sent to colleagues in Beltsville 8 isolates, whose sequences at three genes--EF1-alpha , RPB2, and beta-tubulin--were compared with those of other Neonectria species from a variety of hosts and from numerous continents. The systematists now feel str ongly that the species obtained by Dr. Marra from birch trees in Conn ecticut, assumed to be Neonectria galligena , is actually N. ditissima , the type of which is European beech ( Fagus sylvestris ), from Germany. Interestingly, no other isolates of N. ditissima that have been sampled in North America have come from Betula spp., coming instead from tulip-tree ( sp., and Fagus sp. Dr. Marra has also been experimenting with various culturing methods (including different media) in order to perform la boratory matings and study the vegetative incompatibility system. A laboratory-based ma ting assay will be an important tool in evaluating markers and vegeta tive incompatibility groups. 135 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Impact: Over the past sixty or so years, black birch has become an increasingly important component of Connecticut forests, both in terms of the number of trees and the amount of wood. By either metric, it appear s that black birch is taking the lead over oaks, maples, beeches, and other species. Cankers caused by Neonectria cause major disfigurement, even though trees can persis t for decades with several to many such cankers along their stems. These heavily cankered mature trees, which compete for resources (water, light, nutrients), have a si gnificantly negative economic and aesthetic impact. The genetics and epidemiology of the fungus and its role in the forest are poorly understood. Knowledge gained from studi es of Neonectria canker will suggest appropriate hypotheses on biocontrol strategies. Noteworthy plant health problems: Diseases of conifers were of particular concern this season. In spring, spru ce needle rust, caused by the fungus Chrysomyxa weirii, was unusually widespread and severe thr oughout the state. This disease is also commonly known as repeating spruce needle rust, Weir's rust, and autoecious spruce needle rust. Although in past years this disease had been predominately a Christmas tree plantation problem, this season it was dia gnosed with great frequency in many settings including Christmas tree plantations, pr oduction nurseries, and landscape plantings. Hosts of the pathogen include white, black, and Colorado spruce, but the latter is the most susceptible. This rust was first descri bed in Connecticut in 1996 but was probably present in the state for severa l years prior to its initial detect ion. Although at least ten other needle rust fungi ( Chrysomyxa spp.) have been reported on spruce in the United States, until 1996, only the needle rusts caused by C. ledi and C. ledicola had been of concern for Christmas tree growers in Connec ticut. Unfortunately, the rust caused by C. weirii represents a particular challenge for growers, landscapers, and arborists since unlike the other needle rusts , it is autoecious and does not require any additional hosts in order to complete its life cycle. C. weirii has also been reported in Pennsylvania, Vermont, New York, and New Hampshire and a ppears to be on the increase throughout the Northeast. Infected trees are rarely k illed but the primary damage results in extensive needle discoloration and drop, which di sfigures landscape trees and reduces the marketability of infected trees in production nurseries and Ch ristmas tree plantations. Symptoms first appear as yellow spots or flecks on needles in late winter and early spring. These spots eventually develop into pustules or blisters (telia) and burst open to reveal masses of yellow-orange spores (teliospor es). The teliospores then pr oduce another type of spore (basidiospores) which is readily blown by wind and splashed by rain onto needles of the same tree or onto those of adjacent trees. Infe ction occurs when needles first emerge and are tender and immature. The following spring, yellow spots and blisters develop on the infected needles and the disease cy cle starts again. Blisters of C. weirii can appear on both first- and second-year needles and heavil y infected trees can appear distinctively yellow-orange from a distance. Autoecious sp ruce needle rust can be distinguished from the heteroecious rusts by the timing of sympto ms. Symptoms of the former are evident in late winter and early spring whereas the latter develop in mid to late summer. However, accurate diagnosis still require s microscopic examination since symptoms may easily be confused with those caused by other needle rusts. As with most diseases that are not fatal but result in needle drop, repeated de foliation may retard growth and reduce marketability. 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Another conifer disease of note this s eason was Uredinopsis needle rust. Also known as fir-fern rust, this di sease is caused by the fungus Uredinopsis pteridis. The primary coniferous hosts are true firs, particul arly grand and white fir. The alternate host is bracken fern. Although th is needle rust is an occasional problem in Connecticut, several outbreaks were recently diagnosed on C oncolor fir in plantations and isolated landscape trees throughout the state. This heteroecious rust occu rs when true firs grow in close proximity to ferns, the alternate hosts. Symptoms on firs consist of chlorotic to yellow blotches on the upper surfaces of infect ed needles. These can appear in spring on one-month-old to several-yea r-old needles. Diagnostic symptoms develop on the undersurface of the infected needles and app ear as white, tubular projections through the stomates. White-colored spores are produced in these structures and are dispersed to the alternate fern hosts, particularly bracken ferns. Infected needles dry out and drop prematurely, often in quantities that render th e trees unmarketable. Symptoms on bracken ferns, the altern ate host, appear as elongated chlorotic spots. These are most apparent on the uppe r surface of the frond and are often located between the veins. The undersurfaces of th e fronds often appear white due to abundant sporulation of the rust fungus. Unlike most rust fungi whose spores are rusty brown, spores of fir-fern rust are white. The fungus overwinters in dead bracken fern fronds. In spring, spores are produced in the fern debris and are carried by wind and rain to infect newly developing needles of true firs in th e vicinity. About one month after infection, inconspicuous fruiting bodies develop on inf ected needles but symptoms usually don't appear until the following year. During late winter and early spring, white, tubular structures are produced on the undersides of inf ected needles. White spores are released and carried by wind and rain to young, unrolli ng fronds of bracken ferns and the cycle begins once again. Although spore production is most prevalent in sp ring, it can continue into the summer and fall. Infected needles can produce spores for 3-4 years or until they dry up and die. Additional conifer diseases diagnosed th is season were Rhabdocline needlecast of Douglas-fir and Rhizosphaera needlecast Rhabdocline needlecast, caused by Rhabdocline spp., were detected in plantations, production nurseries, and landscape planti ngs throughout the state. Rhizosphaera needlecast, caused by Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii, is a disease of blue spruce and occasionally white spruce. This disease is also considered to be a plantation problem, but was prevalent in both plantations and landscap es, especially on stressed trees. Both diseases caused substantial drop of one- and sometimes two-year-old needles and infected trees showed considerable thinning. Last year we reported an unusua l problem with Eastern red cedar, Juniperus virginiana . Dramatic and conspicuous damage wa s observed on trees in all age and size classes, care regimes, and lo cations, including na tural stands and managed landscapes. Severely affected trees app eared distinctly off-color from a distance. Upon close inspection, a range of symptoms was obser ved, which included needle browning and drop, primarily of older, inner needles, tip and twig dieback, and dead branches. In extreme cases, entire trees were brown. These symptoms were not distinctive or diagnostic. As the 2004 season progressed, some trees appeared to recover, as evidenced by new, healthy growth. Unfortunately, other trees continued to decline and eventually died. In spring 2005, we responded to additi onal inquiries about continued problems 137 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 with red cedar. In some cases, newly affected trees were reported and in others, trees that had appeared to be recovering from the pr oblem last year were once again developing symptoms. To date, no pathogens , insects, or mites have been directly associated with these symptoms and our efforts to furthe r characterize and iden tify the cause(s) are ongoing. Disease survey: Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman dia gnosed a wide range of plant health problems for homeowners, commercia l growers, plant care professionals, and government, state, and cooperative extensi on personnel during the past year. Weather extremes provided challenges for many plants . These included prolonged periods of extremely cold temperatures in January and February 2005, severe snowstorms, strong winds, and bright sun reflected off snow. Additionally, May 2005 was unusually cool and this resulted in prolonged budbreak for mo st plants. During this period, there was limited measurable precipitation but dew pr ovided optimum conditions for many fungal, foliar diseases to develop. Th is situation was particularly problematic since high levels of overwintering inoculum from 2004 were ava ilable to cause infections in spring 2005. The cool May weather was followed by record high temperatures and extremely dry conditions during June 2005. The effects of these conditions were problematic on many woody and herbaceous plants since these weathe r conditions normally occur in late July and August when plants are in a very different physiological state. As a consequence, many of the disease problems diagnosed by Dr . Douglas and Ms. Inman were associated with these spring weather extremes. Winter conditions resulted in high levels of damage to needled evergreens such as arborvitae, spruce, pine, and hemlock as well as broadleaved evergreens such as rhododendron, andromeda, holly, boxwood, and m ountain laurel. Most of the symptoms appeared in early spring but in some cases, th e damage did not appear until later in the season. Symptoms included leaf or needle browning, premature drop, tip dieback, and branch death. In extreme cases, plant d eath was reported. As was the case in 2004, unusually high transplant failure was reporte d for woody ornamentals planted in late October and November 2004 as evidenced by ex tensive dieback and death in spring and continuing into summer 2005. Powdery mildews were unusually heavy on dogwood, oak, maple, forsythia, lilac, Powdery mildew was also id entified on peony and was unusually early and severe. Roses had very early and very h eavy infections of both powdery mildew and black spot and many cultivars were defoliated by mid-June. Last fall, maples throughout the state were affected by significan t levels of tar spot, caused by both Rhytisma acerinum and R. punctatum , and many trees dropped symptomatic leaves prematurely. Particularly noticeable this spring were symptoms of the related fungal diseases oak leaf blister, azalea leaf gall, and peach leaf curl. The cool temperatures in May prolonged budbreak and created optimum conditi ons for infection. Anthracnoses of maple, ash, and oak were all prevalen t during spring 2005 although anthracnose of sycamore was unusually severe. Although sycamo re trees typically recover from spring infections, this season, recovery was slower than normal and some trees continued to exhibit symptoms of infection into midsu mmer. Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman examined many samples of junipers of all species and cultivars that were e xhibiting extensive, 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 unexplained dieback as we ll as typical tip blight symptoms caused by Phomopsis and Kabatina . Decline of ash (especially white as h) continued to be a problem throughout the state and prompted many questions from homeowners and arborists. Dutch elm disease also continued as a significant and serious pr oblem throughout the state. Unusually high incidences of Verticillium wilt continued to be problematic for several tree species. Symptoms were part icularly severe on Japanese maple and infections often led to tree death. Numerous instances of Verticillium wilt of impatiens were also diagnosed by Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman. In most cases, impatiens had been planted in the same locations for many year s and this resulted in the buildup of the soilborne fungus in these sites. Many crabapples, hawthorns, and amelanchie rs were nearly defoliated by July as a result of scab, leaf spot, and Gymnosporangium rust infections. The Gymnosporangium rusts were particularly severe and noteworthy this spring as the bright orange, gelatinous spore-horns of these fungi became evident. These distinctive diseases, caused by several species of the fungal genus G ymnosporangium , were widespread throughout the state in areas where apples, crabapples, and other rela ted members of the Rose family grow in close proximity to Juniperus species such as Eastern red cedar and juniper. These fungi require these two different types of hosts in or der to complete their two-year life cycles. Volutella blight of pachysandra continue d to be the key problem of groundcovers throughout the state. It resulted in extens ive dieback in young as well as established plantings throughout the state. Symptoms de veloped in late summer and fall and were prevalent again this spring. Plan ts weakened by stress or th ose growing in marginal sites (e.g., full sun) appeared to be most suscep tible to this fungus. Although diagnostic, concentric lesions were present on leaves , stem cankers posed the most important problem since they resulted in total plant collapse. The cumulative effects of the weather extr emes of the past few years were evident on many woody ornamentals in the landscape as they exhi bited dieback, cankers, and root problems. An unusually high number of these problem s was caused by fungi that are often considered opportunistic pests: cankers and dieb with Armillaria and Phytophthora . Tree and small fruit had a number of dis ease problems and it appeared that many homeowners missed critical, earl y-season sprays because of th e difficult weather. Brown rot appeared on peaches, cherries, and plums once fruit began to ripen. High levels of black knot were also reported on both domestic a nd wild cherries and plums. In spring of '05, Dr. Douglas examined pear leaves from se veral commercial orchards with leaf spot symptoms that mimicked Fabraea but determined they were associated with spray damage. Bacterial leaf spot was identified in several commercial peach and nectarine blocks. Fungal canker diseases caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea and B. obtusa were of particular and unusual concern for commercia l plantings of peach. These are normally considered significant pathogens of apple but were recently identified by Dr. Douglas as the cause of extensive dieback in peach tree s. Blueberries exhibi ted extensive winter damage, dieback associated with Phomopsis canker, and fruit loss due to mummy berry. Very high levels of downy mildew, powdery m ildew, and black rot were also diagnosed on backyard plantings of grapes. 139 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 The unusually cold temperatur es of winter '04-'05 also had an adverse effect on greenhouse crops since many comm ercial growers had proble ms maintaining nighttime temperatures above 50\u00b0F. Chilling and freezing injuries as well as cool temperature nutrient problems were diagnosed on many of the temperature-sensitive bedding plants such as New Guinea impatiens. Vegetables were affected by a variety of disease problems. In addition to powdery mildew, noteworthy outbreaks of Sept oria leaf spot, blossom-end rot, early blight, bacterial canker, were repo rted on tomato. Additional tomato problems included poor fruit set, une ven ripening, and excessive internal white tissue, which appeared to be associated with the weather. Problems with fruit set due to the predominance of male flowers, a phenomen on associated with the weather, were reported on cucurbits. Downy mildew and powdery mildew a ppeared very early and very heavy on summer squash and pumpkin. Powd ery mildew was also detected on many culinary herbs. Dr. Douglas worked with Drs. Victoria Smith and Robert Marra, CAES nursery inspectors, and USDA-APHIS PPQ personnel to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , in Connecticut. She and Ms. Inman are also developing a collection of cultures of Phytophthora species isolated from samples submitted to the Plant Disease Information Office for diagnosis. This collection will assist in work aimed at refining techniques used for detecting various species of Phytophthora , including P. ramorum . Sphaerobolus stellatus , the artillery fungus, continue d to be a significant concern for property owners and was frequently identif ied as the source of persistent brown to black spots on house-siding, cars, plants, and other surfaces during the '04-'05 season. Dr. Douglas responded to questions and emails about this fungus from residents and insurance companies in Connecticut and thr oughout the United States. Slime molds were also identified on many types of mulch. Thes e types of fungi can appear dramatically overnight as large (up to 12-16 inches in di ameter), brightly-colored masses. These masses then turn into masses of brown, powdery spores. Although both problems are certainly eye-catching, they do not represent serious threats to plant health. However, slime molds were of particular concern when they developed in mulches of playscapes in daycare centers and schools. These fungi are not considered hu man pathogens, although there was concern that some individuals could be sensitiv e to exposure to spores of the fungus. The quirky spring weather resulted in a number of turf problems. These were associated with the cool, moist May followe d by an unusually hot, humid, and dry June. Pythium blight, typically a mid- to late-summe r disease, was identified for several golf courses in June and resulted in extensive dama ge to greens. Last season's wet summer caused significant stress on many lawns throughout the state. The predominant diseases diagnosed by Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman were brown patch, necrotic ring spot, summer patch, rust, and anthracnose. Common \"grassy \" weeds identified in lawns were bulbous bluegrass and bentgrass. The predominant lawn weeds were ground ivy, henbit, nutsedge, wild violet, and speedwells. Identi fication and control of poison ivy continued to be of major concern to homeowners and pl ant care professionals as this plant continues to spread and thrive throughout the Connecticut landscape. 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Impact: Information on the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut landscapes, natural woodlots, and forests each ye ar help to monitor and access the impact of these problems on the overall health of pl ants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or in iden tifying potentially impor tant emerging diseases on specific plants which can then be monitored in the years that follow. Seed testing: During 2005, the Bureau of Regul ation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture s ubmitted to Dr. Douglas 342 vegetable seed samples for germination analysis, 16 lawn gr ass seed samples for purity and germination analyses, and 5 crop seed samples for purity and germination analyses. Four vegetable seed samples did not meet germination claims. Two samples were retested and failed the second test. Two samples were not retested b ecause of insufficient numbers of seeds. Of the 16 lawn seed samples tested, one met labe l claims for both purity and germination. Three samples failed label claims for both purity and germination. Twelve samples passed label claims for germination but did not meet claims for purity. Vegetable and lawn seed samples were also examined fo r prohibited noxious weed seeds and none of these samples contained weed contaminants. Of the five crop seed samples, four met label claims for germination and purity. One sample passed label claims for germination but did not meet label claims for purity becaus e of excessive weed s eed. In addition to germination and purity tests, samples were al so examined for prohibi ted noxious weeds. No noxious weed seeds were found in crop seed samples. Impact: Germination and purity analyses are performed every year on official samples of vegetable, lawn, and crop seeds by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, the official seed testi ng laboratory for the state. Th e results of these tests provide Connecticut residents with information on the compliance of seeds sold within the state with the Connecticut Seed Law Regul ation and the Federal Seed Act. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection : During this year, Dr. Douglas and Ms . Inman examined 40 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protec tion at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. Meetings sponsored: January 5, 2005 : Wade Elmer was the CAES spons or for the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association Winter Meeting in Jones Auditorium . Approximately 80 growers were present. January 27 : Wade Elmer was the CAES sponsor for a UCONN Extension Outreach Meeting for bedding plant growers in Jone s Auditorium. Approximately 30 growers were present. 141 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 February 8 : Wade Elmer was the CAES sponsor for a UCONN Extension Outreach Meeting for bedding plant growers in Ver non, CT. Approximately 35 growers were present. April 12 : Wade Elmer organized the Lockwood Lecture presented by Dr. Kerry O'Donnell from Peoria, Illinois, in Jones Aud itorium. Twenty-five pe ople were present. Wade Elmer organized and hosted 12 L unch Club seminars by Station staff in Jones Auditorium. Participation ranged from 10-30 people. Citizen inquiries: Dr. Douglas, assisted by Ms. Inman, answered 6,939 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizen s: 14% dealt with food crops, 69% with ornamentals and trees, 3% with turf grasse s, and 14% were misc ellaneous questions. Twenty-five percent of the i nquiries were from commerci al growers and plant care professionals, 70% were from homeowners, a nd 5% were from cooperative extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel. A further breakdown of responses showed that 52% of the inquiries came in by phone, 10% came in by mail, 3% came as email, and 35% were brought in person. Dr. Douglas a nd Ms. Inman also sent over 925 letters and sent numerous email messages with attached f iles of fact sheets. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxic ity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, identification of various plan ts and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pestic ides and their relations hips to health and environmental concerns. Mary Inman examines a hosta Dr. Anagnostakis responded to over 780 inqui ries about chestnut blight, chestnut trees, and other nut trees. Dr. Elmer answered 20 inquiries dealing with plant problems on asparagus, basil, cyclamen, and pumpkins, and made 13 site visi ts to growers in Branford, Cheshire, North Grosvenordale, Shelton, Southbur y, and Storrs. He also pr ocessed and autoclaved over 100 soil samples from cemeteries around the worl d for eventual use in the West Hartford Veterans Memorial Ceremony in fall 2005. In the past year, Dr. Marra processe d 185 nursery samples for the 2004 National Survey and 56 nursery samples for the Trace Forward survey. 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 DEPARTMENT OF SOIL AND WATER Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program. Mosquito surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is integral to the public health response to these mosquito-transmitted viruse s in Connecticut. The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) ear ly evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, id entity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) baseline data that are used to assess the threat of WNV and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Drs. Theodore Andreadis and Ph ilip Armstrong (assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas, and Shannon Finan). In 2004, the CAES reestablished the network of 91 permanent mosquito-trapping stations in 72 municipalities throughout the state. Mosquito trapping was conducted daily from J une 1 to October 27. Traps were set and attended by CAES staff every 10 days at each site on a regular rotation. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to species, trappi ng site, and date of collection. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes were included in each pool. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of viruses. Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for EEE and WNV by Real Time (TaqMan) PCR using virus- specific primers and/or plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT). All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratory. A total of 156,409 mosquitoes (12,521 pools) representing 35 species were trapped and tested in 2004. A total of 43 isol ations of WNV were made from quadrimaculatus (1) collected from 8 locations in 6 towns: Bridgeport, Fairfield, New Haven, Stratford, and West Haven. A major decline in WNV activity was seen throughout the state. No locally acquired human or horse cases were reported for the first time since 2000. A total of 37 isolations of EEE virus were obtained from 10 mosquito species: and Ochlerotatus trivittatus (1). The infected mosquitoes were trapped in 6 locations in 5 towns including: Chester, Ledyard, North Stonington, Stonington, and Vol untown. No human or horse cases were reported. Mosquito Investigations. Enzootic transmission of WNV requires sufficient contact between vector mosquitoes and av ian amplification hosts, whereas epidemic transmission represents a diversion from th e natural transmission cycle to humans. To evaluate the role of Culex mosquitoes as enzootic and epidemic vectors for WNV in northeastern United States, Drs. Goudarz Molaei, Theodore Andreadis, Philip Armstrong, John Anderson and Charles Vossbrinck co llected blood-fed mosquitoes throughout Connecticut and identified the source of vertebrate blood by PCR amplification and sequencing portions of the cytochrome b ge ne of mitochondrial DNA. By implementing this method, they were able to unambiguous ly identify the blood meal source to the species level, therein improving the sensitivity and specificity of prev ious techniques for 143 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 blood meal analysis. An analysis of PCR products from a total of 213 Culex pipiens , 106 Culex 93% acquired blood from avian hosts; whereas, Cx. salinarius fed frequently on both mammals (53%) and birds (36%). Individua l mosquitoes containing mixed-blood meals from both avian and mammalian hosts we re detected in 11% and 4% of Cx. salinarius and Cx. pipiens respectively. American Robin was the most common source of avian blood for Cx. pipiens (40%) and Cx. House Sparrow, European Starling, and Mourning D ove. American Crow represented <1% of the blood meals identified in Cx. pipiens and none in Cx. restuans , despite historically high rates of WNV-mortality in the wild cr ow population. Culex salinarius obtained mammalian blood meals most frequently from the white-tailed deer (67%) and contained more crow-derived or Cx. two Cx. salinarius and one Cx. pipiens. These findings in conjunction with other lines of evidence, suggest that Cx. salinarius is an important bridge vector of WN V to humans, while Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans serve as efficient enzootic vectors in this region of the northeastern United States. The infectivity and pathoge nicity of a baculovirus, called OscoNPV that was originally isolated from the salt marsh mosquito, Ochlerotatus sollicitans in FL, were evaluated in laboratory bioa ssays by Dr. Theodore Andreadis (assisted by John Shepard and Michael Thomas) against 10 species of mo squitoes native to the northeastern US. Five larval equivalents with 5 mM Mg2+ added were used as a dosage rate in exposures with second and third instar mosquito larvae at 20-24 0C. Development of the virus was observed in the nuclei of the midgut epitheial cells in the gastric caeca and posterior region of the stomach. One hundred percent mo rtality was observed in all larvae that exhibited gross symptoms of infecti on. Infection Cx. restuans or Cx. territans nor were infections found in any species in the absence of Mg2+. This virus has potential for development as a biological control agent for Aedes and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes. Arbovirus studies. Drs. Armstrong, Andreadis, A nderson, and Main documented the first isolation of Potosi virus (POTV) fr om the northeastern United States. In 2001, a bunyavirus was isolated from Aedes vexans that was different from other arboviruses known to occur in Connecticut by cross-neut ralization and RT-PCR assays. Nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of a portion of the G2 envelope gene were 99% and 100% similar to POTV respectiv ely, yet distinct from indi genous strains (JCV), Cache Valley (CVV), and Trivit tatus viruses (TVTV). Viral isolates obtained from the state-wide surveillance program were re-tested by RT-PCR coupled with restriction POTV isolates, by neutraliza tion, were correctly identified by RT-PCR; however, many isolates classified as JC V or CVV by ELISA proved to be POTV by molecular assays. A total of 92 strains of POTV were isolated from 12 different mosquito species in 2000, 2001, and 2003, wh ereas POTV was not detected in mosquitoes sampled during 1998, 1999, 2002, a nd 2004. Viral isolation rates were highest for Anopheles punctipennis (3.2-11.3 infection rate per 1,000 mosquitoes) while 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 the greatest number of isolates came from Ochlerotatus trivittatus (Coquillett) (8-16 isolates). Repeated isolations of POTV ove r multiple years indicate that this virus is enzootic in Connecticut. The phylogenetic relationships of eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV) strains are currently being evaluated by Drs. Armstrong, Andreadis, Anderson, and Vossbrinck. Virus isolates obtained from the statewide mosquito trapping program during 1998-2004 were sequenced and analyzed to discern patterns of evolutionary change and lineage turnover from year-to- year. Preliminary results indicate the following: 1) Diverse EEEV lineages may co-c irculate in a given transmission season. For example, in 2003, 6 well-supported clades were detected representing 11 distinct sequence variants. Two distin ct lineages co-circulated in 2000 and 2001 versus one identical strain in 1998; 2) Th ere appears to be limited viral traffic between foci in the western and eastern parts of the state. Us ing the CT River Valley as a dividing line, different strains tend to circulate along an eas t-west axis; and 3) The same strains do not reappear in successive years except for one from 2000-2001 and another from 2003- 2004. This suggests that local over-wintering occu rs in CT but on a limited basis. Most EEEV strains are unique and probably arose from importation events. Long term persistence of the same viral strain for more than two transmission seasons was not supported by the data. Dr. Armstrong is currently developing rapi d diagnostic tools fo r the identification of arboviruses circulating in Connecticut. A PCR-based assay was devised to detect and distinguish bunyaviruses endemic to Conn ecticut, including Jamestown Canyon, Cache Valley, Trivittatus, and Potosi viruses. The assay uses primers targeting highly conserved regions of the S-segment of the genus Orthobunyavirus and species-specific restriction enzyme sites to id entify amplification products. Vira l isolates previously typed by the cross-neutralizatio n test were evaluated against the PCR-based assay. Preliminary results indicate that RT-PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis readily distinguishes bunyaviruses found in CT. Drs. Vossbrinck, Andreadis, Armstrong a nd Anderson (assisted by John Shepard) have completed sequencing of more than 300 WNV isolates from Connecticut. Results show a correlation between locati on and evolutionary relatedne ss. Isolates obtained from mosquitoes are being recaptured in following ye ars. Some are identical with isolates obtained in previous years while others show nucleotide mu tations and changes to their protein structure. The recapture of isolat es from previous years provides good evidence that the virus is over wintering in Connecticut. Analysis in th e current year will look for convergent changes in the viral protein that is the same muta tion in an unrelated isolate, to see if the virus is possibly adapting to the new bird hosts or mosquito vectors found in North America. Molecular Biology Research on Microsporidian Parasites: The Microsporidia are a group of obligate intrace llular parasites, now thought to be derived fungi. Dr. Vossbrinck conducted a comparative analysis of the small subunit rDNA (ssrDNA) of 125 species (sequences obtained from GenBank) . This analysis showed that groups or clades are formed based largely on habitat and host. This result is supported by comparative molecular analyses of the past decade, and indicates that structural and ultrastructural characters are unreliabl e for distinguishing among higher-level 145 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 microsporidian taxa. His findings indicate the presence of five major clades of Microsporidia which group according to habitat. He proposed three new classes of Microsporidia based on natural phylogeneti c groupings as illustrated by the ssrDNA analysis: Aquasporidia, Mari nosporidia and Terresporidia. The names of the proposed classes reflect the habitat of each group. The class Aquasporidia, found primarily in freshwater habitats, is a paraphyletic group consisting of three clades. The Marinosporidia are found in hosts of marine origin and the Terresporidia are primarily from terrestrial environments. Control of Variable Wate r Milfoil in Bashan Lake. Water milfoil is an invasive aquatic plant that can restrict the recreationa l use of lakes and elim inate desirable native aquatic plants. Since 1994, the Station has been monitoring the milfoil problem in Bashan Lake, East Haddam. The Connec ticut Department of Enviro nmental Protection (CTDEP), the town of East Haddam and the Bashan La ke Association have supplied the Station grants to study the use of the herbicide 2,4-D for controlling the milfoil. Greg Bugbee and Jason White have met with lake associ ation, CTDEP and town officials to educate the public on the project and obtain the necessary permits. In 2000 - 2004 areas of Bashan Lake were treated with 2,4-D (2,4-D ester). Although contro l was generally very good regrowth occurred in some areas and new areas of milfoil were found particularly in water from 10 - 20 feet deep. Tests in 2001- 2004 have discovered that a late summer application of 2,4-D is likely more effective than the traditional spring treatments and the rate can be reduced from 200 lbs/acre to 75 - 100 lbs/acre with equally good control. Areas treated with 2,4-D usually stay nearly m ilfoil free for two years. Reinfestation is thought to occur by either uncontro lled remnants of previous plants or rooting of plant fragments from untreated portions of the la ke. New underwater video equipment allowed accurate assessment of where th e milfoil is occurring. Large areas not known to contain milfoil were discovered with new underwater video equipment in deep water. This milfoil could be the source of plant fragment s. In September 2004 2,4-D was applied to a large deep-water area of milfoil between th e island off the boat launch and the Sunset Acres dock. Other areas incl uding the boat launch cove, Brooks Cove, and Laurel Cove were also treated. Late fall and spring surv eys indicated excellent control. In September 2005, all remaining areas of m ilfoil will be treated with 2,4-D. Nearby groundwater wells are tested each year and no 2,4-D has been found. Control of cabomba and Eurasian water milfoil in Lake Quonnipaug. Lake Quonnipaug, CT, has become infested with the non-na tive aquatic weeds cabomba and Eurasian water milfoil. In 2001 the herbicide Sonar SRP (fluridone, slow release pellets) was applied to two acres of cab omba in the cove near the boat launch with excellent control. This was the first known successful control cabomba with a granular herbicide applied as a spot treatment. In 2002 this area was monitored for regrowth and a total of 122 plants were found and removed by hand pulling. Many of these plants had likely come from fragments floating in from other parts of the lake and taking root. Regrowth of cabomba in the north cove continued through 2004 and cabomba has become a problem again. Retreatment scheduled for 2005 was delayed by CTDEP until the proximity of an endangered plant called wa ter marigold could be detailed. Eurasian milfoil is also present in the lake with dense patches in near a shoal in the lakes center. 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Because the milfoil patches were close to wa ter marigold, no applications were made in spring 2005. Discussions with the CTDEP on how to treat milfoil under these conditions are in progress. Aquatic vegetation was mapped. In the southern cove, a 2000 X 50 ft. area of lily pads and other nuisance vegeta tion was treated with glyphosate in September 2002. Three weeks later the area was then hydr oraked and the collected vegetation was removed. In April 2004 the hydroraking was performed again to remove floating islands of muck and dead aquatic vegetation. A sp ring survey found large areas of cabomba in the treated area. Two treatments of fluridone Q (quick release) we re applied in June 2004. Rapid decline of cabomba ensued but regrowth occurred late in the season. Surprisingly little of the cabomba that regrew survived the winter and few plants were evident in 2005. To monitor th e results before and after treatment, aquatic plant surveys were performed along GPS referenced tran sects, in 2004 and 2005. Water samples were routinely tested for temperature, di ssolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, phosphorus, and pondweed and coontail with liquid fluridone in Grannis Lake, East Haven CT. Tests on the effectiveness of the aquatic herbicides fluridone a nd Diquat are underway in Grannis Lake. Plants in need of control are Eurasian milfoil, sago pondweed, curly leaf pondw eed and coontail. Grannis Lake was surveyed for aquatic vegetation prio r to the initial treatment and again each spring thereafter. North/South transects were made at 100 feet intervals using GPS. Vegetation samples were obtaine d at 50 ft. intervals, iden tified, judged for abundance and then brought back to the lab to obtain their dry weight. Fl uridone was applied in Spring 2003 to obtain concentrations of 10 -20 ppb. Wa ter was tested each week to determine fluridone concentrations. By late summer, control of Eurasian m ilfoil and coontail was excellent. Sago pondweed control was moderate , while curly leaf pondweed could not be assessed because this plant dies back naturally during the summer. The spring 2004 transects found a few milfoil plants, large areas of Sago pondweed and dense curly leaf pondweed. The fluridone treatment was, theref ore, judged ineffective for sago and curly leaf pondweed. In 2005, a spri ng application of Diquat fo llowed by several low rate applications of fluridone was tested. The hypot hesis is that better c ontrol will occur with an initial quick acting herbic ide (Diquat) followed by a full season dose of fluridone to prevent late season regrowth. Water samples are periodically tested for temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinit y, conductivity, phosphorus and fluridone. These studies continue to show the efficacy of highly localized spot treatment s of herbicides as part of a management plan to control aquatic invasive weeds. 147 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 CAES Invasive Plant Program Staff Participating in Project CLEAR (Candlewood Lake Environmental Awareness and Research) Statewide surveillance a nd mapping of Connecticut la kes for aquatic vegetation. Non-native aquatic plants such as Eurasian milfoil, variable milf oil and cabomba have become problems in many Connecticut lakes. Information is need ed on the distribution of these plants and the cond itions that encourage their gr owth. Beginning in spring 2004, a lake surveillance team including Gregory Bugbee, Dr. Jason Wh ite, and Dr. Robert Capers (assisted by Roslyn Selsky) was formed to visit state lakes, map the aquatic vegetation and compare the results with water chemistry and watershed land use information. Protocols were established us ing GPS and underwater video technology. An on-line database of the aquatic vegetation maps will be constructed and continually updated as the data from additional lakes ar e processed. The information will be made available to the scientific community and general public in via a newly designed web page (www.caes.state.ct.us/AquaticPlants/inde x.htm). Thirty-two lakes and ponds were surveyed in 2004, 61 plant species were observe d. Twenty-four lakes contained invasive plants with the following being most prevalent; Potamogeton crispus (13), Myriophyllum spicatum (11), M. (8), Cabomba caroliniana (6), and Marsilea quadrifolia (1). Six new populations of stat e listed species found; P. vaseyi (2), P. pusillus ssp. gemmiparus (3), M. sibiricum (1). Over 60 lakes and ponds projected to be surveyed in 2005 with many being requests fr om town and local officials. To help citizens identify plants and supply CAES w ith information on potential sites, CAES sponsored three invasive aquatic plant workshops. In conjunction with the Invasive Aq uatic Plant Protection Program, Dr. Vossbrinck (assisted by Kirsten Deeds) has in itiated studies to de velop new molecular- based techniques to identify these non-nati ve aquatic plants via DNA sequences from. This database make it possible to rapidly and accurately identify any new invasive plant species infesting Connecticut lakes. To date 12 plant species have been sequenced. Soil Testing: Testing soil samples for fertility and suggesting methods for growing better plants is a continuing service for citi zens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Mr. Bugbee tested 5002 samples and answered 1921 inquiries. Phytoremediation of persistent organic pollutants: Studies were conducted by Dr. Jason White in an ongoing investigation of the potential of certain vegetation to remove moderately low levels of persistent or ganic pollutants from so il. Previous data 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 had indicated that Cucurbita pepo cultivars seemed to have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathered resi dues but that significant cr op variability may exist down to the species level. Several studies were conducted with different lines of investigation in the past year: 1.) In a field study, the e ffects of two soil amendments, mycorrhizae or a biosurfactant, and on p,p'-DDE accumulation were determined. Cucurbita pepo ssp pepo accumulated large amounts of the contaminan t from soil, having stem bioconcentration factors (BCFs, dry weight ra tio of contaminant concentration in the stems to soil), translocation factors (TF, ratio of stem p,p'-DDE concentration to that in the root), and overall percent contaminant phytoextracted that were 14, 9.9, and 5.0 times greater C. pepo ssp ovifera , respectively. Mycorrh the accumulation of weathered p,p'-DDE in the tissues of both subspecies by an average 4.4 times. For ssp pepo , mycorrhizae increased the percent of contaminant extracted from 0.72 to 2.1%, including a value of 6.0% rem oval by one cultivar. Similar enhanced contaminant accumulation was observed with both subspecies after biosurfactant amendment, although treatment reduced the biomass of ssp ovifera by 60%. The biosurfactant had no effect on the biomass of ssp pepo , increased the average tissue concentration of the contaminant by 3.6- fold, and doubled the overall amount of p,p'- DDE removed from soil. These results demonstrate that soil amendments that enhance the mobility of weathered POPs will signifi cantly increase the amount of contaminant phytoextracted by Cucurbita pepo and can be used to maximize remedial potential. 2.) In hydroponic studies, the mechanism by which shoots of zucchini ( Cucurbita pepo L.) accumulate various hydrophobic contaminants from soil while cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L.) does not was investigated. A mixture of DDE bound to Tenax TM beads stirred with a solution of water passi ng through an air-tight polyethyl ene mobile-phase reservoir provided a flowing solution with DDE at about 2 ug/L for many weeks duration. The DDE supplied in solution was bound tightly to th e roots of both cucumber and zucchini. Less than 10% of the DDE was released when clean solution flowed past these contaminated roots. Some DDE moved from the roots to the shoot of both species, but the fraction translocated in zucchini, ranging fr om 6 to 27% in various trials, was 10 fold greater than that translocat ed in cucumber, 0.7 to 2%. Th ere was a gradient of DDE concentration in zucchini, root >> stem > petiole > leaf bl ade, indicating the movement was in the transpiration stream. DDE in leaf blades varied less with time, position in trough, or species, than did DDE in stems and petioles, suggesting that DDE in leaves may have been absorbed from the air. These studies demonstrate the ability of zucchini to translocate DDE from roots to shoots is independent of its ability to extract weathered DDE from soil. 3.) In ongoing collaborative investigations with Dr. Jason Kelsey of Muhlenburg College, small pot studies were de signed to assess the influence of nutrient amendments, cultivation conditions, a nd consecutive growing cycles on DDE accumulation by zucchini. This shows the bioavailability of weathered DDE to zucchini is impacted by nutrient status and cultiva tion conditions, and the amount of contaminant removed from soil increases during consecuti ve growing cycles. 4.) In greenhouse studies, the effect of differ ent fungal inoculants on the uptake of weathered PCBs by zucchini clover was inves tigated. Unlike DDE, fungal i noculation did not increase PCB uptake by either plant species, although in both cases the plants were successfully colonized by the fungal inocula. 149 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Bioavailability of persistent organic pollutants to earthworms: In a study with earthworms and plants, experiments were c onducted by Dr. White to study the influence of multispecies interactions in soil on the bioaccumulation factor (BAF; dry-weight ratio of contaminant concentration in the tissue to that in th e soil) of DDE. Although some combinations of earthworm and plant sp ecies caused significant changes in the p,p'-DDE burden in both organisms, the effects were species specific. Contaminant bioconcentration in C. pepo was increased slightly by E. foetida and by 3 fold when the plant was grown with L. terrestris . Eisenia foetida had no effect on the contaminant BCF by C. maxima , but L. terrestris caused a 2-fold reduction in p,p'-DDE uptake by the plant. Contaminant levels in E. foetida and L. terrestris were unaffected by C. pepo . When grown with C. maxima , the concentration of p,p'-DDE decreased by approximately 4 fold and 7 fold in E. foetida and L. terrestris, respectively. The data indicate that contaminant bioavailability in soil may be significantly impacted by multi-species interactions and that exposure/risk estim ation should account for these effects. Quantification of True Sorption Hysteresis. (Mr. Michael Sander and Drs. Yuefeng Lu, and Joseph Pignatello). Sorp tion of organic chemicals to soils and sediments often shows true hysteresis. Tr ue hysteresis is the non-singularity of the sorption-desorption isotherm not attributable to known experiment al artifacts and is usually manifested by less desorption than predicted by the sorption branch of the isotherm. Since true sorption hysteresis is fundamentally important to describing and predicting the behavior of chemicals in soil, a way to quantify it is desirable. Previously suggested indices of hysteresi s are empirical and usually require a specific isotherm model. True sorption hysteresis to synthetic and natural organi c solids has been attributed to irreversible structural changes of the solid during th e sorption-desorption cycle. Therefore, we propose the Thermodynamic Index of I rreversibility ( TII) for quantifying hysteresis in a sorption-desorption cycle in soils where natural organic matter is the predominant sorbing material. The TII is based on the difference in free energy between the observed desorption state a nd the hypothetical fully-reversible state. The index is 0 for completely reversible syst ems and approaches 1 as the process tends toward complete irreversibility (i.e., no desorp tion at all). It does not requ ire any assumptions about the physical properties or molecular compositi on of the solid, and it does not depend on a specific equilibrium sorption model. A sensitivity analysis of measurement errors provides general recommendations for the setup of sorption/desorption experiments. The TII was applied to sorption of 1,4-dichlorobe nzene to two high-organic matter soils, Pahokee Peat and Amherst Soil, and a low-ra nk coal reference material, Beulah-Zap Lignite. Common artificial causes of hystere sis were eliminated. Hysteresis was significant in the peat and the coal. The TII was clearly concentration dependent for both solids; it decreased with concentration for th e peat, but increased w ith concentration for the coal. The TII allows quantification of hysteresis as a func tion of sorbate/sorbent combination, concentration, time, and other variables. Mechanism of Sorption Hysteresis (Drs. Yuefeng Lu and Joseph Pignatello). The sorption of two nonpolar organic solutes in three samples of macromolecular natural organic matter (NOM) was examined in or der to test whethe r history-dependent (\"irreversible\") behaviors, in cluding sorption hysteresis and the conditioning effect, agree 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 with a pore deformation/creation hypothesis fo r irreversibility applicable glassy so lutes are 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and naphthalene (Naph). The NOM samples are a soil humic acid (H-HA), an Al3+-exchanged form of the same humic (Al-HA), a low-rank co al (Beulah-Zap lignite, BZL). The humic acids are believed to be free of environm ental black carbon. The degree of nonlinearity in the sorption isotherm and the ratio of hole-filling to solid phase dissolution obtained from the dual-mode model increased with hardne ss (stiffness) of the solid in the order: H- HA < Al-HA < BZL. Independently of so lid, the solutes show a 15-20 kJ/mole preference for hole \"sites\" compared to dissolu tion \"sites\", which we attribute to the free energy needed in the dissolution domain to cr eate a cavity to accommodate the solute. All solids exhibited hysteresis and the conditioning effect, which refers to enhanced re- sorption after pretreatment with a conditio ning agent (in this case, chlorobenzene). Conditioning the sample results in increased sorption and increased contribution of hole- filling relative to dissolution. The effects of original hole population, matrix stiffness, and solute concentration on the hysteresis i ndex and on the magnitude of the conditioning effect are consistent with a pore-deforma tion mechanism as the underlying cause of sorption irreversibility. This mechanism involves concurre nt processes of irreversible hole expansion and the creation of new holes by the incoming solute (or conditioning agent). The results show that nonlinear and i rreversible behavior may be expected for macromolecular forms of NOM that are in a glassy state, and emphasize the case that NOM is not a passive sorbent, but may be phys ically altered by the sorbing molecules to affect sorption in a second experiment, whethe r that be desorption or re-sorption. The results of this study enhance our understandi ng of the molecular forces that govern the adsorption of pollutants by soil components. Mechanism of Adsorption of Chemic als to Black Carbon (char) Particles. (Drs. Dongqiang Zhu and Joseph Pignatello and Mr. Mi chael Sander). Mole cular interactions controlling the sorption of pollutants to e nvironmental black carbon (i.e., soot and charcoal particles) that are commonly found in soils are not well resolved. The adsorption of a series of aromatic compounds to wood charcoal and nonporous graphite powder as a model adsorbent was studied. The charcoal (420 m 2g-1) was produced from maple-wood shavings by oxygen-limited pyrolysis at 673 K. Issues of concern were the possible involvement of - electron donor-acceptor (EDA) inte ractions of electron-poor and electron-rich compounds with the graphene (i.e., polycyclic aromatic) surface of the BC and molecular sieving effects (i.e., exclusi on based on molecular size). (DNT), to a lesser extent -donor compounds, naphthalene (NAPH) and phe nanthrene (PHEN) was greater than predicted by hydrophobic driving forces in accord with th eir acceptor or donor strength. Hydrophobic effects were estimated using a concentrati on-dependent free energy relationship between adsorption and partitioning into an inert solvent ( n-hexadecane or benzene) for a non- donor/non-acceptor calibration (PYR), chloroform and benzene was by ring-current induced upfield shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum and by charge-transfer bands in the UV/visible spectrum. The EDA component of graphite-water adsorption for the 151 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 acceptors correlated with the NMR-determined complexation constant with the model donors in chloroform, which, in turn, correlate d with -acceptor strength (TNT > DNT > MNT > BNTL) and -donor strength (PYR some trisubstituted benzenes (1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, possibly DNT ). When steric effects are taken into account, the order in adsorption among acceptors was qualitatively similar for graphite and charcoal. The results suggest - EDA in teractions of the acceptors and possibly the donors with both graphite and charcoal surface s. For graphite it is postulated that - acceptors interact with electron-rich regions of the basal plane near edges and defects, and -donors with electron-depleted regions further away. A similar mechanism may operate on the charcoal, but would be modifi ed by the electron-w ithdrawing effects of oxygen functional groups on the edges of graphe ne sheets. he results of this study enhance our understanding of the molecula r forces that govern the adsorption of pollutants by soil components. In a companion study, we investigated th e sorption on charcoal of three weakly soluble aromatic solutes, benzene (BEN), toluene (TOL), and nitrobenzene (NBZ), by conducting both single-solute and bi-solut e experiments. The charcoal (420 m2g-1) was produced from maple-wood shavings by oxygen- limited pyrolysis at 673 K. Solute affinity for charcoal followed the orde r NBZ > TOL > BEN. Commonly employed adsorption models did not adequately describe the single solute isotherms. Competition in both TOL-BEN and the TOL-NBZ bi-solute sy stems was strong. No rmalization of the isotherms for the hydrophobic driving force by using an existing free energy correlation between sorption and partitioning to an inert solvent (benzene or n-hexadecane) with a nonpolar aromatic compound calibration set, re sulted in enhanced sorption of NBZ relative to the coalesced BEN and TOL isothe rms, indicating some specificity in the interaction of NBZ. The competitive data indicated 1:1 molar competition between BEN and TOL and between NBZ and TOL, showing c onclusively that this specificity was not due to a sub-population of sorption sites un ique to NBZ. Hydrogen bonding of H-donor surface groups with the H-acceptor nitro group was ruled out, as the relative affinity for the sorbent among the solutes did not change at all when increasing the solution pH from 6.5 to 11. 1H-NMR experiments showed molecular complexation in chloroform between NBZ and small molecules (naphthalene, and pyrene) selected to model the graphene polycyclic aromatic surface. Such complexation was absent for BEN and TOL. This result, in combination with the results of the companion study by Zhu and Pignatello (Environ. Sci. Technol. , 39: 2033-2041, 2005), is support the exis tence of - electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions between NBZ (electron acceptor) and the polycyclic aromatic charcoal surface (electron donor) as the cause of enhanced NBZ sorption. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the mo lecular forces that govern the adsorption of pollutants by soil components. Surface Properties Controlling Adsorp tion of Chemicals to Black Carbon. (Drs. Dongqiang Zhu, Seokjoon Kwon, and Joseph Pigna tello). Environmental black carbon (BC) is believed to be an important adsorb ent of organic pollutants. In this study, we examined the effects of changes in surface pr operties and adsorbate molecular structure. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 A series of to mapl e wood char prepared under five thermo- chemical conditions as follows. Two chars were prepared in air at 340 oC (C340) and 400oC (C400). A sub-sample of C400 was treated with H 2 in the presence of a supported Pt catalyst at 500oC (C400-H) to remove surface oxygen atoms. Another was treated under N 2 at 500oC (C400-N) to serve as a control fo r C400-H. The reduced C400-H char was further oxidized in air at 340 oC to reintroduce oxygen atoms (C400-H-A). The five chars vary in oxygen atom content (26.1% , 22.3%, 4.2%, 20.8% and 18.6% by weight, respectively) but show only minor differen ces in surface area and pore-size distribution based on N 2 and CO 2 gas adsorption analysis. Thes e chars provide a basis for rationalizing sorption intensity as a function of adsorbate molecular structure and char surface chemistry. The following conclusions we re drawn. (1) Polar in teractions of the adsorbate with surface oxygen functional groups are not a significant driving force for adsorption. (2) When isotherms are adjusted for adsorbate \"hydrophobicity\" (calculated from the n-hexdecane-water partition coefficient), sorption intensity of the polar compounds is greater than sorption intens ity of the nonpolar/weakly-polar compounds, possibly due to - EDA interactions of the polar compounds with the basal plane of the graphene sheets. (3) The largest molecules s how steric exclusion from a portion of the adsorption space available to the others. (4) Removal of oxygen functional groups by hydrogenation enhances sorption intensity by reducing competitive adsorption by water molecules. The results contribute to our unde rstanding of how polluta nts adsorb to this important component of soils. Bench Studies of the Feasibility of Bi oremediation of Coal Tar Contaminated Soil. (Drs. Jun Li, Joseph Pignatello, Barth Smets, Domenico Grasso, and Esteban Monserrate). In this stu dy, the rates of biodegradation and desorption of a set of 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compo unds in a coal-tar contaminated soil collected from a former manufactured gas pl ant site in Connecticut were measured to evaluate the feasibility of in situ bioremed iation of the soil. Experiments were conducted in well-mixed, aerobic soil suspensions containing various additives over a 93-106 day period. In general, both biotransformation and desorption decreased with PAH ring size, becoming negligible for the six-ring P AH compounds. Biodegradation by native microorganisms was strongly accelerated by the a ddition of inorganic nutrients (N, P, K, and trace metals). The rates of biot ransformation of PAH compounds by native microorganisms in these nutrient-amended fl asks outpaced their maximum rates of desorption (i.e., chelate-enhanced and carried out in the presence of an infinite sink of Tenax polymer beads) in sterilized system s run in parallel, s uggesting that native microorganisms somehow facilitated desorption of the PAHs. Biodegradation by native microorganisms in nutrient-amended flasks ap peared unaffected by th e addition of a site- derived bacterial enrichment culture, even though this cultu re resulting in ~100-fold higher aromatic dioxygenase levels, and furt hermore by the addition of 0.01 M chelating agent (citrate or pyrophosphate), even though enhanced desorption in microbially-inactiv ated flasks. The strong ability of nutrients to enhance degradation of the bioavailable PAHs indicates that their pers istence for many decades at 153 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 this site is probably due to nut rient-limited natural biodegrada tion. It also suggests that an effective strategy for their bioremediation could consist simply of adding inorganic nutrients. VALLEY LABORATORY RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 43 experi mental plots during the past year at the Windsor farm. Five Windsor-based scientists had 30 of these plots; five New Haven-based scientists were using the remain ing 13 plots. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off s ite, such as in grower s' fields and State forests. Richard Horvath kept the farm and his equipment ready and in excellent shape. With the help of Michael McHill and Matthew Deltendre, Richard expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specifi c needs of each scientist. He and his summer assistants did an outstanding job main taining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with Rose Hiskes and the Connecticut Nurser y and Landscape Association. Mr. Horvath and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agri cultural Pesticides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Exotic insect pests of hemlock Dr. Carole Cheah is currently dividing her time between research projects on various aspects of biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid, spending 50% of her time at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, cooperating with Dr. Richard Cowles, and 50% at the Northeastern Research Stati on, USDA Forest Service in Hamden, CT. Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae , an introduced invasive insect pest from Asia, continues to be a very serious pest of national importanc e, threatening native eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis and Carolina hemlock, Tsuga caroliniana on state and private lands, national forests and park s, and nursery production of hemlocks for landscape use in 16 eastern stat es. Current range expansion fo r HWA is at its most rapid rate southwards through the Carolinas, Geor gia and Tennessee where extensive hemlock mortality is occurring, while a series of colder than nor mal winters have temporarily retarded its northward and westward expans ion. Biological control remains the major priority of the HWA Initiative for management, developed by the USDA Forest Service with national and state partners. Dr. Cheah cont inues to direct a 3 pa rt project to enhance biological control of HWA using imported coccin ellid predators, in collaboration with the USDA Forest Service. 1.) Dr. Cheah participated in a year long Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) at the Valley Laboratory with two seniors, Richard Cha ndler III and Eddie Thornton, Jr. from Weaver High School, Hart ford through the Harris AgriScience Center in Bloomfield, a vocational agricultural schoo l. They volunteered as interns 2 to 3 afternoons a week throughout the school year and assisted in experiments, colony maintenance and rearing of the introd uced Japanese predatory in collaborati on with Dr. Allen Cohen, Insect 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Diet and Rearing Institute, Tucs on, Arizona, continued with arti ficial diet investigations for maintaining and/or mass rearing Sasajiscymnus (formerly Pseudoscymnus ) tsugae , an introduced predator for biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid. Another 20 diets were tested for palatability and feeding prefer ences. Preferred con centrations of sugars, antifungal components, additional vitamins a nd feeding stimulants were established. Diets containing casein and wheatgerm were the least palatable, while diets with egg yolk were preferred. However, adult S. tsugae did not readily accept diet formulations containing commercial e gg extracts and/or entomophage di ets. It was determined from behavioral bioassays that a dults highly preferred fresh e gg preparations. A novel new diet delivery system was deve loped using the host plant, non-infested eastern hemlock, which greatly increased predat or feeding response. Diet applied to hemlock tips were readily fed on and initial trials showed high su rvival (74%) after 6 w eeks on artificial diet and water alone. This has been significant pr ogress toward the development of a diet for maintaining survival of predators reared fo r biological control implementation in the management of hemlock woolly adelgid. Larvae of S. tsugae also responded and fed for the first time on the same diet. Current studi es are directed toward the development of suitable textures for larval f eeding and the potential for reari ng through to the adult stage. The national biological control program administered and supported by the USDA Forest Service provides severa l introduced predator specie s for deployment in the HWA- infested states. Currently, five state-run, priv ate or commercial inse ctaries in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North and South Caroli na and Tennessee are mass rearing S. tsugae and other imported predators using a proce dure completely dependent on extensive collections of healthy, heavily infested hemloc k foliage. The availability of such foliage, optimal for mass production of high vigor pred ators, is unpredictab le due to recent extreme winter mortality of adelgids, and/ or declining hemlock conditions affecting adelgid quality. The dependence on natura l prey collections has placed production limitations on the efficacy of the biological control management strategy. Currently, the annual rate of mass production of predators for re lease in multiple states is subject to the bottleneck caused by adelgid availability and the high costs of the labor-intensive process. Current funding for mass rearing at federally supported inse ctaries in the south and mid-Atlantic runs at > $500,000 annually. While annual production has numbered in the several hundred thousands for S. tsugae and to a much lesser extent for other species, the demand for more predators greatly exceeds the supply. Development of an artificial diet for mass rearing and/or a supplement for enhancing S. tsugae survival during storage when adelgid is scarce until implementation w ould have significant economic impact and savings for the multiple states (16 eastern states to date) benefiting from the national biological control strategy for hemlock woolly adelgid management. Findings would also have significant implications and applicability for other predator species mass-produced for biological control. 2). Hemlock health assessments in S. tsugae release sites in 2004 were completed by Dr. Cheah with the assistance of Jason Pa rent, and assessments in 2005 are continuing with the assistance of James Preste, Rich ard Chandler and Eddie Thornton. In Connecticut, the majorities of S. tsugae release sites were implemented in the mid-late 1990s and at 4-10 years since release represent some of the oldest S .tsugae sites in the U.S. In 2004, S. tsugae release sites conti nued to show recovery across all types of woodland suitability si tes with high levels of new shoot production and much reduced 155 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 HWA crown levels. Hemlock recovery was evident even in the poorest of hemlock habitats composed of rocky outcrops with very thin droughty soils. The recovery of hemlocks occurred statewide in both releas e and non-release stands and was correlated with optimal cool moist growing seasons and concurrent heavy winter mortality of adelgids in 2003 and 2004. Cumulative hemloc k mortality in release sites was minimal and was largely due to recent drought even ts in 1999 and 2002. The major portion of mortality was attributed to hemlock borer a ttacks. The 2005 winter was less severe with much more variable and patchy HWA survival (mean 71%) and some resurgence of HWA has occurred in some eastern sites. Foliar transparency, a standard Forest Inventory Analysis procedure used by the USDA Forest Service in forest health monitoring, is a visual index, which measures the amount of sunlight penetrating the canopy. Foliar transparency in combined Connecticut and New Jersey hemlock assessments emerged as a useful tool for tracking hemlock health in release and non- release sites from year to year in a joint assessment performed by the two states. A low transparency rating indicates a more dense, healthy and foliated cr own. Comparisons of Connecticut foliar transparency ratings in 2003 were analyzed in 2005 and mean ratings in S. tsugae release sites were significantly lower than in non-release infested hemlock stands surveyed in Litchfield and northern Ha rtford counties. Mean foliar transparencies in release sites were statistically compar able to those in pristine northwestern high elevation stands which had negligible adelgid or scale infestations or impact, indicating the overall restoration of previously adel gid-damaged hemlock stands. In 2004 and 2005, two S. tsugae , a larva and an adult, were reco vered during summer sampling. The recovery of previously declining hemlock stands in Connect icut is one of the first to be reported in eastern states th at have been under HWA siege since the early 1990s. This recovery has significant economic and ecol ogical implications on managed forests, obligate species, recreational areas, wildlife winter cover, and watershed ecosystems. The majority of the premium fishing and re creational streams and rivers are hemlock- lined. Hemlock-dominated streams harbor c onsiderably higher aquatic species diversity than comparable mixed hardwood streams. Streams running through hemlock stands have significantly cooler temperatures and oxygenated waters which are essential for the survival of native brook trout and other stoc ked trout species, wh ich are the preferred species for stream recreational fishing. The loss of hemlock stands along important trout streams would impact the part of the revenue generated by the sale of fishing licenses for the state which support the stat e's fisheries programs. Heml ocks are also important for maintaining and holding soil moisture and nutrien ts and provide an important function in the purification of ground and stream waters around reservoirs. Several warbler and vireo species are obligate to hemlock stands and preservation of natural hemlock stands enhances the survival of these avian species. In aesthetic and functional terms, hemlocks also provide dense cool shade for popular picn ic and other public recreational areas and the recovery of damaged hemlock stands is important to the public's enjoyment of the outdoors. Winter cover in hemlock stands is very important to the survival of many wildlife species with important implicati ons for recreational hun ting revenues for the state. The documented recovery of dama ged hemlock stands is concurrent with S. tsugae releases in Connecticut and New Jersey and th is finding, in addition to recent recoveries of S. tsugae, has provided the first documentation for continued predator establishment and encouraging support for the national biologi cal control program of the USDA Forest 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Service, whose annual budget for HWA res earch and suppression support exceeds 3-5 million annually. 3) Dr. Cheah, with the assistance of USDA Forest Service technicians Paul Moore, Gregg Bradford and Cuyler Remick, has re -established the original stressed US laboratory colonies and imp roved mass rearing technique s for two other introduced coccinellid species from southwestern China, Scymnus sinuanodulus and Scymnus ningshanensis . These species were discovered in the mid-1990s by Dr. Michael Montgomery and his colleagues from China. Successful small-scale mass-rearing in 2004-2005 at the Insect Rearing Facility of the Northeastern Research Station in Hamden, CT, has produced healthy la dybeetles for the first release of S. sinuanodulus in the Northeast at the Centenni al Memorial State Forest in Weston, Fairfield County, CT and has also provided beetles for a 2004 fa ll release in the so uthern Appalachian mountains of northern Georgia. A comparativ e sleeve assessment also provided the first documentation in Connecticut and Georgia in spring 2005 of the reproductive ability of mature S. sinuanodulus (> 1 year) and capability of deve lopment from egg to adult under caged field conditions at both th e northern and southern part of the HWA range. Studies in 2004 and 2005 have also shown that S. ningshanensis does not exhibit peak reproductive ability until the s econd year after emergence, in spite of the provision of optimal densities of healthy adelgids, photoperiod and temperature. Over 5,000 S. sinuanodulus and > 1,300 S. ningshanensis were successfully reared in Hamden in 2005 and this will facilitate additional free release trials of both species next spring in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and perhaps othe r states. Optimal temperatures and photoperiod for inducing oviposit ion and maintenance of Scymnus adults until implementation and release have also been established through studies in Hamden. In addition, Dr. Cheah is also directing th e quarantine investigations and evaluations of new species of coccinellids collected from expanded foreign exploration in China that were initiated in April 2005 under the biological control initiative. These studies are being conducted in the USDA Forest Servi ce Quarantine Laboratory in Ansonia, CT. The revival of imported Scymnus predator colonies has been an important step forward toward the implementation of free rele ase trials. This has been long been an important objective of the national biologi cal control strategy by the USDA Forest Service. The evaluations of new species of co ccinellids for potentia l biological control of HWA under quarantine laboratory conditions are also an important component of the national strategy for establishi ng a complex of introduced pred ators in the US to combat HWA. USDA Forest service support for expa nded explorations and quarantine support was $378,000 in 2005. Nursery Integrated Pest Management Tim Abbey continues to work with co mmercial nursery growers, and other ornamental plant industries, to promote th e adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) practices. During the 2004 field season, th ree nurseries received intensive on-site assistance with establishment of IPM program s. Detailed pestic ide records from one nursery were used to calculate changes in pes ticide use attributed to increased adoption of IPM strategies. Pesticide usage records fr om the cooperative year, in this case 2004, are compared to the year designated as pre-IPM adoption (2002). Overall, 157 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 insecticide/miticide usage increased by 16.3 pounds of product. Total active ingredient applied decreased by 4.7 pounds. This translat ed into a decrease of $234 for pesticide products. Along with the detaile d analysis of the pesticide spray records, participants were asked to complete a post-season questi onnaire that allows them to review their collaboration with Mr. Abbey. The three partic ipants of record rated the overall Nursery IPM program as \"good.\" All of the particip ants stated that th ey would recommend the program to other Connecticut nurseries. The first year of a life history study of the rhododendron leafminer ( Lyonetia latistrigella ) was completed in 2004 at a model container nursery. Forty-one hoop houses were selected in the nur sery. Areas (approximately 250 sq.ft.) were marked with flagging tape at both ends and the middle of each house. The Rhododendron spp. in these areas were monitored on a weekly basis from late April through September. Infested leaves were counted and removed each wee k. The routine monitoring documented the date and location that this pest first appear ed in the nursery, along with the corresponding growing degree days. Insecticide applications were applied to target specific insect life stages and areas of rhododendrons rather than cover sprays to entire blocks of plants. The hypothesis that early detection and targeted insecticide treatmen ts will stop a major rhododendron leafminer infestation, and thus, decrease overall insecticide applications, appears to be accurate. There was minimal (non-detectable) damage at the end of the 2004 growing season. The monitoring will cont inue in 2005 to confirm the observations made in 2004. At this time in 2005, no damaging leafminer population has been detected. A native plant survey was sent to Connect icut Nursery and Landscape Association members who are retail businesses, or have retail as part of their business. The intent of the survey was to determine if the publication Alternatives for Invasive Ornamental Plant Species (originally printed in November 2002 a nd revised September 2004) is being used by the general public to influence their sele ction of plants (i.e., has there been an increased awareness and sales of native plant species in garden centers). Ninety-two surveys were mailed in late 2004. Forty-four (48%) were returned. The results showed that most respondents had not seen a consumer using the publication, a nd that the sale of native ornamentals has not increased for most businesses. Black vine weevil : Commercially acceptable strawberry cultivars grown in the Northeast vary in their susceptibility to black vine weevil (mediated by adult feeding preference for the foliage) and black root rot. Four varieties with superior tolerance for either or both of these ch aracteristics produced about 2,000 seedlings in 2003. During the first year of growth, no obvious differences with respect to black root rot or black vine weevil were obvious. Selections have been ma de to eliminate plants with photosynthetic defects (variegation), excessive crown division, susceptibility to leaf diseases, and poor fruit flavor. Some plants have collapsed due to poor root function and have been eliminated, and screening conti nues to determine palatability of foliage to black vine weevil adults. Sixty plants with exceptiona l flavor and fruit size were allowed to set runners, and these daughter plants were tested in the greenhouse (i n collaboration with Dr. James LaMondia) to determine their tole rance to black root rot. Considerable variation was present, with tw o modes of tolerance to black root rot being apparent. 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Some plants had a very low incidence of in fection of their roots, while other plants simply grew so many roots that the loss of some of the root biomass from root rot did not affect overall root function. Many more strawberry hybrids have been found through laboratory bioassays to be unpalatable to bl ack vine weevil adults . These additional plants will be screened during the winter for black root rot suscepti bility, and the best plants (based on flavor, fruit size, black vine weevil tolerance, and black root rot tolerance) will be propagated further to fiel d test in cooperating grower's fields to determine commercial acceptability. Christmas tree insect pest management: A special problem for Christmas tree growers is the loss of green co lor in foliage late in the gr owing season. Color defects can be caused by the loss of root function, for ex ample, by white grub injury to roots. A dose-response experiment determined whethe r application to the soil of imidacloprid (Admire) would manage white grubs, conifer root aphids, and balsam twig aphids. In this trial, imidacloprid significantly reduced the populations of conifer root aphid, whereas the white grub population was too low to determine treatment effects. Although the populations of balsam twig aphids were not reduced quickly enough to prevent injury during the year of applicati on, the population of stem moth er aphids was significantly reduced during the next spring. Therefore, a new strategy for using soil-applied systemic insecticides may provide an alternative to th e current practice of foliar sprays to control balsam twig aphid. A follow-up study is curr ently evaluating the impact of imidacloprid on various pests and the growth rate of Christmas trees. Along with the previously mentioned insect pests, this study will dete rmine whether populations of the yellow ant are disrupted. The yellow ant is found in mutua listic association with conifer root aphids, and is implicated in the dispersal of root ap hids between trees. Pales weevils seriously damage Christmas trees when the adults feed on and girdle side bran ches and leaders. The larvae develop in fresh stumps of spruce and pines; so the focus for control of this pest has been to kill adults at the stumps before they have a chance to lay eggs. In 2003, stump sprays of bifenthrin were as effective as the labeled high rate of chlorpyrifos for preventing larval development on spruce stumps at a cooperating Christmas tree farm. The concentration of chlorpyrifos comm only sprayed by growers was found to be completely ineffective. In 2004, a higher rate of bifenthrin was tested, and found to not improve control. Improvement in control is being tested in 2005 by treating a larger area around the stump, and by spraying at an ea rlier timing. An organically acceptable cultural control method (a 1-inch layer of soil burying the stump) and a potential deterrent to oviposition (a spray of diesel fuel on the stump) were found in 2004 to be ineffective. Growers in the past have used diesel fuel in combination with insecticides; these results should discourage this ineff ective and potentially polluting practice. Growers have now adopted the use of bife nthrin for management of pales weevils, thereby reducing the spraying of the much more toxic organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos. The cost of control has been decreased from about $73 to $20 per acre, and control has improved. White pine weevil is a similarly troublesome pest, which in spite of its name, attacks nearly all species of trees grown as Christmas trees. A trial conducted in 2005 at a cooperating grower's field has determined that an application rate of 3.4 grams per acre of bifent hrin applied to the leaders in early April provided complete control of this pest, while a 1.7 gram rate gave 80% suppression. This treatment will cost 159 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 $1.75 per acre, and save approximately a va lue of $20 - $1,000 per acre in damage to trees. Hemlock woolly adelgid: Imidacloprid application t echniques for control of hemlock woolly adelgid include a drench around the base of the tree, injection into the soil close to the trunk or under the dripline, or trunk injection w ith various types of equipment. All of these methods were co mpared in fall (2002) versus spring (2003) application timing in five sites within Connecticut to determine the most effective techniques. All soil-based applications provided statisti cally significant and excellent levels (48 - 100%) of population reduction over one year, with the so il injection near the trunk at the fall timing giving complete co ntrol. Trunk injection methods were ineffective, with populations of adelgids ra nging from 52 - 144% of those found in the untreated checks. The average population re duction for the soil-based applications was found to be 78% in 2003, and 98.2% in 2004 repeat ed evaluations of these treated trees. Improved control of adelgid populations over time suggests that annual treatment of valuable forest or landscape hemlock trees is unnecessary, and th at an appropriate treatment interval is greater than 2 years. A follow-up experiment in Pennsylvania state forests will determine whether a lower dos age of imidacloprid will provide adequate control of hemlock woolly adelgid. The longe r treatment interval and lower dosages of imidacloprid implies that the environmental loading of imidacloprid could be reduced, thereby reducing treatment cost s and the risks to non-target organisms. These results have influenced decision-making in hemloc k forests throughout th e range of hemlock woolly adelgid infestations, both at the le vel of individual arbor ists treating landscape trees, in state forest treatment plans (Pe nnsylvania) and in federal forests (Smoky Mountains National Forest). Most importantl y, ineffective treatment measures have been abandoned (use of the Wedgle trunk injection system), and soil application has become the treatment method of choice where practicable. Indoor Fungi Studies : Dr. DeWei Li conducted research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on building materials, and infilt ration of mushroom spores outdoors into residences. Airborne fungi : Dr. Li is collecting both indoor and outdoor air samples from New Haven, Windsor, and Avon on a monthly ba sis. This is a long-term study started last fall to measure the airborne fungal con centration and compositions (types of fungi) in Connecticut, to establish the baseline of exposur e of residents/occupant s to airborne fungi in CT, and to determine seasonal and diurnal patterns of airborne fungi, and at the same time determine the relationship of airborne indoor fungi with outdoor ones. The samples are under analysis. Threshol ds for fungal exposure levels are not available in Connecticut and in the United States at presen t due to a lack of long term research and the presence of huge variations in airborne fungi related to geographic areas, season, and time. This study is important to determin e the exposure level of airborne fungi in Connecticut in different seasons and the pre dominant airborne fungi in the area. These data will provide professionals who c onduct field investigat ion of indoor fungal infestation with baseline data for comparison. The outcome of the study will help Indoor 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Air Quality (IAQ) professionals to come up a better sampling strategy for investigation and remediation of indoor fungi. Fungal succession on building materials : A fungal succession on drywall experiment is being conducted on interior wall units (2 \u00d7 4 ft), which were specially built for the project. The wall units are subject to water damage at low (2L), medium (4L), high (8L) levels by adding water to the wall units at monthly intervals. Three batches of fungal samples are taken from the wall units every four months. The early predominant fungi that appeared on wall units with low water damage appeared on wall units with medium wa ter damage and the predominant fungi fungi found on wa ll units with high water damage is pos itively related with the level of water damage. Moisture distribution following water damage was also studied. After the drywalls were wetted at the bottom, water movement in the drywalls was determined by wooden stubs behind the drywalls. Moisture le vels at the spots on the drywall with stubs behind them are much higher than the ones at locations without stubs behind. Moisture in the wall units is unevenly distributed a nd it appears that woode n stubs absorbed and move water more efficiently than the drywall panels. Preliminary data showed that the severi ty of water damage affects the type of fungi that developed on the wall units. More diversified fungi developed on the wall units with higher levels of water damage. At early stages of water damage species of Penicillium and Aspergillus are not the predominant specie s. These results are not in agreement with what indoor ai r quality professionals curren tly believe. These data are crucial to the IAQ industry a nd public health professionals. Dating the time frame of water damage according to what kinds of fungi are present will require additional research. Infiltration of spores of mu shrooms outdoors into residences : Most indoor airborne fungi originate from outdoor source s. A study was conducted to determine the ability of mushroom spores produced near re sidences to infiltrate into residences, to determine release and short distant dispersal of several mushrooms, and to define their concentration fluctuation with time. Samples of airborne spores of Amanita muscaria var. alba and two boletes were collected from th ree locations: the ba ck yard, deck, and living room in September and October of 2004 in Avon CT. It was found that the fruiting bodies of Amanita muscaria var. alba released a large amount of spores into the air. In the first day of expansion of the fruiting body, the concentration of airborne spores near the fruiting bodies ranged from 21,992 to151,270 spores/m3. The 281,738 spores/m3. Amanita muscaria var. alba spore release mainly occurred in the first three days following the expansion of the caps. The concentrations of released spores near fruiting bodies were 77,137; 75,062, and 41,738 spores/m3 in the first three days, respectively. After three days, the c oncentration dropped by 95%. On the deck, 161 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 airborne spore concentrations dropped 96 to 99% after 3 days with the concentrations of 940, 575, and 1,359 spores/m3 in the first three days, resp ectively. Spore concentration showed a diurnal patte rn with a relatively extended night peak. Relative humidity and dew were positively correlated with spore release and short distance dispersal. Rain and rain rate were positively correlated with s pore release, but not correlated with short distance dispersal. The spore release period of Amanita muscaria var. alba was short, but within such a period it releas ed a large amount of spores. However, less than 5% of spores released were dispersed to the deck 5.2 m away and 2.7 m above the fruiting bodies. Less than 0.1% of spores dispersed from the fruiting bodies were found inside a nearby residence. Airborne boletes spores at all locations showed diurnal pa tterns with night peaks. Bolete spores in the living rooms showed st rong correlations with the ones on the deck. Dew and wind speed correlated with both la rge and small spores at all locations positively and negatively, respectively. Relative humidity was correlated with the spores outdoors, except the small spores on the deck. Rain was not correlated with the number of bolete spores. Diurnal patterns and daily variations of small sp ores near the ground were correlated with the ones on the deck, but not so for large spores. Human activity had a significant effect on large bolete s pores in the living room, but not on the small ones. With an open window/door, a significan t number of bolete spores entered the residence and the concentration of small bo lete spores indoors reached 33,301 spores/m3. However, overall <5 % of the s pores infiltrated the residence. The occurrence of high populations of air borne spores of mushrooms may have significant effects on allergic individuals. Such data and information are helpful for medical practitioners to better understand mush room related allergy for proper diagnosis and treatment. Amanita muscaria var. alba is a toxic mushroom. The effect of breathing in such spores on public health is not cl ear. Individuals near fruiting bodies of Amanita muscaria var. alba will be exposed to a large amount of airborne spores. To very sensitive individuals, such an exposure could be a very significant hea lth risk. This area needs more research on the health effects of these mushroom spores in the air. Spatial distribution of the mushrooms was different within a 5-m range. Less than 5 % of the mushroom spores infiltrated the residence. Diurnal and daily vari ations of mushroom spores indoors and outdoors were very high and reached > 10 folds for the comparisons of maximal and minimal spore populations. U nderstanding spatial, daily, and seasonal variations of mushroom spores will be cruc ial for using a proper strategy to take air samples to avoid non-representative results. Tobacco pathology : The breeding program conducted by Dr. Jim LaMondia to develop resistance to tobacco pathogens in Connecticut, including Fusarium oxysporum tobacco the blue mold pathogen (Peronospora tabacina ) is continuing for both shade a nd broadleaf tobacco types. The development and deployment of resistant plan ts is the most effective, economical and environmentally safe means of managing diseas e. Approximately 25 lines each of shade and broadleaf tobacco were grown and eval uated under field conditions in 2004. After a tobacco free period to eliminate blue mold, an additional generation of 20 shade and 20 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 broadleaf lines was grown in the greenhous e during the winter of 2004-2005 to reduce the number of years required to re lease resistant lines to growers. Fusarium wilt increased in severity du ring the 1980's and early 1990's, causing up to 20% crop losses on broadleaf tobacco. The development and release of wilt-resistant broadleaf cultivars has avoided at least $5 million per year in losses due to this disease each year since 1992. Production of CAES wilt-re sistant cultivars has reduced spread of the pathogen and kept infested fields in production without soil fumigation. All advanced broadleaf lines under development in the breedi ng program continue to be screened for high levels of resistance to wilt. The tobacco cyst nematode decreases shade tobacco growth and leaf yield directly (losses of up to 15%) and indi rectly affects broadleaf tob acco as a component of the Fusarium wilt complex. Single gene resistance to G. t. tabacum is being transferred to shade and broadleaf tobaccos using both a pedigree breeding program with repeated backcrossing to Connecticut types as well as a bulk system of modified single seed descent. Additional resistant lines were pr ogeny tested and screened to determine if resistance was due to the same gene as previo usly utilized sources, or if a different gene was responsible and available for the breeding pr ogram. It appears th at all resistant lines tested have resistance conferred by the sa me gene. Approximately 900 progeny of BC9 to BC12 or F1 hybrid crosses were evaluated for nematode resistance and/or horticultural characters in the field and in greenhouse tray evaluations. Leaf quality evaluations were conducted on advanced lines in cooperation with growers in 2004 and limited quantities of seed were made available to grow ers for cooperative field evaluation under commercial conditions. Tobacco cyst nemat ode shade tobacco lines are being crossed with blue mold-resistant parents to select for resistance to both pathogens. In field evaluations, these resistant lines reduced tobacco cyst nematode populations by 60 to 80%, similar to the effects of soil fumigati on with a broad spectrum nematicide. The deployment of TCN-resistant cultivars w ould reduce human health risks, reduce environmental exposure to large amounts of fu migant nematicides and be more effective than soil fumigation while eliminating costs of approximately $500 per acre. Single dominant gene resistance to tobacco mosaic virus is present in many of these lines. Evaluation and selection for TM V resistance is conducted on all field-grown progeny. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, TMV infection resulted in significant commercial losses ($3 million to $5 million) due to green spot symptom development on susceptible shade tobacco leaves. Our research demonstrat ed the associated of green spot with TMV infection, and determined that plant resistan ce was the single most important factor for reducing green spot disease. Grower lines were evaluated for resistance to TMV and large amounts of seed of homozygous TMV -resistant 8212 produced at the Valley Lab was distributed to growers to re duce losses from virus infection. Blue mold, caused by Peronospora tabacina, has been a recurring problem on tobacco in the Connecticut River Valley fr om 1997 through 2004, causing losses in the tens of millions of dollars annually. The development and use of better spray technology, timing of applications, and grow er education have greatly redu ced blue mold severity in recent years. Tobacco lines w ith resistance to blue mold were collected from different sources and evaluated for blue mold resistan ce under field conditions in Windsor. Shade and broadleaf tobacco lines last grown in th e 1960's and held in long-term storage in North Carolina ranged from almost complete im munity to mildly infected. Two shade 163 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 tobacco lines developed by the USDA in th e 1960's, line numbers 509 and 292-393, were promising sources of adapted resistance and ha ve been used as parents in crosses to Connecticut shade tobacco types. A Cuban dark tobacco accession, H2000, was found to be virtually immune to blue mold infection and will be used as a resistant parent in crosses to Connecticut broadl eaf tobacco. Blue mold resi stance breeding in shade and broadleaf is being attempted through the se lection of resistant inbred lines and the development of male-sterile Connecticut types to allow the production of F1 hybrids between resistant 509 or 292-393 and sus ceptible shade tobacco and H2000 and susceptible broadleaf tobacco. Early hybrid s were intermediate in resistance and commercial quality. Pathogen response to toba cco resistance genes differed in the years prior to 2001 and in 2001 to 2002. Greater numbe rs of lesions of larger size have been observed on F1 lines in 2001, 2002 and 2003, indi cating that a more aggressive isolate may have been present. Resistance levels generally decreased with inbreeding beyond the F1 selection, however, certain F2 selections with signif icant resistance have been identified and selfed to the F3. Male sterile lines are also curren tly being developed to allow production of F1 hybrid blue mold re sistant seed. Blue mold incidence was compared between susceptible commercial varie ties and resistant lines. Over 5 pickings in 2004, susceptible 8212 tobacco had a total of 360 blue mold lesions per plant while several promising advanced breeding lines had 0 to 11 lesions per plant. The development and deployment of blue mold-re sistant cultivars will greatly reduce disease losses with reduced pesticide application. Fungicide applications were evaluated for efficacy of blue mold control in shade and broadleaf tobacco in Windsor, CT. Acroba t MZ, Actigard, and Quadris fungicides were applied at 14-day intervals to shade and broadl eaf tobacco plants in small plots. Actigard resulted in fewer blue mold lesions per le af than Acrobat MZ (1.0 to 2.5 lb./acre) or Quadris (0.24 or 0.48 pt/acre) and was activ e at rates as low as 0.03 oz/acre Actigard when applied in combination with Acrobat MZ or Quadris. All fungicide applications resulted in significantly less disease than untreated controls. Actigard, a systemic acquired resistance elicitor, ma y act synergistically with f ungicides to increase fungicide efficacy at very low rates. Perennial flowers and Ornamentals: Plant parasitic foliar nematodes can cause severe damage to a large number of flow ering ornamentals in nurseries and landscape plantings. The range of symptoms obse rved on flowering ornamentals can vary considerably with plant and nematode species, but leaves, stems, flowers, or buds are commonly distorted, dwarfed and killed. There are two differe nt plant parasitic nematodes which can attack above-ground nematode. Both of these nematodes are wide ly distributed and can quickly ruin foliage and flowers. Dr. LaMondia evaluated the insecticides Avid (avermectin) and Pylon (chlorfenapyr ) in combination with shoot pruning, for efficacy against both nematodes on Anemone, Salvia and Phlox. Anemone and Phlox, but not in Salvia. Th e combination of scouting, sanitation and insecticide use is currently the only effective management approach for foliar nematodes. Root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., are one of the mo st widespread pests limiting agricultural pro ductivity around the world, infect all major crop plants, and are 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 difficult to control in the soil environmen t. The northern root-knot nematode M. hapla is a common and serious problem in many minor-u se food and ornamental crops such as herbaceous perennial ornamentals, vegetables and small fruit in the Northeastern U.S. The effects of a TerraClean (active i ngredient 27.18% hydrogen dioxide; EPA eurized field soil inoculated with M. hapla juveniles and eggs in suspension or with nematode-infested roots containing females, juveniles, and egg masses were evaluated in the greenhouse and in field microplots, then planted with one Rutgers tomato transplant 24 hours after treatment. TerraClean (active ingredient 27.18% hydrogen dioxide; EPA pr eliminary greenhouse experiments, pre-plant drenches of 1 to 500 and 1 to 250 dilutions of TerraClean to root-knot nematode-infested soil reduced tomato root galls per plant by 43 to 59 percent after four weeks growth (P=0.006). In the field, prepla nt drench treatments reduced initial root infection, but populations were not different at the end of the season. Re search is continuing in 2005. Weed research: Dr. Todd Mervosh conducts research on w eed management in a variety of crop systems and in non-crop areas. In the past year, his projects in cluded weed control experiments in ornamental plants grown in containers, Christmas tree plantings, and pumpkins. These experiments were conduc ted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor and/or in growers' fiel ds or nurseries. Dr. John Ahre ns is a research partner in some experiments involving ornamentals and Ch ristmas trees. In addition, Dr. Mervosh is conducting experiments to find effectiv e and environmentally sound methods to control the following non-native invasive plants: Asiatic (Oriental) bittersweet ( Celastrus orbiculatus ) vines in a woodland at Bluff Point St ate Park in Groton, pale swallowwort (Cynanchum rossicum ) in a coastal ecosystem at Bluff Point, Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica ) on town-owned reed (phragmites) (Phragmites australis ) in marshes in Manchester and in Old Saybrook. Jeremy Leifert assisted with projects in the summer of 2004, and Krystle Olszewski and Dorothy Reiss assisted with projects in the summer of 2005. Nursery ornamental weed control: The efficacy of six granular herbicides for residual weed control in nursery containers and their safety to the ornamental shrub spirea ( Spiraea x bumalda ) was determined in two-gallon containers. Plugs of spirea were planted in half the containers on June 4, while the other half remained plantless. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four plots per treatment. Each plot containe d three containers of spirea and three plantless containers. In addition to an untreated check, the follo wing herbicide treatments were applied on June 10: Snapshot 2.5TG at 150 lb/A (isoxabe n + 150 lb/A ([lumioxazin). Once the spirea foliage was completely dry, treatments were applied over the containers. Thirty minutes after applications had been completed; all containe rs were watered. On June 11, seeds of the following weeds were spread in separate pl antless pots in each pearlwort ( Sagina procumbens ). Relatively minor stunting of growth (1.5 on a scale of 0 to 10) was observed on spirea treated with flumioxazin at 4 WAT, but the plants recovered. No other treatment injured spirea. Weed control data (visual ratings based on weed numbers and size) and weed counts we re collected at 6, 12 and 16 WAT. At 6 WAT, all treatments provided 95% or better co ntrol of crabgrass and at least 92% control of pepperweed. Nearly complete prevention of pearlwort was provi ded by treatments other than oxadiazon alone and oxyfluor fen + oxadiazon, both of which provided no control of pearlwort. Weeds were counted and removed, and the same weed seeds as before were sown in the plantless pots. At 16 WAT, containers tr eated with flumioxazin had the fewest weeds overall, with the ratings: crabgrass, 70%; pepperweed, 86%; and pearlwort, 100%. other herbicides ranged from 15% (oxyfluorfen for pearlwort. Overall, flumioxazin provided better residual control of the weeds present than did the other herbicides tested. At the IR-4 Ornamental Horticulture Wo rkshop in 2003, high priority was placed on obtaining data needed to expand labels for pr eemergence herbicides to include additional tolerant perennials. Drs. Me rvosh and Ahrens conducted an e xperiment to evaluate four widely grown herbaceous perennials for their tolerances to herbicides not currently registered for use on these plants. Th e following herbicides were included: s- metolachlor (Pennant Alchemilla mollis ). Perennial container experiment at Valley Laboratory All plants were potted in 1-gallon containers on June 11, 2004. Each plot contained three plants of each perennial and treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design. Applied on June 17, treatments consisted of s-metolachlor sprays at 1, 2 and 4 lb ai/A, pendimethalin granules at 3, 6 and 12 lb ai/A , and isoxaben plus trifluralin granules at 2.5, 5 and 10 lb ai/A (0.5, 1 and 2 lb ai/A of isoxaben plus 2, 4 and 8 lb ai/A of trifluralin, respect ively), and an untreated check. Visual evaluations of plant injury (0 = no injury; 10 = d ead) were recorded on June 24, July 2 and July 30 [1, 2 and 6 weeks after treatment (WAT)]. Plant vigor (0 = dead; 10 = most vigorous) was evaluated on August 26 and October 18 (10 and 18 WAT) . The only significant injury was observed on Chrysogonum treated with isoxaben plus triflu ralin at dosages of 5 and 10 lb 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 ai/A. Injury was first obse rved at 2 WAT, when averag e injury ratings of 1.5 and 1.75, respectively, were assigned. Injury consisted of stunti ng and purple leaf coloration. Slight reductions in vigor (9.0 and 8.5, respectively) of these Chrysogonum plants were observed later in the growing season. The only other treatment effect was a slight reduction in flowering of Lavandula at 10 WAT with isoxaben plus trifluralin at the 10 lb ai/A rate. Otherwise, the perennials demonstr ated excellent tolerance to the herbicides tested. Weed Management in Pumpkins: Herbicide options for pumpkins ( Cucurbita pepo L.) were evaluated in 2004 in experiments conducted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor. Treatments were rep licated four times in plots arranged in randomized complete blocks. Pumpkin seeds of two varieties ('How den' and 'Oz') were planted in alternating plots. Plants were thinned to two per hill after 2 weeks. Treatments included an untreated check and a hand-weeded check. Preemergence (PRE) herbicides applied on halosulfuron). Halosulfuron was applied as postemergence (POST) treatments. In these plots, ethalfluralin had been applied pr eemergence to prevent annual grasses. Postemergence halosulfuron treatments were ap plied at \"early POST \" (July 7) or \"late POST\" (July 16) timings. Also applied on July 16 was a treatment containing the herbicide Poast (halosulfuron + sethoxydim) to control emerged weeds in plots that did not receive any preemergence treatment. Weed control was evaluated on July 26. All treatments contai ning ethalfluralin prevented more did not work as well in 2004 as in previous experiments. Clomazone prevented only about 70% of crabgrass, a weed that usually is more susceptible to this herbicide. Cont rol of other weeds by clomazone was more typical, with contro l ratings of 95% purslane, on PRE provided better control of purslane and lambsquarters than did halosulfuron PO ST, which was very weak on these weeds, especially at the late POST timing. All halosulfuron trea tments (PRE & POST) were excellent in carpetweed and yellow nutsedge containing halosu lfuron provided adequate control of yellow nutsedge. The late POST treatment cont aining sethoxydim controlled over 90% of emerged crabgrass. The best overall w eed control was provided by ethalfluralin + clomazone combinations (except for Strategy at the lowest rate) and the ethalfluralin + halosulfuron PRE combinations. Halosulfuron was the only herbicide to injure pumpkins. Slight stunting and chlorosis occurred when halosulfuron was app lied PRE, more injury resulted from early POST treatments, and the most severe inju ry occurred on pumpkins sprayed with late POST halosulfuron treatments. Injury was di rectly related to halosulfuron application rate, but was most dependent on application ti ming. Most injured plants recovered well, except for the pumpkins receiving the late POST halosulfuron treatments. 167 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 As expected, the lowest pu mpkin yield was harvested fr om the untreated (weedy) check plots. Total weight of pumpkins from the check plots was 189 lb. Low yields also resulted from poor weed control [clomazone alone: 346 lb; lowest rate of Strategy: 373 lb] or excessive plant injury [all late PO ST treatments containing halosulfuron: 232 to 338 lb]. The highest pumpkin yields were harvested from plots with excellent weed control and little to no plant injury. Th e following PRE treatments produced the highest pumpkin yields: ethalfluralin + clomazone [Str ategy] at the lb), and ethalfluralin + halosulfuron (547 lb). Dorothy Reiss and Todd Mervosh after pumpkin harvest Invasive Plant Management at Bluff Poin t State Park: Oriental Bittersweet and Pale Swallowwort: Dr. Mervosh has been working in cooperation with David Gumbart of The Nature Conservancy on a project partially funded by the Long Island Sound License Plate Program, administered by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Long Is land Sound Programs since 2003. The primary focus is to conduct research on control of the inva sive plants Oriental at Bluff Point State Park and Coastal Reserve in Groton, CT, and to remediate specific areas impacted by these invasives. These plants threaten the health of ecosystems at this coastal location and in many other areas throughout North America. Data on the efficacy of various treatments should improve conditions for native vegetati on at Bluff Point and provide information for other projects intended to manage these invasive plants. Research on control of Oriental bittersw eet is being conducted in wooded areas at Bluff Point, where vines are adversely affecti ng tree growth. Vines we re selected in two size classes: small vines with diameters of 15 to 25 mm (< 1 inch) and large vines with diameters of 25-40 mm (> 1 inch). Each treatment was applied to 10 vines (five small, five large) at each of three timings (April, August, November) in 2003, and similarly to a different set of vines at three timings in 2004. Treatments were applied to vines 6 to 12 inches above the ground, either to the bark of uncut vines (b asal-bark treatments) or to the cut surface immediately af ter lopping vines off (cut-stump treatments). Each herbicide treatment was applied undiluted direct ly to vines with a paint brush. Basal-bark treatments (1.5 ml per vine) consisted of no herbicide (uncut check), Garlon 4 (triclopyr ester, Cut-stump treatments (0.75 ml per vine) c onsisted (cut 25% a.i.). Vines treated in 2003 were evaluated in th e summer of 2004. A section of bark was 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 scraped off each vine just above ground leve l to determine if the vascular cambium tissues were dead or alive. Also, the number and length of any new sprouts from above or below ground were noted. Treatment e fficacy in 2003 was not affected significantly by application timing. Combined over all timings in 2003, the following number of Asiatic bittersweet vines (of 30 treated) were still alive in 2004: uncut check (28), Garlon 4 basal-bark (6), Roundup Homeowner Concentrate cut-stump (2). Vines cut wit hout herbicide produced an average of 2.4 new sprouts per vine. All herbicide treatments either elimin ated or greatly reduced sprout formation. Bittersweet vines treate d in 2004 are being evaluated in 2005. An area of the cobble beach infested with pale swallowwort is being used as an experimental site. This coastal habitat is home to some rare or threatened native plant species. Treatments were applied to dense stands of pale swallowwort on July 15, 2003. Treatments consisted of: untreated check, sw allowwort pulled by hand, plants cut off just above ground, application of glyphosate (R oundup Pro, 50% solution) to cut stems, application of triclopyr amin e (Garlon 3A, 50% solution) to cut stems, foliar spray of Roundup Pro (2% solution), and foliar spray of Garlon 3A (2% solution). Spray volume was equivalent to 25 gallons of spray solution pe r acre. One year after treatment, plots in which plants were pulled or cut had slight reductions in swallowwo rt density. Although the triclopyr spray treatment reduced pod fo rmation both years, swallowwort vigor was not affected in 2004. The largest reductions in swallowwort density and vigor occurred in plots sprayed with glyphos ate and those in which glyphosat e or triclopyr were applied directly to cut stems. Treatments were a pplied again to the same plots in August 2004, and are being evaluated in 2005. Christmas Trees . On Fraser firs planted in a commercial plantation in 1998, Mr. Rathier is evaluating the effect of app lications of luxurious amounts of phosphorus fertilizer on bud formation, growth and tree quality. Additional phosphorus is a practice used on Fraser firs growing in North Carolin a and other southern states to improve bud count thus speeding growth and improving quality. Connecticut soils may already contain sufficient phosphorus for excellent tr ees but if additional amounts can improve tree quality or shorten field growth time, it would be a benefit. After five annual applications of 100, 200 or 400 lbs P 2O5 per acre, the third annual evaluation was made in fall, 2002. As yet, no evidence of improved bud formation, tree growth or quality has been observed, suggesting that many soils in the Northeast already have sufficient phosphorus levels. Many trees in the experiment have reached harvest size. Final quality evaluations revealed no differe nces between any treatments. In 2000, Mr. Rathier began a long-term experiment to determine how much nutrition Christmas trees get from the soil th ey are planted in compared to how much they get from applied fertilizers. Several plantations in Connecticut successfully grow trees with no annual applications of fertili zer though it may take them longer to grow. Forestry research suggests that uptake of fer tilizer applied nutrients is slight compared to what trees get from native soil. But the sli ght extra nutrition that trees obtain from fertilizer nutrients may be enough to maintain quality color and reach salable size a year or more sooner. Therefore, plots have b een established at the Valley Laboratory for a ten-year experiment. Uniformly high quality, 4-year-old Fraser fir transplants were 169 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 planted at ten foot spacing, which will allow for annual ro ot pruning between plots to limit root growth into adjacent plots. One treatment will receive no fertilizer for ten years. Others will receive the following annual treatments that began in 2002: phosphorus and potassium only; nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) applied in the spring; NPK applied in the fall; and NP K applied in the spri ng along with a second application of N only in the fall. Every 2 y ears, 4 trees from each treatment will be cut, chopped and analyzed for nutrients. During th e summer of 2003, visu al color differences were observed between trees receiving N (dar ker green) and those th at have not received N (lighter green). The first set of trees to be harvested for analyses was cut in December 2003. Fresh and dry weight data did not diffe r between treatments. Additional harvests are planned every 2 years until the trees reach ma turity. Results of this experiment could impact the industry by helping growers realize the fertility values of their soils, possible avoiding over fertilization. In 2000, Mr. Rathier established a Christma s tree transplant su rvival experiment at the Valley Laboratory. With droughty spri ngs and/or summers o ccurring in three out of the last five years, many Christmas tree growers have experienced substantial transplant losses that may be reflected in a shortage of mature tr ees in seven or eight years. Since most tree plantations cannot be easily irrigated, bare root transplants are greatly susceptible to drought problems, a nd growers are looking for strategies or products that may assist in su rvival. Products such as bios timulants, mycorrhizal fungi and planting gels are currently being used to improve transplant survival in the landscape and arborist industries. The volume of roots may also play a role in survival, so the Fraser fir transplants in this experiment were graded into 2 categories - good and poor. Each root grade group was planted with one of the following transplant survival products: biostimulant; mycorrhizal fungi; planting gel; a combination of all three products; and no treatment. In July 2002, one tree was removed from each plot and evaluated for root quantity and quality. The only effect noticed wa s that the trees with greater root volumes at planting were the most vigor ous and continued to have the greatest root volumes. No effects were observed due to any of the suppl emental treatments. Similar results were observed with the second harvest in 2003. The 2004 harvest revealed similar results. Two trees will remain in each plot to grow to salable size. Enough room was left in this experiment to make a second planting in spring, 2002 in cooperation with Dr. Cowles. Instead of grading by root volumes, however, the trees were graded based on whether or not they had their root systems injured by white grub feeding. The same evaluation criteria will apply to these tr ees. The impact of transplant survival experiments should be to help growers optimize survival and a void costly replanting and losing time in production areas. Tobacco. One shade tobacco grower in th e valley is growing the crop under plasticulture (e.g. plastic film mulch for weed control and leaching management and drip irrigation for water and nutrient manageme nt). This method is appropriate for Connecticut tobacco but is complicated by the fa ct that the quality of our crops is linked to the traditional use of natura l sources of nitrogen such as cottonseed meal or castor pomace. Conventional culture allows for the ap plication of these meal types of fertilizers prior to planting and in side-dressings throughout the first 30 days afte r transplant in the field. Formation of raised be ds and installation of the drip irrigation and plastic mulch 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 limit the use of meals to the preplant period on ly. Determining how much meal to add in advance and its rate of mineralization under the plastic is a sign ificant challenge. Additionally, amounts and timing of supplemen tal nitrogen applie d through the drip irrigation needs to be determined. Since 1997, Mr. Rathier has been conducti ng studies at shade tobacco farms in Suffield and West Suffield, CT. The findings thus far are 1) The plastic mulch speeds up the N mineralization rate by 2-3 weeks, de pending on the weather. In years with unusually high rainfall amounts and cool soil conditions, the plastic mulch actually slows down N mineralization. 2) The timing of suppl ement N applications should mirror the N needs of the plants but be advanced by about 2 weeks; 3) Applying twice as much meal fertilizer than normal does not improve N av ailability or yield or leaf quality. 4) Applying no meal fertilizer in advance reduces N availability, yield and leaf quality; 5) Eliminating supplement soluble N addition re duces yield and leaf quality but not N availability. 6) No difference was observ ed among different N treatments when soil texture was variable. 7) Th e actual amounts of supplement soluble N needed at any one time are far less under plastic. This study will continue for a few more years to work out all the possible variations of preplant and s upplemental nitrogen and their affects on yield and quality. The major impact of this experi ment will be to help growers reduce losses of nitrate nitrogen and other solutes to ground wa ter, reduce fertilizer costs and improve the ability to grow a uniform crop. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information: A total of 8,229 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year . The majority of these que ries (77%) were answered by Mr. Thomas Rathier (5,132), assisted by Mr. John Winiarski (827) and Ms. Rose Hiskes (341) in the inquiry office , Cowles (4%), and About 60% of requests for info rmation were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pe st control operators. Inquiries by subject category were as follows: arthropod pests (19%); plant diseases (10%); general horticultural information (29%); soil fertil ity and water issues (25%); pesticide use (10%); weed control (4%); mammals, bi rds and reptiles (2%); and others (1%). Continuing concern among tobacco growers over the blue mold epidemic in the Connecticut River Valley spawned a large num ber of inquiries to Dr. James LaMondia and Thomas Rathier. Dr. LaMondia answered 1003 inquiries, made 14 presentations to grower and citizen groups, and was intervie wed on 9 occasions about his research. He also initiated and maintained the Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progress of the disease in North America, and the potential exposure and management options in the Valley. He also obtained a Section 18 registration for Quadris fungicide for c ontrol of blue mold in shade tobacco Inquiry office perspective: Commercial agriculture: Mr. Rathier made 52 field visits to co mmercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests a nd private landscapes to diagnose complex problems firsthand. Some problems were so lved during the visits but many required 171 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 taking plant and soil samples for laboratory analyses and subsequent reports to the growers. Most of the inquiries from commerc ial agriculture came during grower visits to the diagnostic lab or during phone calls. Many diagnoses were centered on plant responses to weathe r conditions. The 2004 growing season was moderate throughout most of the summer and remained so during the fall and early winter. Sunlight was somewhat limited during the summer which kept yields down and promoted diseases due to unmarketable products among annual crops and woody plants. Many large tr ees in parks, golf courses and commercial landscapes required substantial pruning or ev en removal as the drought related losses from previous seasons continued. Many weakened trees succumbed to vascular wilts such as Verticillium and Dutch elm disease and various borers. Christmas trees performed well with newl y planted and mature trees growing well in 2004. The 2005 spring planting season had ma ny difficulties to, at first to cooler weather followed by 2 damaging, warm, dry spel ls in June. Drought related injuries are expected as the 2005 season continues. White pine weevil, Pales weevil, spruce spider mites and elongate hemlock scale were the in sect pests most often reported. Needle diseases (Rhabdocline and Rhiz osphaera needlecasts and spru ce needle rust were the most reported problems. Comparatively little winter injury wa s observed on over-wintering woody plants in production settings although some desi ccation injuries occurred on broadleaf evergreens and conifers. Growers of woody a nd herbaceous plants in containers outdoors experienced good results during the growing seas on. Most plants over wintering in white plastic covered hoophouses or other structures made it through the winter with very few injuries. Freeze and frost injuries and subs equent bacterial or f ungal blights and leaf spots resulted in significant losses, especially in lilacs and rhododendrons. Greenhouse growers experienced a bright though difficult to heat late winter season but cool, dark conditions during the spri ng resulted in root diseases such as Pythium and foliar diseases, especially Botry tis blight. The marketing season for bedding plants was marred by several rainy, co ld weekends which limited sales. Golf courses and turf farms saw more fo liar and root diseases throughout the cool, moist summer and fall. Forage crops grew we ll but most growers were unable to harvest hay on time in June 2005. Silage crop harves ts were moderate in 2004 although some wet conditions made storage of harvests difficult. Small fruit harvests were below aver age during the 2004 season, with cool, wet conditions causing significant disease and harv est problems. Spring 2005 saw very little frost damage to strawberries but difficul t conditions for harvesting and yields were average. Vegetable growers required very little ir rigation but had only m odest harvests in 2004 due to disease loss and poor ripening. Bact erial spot and wilt diseases continued to plague peppers and tomatoes. Growers usi ng plasticulture or row covers saw fewer problems despite a colder than normal start. The planting season in 2005 was plagued by alternating cold and very warm and dry condi tions. Many growers had to replant fields. Tobacco acreages did well in 2004 alt hough cool conditions probably limited yields somewhat. Blue mold appeared la ter in the season and had a comparatively minimal effect thanks to great er attention to fungicide spra y coverage and the widespread use of the fungicides Acrobat and Quadris. Most broadleaf tobacco growers experienced 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 significant curing losses as wet conditions in late summer kept ha rvested tobacco from drying properly in sheds. Ordinary insect problems, such as budworms and aphids were present in many fields. The transplant pr oduction season in spring 2005, as was the case in both 2003 and 2004, was hampered by signifi cant periods of cool, dark conditions, which limited rapid growth in the greenhouse. Also present in spring 2005 was black root rot ( Thielaviopsis basicola ), which resulted in substantial losses of transplants. Presently, no fungicide is re gistered for management of this disease but growers can successfully use cultural methods to manage the disease. Commercial and Home Landscapes As for commercial agriculture, weathe r conditions througho ut the bulk of 2004 were moist and moderate with nearly all landscape plants growing vigorously and making it into Spring 2005 with some winter injuries and other desiccation problems, especially to conifers like arborvitae. Most other plan ts survived the winter in good shape. Spring 2005 brought many problems as April and May were dryer and much colder than ordinary followed by nearly the warm est, driest June in history. Vascular wilts, most commonly caused by Verticillium were diagnosed in many different woody plants but most commonly in maples. More than likely the infections were made worse by the droughty conditions of previous seasons. Despite the moist conditions, many trees will continue to fail well into 2005. Home landscapers reported more success with transplanted trees and shrubs, due mostly to more consistent moisture supplies. Transplant shock or failure remains the single most important cause of losses in lands capes. In some cases, field dug shrubs and trees did not have enough roots to support the transplant and soil conditions did not allow timely growth of new roots. Container grow n plants may have had too many roots that didn't allow the plant to grow new roots until too late. The highly porous conditions of container growing media create conditions where root growth dominates the space within the container and the plants do well while unde r daily irrigation. But once that root ball is placed in a typical landscape soil, its ne eds are no longer met. The plant lives on the carbohydrate reserves in the roots and stems and often do not grow new roots. Landscapers and homeowners need to take be tter care to prevent or limit this condition. Home landscapers with frequent irriga tion habits reported many cases of slime molds growing on mulches, especially wood ch ips or locally produced bark mulch that contained large amounts of wood. The presen ce of wood in the mulch allows the mold fungi to grow more rapidly, and the moist conditions of regular irrigation created the ideal environment for growth. Artillery f ungus that \"shoots\" spore cases towards light colors such as struct ures and vehicles, also grow well in these conditions and was widely reported. Many cases of sour mulch were reported in 2003. This is caused by poorly piled mulch becoming anaerobic, producing al cohols and acids that can injure many plants. Also a result of two darker, moister growing seasons, algae and lichens were reported on a variety of surfaces including trees, paved areas, bare soil, roofs and siding. Frost and freeze related problems were observed on an assortment of plants in June 2005. Hemlock woolly adelgid has begun to re bound after two difficult winters in a row 2002-2003 and 2003-2004). Cool moist conditio ns in the 2004 growing season and a moderate winter of 2004-2005 allowed many he mlocks to recover and grow more 173 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 vigorously. The same conditions also favored adelgid populat ions and, for the first time in a few years, sprays were necessary. Also plaguing hemlocks and other conifers were elongate hemlock scale and spruce spider mites. Gypsy moths were quite prevalent in se veral areas around the state, perhaps the result of dry conditions in June 2005. Sprays were typically not needed but homeowners and landscapers are being cautioned to scout fo r egg masses in the coming winter and to be prepared to spray next year. Other arthropods of note during 2003 were white pine weevil and Pales weevil. Hard pines were once again infested with Eu ropean sawflies, tip moths and pine shoot moths. Pear leaf blister mites were wide spread in early spring, 2004. Leafhoppers, lace bugs, arborvitae leaf miners were more plen tiful and significant defoliation by assorted caterpillars and sawflies was observed on deciduous and evergreen plants. Also noticed were azalea bark scale, cottony camellia scale, assorted lecanium scales and white prunicola scale. Hibiscus sa wfly and lily leaf beetle, both newcomers to Connecticut continued to esta blish populations in Connec ticut. Viburnum aphids and assorted eriophyid mites were more numerous in Spring 2005. Diseases were more plentiful in 2004-2005, especially foliar disorders such as leaf spots, blights and anthracnose. Anthracnos es have been widespread and especially problematic to sycamores, oaks, maples a nd birches. Cedar apple rust and other gymnosporangium rusts were quite co mmon on many crabapples, hawthorn and shadbush. Stressed related cankers were re ported on many trees, espe cially ornamental cherries, maples and beeches. Powdery mildew was a problem on many di fferent broadleaf trees and shrubs as well as herbaceous plants. Conifers were pl agued by needlecasts, n eedle rusts, and tip blights. Home lawns experienced cool moist conditions throughout all of 2004 and right up through May, 2005. But drought conditions resulted in some losses in June, 2005. Disease pressure was much higher on high ma intenance lawns, especially summer patch, Pythium and red thread. Large numbers of scar ab beetles adults were reported in spring 2005, so caution may be appropriate for the coming season. White grub injury was less obvious because conditions were less stressful . Bluegrass billbug out breaks have been observed on a few occasions and only on sodded areas. Ground ivy, violets, corn speedwell and yello w nutsedge were the most important weeds in lawns. Poor crabgrass management was a common observation in 2004 due mostly to home landscapers applying pre-em ergent controls too early in the season followed by heavy rains and cool conditions. Crabgrass germinated late in most lawns and management compounds were below the seed by then. Moss colonization of poor turf areas received plenty of attent ion from homeowners, as well. Management strategies offered for all pest s include cultural and sanitary approaches as the primary effort with low impact pestic ides as a second effort , and lastly, stronger pesticides when other approaches do not succeed. Wildlife and Structural Pests Animal problems were numerous th roughout the year with most inquiries concerning squirrels, chipmunks , moles, voles, rabbits, woodc hucks, skunks and snakes. 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 Insects that bother humans were of c oncern to many homeowners during the wet conditions of 2004, especially mosquitoes. Many inquirers expr essed interest in larvicidal, sanitary and predat ory (bats) management strate gies rather than sprays. Mosquito problems were less intense in spring 2005. Many ticks were submitted for identification. All blacklegge d ticks were forwarded to the lab in New Haven for spirochete analysis. Wasps, especially Ge rman yellow jackets and solitary ground bees were bothersome to many. Numerous popul ations of ground bees were reported in Spring 2005. Among arthropods found inside structures, carpe nter ants, termites, black and varied carpet beetles, ground beetles, gr ass carrier wasps, cigarette be etles, larder beetles, acorn weevils and spiders received the most atte ntion. Also noted were multicolored Asian lady beetles, squash bugs, western conifer seed bugs, boxelder bugs, clover mites, assorted food infesting beetles, Indian meal moths and centipedes and millipedes. On a somewhat disturbing note, bed bugs were submitte d in greater numbers in the past year. Where management strategies for indoor a nd other structural pests were necessary, most homeowners chose baiting and/or sa nitation rather than pesticide use. Field visits by scientific staff : Valley Laboratory scien tists visited 309 commercial fields, greenhouses, golf courses, Christmas tr ee farms, residential properties, parks and forests during the past year to diagnose the more complex problems firsthand. The majority of these visits were made by Timothy Abbey (137) who visited production nurseries, Christmas tree growers, and golf c ourses. Thomas Rathier made 52 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes, Dr. Richard Cowles made 22 field visits to evaluate soil- inhabiting insect pests and mite s in nurseries and strawberry fields, Dr. James LaMondia visited 19 farms, and Drs. Todd Mervosh and John Ahrens made 31 and 11 visits, respectively, to investigate w eed control problems. Most problems were solved during these visits, but many required taking plant a nd soil samples for laboratory analysis with subsequent reports to grow ers by letter or phone call. Special diagnostic tests: Valley Laboratory scientists conducted 1043 special diagnostic tests at the request of citizens during the past ye ar. Of these, 500 were in- depth investigations of unusual pest problem s by Thomas Rathier and Rose Hiskes, 233 involved identification and enumeration of pl ant parasitic nematode s in soil samples by Dr. James LaMondia, 40 were evaluations of mites and soil-inhabiting insects by Dr. Richard Cowles, 79 were tobacco seed germin ation trials and 99 were soil texture or organic matter determinations conducted by Mr. John Winiarski, 50 were made by Tim Abbey from nursery visits, and 8 were identi fications and control evaluations of weeds by Drs. Todd Mervosh and John Ahrens. Soil testing: A total of 4,042 soil tests were expertly performed by Mr. John Winiarski during the past year. About 63% were performed for commercial growers, 30% for homeowners, 1.5% for municipalities, and the remainder for Station research. Of the 2,573 commercial samples submitted, 49% we re for landscapers; 22% for tobacco growers; nursery growers; 5.5% fo r vegetable growers; 2% for Christmas tree 175 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 growers; 1.5% for golf course superintendents; 2% for fruit grower s; 1% for greenhouse growers, and the remainder for others. Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room : Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regu larly for their meetings. During the past year, 40 different groups used the room on 131 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Farm Wine Council, the CT Wine Associ ation, Connecticut Chapter of the National Association of Organic Farmers, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connecticut Fa rm Fresh, Connecticut Greenhouse Grower's Association, Connecticut Nursery an d Landscape Association, Connecticut Rhododendron Society, and Connecticut Invasi ve Plants Workgroup. Jane Morrison, Thomas Rathier and John Winiarski schedul ed the appointments and Richard Horvath arranged the furniture for scheduled meetings and ensured that the room was available after hours. 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2004-2005 BULLETINS OF THE CONNECTIC UT AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION PUBLISHED DURING 2004-2005 996 (966) Identification Guide to the Mos quitoes of Connecticut. 178 pages.
