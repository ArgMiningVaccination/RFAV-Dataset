Naturopathic Medicine has been around since the late 1800s. At that time \"naturopathy\" was used to describe an increasingly popular mode of therapeutics that drew from both western as well as indigenous medicines of the world. Today at White Oak Medical we use scientifically proven and evidence based alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, clinical nutrition and homeopathy to treat everyday health problems, as well as many acute and chronic conditions. As Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) our focus is on disease prevention, activating the body's own inherent healing ability, treating the whole person and educating our patients to be partners in their own health care. Naturopathic Doctors NDs study all the same basic sciences as medical doctors (MDs). Just like MDs, we must undergo rigorous professional board exams that include basic sciences, diagnostic and therapeutic subjects and clinical sciences before we can be licensed. We also study holistic avenues to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and wellness promotion. As NDs we are trained in such treatment modalities as clinical nutrition and diet counseling, lifestyle counseling, botanical medicine, Chinese medicine/acupuncture and Homeopathy. "}
