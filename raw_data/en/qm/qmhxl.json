Closing of the Bones Postpartum Ceremony The Closing of the Bones ceremony is a deeply restorative, universal practice for any family and community. An esteemed and beautiful ancient Mayan ritual, it is also referred to as Cerrar la Cadera, La Cerrada or La Manteada. Pregnancy and birth expand the mother's physical body and energy field significantly to usher in new human life. Hence, one of the core aspects in many traditional postpartum care practices involves helping to \"close\" women up. Several of the many physiological expansions during pregnancy include: \u00b7 Increases in the hormone relaxin \u00b7 Blood volume increases by on average of 50% \u00b7 Diastasis recti expansion in 100% of women \u00b7 Pelvic opening during birth to allow for the baby's passage \u00b7 Emotional, psychological and spiritual expansions are numerous as well and unique to each mother The cross-cultural Closing of the Bones ceremony is a powerful way to aid in closing the mother's physical, emotional, spiritual and mental bodies so she can reconnect with herself and be fully present. Benefits include: \u00b7 Abdominal work to help bring the fascia and muscles closer together for more effective pelvic floor and core contractions \u00b7 Stress and pain relief \u00b7 Facilitate the important process of closing the pelvis after birth \u00b7 A break for deep rest, self-care and nourishment \u00b7 Sharing the mother's birth story \u00b7 Giving a small closing ceremony with family and friends Ayurvedic Pregnancy Oil Addition to Infant Massage Instruction and Consultations: very safe, supportive blend mostly used after the first trimester with eight herbs, six oils, and a blend of essential oils to further reduce aches and pains, prevent stretch marks, and strengthen muscles.
