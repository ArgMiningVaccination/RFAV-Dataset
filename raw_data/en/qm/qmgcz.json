Try this easy spring detox you can do from home -- and watch your energy levels soar.", "sitename": "Women's Health Network", "date": "2020-04-21", "cleaned_text": "If non-stop time indoors is making you feel tired, bloated, unfocused, or otherwise in a slump, your body could be telling you that it needs help getting rid of energy-and health-zapping toxins that have accumulated during this stressful time. Your body's natural detox pathways \u2014 i.e., the liver and lymphatic system \u2014 are always removing toxins. But you can supply the support needed to keep these systems clean and clear. A gentle detox is one of the easiest and fastest ways to see a dramatic improvement in how you feel. Here are 4 detox tips you can do at home. 1. Spring into action Exercise boosts our detoxification capabilities by pumping up the cleansing action of the [lymph system](/detoxification/the-lymphatic-system-and-your-health/) and ridding your body of toxins and excess hormones through sweat. This includes excess stress hormones that can be at the root of so many problems, like fatigue and weight gain. Exercise also detoxes the mind by warding off depressed mood. Most of us can still get out for a daily brisk walk, or you can look online for free exercise classes you can do at home. Try dusting off that old Richard Simmons Sweatin' to the Oldies VHS and have some fun as you get moving! 2. Give your skin a soak A warm bath soak can loosen dry skin that's built up over the past winter, especially on your feet, legs and arms. Gently exfoliate skin with a loofah pad. For added detox power, add a tablespoon of ground ginger to your bath water. The added \"heat\" of ginger encourages your body to sweat and flush toxins. 3. Detox Your Diet Take a break from foods that our bodies tend to interpret as toxic. These include sugar, alcohol, caffeine, dairy, gluten, artificial sweeteners and additives, processed food, and grilled or charbroiled meats. Give it a few weeks and see how you feel. Are your energy levels rebounding? Feeling less brain fog? Has your acne cleared up? Temporarily eliminating \"trigger foods\" can give your liver and digestive system time to rest and reset. 4. Add These Detox Powerhouses Foods such as alfalfa sprouts, brown rice, dark green veggies, lemon, garlic, gluten-free oats, millet, root vegetables and seeds boost your body's ability to get rid of toxics and extra weight. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and help flush toxins from the body. |Fuzzy thinking in menopause got you down? | "}
