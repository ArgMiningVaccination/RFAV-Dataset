This doctor's name was Wilhelm. H Scheussler, a man responsible for what we know today as cell salt therapy . Scheussler was interested in biochemistry, the study of chemical and physiochemical processes that go on inside the human body. This is the study that encompasses the science of cell salts. Cell salts, also known as tissue salts in some circles, were recognized and then created as remedies by Schuessler as a culmination of two major ideas that resonated deeply with him. To fully underst and this inspired work of Dr. Scheusslar and his development of cell salt therapy , it must be understood from where, or whom rather, his inspiration came from . Enter homeopathy, cell theory, also known as cell doctrine, and t wo me n by the names of Samue l Hahnemann and Rudolph Virchow. Homeopathy was fir st conceptualized and evolved by a German physician and sc ientist named Samuel Hahnemann. Hahnemann performed extensive research with thousands of organic and inorganic substances to prove his theory of \"like cures like.\" Homo , meaning same , and pathy , den oting feeling or suffering. E vidence of same or like suffering materialized as Hahnemann performed provings time and time again that the same substance s that cause a disease in a healthy patient, actually resulted in curing the same symptoms of disease in a patient who was ill. Ad ditionally, Hahnemann made the revolutionary discovery that \"the very smallest dosage of a particular remedy - less than one part per million - was more effective than the large doses commonly given. In his day, large quantities of medical substances were routinely dispensed to patients.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004. P. 7). Remedies could, and would, be diluted down until there was no amount of the raw material left. Depending on the sym ptoms of disease, these levels of dilution and forms of preparation actually stimulated the body to heal itself fully 3 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY instead of traditional treatments simply blocked symptoms. This homeopathic approach to treatment was \"Like Hippocrates before him, Hahnem ann saw his patient as a whole being - one who is joined in the body, mind, spirit, and emotions. And only by taking into account the whole being can the patient be healed of all disease.\" (McCabe, 2009. P. 11). For Hahnemann and homeopaths after him, the disease diagnosis is almost completely useless if the uniquity and state of wholeness of a patient is not considered. This means that symptoms o f disease are not treated, patients are treated based on the entire spectrum of their symptoms , including their behaviors, personalities, and who they are as people . The basic understanding of homeopathic principal is important to recognize, as it influenced the preparation and manufacturing of cell salts. Schuessler , who first became a homeopathic physician, builds his theories upon these principles. As Schuessler studied homeopathy, he too studied and found understanding in the works of Rudolph V irchow, a theorist and scientist who came to be known as the Father of Cell Theory and the Chief Founder of Modern Scient ific Medicine . As stated by McCabe (2009, p.180), Virchow's earl ier publications on cell theory can basically be summed up by one comment he made in one of his first publications: \"life is essentially cell activity.\" As Virchow's work progressed, it became largely developed from the work of Theodor Schwann , a scientist known for discovering that all animal tissues are made of cells . Schwann held tight to the preconceived notion that cells were of a spontaneous nature, that they just appeared from a fluid recognized then as blastema, and diseased cells came from diseased blastema . Through Virchov's own studies, he separated himself from spontaneous genesis and boldly stated \"All cells come from cells.\" ( as cited in McCabe, 2009, p. 22). This s tatement came to be known as biogenic law and continued to shape scientists and physicians of pathology for generations to come. As Virchow's work began to develop, his work gave rise to arguably the most influential statement on 4 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY Schuessla r and the cell sa lts yet . \"Every form of suffering is only based on a disorder in the cells. Only the cell can become sick - the cell, the smallest functioning unit of the human body.\" (as cited in McCabe, 2009, p. 22). Deeply affected by and closely following the developme nt of cell theory, the final catalyst to the turning point of Schue ssler's career happened with a conclusion reached by a fellow cell theory and Virchow follower, a man name Moleschott. \"' The structure and vitality of organs are conditioned by the necessa ry amounts of inorganic constituents.' In other words, in order to be healthy, cells need to be nourished. And, as Virchow had already concluded that the life of the body was dependent upon the life of its cells, it could therefore be concluded that the he alth of the whole body was to a great part dependent upon the proper nourishment of the cells.\" (McCabe, 2009. P. 22). This aforementioned nourishment is the inorganic material recognized as absolute necessities to the human body; also known as minerals. These essential minerals come together in chemical compounds to create cell salts. Queue the melding of two very different developments of science and medicine in the time of Schuesslar's practice and research. From one end of the spectrum, cell theory, he took the idea that health and vitality could uattained and maintained through the nourishing of cells through the use of specific inorganic substances in specific doses. From the other end of the spectrum, homeopathy, he took the preparation of homeopathi c remedies, the practice of prescribing in low dilutions , and further argued that the active ingredients in homeopathic remedies that affect cell metabolism are the inorganic minerals in the organic matter used to make the homeopathic remedies . Schuessler c arried on in his studies with the analyzing of human blood, as well as, human ashes after death . He began to isolate minerals from these various tissues and discovered twelve mineral compounds that he referred to as cell salts. He theorized that when the b ody became deficient in (or fell out of balance with ) any of these 5 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY important minerals, an abnormal or diseased condition occurred; and when correct minerals were supplied to the cells , abnormal or diseased symptoms decreased or disappeared and the body healed itself . It is important to recognize, as Schuessler himself did, that there are far more than twelve various mineral compounds present in the body at any given time . The twelve identified in Schuessler's series were deemed the most important by him bec ause he believed they were what actually made up the tissues of the human body and occurred naturally. (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p.9, McCabe, 2009, p. 23). Schuessler's discoveries led him to adopt a nutritional approach to medicine. Thus, the new issue became a question of how the various mineral compounds could be supplied to and readily and easily assimilated by depleted cells that had been weakened by a starved or restricted supply. As aforementioned, a homeopathic approach was settled on for his not so homeopathic notion. \"He began to create these essential mine rals, the cell salts, in potentized form of homeopathic remedies, using the same methods of dilution that Hahnemann set forth in the creation of homeopathic remedies. In doing this, he created what where in essence homeopathic remedies, and their physical form at least, although he did not intend to use them in accordance with the law of similar, as Hahnemann did. Instead, Schuessler worked by the theory of deficiency. \" (McCabe, 2009, p. 32). Often times, the most powerful homeopathic remedies, of organic or inorganic nature, are dilut ed to a high pot ency and there is no raw material left in the remedy itself. Schuessler, however, decided on a form of low potency for administering his cell salts. The low potency dosages provided actual readily and easily available presence of an essential mineral, but were administered in a form that also \"stimulated the body to absorb and utilize them in the optimal amounts needed to maintain balance and health. \" (McCabe, 2009, p. 32). 6 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY All of these ideas linked together form the full ideas of Schuessler's biochemical cell salt therapy. Unlike, homeopathy, the successes of cell salt therapy is entirely relied upon by linking a person's symptoms with the appropria te tissue cell salts. \"Symptoms occur in a variety of forms and our guide to the nature of the body's deficiency into the correct treatment required. How and where they occur will help you decide the correct tissue cell salt. Often, you need more than one. The proper dose replenishes the cell salt supply and restores tissue or organ function.\" (Weintraub, 1999, p. 12). Cell salt therapy a safe and beneficial way to treat any form of nutritional deficiencies; they help the body maintain balance and nourish i t during times of disease and distress. The twelve cell salts are given their name based on traditional periodic table elemental names. In the following summaries , additional names will be identified as well as common conditions suggesting a need for a particular cell salt, mental symptoms, emotional symptoms, p hysical symptoms, and key components that might lead one to a specific remedy ; to start, the 12 cell salts remedies is a remedy m ade using the chemical compound calcium fluoride. It is known as a natural producer of suppleness and elasticity, is found in the bone covering, teeth ename l, blood vessel walls, skin cel ls and is a prime ingredient in elastic fibers of the body. Ailment s suggesting the need for Calcarea Fluorica are aneurysms, bone diseases and bone pain, cataracts, cold sores, colds, coughs, postnasal drip, flatulence, gout, hardening of tissue, herpes, hemorrhoids, Hodgkin' s disease , low back pain, nodes and any part of the body, strains, varicose veins, and wrinkles. Calc. Fluor is essential to the connective tissue of the body; 7 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY it is used in all cases of tissue weakness, excessive hardness, and prolapse. This remedy helps the tendons, ligaments, and joints of the body. It is often seen used extensively for fluoride treatments to strengthen tooth enamel. Calc . Fluor. is unique in two ways; it is excellent in remedying ail ments of long -standing and also ailments that have a certain vagueness or even sluggishness to them. The latter of its u niquity can be fully expressed in the mental and emotional symptom s of the Calcarea F luorica patient. These patients typically blend a sense of freeform anxiety with a sense of indecision. These patients can fixate on specific fears, have tendencies towards hypocho ndria, have depressions great and small, have tendencies to look on the dark side of life or any present situation, and have an incapability to focus on any given situation at hand. Calc. F luor. Patients may have trouble verbally conveying his or her ideas, they can forget what they are saying mids entence, and confuse their words all whi le exhibiting a certain dullness and indecision. They can be hard to treat. They do not seem to actively resist treatment, but can have a tendency to be passive aggressive in an unwillingness to do anything to relieve them of chronic illness. These patients may also feel at the mercy of their disease symptoms which may cause anxiety. Whether they exhibit an anxious state or an apathetic state, a Cal c. Fluor. mentality is often presented as a block against treatment. These sluggish and vague symptoms play out in physical complaints as well as the mental and e motional, and can be seen in its listing of common ailments . Soft tissues throughout the body will tend toward a lack of elasticity, fibers are relaxed instead of being supple, there may be malnutrition of the bones, and poor ossification. A need for Calcarea Fluorica can gen erally be linked to a poor diet . The second cell salt is Calcarea Phosphor ica. Cal c. Phos., the abbreviation, is made from calcium phosphate, and is also called phosphate of lime. Calcarea Phosphorica is found in bones, cartilage, tendons, inner parts of teeth, and digestive fluid. Constituting about 57% of bone 8 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY tissue, this cel l salt is used like cement when combined with protein. Prominent in bone tissue, it is also a main constituent of all the cells and fluids in the body. Recognized as a good general tonic for all cellular activity, this cell salt will promote feelings of overall wellness. This overall feeling of wellness can be attributed not only to its vast omnipresence throughout the human body, but also to the profoun d effect the cell salt has on assimilation. This is why Calc. Phos. is often added to treatments along with other cells salts, it intensifies their action by restoring proper tone to tissues through structural integrity and reinforcing the opportunity for healt hy cellular activity. Calcarea P hosphorica is often used with very young and very old patients. It supports healthy bones and teeth during times of rapid growth in the young and supports the elderly during recovery from severe ailments and as a n excep tional tonic for the nervous system. Common uses of and conditions that suggests Calcarea Phosphorica are anemia, arthritis, bone inflammation, brittle or soft bones, fractures of all kinds, broken bones, colds with a sore throat, colic, diabetes, epilepsy , headaches, eczema, gout, indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, joint pain, backache, palpitation, teething problems, tonsillitis, weakness with exhaustion, trembling and delayed recovery, cavities of teeth, and weight gain and obesity. A mental symptom of a person who may need Calc. Phos. is the displaying of an overall fogginess, slowness, or incapacity to concentrate; children may be slow to learn and elderly may have problems with short -term memory with clear long -term memory. E motionally, persons who need this cell salt tend to be deeply emotional, appreciate solitary existence, and dread doi ng required tasks, whatever the tasks may be. Calcar ea Phosphorica can be used to help cope with grief and bad news or to help manage the emotional corollaries of the loss of a loved one. Some specifically clear indicators for this remedy are terribly sensitive or throbbing and burning headaches accompanied by symptoms of rheumatism, inability to sleep late in the morning with lingering 9 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY sleepiness upon awaking, ove rly vivid dreams or nightmares , creeping sensations of the ski n with limb numbness, cataracts when they are accompanied by a right -sided headaches and eye pain, acquisition of constant colds and mucosa l conditions especially when nasal discharge is reminis cent of a raw egg, cases of constipation accompan ied by depression, vertigo, and headaches in the eld erly, an aching or hurting of the bones around the ear accompanied by a cold feeling of the outer ear, a flabby abdomen even if there is an overall genera l thinness, and when there is chilling in us, pain in the liver, and soreness after or during eating or motion. The third of cells salts is calcarea Sulphurica. Calc. Sulph. is the abbreviation, it is made from calcium sulfate, and is also known as plaster of Paris or gypsum. It is found in epithelial tissue and in th e blood for clotting. Calc. Sulph. is known as a powerful healer and purifier of the blood, and because of this , it is used for infections, pus, and general toxicity of the body. Its detoxifying qualities are showcased as it eliminates waste materials and prevents new infection. It has been seen as a protector of stomach walls, eyeballs, nasal passages, mouth, throat, bladder and other organs that nee d protection against moisture; it will hold water but resist acid as it coats surfaces. This cell salt is needed to destroy old red blood cells when their life cycles have ended. W ithout it a liver may become overloaded and congested. Common uses and conditions that suggests the need for the c ell salt are abscesses, burns, acne, colds, costs, sore throat glandular swelling, hemorrhaging, herpes, injuries, cuts, bruises, conjunctivitis, skin conditions, and tendencies towards infection and reinfection. A person in need of Calc . Sulph . often has an emotional temperament that develops with the day. Beginning in the morning with a lighthearted happiness, it all begins to wane as the day seems to yield a steady progression of difficulty and depression; the worst time being from 9:00 PM to 4:00 AM. Al ong with a shifting daily temperament, the need for the cell salt might be indicated by silent broadening, contrary and self -10 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY contradictory behavior, disdain for being disagreed with are patronized, a loss of motivation as they begin their tasks , and a sens ation of suffocation and craving for air . A c lear indicator for the need of Calc. Sulph. is, first and foremost, the color yellow. A sick yellow coat will be present on the tongue . The skin may take on a yellow tinge as it beco mes dry. All accompanying pus s will be yellow; in ulcers, pimples, and wounds; as well as , the mucosal discharges from the nose. Other indicators for this remedy are pains associated w ith symptoms will also have burning sensations or sensations of numbness, chronic acne of the face, b ack, and shoulders, dandruff, fever due to infection, a hot and sweaty head during sleep, chronically swollen glands, sensitivities to both cold and heat, aggravation by lifting or bending, a ravenous urgency to eat or total lack of appetite, salts, sweet, and greasy cravings, and tendencies towards a slow recovery period. The fourth cell salt remedy is Ferrum Phosphoricum and is abbreviated by Ferrum Phos. It is made from iron phosphate and is found in blood, vein and artery wal ls, and capillaries. Ferrum Phos. is known as the preeminent biochemical remedy for common acute conditions. This cell salt is important for oxygenating of the blood as it carries oxygen to all parts of the body. A lack of oxygen in the blood increases circulation and creates excess heat, this is what makes Ferrum Phos. extremely valuable in times of controlling fever and inflammation. This remedy is often needed by children and young people and especially by those going through puberty. It is the principal remedy for neurology pain. Common uses and conditions that s uggests the need for Ferrum Phos. are anemia, arthritis, bedwetting, bronchitis, diabetes, cystitis, nosebleeds, rheumatism, incon tinence, pneumonia, prolapse, and tinnitus. Ferrum Pho s. is profoundly useful for balancing iron in the body whether 11 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY it is too high or too low. It is also arguably the most important remedy to combat anemia. Often times, the need of this cell salt remedy is accompanied by a relaxed view of one's own illness, \"their reaction to their condition is more or less appropriate to that condition, nothing more, nothing less.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 83). The origins of the i llness may seem confusing or unknown and have a lack of specificity. Situations indicat ing the need are often accompanied by the color red. Affected parts will display a bright redness, discharges may be bloody, and when blood is present it will be very br ight red. Other indicators for the need of this remedy are whooping cough that is leading to vomiting, painful coughing, short, dry, a nd spasmodic coughing, the wanting to rest or lie down accompanied by a trouble to sleep, right shoulder pain in all ages, and a tightness in the right side of the neck . An interesting idea is that \"some biochemists believe a lack of ferrum phos. is often the cause of the common cold. When there is an iron deficiency, the blood is drawn away from the skin and outlying parts o f the body so that it can concentrate important areas such as the heart, lungs, liver, brain, and stomach. The pores of the skin are consequently closed, and there is an accumulation of nonfunctional matter thrown out by the mucous membranes. This accumula tion is the cause of the characteristic discharges of colds, pneumonia, and pleurisy.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p.71). Hence the preeminent value for the common acute condition. This remedy should always be remember ed at the first sign of a cold or illness a s the oxygenating effect does not hold as much value when disease has fully set in. The fifth cell salt is Kali Muriaticum, Kali Mur is the abbreviation. It is made from potassium chloride and is found in blood fibrin. \"Kali Mur is the worker of the blood that forms fibrin and properly defuses it through the tissues of the body. It keeps body fluids and correct thickness, including blood, and works on mucous conditi ons.\" (Card, 2007, p.11). Kali Mur. is known as the remedy for sluggish, run down conditions . It can be quite subtle in its action. This 12 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY cell salt is an essential component in muscle tissue, as well as, nerve cells and brain cells. Kali Mur. can be a powerful cleanser, it plays cleanup while helping to destroy wastes as the body fights fever or i nfection. This cell salt is most commo nly given as a secondary remedy after the first remedies have been distributed. It quite literally heightens the effects of preceding cell salt remedies and aids in the completion of healing. In other words, Kali Mur . is best for second stages of illness. It is also a favorable option when symptoms have been slow in developing. Common uses and conditions that suggest the need for the cell salt are chronic bronchitis, chickenpox, colds and coughs, autoimmune diseases, eu stachian cystitis, deafness, measles, mumps, nodes, obesity, wa ndering joint or muscle pain, rheumatism associated with cracking joints, sore throats with laryngitis, swelling, and ill effects of vaccinations. A pe rson in need of Kali Mur. will be hungry; they will eat regardless of the illness, they will eat foods they cannot digest, and they will eat beyond making themselves sick. This person might exhibit a desire to suffer in sile nce, experience no humor or pleasure of any kind , and a disinclination to speak and an irritability -causing inability to find comfort in anything. Kali Mur. need is represented by the color white. A thick white or gray coat ing tends to be present on the base of the tongue, discharges are milky white, as well a s, thick, lumpy and/or slimy. The moment these discharges appear is indicative of exactly when this remedy should be given. Other symptoms that are strong indicators for this rem edy are cracking noises , particularly in the joints of fingers and hands, presence of stalling s in recovery, chronic pain of an unidentifiable nature, a worsening state beginning around 5:00 PM that hits its peak of discomfort typically around midnight and remaining in a goaded state until 4:00 PM, a worsening state from coldness in any form, a worsening state when in a damp environment, and a sense of relief from rubbing. It should be noted that \"this is a remedy that is to be thought of as being for acute and chronic 13 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY conditions equally. It works well with all other cell salts and c an be used in concert with any of them, especially in stubborn cases that are slow heal.\" (McCabe, 2009, p.93). A reiteration is of invaluable importance that this is the remedy needed for injury after vaccinations; when a person becomes languid and weak a fter vaccinations, Kali Muriaticum can bring back a sense of strength and vitality to an overloaded system. Schuessler's sixth cell salt is Kali Phosphoricum. Kali Phosphoricum is also recognized as Kali . Phos . and Potassium Phosphate. This cell salt is k nown for its impact on nerves; a sort of tranquilizer for irritable tempers, depression of every degree, worry, insomnia, and anxiety. Kali Phos . is found, as previously alluded to, in the nerves of the central nervous system and gray matter of the brain. The origin of function for these nerves and brain matters is of this cell salt's jurisdiction. Common uses and conditions that sugges t the need for Kali Phos. are allergies, asthma, bedwetting, concussion, chilblains, depression, bad breathe, canker sores , croup, diarrhea, epilepsy, neuralgia, gangrene, nervous associated with menstruation , hysteria, insomnia, nosebleeds, sciatica, nightmares and night terrors, sensitive teeth, toothac hes that are accompanied by frontal headaches, varicose veins, tinnitus, and whooping cough. The person who needs this cell salt will often lack an ability to i ndependently stay warm, they may suffer immensely from becoming too cold, but will also suffer from becoming too warm. Kali Phos . need is alway s accompanied by oversensitivity -physical, mental, and/or emotional. This cell salt will help restore energy to a person who seems to be in a never - ending state of exhaustion caused by a constant worry and quest to find bot h physical and emotional warmth, a person who is affecte d deeply by daily pragmatics and pieces of less -than- ideal news, the child who can only find solace in the arms of an adult, and the elderly who have lost muscle tone and their desire to go on further in life . Key indicators that hel p to determine the 14 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY need for Kali Phos . are the expression of sluggishness, a certain smell comparable to old onions as the body and mind become more sluggish, and the presence of the color golden yellow in bodily discharges . One of the main physiological a pplications of Kali Phos. is when heart troubles are present .. \"Everything connected with heart trouble can be treated with this cell salt - in conjunction of course, with whatever your physician prescribes. When the heart is full of fat or is degenerating, the lungs are inflamed, or there is pain in the chest, this wonderful soother should be taken on a regular basis.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p. 96). The seventh of the cell salts is Kali Sulphuricum. This remedy is taken from potassium sulfate and is calle d Kali. Sulph. for short. Kali . Sulph . is quite a powerful carrier of oxygen, carrying it to all cells of the body. Because of the oxygen carrying abilities, it is significant to new cell growth, overall cellular nutrition, and has an impact upon respiration. Kali Sulph. has an impact on and an attraction for mucosal membran es throughout the body, as well as, the hair, nails and especially t he skin. This cell salt is particular to the third and final stages of inflammation or resolve of disease . Common uses and conditions th at suggest the use of Kali Sulph. are allergies and sinusitis, asthma, baldnes s, colds, coughs, rattling mucous in chest, flu, colic, constipat ion, dandruff, diarrhea, diges tive upset, eczema, flatulence, irritable bowel syndrome, pain in limbs, neck and shoulders, wandering pains, psoriasis, rheumatism, ring worm, vertigo, vitiligo , and whooping cough. Skin conditions are considerably most c ommon among the Kali Sulph. deficient because \"there is breakdown of the skin and high fevers from infections or inflammations. This is the body getting rid of self -inflicted toxins from a poor diet or polluted conditions of living in the modern world. \" (Card, 2007, p. 13). Kali Sulp h. is believed to help with these condit ions by destroying worn out cells as it delivers oxygen. The mood of a person in need of K ali Sulph . is extremely susceptible to change. They can be crying in one 15 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY moment and satisfied by the next with no indication a s to what caused this variable. A Kali Sulph. requirement might show as a tendency to \"be agitated. They are hurried, always rush ing from one place to another from one task to another. They say they are tired, that they want to lie down and rest, yet they never seem to. As soon as they lie down, they are back up again.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 102). This agitation will often translate int o reactions to emotional and physical upsets, they are driven back up as soon as thy lay down to rest. Overreactions to anything perceived as threatening are common, yet these perceptions seem to be affected by inconsistency as well. This deficiency is giv en the particular fear of falling, the cause of this is said to be the inclination towards afflictions of vertigo. \"They feel their whole world fly out of control when they are in high places.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 103). Other indications that mig ht point one towards Kali Sulph. as a remedy are watery yellow discharges, as well as, painful red eruptions, lack of sweating, and an irritable bowel that alternates between constipa tion and diarrhea often linked to food allergies. Cell salt number eight is Magnesia Phosphorica. Alternatively, Mag . Phos . or magnesium phosphate. This cell salt known as an amazing antispasmodic remedy. Magnesia Phosphorica \"is abundant in the human body. It is found in bones and teeth and in the spine marrow itself, and in the muscle s, the nerves, and the gray matter of the brain. Human sperm is especially rich in phosphate of Magnesia.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 106). As the only cell salt that is a magnesium based remedy, it is importance of vital importance for remedying irritability of th e nervous system. Common uses and conditions th at suggest the need for Mag. Phos. are colic, convulsions, cramps, headaches, migraines, neuralgia, sciatica, toothache and teething pains, writer's cramp, darting pains, whooping cough, nightly agg ravations, and spasms of all kinds. \"Mag Phos is, by and large, a remedy associated with pain. Those needing it are in the grip of 16 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY pain, and are therefore, complaining, lamenting, and wishing the pain on someone else. They can be self -pitying, angry, or ch angeable in their moods -- alternating between anger and self -pity.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 107). Other words to describe the mental and emotional capacity of a person in need of the cell salt might be anxious, fretful, forgetful, and drowsy. They may be meditat ive and stoic in their pain, or conversely , very talkative about their own problems. They may be affected by fears connected to their physical pain and experience depression that they have succumbed to because of it. The stand out key physical symptom for this cell salt is pain. These pains are in the realm of crampy, radiating, shooting, order out check. These pains can run along nerves in the body and shift from place to place. Pains specific to this remedy will often manifest on the right side of the bod y and are worse at ni ght. Resting seems to make pains worse while warmth and pressu re improve them . Any symptoms of a violent nature point directly to M ag. Phos. \"Finally, here are two more indications of a magnesium phosphate deficiency: a thirst for cold drinks and sugar with an aversion to coffee and a feeling of drowsiness. If from ten to eleven in the morning and four to five in the afternoon you suffer from headaches, mag. phos. Can help you. If your brain feels as if it were swishing about and you fe el a tightness in your head, consider trying mag fosse.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p. 82). Natrium Muriaticum, Nat. Mur., or sodium chloride is the ninth cell salt. This remedy is known as nature's cure for headaches as it is called for in all headaches a s at least one of the remedies in a cure. Nat Mur is found in the digestive system, kidney, bladder, and the moisture components of both blood and skin. This remedy is highly versatile because of the simple abundance already required and present in the human body. \"Sodium chloride's great quality is its creation of osmotic pressure.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p. 116). It is a water distributor. It will carry water to where it needs to be and keep it in the right proportions. Sharing the chemical 17 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY name with table s alt, sodium chloride prepared as a cell salt remedy actually helps to reso lve issues that table salt may cause, including high blood pressure , bloating, and an extended craving for the taste of salt. \"The primary indication of sodium chloride deficiency i s either an exceptional dryness anywhere in the body or, conversely, an overabundance of water. If you need natrum mur., you will probably appear bloated, feel languid and drowsy and suffer from chilly extremities. You'll most likely have a pronounced crav ing for salt - because even though you may be eating many more times the required amount with your meals, it cannot be absorbed by the body and less is taken in minute doses.\" (Lennon & Rolfe, 2004, p. 117). Common uses and conditions that call for the use of the cell salt are anemia, bone and joint pain, back pain, claustrophobia, colds, coughs, flu, constipation, depression, salt cravings, diabetes, deafness, diarrhea, eyestrain, fainting spells, dryness, fever, goiter, gout, grief, headaches, heart disord ers, herpes, introversion, indigestion, fever blisters, canker sores, involuntary urination, parasites, sexual version, shyness, greasy skin, loss of sense of smell, loss of sense of taste, sunstroke, varicose veins, eczema, ringworm, menopause and menstru al disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome. Mccabe perfectly describes the type that needs this cell salt the most as stubborn (just like the typical physical symptoms ). Headaches and chronic complaints, such as allergies, can come to rule a patient's life . The people who respond best to this remedy have the peculiar keynote of having allergies to the things that they love most, i.e. beloved pets, favorite foods, or favorite vacation spots, especially if they are by the sea. (p. 114). A good time for the us e of the cell salt is for the lack of fully healed ailments that periodically return with symptoms after a false but seemingly period of health. An emotional pattern representative of a Nat . Mu r. deficiency is grief; for long -term grief or that that has be come confused with betrayal. The Nat. Mur. deficient may have a hard time processing love, they may crave it and avoid it equally. 18 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY These types will experience their emotions in silence and do not want to be consoled for fear of speaking about the emotions may cause them an involuntary relinquish of control. These types desire to laugh; a crying, tear filled, belly aching, bladder emptying laugh. Laughter is the most effective release for the Nat . Mu r. type. Distant but deeply desiring a connection to the w orld around them is commonplace. They often expect those around them to know exactly what it is they need . Key physical indications are as followed, but simply cannot be limited to, the need to lay down from headaches, no matter the cause, dry mucous membra nes, skin that is greasy in some parts and very dry and others, dry and cracked lips, a constant thirst for cold things especially cold water, those who speci fically get heartburn from over eating, love of bread, salt, sugar, alcohol, and processed foods, a deep insatiable hunger, painful dryness of the vagina, and arthritic pain of the arms, legs and knees with tingling and numbness that is accompanied by dry skin in corresponding areas. This type generally feels better from not doing what it is that they desire to do, but and instead doing what is good for them. Natrum Phosphoricum is the tenth cell salt. It can be called Nat . Phos., sodium phosphate, and sometimes phosphate of soda. Sodium Phosphate is the antacid of the cell salts; not only in digestion, but also in bodily fluids. A build up and overabundance of acid is a clear indicator for the need for this cell salt. \"Natrum Phos phoricum does not have the widest range of uses of any of the cell salts. Its uses are rather narrow in terms of range, as they tend to fall into one of two camps: either the patient suffers from chronic digestive disorders that are based upon an abundance of acid and his or her system, or the patient is suffering from pain that can be lumped within the diagnosis of arthritis or, more commonly gouty arthritis. Either way, over acidity plays an important part in the cause of the symptoms, making Natrum Phosp horicum a vital remedy among the cell salts.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 123). This type has a mental and 19 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY emotional state of indifference, with sensitivities reflecting in their physical reactions to weather. They will be very susceptible to changes in temperatur e and tend to have a lack of vital heat. They can be deeply affected by music, often times being moved to tears. This type can have a tendency to be fearful of the future, of the dark, and of intruders. A Nat. Phos. Can be represented by the need to sit wh en resting, and to do so quietly. They will not want to exercise or walk, they will have an air of sluggishness about them. Conditions and symptoms that suggest the need for this cell salt are acidosis, arthritis, chronic constipation, goiter, gout, heartb urn, indigestion, chronic postnasal drip, rheumatism, stomach upset, worms and other parasites, acne, conjunctivitis, and jaundice. Matt sauce deficiency is represented by the color yellow. The persons tongue will have a thick yellow coating. Some key indi cators that will point towards this remedy are pain that originates or as worst on the left side of the body, an increased pain when the left side of the body is laid upon, when pain is improved by warmth when pain is concentrated in the ribs, when chronic indigestion is followed by belching and a desire to fall asleep seated in front of the television, and if symptoms are made worse by the coming of a storm. The eleventh remedy is Natrum Sulphuricum. It is also recognized as sodium sulphate or an abbreviated Nat. Sulph. \"This cell salt is found in intercellular fluids and regulates water by eliminating any excess from the tissues, blood and fluids.\" (Card, 200 7, p.18). Nat. Sulph. Regulates water by absorbing it so that it can be eliminated, it plays a large role in the disintegration and elimination of cells that are old or dead. This cell salt functions highly in elimination organs, the bladder, pancreas, int estines, and liver; it helps to cleanse the body of toxins. Conditions in common ailments that suggest the need for this remedy are asthma, bedwetting, costochondritis, diabetes, chronic diarrhea, flu, chronic gout, head injury, headaches 20 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY and migraines, ne phritis, overweight, rheumatism, sciatica, warts, liver problems, loose or huge stools, suicidal tendencies, sun sensitivity, swelling, excessive urination, vomiting of bitter matter, and seasonal affective disorder. The person needing this remedy will fee l restless and melancholy. They may be manic in response to overstimulation, will be quite subdued on foggy days, and have a negative reaction to music. One of the most important symptoms representative of this cell salts deficiency is a tendency to be ext remely sensitive to dampness or being wet in any way. This type will have watery discharges that will typically be greenish yellow and a Tom that is coated with a stick greenish film. This coating might also have a grayish or brownish tint. This type go ni ght after night without comfortable night's sleep, they will not fall or stay asleep easy and will arise in the morning very early for no reason feeling very refreshed. This type will often be overweight and have adverse emotions regarding the way they loo k and feel. This cell salt, like the one before, will manifest on the left side of the body especially in the chest. This cell salt is very good at ridding the body of over abundances of cholesterol. This remedy needs to be thought of in all cases of asthm a that is agitated by dampness, bronchitis and pneumonia. This remedy is also a key remedy for sciatica that is crippling and inc apable of any kind of soothing. The twelfth and final cell salt in Scheussler's cell salt therapies is Silicea . \"Silica \" is the only alteration in spelling and it is also known as flint. \"It can be found in traces in blood, bile, and urine and is contained in connective tissues throughout the body, in the spine and brain itself, in nerve tissues and membranes, in the skin, the ha ir, and the nails.\" (McCabe, 2009, p. 137). Silica provides the body with strength and support, and is known as somewhat of a universal remedy because of the action it has on every single bodily system. It is also an amazing eliminator and cleanser. This r emedy is slow and deep acting, is more often used in chronic cases than acute cases, and is needed by those who have lost the innate ability to nourish themselves. 21 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY The common conditions and symptoms of those needing silica are acne, AIDS, anemia, bedwettin g, body odor, boils, bone disease, bunions, carbuncles, cataracts, chronic fatigue, conjunctivitis, constipation, especially chronic, cough, diabetes, fainting, splinters, fractures, swollen glands, headaches, homesickness, infections that are slow to heal , hemorrhoids, joint pain, all kinds of injuries, cuts, keloids and scar tissue , malnutrition, neuralgia, obesity from malnutrition, passive -aggressive behavior, rheumatism, rickets, sinusitis, sweat on head and feet that is smelly, tooth decay, vaccination reactions, whitlows, shyness, timidity, and ulcers. The type needing this remedy tends to be strong mentally and emotionally, but may be weak in spirit and mind. This type might be easy to startle and may become anxious and irritable in the eve nt that they are startled. This type might experience a difficulty in concentrating. They cling to structure, they can be slightly stubborn and passive aggressive, they will dislike confrontation, but silently hold to their beliefs and feel rebellious agai nst an opposing authority. They are not liars, but do tell lies as an act of survival and self -preservation. They will often have a keen sense of hearing. The silica deficient will be full of anxieties and fears, often fearing being cut open, and sometimes developing a fascination and desire to do just that. They will not like to travel, they will feel guilty even when they've done nothing wrong, and they will become depressed if they have to live or work alone. Key indicators for this cell salt are a head that sweats profusely during sleep, a strong and enduring body odor that does not go away after bathing, feet and hands that are always cold, abscesses or boils that are filled with white puss , in all cases of malnutrition, and in situations where symptoms are improved by hot and humid weather. The sheer magnitude of what cell salts do in the body and what cell salt remedies can do for the body is overwhelming, and quite frankly, endless. There will never be a complete set of writings to describe the bioch emical power. There is no linear description of the effects and 22 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY benefits; as they work individually, they all work together. There is still so much that is not understood. One thing that is evident is the importance that cell salts have on human processes, and how cell salts , as remedies , can help restore balance , health, and well -being to any and all individuals. With the help of Hahnemann and Homeopathy, Virchow and his cell theories, and the twelve chemical compounds that Scheussler discovered as the mai n essential mineral salts, Scheussler changed and revolutionized how disease can be viewed and treated. He created a safe, and easy form of treatment that could benefit everyone. A form of treatment that is made up of remedies that are made of what humans are built from. What could be more genius or beautiful? 23 SCHEUSSLER'S BIOCHEMISTRY Reference List Card, David R. (2007). 12 Essential Minerals For Cellular Health: An Introduction to Cell Salts.
