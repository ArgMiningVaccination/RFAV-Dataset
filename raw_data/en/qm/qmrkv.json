Based on such knowledge, we can begin to better understand vaccine hesitancy and probably design communication and training interventions aimed at biomedical providers Weconduct ourresearch together with CAM physicians Wehave included 3 Swiss CAM physicians in ourstudy They participate in ourresearch meetings Forsymbolic Unit, Cantonal Fribourg) CAM help usrecruit additional CAM physicians tothestudy Weconsult them and include them asco-authors on ourmanuscriptsPersonal attitudes and motivations that facilitate this research I've been living in vaccine -hesitant social networks for years A number of CAM physicians know me personally and know that I do not want to harm them Not interested in introducing mandatory vaccination in Switzerland Hiking, Mountain climbing since age 142 daughters who go to Rudolf Steiner School (NB: fully vaccinated + Hep A, B, Influenza )Professional Baroque musician since age 10How didweconvince CAM providers to work with us ?

We've received quite detailed emails from some providers, explaining to us why they're not participating, e.g. : \"I don't share 2 central concepts of your study: a) that vaccines are safe and effective b) that goal should be to increase vaccination rates\" Some CAM providers are reluctant to work with us They are concerned .... .... that we're doing \"espionage\" for the health authorities in order to gather data that will be held against them in order to introduce vaccine mandates in SwitzerlandPreliminary qualitative results: 2. CAM providers' perspectives on vaccination in general Not categorically opposed to vaccination -Hesitancy/acceptance spectrum -Variety and range of perspectives Position themselves as providers who reflected critically about the necessity of individual vaccines for each one of their individual patients. In part divergent views from biomedicine on illness and its effects on body e.g. measles \"benign\" childhood illness More likely to take personal experience into account as evidence about the risks of vaccination Slide courtesy Michael DemlFrame Switzerland as a \"safe space\" low probability of contracting certain vaccine -preventable infections. in case of vaccine -preventable infection Swiss health system adequately prepared to manage them Question the necessity of Swiss vaccination recommendations and mass vaccination policies advanced by public health institutions: \"We treat humans, not herds!\" public health approaches to vaccination might not necessarily be justified and fail to take into account individual patients, their contexts, and their wishesPreliminary qualitative Results: 3.
