It stimulates the chakras like the sunlight of spring, clearing the mind and stirring the soul to action. Its frequency awakens creativity and imagination, and sustains the process of transforming dreams and wishes into tangible form. With its pure yellow energy, Citrine encourages fullness of life, fresh beginnings and new pursuits. This Citrine Essence, with its internal dynamics, is reported to be able to clarify your thoughts and allow the creative juices to flow in your mind. Comments from direct experience: \"I felt an expansiveness in my heart and my chest, and as though my head was being cleared. A high vibrational \"buzz\" went through my body, and I \"saw\" a spinning vortex around me, primarily at my Solar Plexus, clearing energy. I received that this essence catalyzes positive ions to the body, and changes negative ions to positive ones, as well as raising the body's frequency to shake off negative energies, very cool!\" Each bottle consists of spring water, 20% apple cider vinegar (for preservation), and the Crystal Vibrational Essence. The Essence is not a diluted dosage strength, so it is very powerful! Recommended dosage: As a daily tonic, place 4 drops under the tongue when you are guided. You can safely take any amount several times a day, if necessary. This elixir can also be used in drinking water for a healing regime, topically for aura alignment, and in the bath. It is also beneficial for pets and plants, and can also be used in water to drink or in a bath. It can also be topically put on chakras and meridians. This elixir is safe for pets and animals. It can be used to clear negative energy, and for Feng Shui purposes in the same manner as as a Citrine crystal. See the Crystal Encyclopedia entry for Citrine for more details. For detailed dosage recommendations on these usages see the detailed Crystal Elixir Guide here. Citrine Essence is associated with the Solar Plexus Chakra. The Solar Plexus is the energy distribution center, the first of the chakras of relationships. This Chakra is located between the rib cage and navel. It controls the immune system and digestive systems. When in balance physically you have strength to fight infections, are free of allergic reactions, and are able to use the nutrients you ingest. Citrine has subdued fire energy, but is generally used in the center of a home or room to bring cheerfulness, light, and energy to the entire space. Yellow is the color of the middle of the year, the middle of space, the sun, and light energy. Use Citrine Essence in the center of a space to energize and vitalize it. Crystal Elixirs are Vibratory Essences that work on a deep level and are very powerful. They affect the physical and etheric levels to shift and raise your vibration, to energetically release that which is not of your highest good, to heal certain issues, to rebalance you, and to awaken your Spiritual gifts and abilities. Their effects can be subtle or very intense. This depends on you and your chemistry. Experiment with them to see what works best for you! As everyone is different, no claims are made on what exact effect the essence will have on each individual.
