SEASONS | Fall 2014 2 0C2-003 TOC_Letter.indd 2 8/25/14 2:38 PMED LETTER DEAR HY-VEE READER, More than 20 years ago, I became a chef because I love food. Nothing has changed through the years. My life will always be about fruits and vegetables, flours and spices, creams and wines\u2014and helping people experience memorable meals, often from their own kitchens. I'm privileged to engage with so many people here at Hy-Vee. It's different from working in restaurants, where I was usually isolated behind kitchen doors. Here at the store, I interact with customers on a daily basis\u2014offering advice, giving them insider secrets and gaining insights and knowledge from them in return. People are much more adventurous in their cooking today; we aren't limited to meat- and-potatoes diets any longer. It's a generational thing. You'll see it in the pages ahead, where you'll discover recipes as varied as roast duck, eggplant patties and a wonderful acorn squash stuffed with apple and cranberries. These are some of the tastes of autumn, which are deeper, richer and more savory than those of the warmer seasons. Good food is at the heart of this Fall issue of Hy-Vee Seasons. For flavorful holiday entr\u00e9es, check out \"Perfect Poultry,\" page 16, and the robust tastes in \"Holiday Sides,\" page 44. We also look back to the 1960s, when the familiar Hy-Vee slogan, \"Where there's a helpful smile in every aisle,\" was first used in a TV commercial. Read about it in \"A Helpful Smile + Fifty Recipes,\" page 30, and travel back in time with some of the recipes. Welcome to the Fall issue. All your friends at Hy-Vee hope you enjoy it. Sincerely,Luke Peters, ChefCedar Rapids #7, IowaAbout Our Editor: Since joining the Hy-Vee staff two years ago, chef Luke Peters has also been named catering manager in Cedar Rapids.

It's a quick, easy bisque; sweet and a little spicy.\" Chef Ron Dillavou, Hy-Vee in Waterloo #4, IowaSweet, tender and packed with antioxidants for good health, winter squash is a fantastic addition to any meal. Serve it with pork or turkey. Or use it in gratins, pastas, soups and desserts. PHOTOS Tobin BennettwinterSQUASHIN SEASON SELECT Always pick squash that is rm and heavy for its size with a smooth, dull, thick rind. Those with soft rinds may lack fl avor. If a stem is still attached, it should be rounded and dry. When choosing a green acorn squash, select one with less orange. Acorn squash that is more orange than green may be stringy. STORE Winter squash do best when stored in a dark, cool place, ideally at 55\u00b0F. Colder temperatures cause them to rot. At home, store whole, unwashed squash in a pantry and use within a few weeks. Cut squash can be stored covered in a refrigerator for a day or two. PREP Using a sturdy, sharp knife with a long blade, carefully pierce the rind and cut squash in half. Scoop out the seeds and lay halves fl at. Peel and cut into pieces, if desired. To peel exceptionally tough rinds, pierce all over with a knife and microwave the squash 3 to 5 minutes until it's soft enough to cut.

WINTER SQUASH CAN BE SWEETENED WITH MAPLE SYRUP, HONEY, BROWN SUGAR OR ORANGE JUICE. COOKING WINTER SQUASH Roast: Cut and seed. (Seeds can be saved for roasting.) Lightly oil a baking sheet and place each half cut-side down; pierce skin with a knife. Cover halves in oil, season to taste and place one layer deep. Roast the squash at 375\u00b0F about 45 minutes until tender. Steam: Peel, cut squash into pieces, discard seeds. Place in steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water. Steam covered until tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Works best with easily peeled varieties of squash. Microwave: Pierce all over with a knife to vent steam. Cook on full power for 5 to 10 minutes or until tender. Knife will easily pierce rind and flesh when ready. Cool, cut in half and remove seeds. To cook pieces, peel, cut into pieces, discard seeds and microwave squash until tender. Turn squash upright and brush remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter over cut sides and cavities of squash. 5.

Here's proof he paid attention: He's been honored by an industry group for his leadership skills as a Hy-Vee store director. TEAM BUILDER PHOTOS Amy Allen SEASONS | Fall 2014 10 010-011 OurBest.indd 10 8/25/14 2:59 PMFor Randy Kruse, taking home the Manager of the Year award from the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) this year was akin to winning a championship. \"It was my Super Bowl. It was quite an honor,\" says Randy, a store director for Hy-Vee in Ames, Iowa. FMI is an industry group representing food retailers in the United States and around the world. Randy competed against managers from other supermarket chains with 200 or more stores. Judging criteria included leadership, communication with staff, innovation and improving a store's financial performance. In his youth, Randy worked for his father in the family-owned grocery store in Laurens, Iowa. When Randy joined Hy-Vee 35 years ago, it was with his father's encouragement. Randy began hiscareer at the store as a part-time checker/stocker in Fort Dodge, Iowa. He has been a store director since 1992, when he was assigned to the store in Waseca, Minnesota. He also held the director position at stores in Carroll and Windsor Heights, Iowa. Q: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB WITH HY-VEE? A:I got to take care of an aisle. Aisle number two was my aisle. I wanted that aisle because it was the most difficult. I stocked it with canned vegetables and similar items and I kept it looking the best that was possible. Q: WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE ASSIGNMENT? A:I love being a store director because I enjoy mentoring people. I feel that I can really connect with my employees and build a team. The way I feel about the job also has a lot to do with the customers. I have made so many incredible friends over the years through my work. At Hy-Vee, we have the most unique autonomous system in the industry. As a store director, I'm allowed to make the decisions needed every day that directly affect thousands of customers and my community, and are also good for the company. Q: WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES ? A:Being a Hy-Vee store director allows me to make the majority of all decisions for our store. I control the pricing to stay competitive against other local stores. I oversee item selection, the hiring of help and all the donations we make to the community. I also develop the store's annual budget and set the sales and profit goals. Other companies dictate everything to their managers, but at Hy-Vee we create our own strategies at the store level and are held accountable for them. It truly gives us the responsibility of running our own business. Q: WHEN ENTERING A STORE FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT ARE SIGNS THAT IT IS WELL-MANAGED?A: You get a feel for a store in the first ten steps you take inside. A new customer will notice if there is a clean entryway, a nice clean floor and that they are greeted with a smile by someone who says, \"Hi, how are you today?\" or \"Welcome to Hy-Vee.\" All those things make our customers feel good. Q: WHAT ARE THE BEST DAYS IN YOUR STORE? A: My best days are when I can spend most of my time on the sales floor working with the employees and visiting with my customers. It's very gratifying when you can leave the store knowing that you have helped make someone's day better. Q: WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR MOST CHALLENGING EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB ?A:I was still a new store director in Waseca when our checkers and some of the customers started feeling ill. It turned out that someone released pepper spray inside the store. It spread through the aisles, so we had to close. Police, fire and a hazmat team were called in to help. After they left, our staff stayed the entire night to clean up. Our state health inspector gave us the OK to reopen just in time to celebrate the Fourth of July. It was a very stressful time, but through that I learned that a store director has to be ready for anything. Randy Edeker, Chief Executive Of cer, Hy-Vee, left, and Randy Kruse, Store Director, Hy-Vee Ames #2, Iowa, right, at the Food Marketing Institiute conference in Chicago.As a Hy-Vee store director, Randy Kruse guides a team of 435 employees. Here are his tips for daily success in any job: Speak to every customer. Be a teacher and trainer to others. Lead by example and be a team player. Follow the rules. Have a great attitude. Be the company's brand! Represent your company inside and outside. Be organized and detail-oriented. Respect your boss. It's OK to make a mistake every day\u2014but never make the same mistake twice.

Make perfection your goal.A DOZEN TIPS FOR SUCCESS SEASONS | hy-vee.com 11 010-011 OurBest.indd 11 8/25/14 2:59 PMselect varieties oz. 2/$5.00 012-015 Ad_101_Opener.indd 12 8/26/14 2:21 PMare several choices for a rich and savory foundation.

When you want an outstanding soup, there are several choices for a rich and savory SoupSTARTERCOOKING 101 READYMADE STARTERS: STOCK: Chicken, beef, vegetable or seafood stocks come in resealable cartons. Stock is made mostly by simmering bones and has a richer body than broth. You'll also nd low-sodium and unsalted varieties. To enhance the fl avor of a lower-sodium stock, simmer it with vegetables and some seasonings for about 30 minutes. BROTH: Straight from the can or resealable carton, a chicken, beef, vegetable or fl avor- infused broth di ers from stock. Broths have hearty, distinctive fl avors\u2014chicken and beef broths taste meatier because pieces with high meat-to-bone ratio are typically used. Reduced- sodium or even unsalted broth is also available. OTHER OPTIONS: Instant bouillon granules or cubes are available in chicken, beef and vegetable fl avors. These also come in fl avor- infused and low-sodium varieties. Besides these shelf-stable staples, there are soup-base pastes that work in a similar way. Simply combine them with boiling water to make a hearty broth. PHOTOS Amy AllenHOMEMADE CHICKEN SOUP STARTER For richer body, use the bony pieces of chicken (back, neck and wings). For meatier fl avor, use a whole chicken.

STEAMING: Use about 2 tablespoons of the starter when steaming veggies in the microwave. COOKING: Use the starter instead of water to cook pasta, rice and other grains according to package directions. It can also replace water or wine used in savory recipes. REHEATING: Add the starter as needed to thin your sauces, soups and stews. BASTING: Use the starter as a basting liquid to moisten oven-roasted chicken or meat. DEGLAZING: Use the starter as the liquid for scraping up brown bits in a pan after roasting or browning meat or poultry. BRAISING: Use the starter to cook tough cuts of meat with long, slow, moist heat. MAKING GRAVY: Deglaze the roasting pan and thicken the starter for a rich gravy.

While turkey may be the centerpiece at large gatherings, roast chicken, duck and Cornish hens can make big impressions at small tables. A bird of any size can make a holiday feast memorable. For cooks, the real beauty lies in choosing from an assortment of birds and recipes. Whether you're feeding a handful or a houseful, we've got the perfect bird for your table. CLASSIC ROAST CHICKEN, surrounded by savory vegetables and served with pan gravy, will feel right at home in an intimate gathering. A 5- to 6-pound roaster serves up to eight people. Roasting the chicken at a high oven temperature is the secret to perfectly crunchy, crisp skin. Rubbing a fragrant herb butter underneath the skin enhances flavor and keeps the meat tender and super moist. It's something special your guests won't soon forget.WORDS Lois White PHOTOS Tobin Bennett POULTRY CORNISH HENS, a small breed of young chicken, offer attractive individual servings and fast prep. A whole hen surrounded by vegetables on a plate makes a delicious and elegant presentation. These tasty morsels weigh about 1 \u00bd pounds each and roast in little more than an hour. They also fit easily into the oven. Brushing on a sweet glaze helps the skin caramelize and crisp up. DUCK offers a distinctive earthy flavor and dark moist meat, something you won't get when taking the tried-and-true path with other birds. Cooks may find duck intimidating because of its fatty skin. Not to worry. Our recipe, page 21, will give you a tender and juicy, pomegranate-glazed bird with a slightly sweet finish. Some of the duck fat can be used to baste the meat while roasting. The rest of this liquid gold can be spooned off and used in other ways, such as for drizzling over roasted vegetables. Figure on a 5- to 6-pound bird to feed four people. TURKEY, the iconic bird, takes on exciting new flavors when soaked overnight in a salty brine. The meat absorbs seasoned liquid, which breaks down the proteins and seals in flavor and moisture prior to roasting. If you're brining, avoid self-basting birds. Look for the words natural and no additives on the label. If the turkey is frozen, allow three days of thaw time in the refrigerator. Figure about 1 pound (including skin and bones) per person to allow for seconds and leftovers.Per/f.3ec/t.9 SEASONS | Fall 2014 16 016-021 compound herb butter underneath the skin enhances fl avor and keeps the meat tender and juicy while roasting.

These desserts may look sweet, sugary and innocent, but each is hiding its true personality. Underneath all those swirls and flourishes, something wild lurks\u2014a shot of bourbon, a dash of almond liqueur or some Caribbean rum. Adult beverages separate these confections from the desserts in your kids' backpacks. \"Some recipes, like one for a rum cake, require cooking. In those cases, you're going to be burning off at least some of the alcohol when you bake the cake,\" says Deb Clemens, Hy-Vee wine and spirits manager at Dubuque, Iowa. Alcohol evaporates based on oven temperature and cooking time. Baked items lose abaout 60 percent of their alcohol content after cooking in an oven for 15 minutes and about 75 percent after they have been baking for an hour, according to a 2003 USDA study. \"When you make bourbon balls\u2014or other things that aren't baked\u2014you get every ounce of the bourbon that was put into them. You go to a party and someone hands you one that is loaded with alcohol and, wow, it can be quite strong,\" Deb says.

Start by picking one type of cheese from at least three of the categories on these pages. Let guests sample subtle-to-bold cheeses that vary in fl avor, color, age and texture. Serve with crackers, breads, jams, dry-cured meats, nuts and fruits. Depending on your audience, you may also o er wines or beers. Chris Smith, cheese specialist at the Hy-Vee store in Waukee, Iowa, recommends sampling each type. Semisoft Cheeses Ranging from silky to very sharp in taste, semisoft cheeses are best when they have a smooth surface and milky aroma. Suggested cheeses: Muenster (below), Drunken Goat, Fontina, Havarti, Port du Salut Fresh Cheeses Noted for fresh milky fl avors, cheeses in this mellow variety have no rind and are not usually aged. Some seem more like thickened cream than cheese. Suggested cheeses: mozzarella (above), creme fraiche, marscarpone, ricotta Firm Cheeses Sometimes called semi-hard, these cheeses are good for grilled cheese sandwiches or mac and cheese. Tastes are generally nutty and buttery. Suggested cheeses: Jarlsberg, Manchego, Swiss Hard Cheeses Because hard cheeses are aged longer than most other varieties, fl avors can be strong and pungent or sweet Jennifer Chappell Smith PHOTOS Tobin BennettSweet and creamy bananas add decadent richness to tarts, quick breads and even griddle cakes and ice cream. Try di erent banana varieties to experience a whole bunch of new fl avors. O pening a green banana sounds as loud as if you snapped a stick. And the smell? Like a cucumber. Surprised? Bananas are part of the cucumber family, says Norm Davis. Norm is the quality control inspector at Hy-Vee's Chariton Distribution Center in Iowa. For 40 years, Norm has handled the ripening and distribution of bananas\u2014now at a rate of about 3 million a week. He is so well regarded in the produce industry for his knowledge that major fruit supplier Dole Food Co.\u2014Hy-Vee's sole source for bananas\u2014calls Norm when it has a technical question about the ripening process. Bananas arrive daily at the Chariton facility from Central America by truckloads. Though rock hard and deep green when delivered, the fruit is ripened in five days inside massive temperature-controlled rooms. (For more on the ripening process, see page 58.) \"It's not a one-man show,\" says Norm, who works with a Hy-Vee team that stretches from buyers in the field to produce managers and staff at local stores. Bananas are the number one seller among items sold by weight at Hy-Vee. Karla Heffron, Hy-Vee assistant vice president of warehousing, says customers are responding to having more choices in bananas. \"In this year alone, we've seen organic banana sales jump 30 percent.\" BANANAS 101 There are hundreds of banana cultivars, and Hy-Vee stocks the five most popular. The common banana is the yellow Cavendish. Other cultivars sold at Hy-Vee are plantains, minis, reds, and Manzanos, see page 56. They are all imported from Central and South America. More like a spice bush than a tree, banana plants grow 10 to 26 feet high. Each plant yields up to 200 bananas harvested from as many as five loaded clusters. As yellow bananas ripen and soften, their sweetness intensifies. If you have more bananas than you can use immediately, freeze some for future recipes. Peel them and place in a resealable plastic bag. To slow the browning process, add a squeeze of lemon juice. A BUNCH FOR BAKING But there are recipes that work best with brown bananas. Overripe bananas\u2014the browner the better\u2014 are the secret to getting the most intense fl avors in baked goods, such as classic banana breads. Darker bananas have a soft texture that mashes and blends easily. This fl avor-boosting ingredient is also the best choice for other recipes, including donuts, pancakes and ice cream. How does a cook put true banana fl avor into a pudding or cream pie when the fruit is slightly underripe and there's no time for ripening? Try roasting, which intensi es fl avor and helps the fruit soften slightly. To roast bananas, place unpeeled fruit on a baking sheet and bake in a 325\u00b0F oven for about 20 minutes or until the skins are completely black. Let cool for 5 minutes. O Sweet and creamy bananas add decadent richness to tarts, quick breads and even griddle cakes and ice cream.

Bananas contain complex carbohydrates and vitamin B 6 that help kick-start your metabolism. RED BANANA Small and stubby, reds have a nutty apple taste and are good for baking. Redder bananas contain more vitamin C and carotene. PLANTAIN A starchy side dish in many Central American countries, plantains come in green, and are best served fried or boiled; yellow, a sweeter fl avor, best grilled or baked; and black, the sweetest version, best for baking or desserts.

Let them develop sugar spots\u2014dark brown spots that mean they're ready to eat. Each mini has just 55 calories, plus 2 grams of bene cial ber. MANZANO This green fruit starts yellow and then blackens as it ripens. Creamy, it has an applelike taste and averages about 4 inches long. It's good for eating and baking. When selecting regular bananas, avoid those with blemishes near necks or crowns. Once you get them home, the temperature of your countertop a ects how fast bananas ripen\u2014the warmer it is the quicker they turn. If you want green bananas to ripen quickly, store them in a paper bag with an apple. But check on them every day. Though when overripe, they remain good for baking.

SEASONS | Fall 2014 58SECRETS OF RIPENING While most fruit delivered to Hy-Vee will ripen on its own, bananas need the help of Norm Davis, a Hy-Vee quality control inspector. For 40 years, Davis has been handling banana processing at Hy-Vee's Chariton Distribution Center in Iowa. His job is to oversee the ve-day process of transforming the fruit from green to yellow. \"Bananas are dormant at 58 degrees: They don't ripen and don't deteriorate,\" explains Norm. He raises the heat until they reach an internal temperature of 60 to 62 degrees on Day No. 1. Then he exposes them to the natural plant gas called ethylene\u2014also emitted by tomatoes, apples and peaches as they ripen. Norm says, \"I have to look at each shipment to see how fast they're going to ripen, and then I control them from that point.\" This attention gives bananas more shelf life when delivered to Hy-Vee stores. 054-061 Bananas.indd 58 8/25/14 5:09 PMCARAMEL-BANANA ICE CREAM SUNDAES Use the ripest fruit for the richest banana fl avor in this irresistible ice cream.

PRImo Shopping efficiently is one of the hardest parts of cooking for two. Start by planning for the week ahead and shop with a tailored grocery list in hand. This cuts down on overbuying and food spoilage, but more importantly, it saves time trying to decide what to cook, which is aggravating after a long day of work. Eating at home instead of going out just one additional night a week will save an average couple about $2,000 a year. Use these savings to invest in time-saving kitchen tools, such as a food processor or chef's knife. secondo Make a menu that's worth the work. Couples often settle for a bland meal simply because it's easy to pull together. Get out of that rut by trying one of our recipes. We've kept the speed of simple prep and quick cooking without sacrificing great flavor. Pamper yourselves with perfectly seasoned, Italian-inspired \" Linguini Chicken Carbonara,\" page 65, that's gluten-free! toss together our blue- cheese-infused \"Caesar Steak Wraps,\" page 67. Or try one of our other great dishes. duLce Reuse and recycle. Consider how foods can do double-duty as a dinner and a lunch. Don't rely on simply reheating leftovers, reimagine them, instead. Tonight's roasted chicken breast can be tossed in barbecue sauce for topping a homemade BBQ chicken pizza tomorrow or chilled overnight and chopped into a salad for lunch. By planning ahead, you can use leftovers more creatively. 062-067 DinnerforTwo.indd 63 8/27/14 11:51 AMBreakfast for dinner? skillet meal gets an extra kick from chorizo, a spicy pork sausage used in Mexican cuisine.

LET THIS BE YOUR COLD-FREE SEASON BY FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF A HY-VEE PHARMACIST. A cold or flu starts with a runny nose. Then comes the coughing, sneezing and whole body aches. Before you know it, you're down for the count. Here are easy ways to avoid getting sick during the upcoming cold and flu season, says Angie Danielson, Hy-Vee pharmacy manager in Davenport, Iowa. 1. WASH YOUR HANDS. Use soap and water and wash often. Basic hand cleansing is key to staying healthy, Angie says. 2. DISINFECT. If someone in your house is sick, disinfect anything they come in contact with to avoid spreading germs to the rest of the family. 3. COVER YOUR MOUTH EFFECTIVELY. Viruses can spread to people up to 6 feet away, so always cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue. No tissue? Cough or sneeze into your upper arm or sleeve, not your hand. 4. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. Stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing. 5. EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. Boost your immune system with foods high in antioxidants, such as carrots, citrus, blueberries and green leafy vegetables. 6. STAY HOME. If you are sick, do every- one a favor and stay home. Coming into contact with groups of people exposes others, allowing a virus or flu to stick around longer, Angie says.WORDS ANDREA COOLEY The common cold is a virus, so there are no antibiotics to treat it or prevent it. The fl u is a contagious infection caused by a variety of viruses, usually lasting 3 to 7 days. Getting a fl u shot is the most e ective way to protect yourself against this disease. 070-075 Soultions_Ad_Space2.indd 70 8/25/14 5:52 PM50% o all Nature Made Fish Oil, CoQ10, Flaxseed Oil, Vitamin B or Vitamin B Complete 30 to 400 ct. A HEALTHIER YOU QUICKREMEDIES GET RELIEF FROM ACHES AND PAINS BY PICKING UP OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE AT YOUR HY-VEE PHARMACY. There are a variety of over-the-counter (OTC) products to treat cold and flu symptoms. Hy-Vee pharmacy manager Angie Danielson in Davenport, Iowa, recommends the following. GENERAL PAIN RELIEF, INCLUDING HEADACHES: Medications include aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Brand names include Bayer, Motrin and Tylenol. Check with your pharmacist about which is right for you. SNEEZING AND RUNNY NOSE: Antihistamines containing diphenhydramine, promethazine and bromodiphenhydramine may help relieve allergic reactions and cold symptoms. NASAL CONGESTION: Reduce swelling in nasal passages and clear congestion with decongestants such as Sudafed. Look for such active ingredients as ephedrine, phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. COUGH: Products containing guaifenesin and dextromethorphan, Mucinex DM, act directly on the brain's \"cough center\" to help relieve coughing and ease throat irritation. Take extra care with dosage of over-the- counter medications, especially for children who are under 2 years of age. Follow the recommended dosage and don't give children medicine intended for adults. If you aren't seeing an improvement after several days, call a doctor.NATURE'S OPTIONS Natural remedies are also an option. Angie says Airborne, which acts as an immune booster, contains vitamins A, C and E, plus zinc and other minerals. The supplement supports the function of immune cells throughout your body. If you have a cough, honey or cough syrups containing honey can soothe your throat. ADDITIONAL PHARMACY SERVICES DRUG INTERACTIONS. Before taking new medications talk to your local Hy-Vee pharmacist about all other medications and herbal supplements you are already taking to avoid drug interactions. EXPRESS REFILLS ONLINE. Getting refills and checking on or transferring prescriptions online is easy. No account login is required, but if you have multiple prescriptions, creating a My Hy-Vee prescription account will save you time. AUTOMATIC REPEAT REFILLS. Get your prescriptions refilled ahead of time and receive a call when your order is ready to be picked up. Your maintenance or repeat medications will be refilled automatically for you so you never have to worry about running out of medication. Ask a pharmacist about Hy-Vee Repeat Refills.

THE SHOT PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR THE ENTIRE FLU SEASON, SO GET IT EARLY. It's a myth that you can get the flu from a flu shot, Hy-Vee pharmacy manager Angie Danielson says. \"The shot contains an inactive virus that is not infectious.\" However, there is still a chance you can get the flu, even if you receive the shot. \"The shot you get covers the types of flu that were predicted for the season,\" she says. \"If the virus mutates and another virus is introduced, you can still get influenza after being vaccinated.\" Shots are available every day at Hy-Vee during pharmacy hours. No appointment is necessary. The price can vary, but it is $30 at most locations for the regular shot and $50 for the high-dose shot needed by those age 65 or older and some others. The cost is often covered by insurance. While Angie recommends flu shots for everyone, she says those who are most at risk are children ages 6 months to 18 years, women who are pregnant, anyone over 65 years old and people suffering from asthma, diabetes or lung disease. The bottom line is, even if you're healthy, you can still contract the flu and infect others. Protect yourself and your family from unnecessary sickness. Get a flu shot. Flu shots won't start protecting you against the virus until about two weeks after you've had one, so get the vaccination early, says Ben Mundt, Hy-Vee pharmacist in Ankeny, Iowa. With a vaccination, you are about 60 percent less likely to need a doctor's treatment for fl u this season. 070-075 Soultions_Ad_Space2.indd 73 8/27/14 11:26 AM\u00a92014 Schwan's Consumer Brands, Inc.
