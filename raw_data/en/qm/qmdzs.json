The University of Maryland School of Medicine, as one of the leading medical schools and research institutions in the nation, is the fertile ground on which the University of Maryland Medical System has grown into a network of clinical leadership. When we say All for One, we include our educational mission, our basic science laboratories, our multidisciplinary collaborations and our advances in clinical technology \u2014 all to provide the best care for each patient and foster healthier communities in Maryland and around the world. ALL for ONEASHARED VISION E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine UMMS/SOM 20 15 Nationwide, medical schools and health systems face increasing fiscal challenges. The entire coun-try \u2014 Maryland in particular \u2014 has embarked on a new approach to delivering and paying for health care. Population health is an important facet of national health care reform, meeting the needs of a community and finding the best way to pay for it. Maryland hospitals have a unique arrangement with both the federal and state governments, in which hospitals' revenue growth is capped. This provides incentive to actively manage each patient's care outside the hospital walls, improve quality and partner with communities to reduce acute care hospital utilization. HIGH-VALUE HEALTH CARE The partnership between the School of Medicine and Medical System plays a critical role in sustaining and improving the health and well-being of our communities in Maryland, as well as around the world in countries where our faculty extend their research and patient care. We share a common mission to teach future health care practitioners, to conduct innovative research, and to provide a full range of health care services to diverse patient populations across the region. MEDICAL SYSTEM GROWTH UMMS comprises 12 member hospitals whose affiliated physicians and care teams are dedicated to delivering world-class care. UMMS member hospitals employ nearly 24,000 people. The Medical System has a combined total of 2,405 licensed beds and recorded 115,049 patient admissions in Fiscal 2015, along with 395,583 emergency visits and 1.5 million outpatient visits. Our strategic growth will offer greater value to patients. In September 2014, UMMS entered into a clinical affiliation with CVS Health to increase patient access to high- quality, affordable care and improve medication adherence. In May 2015, UMMS entered into an agreement to acquire Riverside Health Inc., a Medicare and Medicaid managed care organization with 25,000 enrollees statewide. A RESOURCE TO THE REGIONPhysicians across the region rely on our flagship academic medical center, the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), to refer their patients for specialized care. This year, our own patient-transfer service, Maryland ExpressCare, recorded 11,884 referrals for urgent patient transfers from community hospitals. UMMC is a hospital of choice throughout the Mid-Atlantic for its expertise in the delivery of time- sensitive critical care. In June, UMMC cut the ribbon on the new Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, part of the University of Maryland Children's Hospital (UMCH). The UMCH last year treated a total of 42,000 children, from newborns to young adults, through hospital and outpatient services. UMMS also is increasing the capacity and accessibility of non-hospital-based medical care in communities across Maryland. Our faculty physicians provide compassionate, world-class care at more than 30 different locations throughout the state. A SCHOOL ON THE RISE The UM School of Medicine, founded in 1807, has more than 3,000 faculty members dedicated to training the next generation of physicians, research scientists and allied health professionals. As the health care environment changes and the need for discovery-based medicine intensifies, the SOM continues to rise as one of the pre-eminent biomedical research institutions in the nation, and as an expanding leader in clinical care. In FY 2015, the School advanced two major capital projects that will place its medical and research facilities as among the most advanced in the nation and the world: the topping out of the new $305 million, 450,000 square-foot research building, and the near completion of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. In research, the School contin- ued to rebound in total grants and contracts, despite federal and state budget cuts. Significantly, grants and contracts increased for the second year in a row. This exemplifies how undaunted our faculty are in the face of new challenges. Overall, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, we are now ranked 8th among all public medical schools and 23rd among all 144 public and private medical schools nationwide in research grant and contract expenditures. SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE Several UMMS hospitals have continuously earned national safety and quality awards from organizations such as the Delmarva Foundation, the Joint Commission, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the Maryland Patient Safety Center. Our system-wide safety initiatives are built on collaboration among clinicians practicing across the system and an advanced information technology platform that supports clinical decision-making and secure sharing of data. INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE Working together, we identify where physician and health care professional shortages exist and work with the community and our hospital partners on solutions. Residents throughout Maryland now have more access than ever to our world-renowned transplant specialists, neurosurgeons, cardiolo-gists and pediatricians. The University of Maryland Cancer Network provides access to cancer services and clinical trials across the region. Despite the fiscal challenges faced by the health care industry nationwide, we continue to demonstrate strong finan-cial performance through responsible stewardship across our organizations. In relentless pursuit of excellence, we remain sincerely yours, The University of Maryland School of Medicine and Medical System are facing the challenges in health care, biomedical research and education with a shared belief in innovation, discovery-based medicine and high-value health care. The desire to deliver the best possible outcomes for our patients drives our faculty and staff, who work to meet the needs of Marylanders while developing a global model of an integrated health system and medical school. Together, we create innovative programs in clinical and academic medicine and biomedical research. Robert A. Chrencik, MBA, CPA President and Chief Executive Officer University of Maryland Medical SystemOur two organizations form a partnership that enhances the work that each of us does. Our faculty and staff work together, side by side or in a sequence, with an ALL for ONE mindset to benefit all of Maryland and, more than ever, the world. The prominent role that faculty and hospital staff played in the Ebola outbreaks of 2014/2015 and the effort to develop a vaccine to protect the world from this deadly disease exemplify our global impact. 2 5 ASHARED VISION In the pages ahead, you can read stories about our teams working All for One \u2014 whether it's one patient in distress, one community facing challenges, or one world fighting a deadly disease outbreak. These highlights demonstrate our bold and strategic advancement of discovery-based medicine and high-value health care \u2014 not just in Maryland, but across the nation and throughout the world. 3 Medical System Board of Directors Stephen A.

When one pregnant and very sick young mother arrived with a complex and life-threatening condition, it took an all-out effort to deliver her \u2014 and the baby \u2014 from danger. To read about it, turn the page.ALL for ONE20 15 More than 50 staff from several specialties who went all out for one mother and her baby included, from left to right: Garrett Fitzgerald, MD; Diana Vaughan, LCSW-C; Catherine MD; and Nirav Shah, MD. 7 \"The way I see it is, in Ivory Coast, I would have died because we don't have that level of care over there. I'm lucky to be here and to have my daughter and son and to have access to that care. I'm really sick, but I'm really happy to be in this position.\" - Tinan Doualou KouameDELIVERED from DANGERUMMS/SOM 20 15 8 11Transatlantic flights are the norm for Tinan Doualou Kouame, 36, who splits her time between Maryland and Africa's Ivory Coast, where her husband and 8-year-old son live. Early this spring, on a flight to Maryland, she became so short of breath she needed the crew to provide oxygen. She was scared. And she was 29 weeks pregnant. Mrs. Doualou was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) at the University of Maryland Medical Center. The right side of her heart was failing. She couldn't get enough blood flow through her lungs to provide enough oxygen for her body and her baby. Every breath was a struggle. What she had always thought was asthma turned out to be an underlying lung disease that caused pulmonary hypertension \u2014 a serious condition with often deadly consequences for pregnant women. A team of special- ists from every corner of the hospital came together to save her life and deliver her baby daughter. Coordinating all of her care were intensivists \u2014 physicians who specialize in critical care medicine \u2014 led by Jeffrey Hasday, MD. \"Blood volume and oxygen requirements change a lot during pregnancy and even more so during labor. Women with pulmonary hypertension are often counseled not to become pregnant because the risk of death is so high,\" said Dr. Hasday. \"This case shows not only how deep we are in expertise, but how well we work together here,\" Dr. Hasday said. The only way to save Mrs. Doualou's life was to deliver her baby early at 32 weeks. Obstetricians transformed Mrs. Doualou's MICU room into a labor and delivery suite. The MICU staff and neonatology staff, led by Hyung Woo, MD, turned the room next door into a neonatal ICU. Obstetric anesthe- siologist Shobana Bharadwaj, MBBS, and nurses from labor and delivery arrived to assist. Teams from cardiology and from pulmonary and critical care medicine supported Mrs. Doualou's lung and heart function throughout the delivery. And social worker Catherine Miller, LCSW-C, had managed to get Mrs. Doualou's husband, Fernando Kouame, a visa in just one day, so he could be present for the birth. \"Mrs. Doualou's care really did take a village, and was a completely collaborative approach,\" said cardiologist Stacy Fisher, MD. \"It was wonderful to work with such a phenomenal group.\" At 11 pm, on March 11, Lauren Kouame was born at 3.4 pounds, delivered by obstetricians with a subspecialty in high-risk pregnancy and births. The obstetrics team was led by Ozhan Turan, MD, PhD, and included maternal-fetal medicine fellows Dana Block-Abraham, DO; Sarah Crimmins, DO; and Garrett Fitzgerald, MD. She had no complications and left the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit after four weeks, with additional post-acute care at Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital, part of the University of Maryland Medical System. THE ALL-OUT EFFORT FOR MRS.

The UM School of Medicine and the UM Medical Center deployed their experts: infectious disease specialists with a potential vaccine; virologists who have studied Ebola for decades; trained hospital teams here and an international expert who flew to Africa to care for the sick. The UM SOM joined an unprecedented global consortium assembled by the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health to accelerate testing of a new Ebola vaccine candidate. Myron M. Levine, MD, DTPH, one of the pre-eminent infectious disease scientists in the world, has devoted more than 40 years to the development of vaccines for diseases such as Ebola, malaria and cholera. Dr. Levine mobilized the UM SOM's Center for Vaccine Development, with Kirsten E. Lyke, MD, in Baltimore and Samba O. Sow, MD, MS, and Milagritos Tapia, MD, in Mali, one of the West African countries affected by the outbreak. They administered the experimental vaccine to health care workers who volunteered to participate in the first clinical trials. Alan L. Schmaljohn, PhD, has studied the Ebola virus for more than 20 years and was a lead researcher in the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. He and other UM SOM scientists were regularly in the news explaining the virus and how a further spread could be contained. As a world leader in critical care, UMMC was designated by federal and state agencies as one of three hospitals in Maryland prepared to receive patients under evaluation for or diagnosed with Ebola. While UMMC remains in a constant state of readiness for emerging public health threats, a disease such as Ebola required the diligence and training of a large interdisciplinary work group. Specialists in a myriad of functions worked around the clock for weeks refining protocols for triage, isolation and treatment scenarios, policies, operational response, staff training, facility preparedness, continuity of operations, waste disposal, and a host of other patient care services. Training and preparedness drills ensured continual refinement. Whether preparing for a potential patient, or actually caring for patients under evaluation for Ebola, the team performed with unparalleled professionalism and compassion. Clinicians and facilities staff at UMMC sprang into action to equip a special two-room Biocontainment Unit, managed by nurse leaders Christina Cafeo, DNP, RN, and Theresa DiNardo, MSN, RN, CCRN. Michael Abraham, MD, and other emergency staff were trained to evaluate patients in the ER with symptoms or travel history that could mean they were exposed to the virus. The unit continues to be ready, whether for Ebola or another highly contagious virus. FACULTY AND UMMC STAFF INVOLVED WITH THE UMMC EBOLA RESPONSE INCLUDED: Michael K. Abraham, MD, clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine Christina Cafeo, DNP, RN, director of nursing and patient care services at UMMCTheresa DiNardo, MSN, RN, CCRN, nurse manager of the Biocontainment UnitAnthony Harris, MD, MPH, professor of epidemiology and public healthSurbhi Leekha, MBBS, MPH, assistant professor of epidemiology and public health, and UMMC medical director for hospital epidemiology and infection preventionMichael Anne Preas, RN, BSN, CIC, director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at UMMCCraig R. Savageau, MS, emergency management coordinator for UMMC and clinical instructor in the Department of Emergency Medicine, UM School of MedicineLewis Rubinson, MD, PhD, is an international expert in disaster management. He was among several intensivists selected by the World Health Organization to fly to Sierra Leone to care for those stricken with Ebola. At the time, very few clinicians were willing to travel to Africa to assist. While there, he pro-vided direct care to hundreds of people with Ebola at Kenema Government Hospital. Alan Schmaljohn, PhD 11 The BEST SHOT for Successful Kidney Transplants UMMS/SOM 20 15 Matthew Weir, MD, and Terry Watnick, MD 12 15 Close collaboration between top physicians across the departments of Medicine and Surgery has positioned the University of Maryland Medical Center as a leader in the treatment of kidney disease \u2014 particularly in the management of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) \u2014 before and after transplantation. PKD is the most commonly inherited kidney disease, and is marked by the development of clusters of cysts. As the cysts accumulate fluid, the diseased organs grow as large as 20 pounds each, causing complica-tions such as high blood pressure and difficulty breathing. The enlarged and diseased organs interfere with the patient's quality of life. After many years, the cysts displace normal tissue, causing the kidneys to stop working, and signaling time for a transplant. While most hospitals are performing kidney transplant surgery in PKD patients in two separate procedures, the UM Division of Transplantation is one of only a handful of centers in the country that will remove both dysfunctional kidneys and replace them with a kidney from a living donor in one operation, resulting in a shorter recovery time and more positive patient experience. Terry Watnick, MD, has helped keep UMMC's transplant efforts at the forefront through the Baltimore Polycystic Kidney Disease Research and Clinical Core Center. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, this Center of Excellence was created to research PKD and implement a system to better understand why so many people are affected. Working with their kidney transplant surgeon colleagues, the team is able to effectively care for patients prior to the development of kidney failure and keep them in good health before the time of transplant. The team approach requires collaboration among specialists in the Department of Medicine, led by Stephen N. Davis, MBBS, and the Department of Surgery, led by Stephen T. Bartlett, MD. The success of the transplant surgery relies on highly trained surgeons and, just as importantly, the specialists in medicine who manage the patients long-term, giving them the best shot for a great outcome. This teamwork for the benefit of the patient, backed by research colleagues, make UMMC a leader in PKD and kidney disease treatment worldwide. FACULTY WHO FOCUS ON KIDNEY DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: Stephen T. Bartlett, MD, the Peter Angelos Distinguished Professor of Surgery and chairman of the Department of Surgery, and executive vice president and surgeon-in-chief for UMMSJonathan Bromberg, MD, PhD, professor of surgery, head of the Division of TransplantationStephen N. Davis, MBBS, the Dr. Theodore E. Woodward Endowed Chair and professor in the Department of Medicine and physician-in-chief at UMMCDavid B. Leeser, MD, associate professor of surgery and head of kidney and pancreas transplantation in the Division of TransplantationTerry Watnick, MD, associate professor of medicine, director of the Baltimore Polycystic Kidney Disease Research and Clinical Core CenterMatthew Weir, MD, professor of medicine, head of the Division of NephrologyWhen former Pittsburgh Steeler Chris Kemoeatu needed a kidney transplant, he found his gift in his brother and former Baltimore Raven Ma'ake Kemoeatu. Chris' search for care led him to Matthew Weir, MD. Dr. Weir helped Chris avoid dialysis as long as possible and worked with the transplant team to prepare him for surgery. When Chris learned his brother was a match, the team at UMMC made it happen, and both were out of the hospital and on the road to recovery within days \u2014 even landing an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. When all was said and done, 70 patients \u2014 35 donors and 35 recipients, including four at UMMC \u2014 participated in the longest paired kidney exchange chain in history, made possible by the National Kidney Registry. UMMC's participation in paired exchange opens a wider range of options to patients to secure the best match possible. Included in the chain were a brother and sister from Maryland. Eastern Shore resident LaTwanya Goslee donated a kidney to a stranger, while her brother, Charles Muse of Baltimore, received a donation from a stranger who matched him. Prior to surgery at UMMC, Ms. Goslee received pre- and post-operative evaluation and care at University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton. 13 LUNG RESCUE and HEALING UMMS/SOM 20 15 \"We worked to bring the Hemolung to the Medical Center on an emergency basis. UMMC is only the second hospital in the US to use the device.\" - Si M. Pham, MDRaymond Rector, CCP, LP 14 17Aldo T. Iacono, MD, is the first Hamish S. and Christine C. Osborne Professor in Advanced Pulmonary Care. The Osbornes are among the founding supporters of the Program in Lung Healing. Mr. Osborne received a life-saving double-lung transplant at UMMC. Other founding philanthropic gifts have been provided by the Grayce B. Kerr Fund and an anonymous donor. LUNG RESCUE and HEALING The University of Maryland School of Medicine launched the innovative Program in Lung Healing this year to provide a gateway for research, education and treatment for the growing number of patients with ailments of the respiratory system. Bartley P. Griffith, MD, one of the leading surgeons in the nation for heart and lung transplantation, aortic diseases and pulmonary thromboendarectomy, is executive director of the program. Aldo T. Iacono, MD, is the director of outreach and consultative services. The program integrates physicians from several departments, with leadership from Stephen N. Davis, MBBS, chair of the Department of Medicine; Stephen T. Bartlett, MD, chair of the Department of Surgery; and Thomas M. Scalea, MD, Si M. Pham, MD, and Jay Menaker, MD, of the Program in Trauma's Critical Care Division. The Program in Lung Healing directly translates to patient care through the innovative Lung Rescue Unit (LRU) at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). The LRU is a collaboration between faculty in Medicine and Surgery, and in the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, where staff excel at the advanced critical care of patients with severe lung disease. Dr. Menaker and Dr. Pham are the medical directors of the unit. Theresa DiNardo, MSN, RN, CCRN, nurse manager, and Karen Doyle, MBA, MS, RN, vice president for nursing and operations at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, are the nursing and patient care leaders for the unit and the Program in Lung Healing. \"Through enhanced clinical care and integrated training and research activities, the UM SOM Program in Lung Healing will save lives, generate important new knowledge, and produce the next generation of superbly trained lung and critical care physicians and scientists,\" said Dr. Davis, physician-in-chief at UMMC. Just days after the formal launch of the Program in Lung Healing, a Maryland man was transferred to the Lung Rescue Unit with an infection on top of his already advanced hereditary lung disease. The LRU turned to an investigational respiratory dialysis machine that pumps blood from the body through a cannula in the neck, removes the carbon dioxide, then returns the processed blood. After a day on the Hemolung, the patient was taken off the ventilator, and once his lungs recovered enough to breathe on their own, the Hemolung was removed altogether. KEY TO THE PROGRAM IN LUNG HEALING AND THE LUNG RESCUE UNIT: Stephen T.

Richard Alexander, MD, Martin Edelman, MD, Minesh Mehta, MBChB, and Joseph Friedberg, MD 16 19 A team of experts has formed this year around one mission: To provide the best care available in the world, now and in the future, for patients with mesothelioma and other thoracic malignancies. The new University of Maryland School of Medicine Mesothelioma and Thoracic Oncology Treatment and Research Center was established in early 2015 in connection with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center to provide personalized, cutting-edge treatment to patients with lung cancer, mesothelioma and other cancers of the chest. Providing the best care in the world is a bold mission, and the UM SOM Mesothelioma and Thoracic Oncology Treatment and Research Center is positioned to deliver. The Center's director is Joseph S. Friedberg, MD, a renowned thoracic surgeon and expert in mesothelioma and other thoracic cancers. Soon after he was recruited, he assembled a talented clinical team whose combined expertise crosses all modalities of cancer treatment throughout the entire University of Maryland Medical System: medical, surgical and radiation oncology; pulmonary medicine; pathology; occupational and environmental health; integrative medicine and palliative medicine. The team meets twice a week to evaluate patient profiles, discuss treatment plans and examine innovative treatments that could benefit each patient. They ensure that care is optimally coordinated and patients have access to the latest proven treatments and clinical trials within a supportive environment. Equally important to providing superior cancer treatment is furthering knowledge and developing innovative treatment options. The Center promotes basic science, translational and clinical research, and facilitates collaboration with like-minded researchers around the world.

Cullen, MD, director of the Cancer Center. \"The addition of the UM SOM Mesothelioma and Thoracic Oncology Treatment and Research Center is a tremendous boon for patients in Maryland and beyond who are diagnosed with mesothelioma or any cancer of the chest.\" 17 Physicians and nurses from medical and surgical oncologyAn ALL-OUT EFFORT for ISAIAH \"I'm not supposed to play contact sports for now, but I love throwing the football with my friends. We do that every day. I ride my bike a lot. And I can swim.\" - Isaiah CannonUMMS/SOM 20 15 John Cannon Sr. and Marcy Cannon with son Isaiah 18 21 A seemingly minor scrape on Isaiah Cannon's knee while he was playing football silently unleashed deadly bacteria. By the time he got to the UM Children's Hospital (UMCH) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, the staff prepared his family for the worst. And then everyone \u2014 including Isaiah and his family \u2014 gave it their best. His knee wound had healed normally, but he later developed a fever and achiness. His parents, Marcy and John Cannon Sr., took him to an urgent care clinic that diagnosed the flu \u2014 twice. His big brother, John Cannon Jr., an EMT and firefighter for Baltimore and Harford counties, stopped by the house, took one look at Isaiah, and called an ambulance. At University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, doctors stabilized him for transfer. He was flown to UMCH, as his condition began to rapidly decline. He went into cardiac arrest within the first hour after arriving. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria had seeped into his blood, bones and organs. Pediatric critical care specialists were working around the clock to preserve his organ function with extra- corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), dialysis and other intensive care. Isaiah's core medical team included eight pediatric critical care physicians, a pediatric heart surgeon, and a pediatric nephrologist, perfusionists, and dedicated nurses who administered expert care at his bedside around the clock. They saved his life, but poor circulation from his ailing heart turned his toes black. Doctors were able to save one leg, but had to amputate his right leg below the knee. \"Isaiah's case was an extremely complex one that required expertise from all the UMCH doctors and nurses,\" said Adnan Bhutta, MBBS, FAAP. \"But this is what we excel at \u2014 treating patients whom other physicians refer to us and working as a coordinated team to manage every aspect of these sick kids' care. We treat them as if they were our own.\" After 59 days in the PICU, Isaiah was transferred to the University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute to continue his recovery. He walks on his own, rides his bike, swims and throws a football as well as he ever did. \"Nothing seems to stop him now,\" his mother said. An ALL-OUT EFFORT for ISAIAHIsaiah Cannon's care exemplifies how the University of Maryland Medical System provides a complete continuum of care. At his community hospital, UM Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Timothy Chizmar, MD, FACEP, Carla Janson, MD, and Heather Morrison, BSN, RN, quickly assessed him and arranged for quick transport to the system's flagship \u2014 UM Medical Center. Once he was out of danger, it was a smooth transition to UM Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute, where his team included Rachel Dorsey, OTR/L, and Heather Mascetti, PT, DPT.

The Center for Innovative Biomedical Resources (CIBR), directed by Nicholas Ambulos, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, is the organizational framework for the School of Medicine's biomedical core resources. The now-consolidated core labs have carried out experiments for nearly every program in the UM School of Medicine, offering state-of-the-art technologies and expertise to UM researchers. A $7.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health funded the renovation of nearly 30,000 square feet of space in the Bressler Research Building. The new space allows for the physical consolidation of many core facilities in a common space, creating a dynamic environment that promotes high-impact research and the flow of information across disciplines. This open approach provides the broadest array of core services and optimizes efficiency to support a successful biomedical research environment. Another important shared resource at the UM SOM is the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank (UMBTB), overseen by Ron Zielke, PhD, professor of pediatrics. The UMBTB collects high-quality post-mortem brain tissue, which is distributed to three NIH institutes to advance research of developmental and neurological disorders. The emotional and physical well-being of those involved in the donation process is of the utmost importance, and every effort is made to fully realize the hopes of all generous donors and their families. Concurrent with strides for the equitable distribution of tissue, special respect is paid to each specific case, furthering research into improved treatments and possible cures for the disorder of the donor. Representing one area of special interest, the UMBTB has collected tissue from donors affected with autism since 1993 and is the only facility that has this type of tissue available for distribution to researchers around the world. Thanks to a 2014 NIH grant that enabled the purchase of a liquid nitrogen freezer, the UMBTB is able to carefully store and closely monitor samples to meet the needs of the research community. As a result of this unique resource, more than 100 autism researchers worldwide have received tissue from the UMBTB, resulting in 145 published papers. Nicholas Ambulos, PhD, leads the CIBR, which serves nearly every program in the UM School of Medicine. The CIBR specializes in eight core categories: structural biology, clinical resources, nucleic acid and genomics, animal model resources, imaging technologies, drug-development resources, cytometric and bioassay, and bio- informatics and statistics. KEY TO THE CORE LABS: Nicholas Ambulos, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, and director, Biopolymer Core FacilityRon Zielke, PhD, professor of pediatrics and head of the Division of Pediatric ResearchNicholas Ambulos, PhD 21 TEAM EFFORT in SPORTS MEDICINEUMMS/SOM 20 15 Standing: Andrew Pollak, MD, and Valerie Cothran, MD In front: Yvette Rooks, MD, and David Stewart, MD Craig Bennett, MD \"We have an outstanding team of sports medicine physicians, in the departments of orthopaedics and family medicine, who work with the student-athletes at the University of Maryland, College Park.\" - David Stewart, MD 22 25 Athletes \u2014 from the Terrapins basketball team to the weekend warriors out for fun and fitness \u2014 all have two things in common: They want to perform at their peak, and they sometimes get hurt. With the increasing need for understanding and treating the spectrum of athletic injuries, the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UM SOM) has teamed up with the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) to create a new center to study athletic performance and health. The Center for Sports Medicine, Health and Human Performance brings together a team of expert faculty from two universities, complementing one another's expertise to give Marylanders of all fitness levels a world-class resource. The new center will enable faculty from the UM SOM to treat sports-related injuries in UMCP student-athletes, other students and the general public. UM SOM faculty include those from the departments of Orthopaedics, Family and Community Medicine, Anesthesiology, and Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science. The Department of Family and Community Medicine's sports-medicine certified members train primary care practitioners \u2014 including pediatricians, internists and emergency medicine physicians \u2014 to diagnose and treat many injuries that don't require surgery. Research at the new center will focus on areas includ- ing concussion, traumatic brain injury, muscle-brain physiology and biochemistry, exoskeleton-robotic treatments and clinical and medical biomechanics. Under the leadership of Andrew N. Pollak, MD, the Department of Orthopaedics at the UM SOM is collaborating with the UM School of Public Health's Department of Kinesiology and the A. James Clark School of Engineering's Fischell Department of Bioengineering on projects to prevent and treat athletic injuries of all types. The research could lead to applications for athletes, the military and first responders. The Center builds on the UM SOM's research, academic and clinical leadership in the field of orthopaedics and sports medicine. UM SOM physicians already serve as the official team physicians for all UMCP teams. \"This new center leverages our broad expertise in sports medicine, orthopaedics and clinical care,\" said David L. Stewart, MD, chair of Family and Community Medicine. FACULTY IN THE CENTER FOR SPORTS MEDICINE INCLUDE: Craig Bennett, MD, assistant professor of orthopaedics, team orthopaedic surgeon for the University of Maryland Terrapins Valerie Cothran, MD, assistant professor of family and community medicineAlan I. Faden, MD, the David S. Brown Professor in Trauma and director of the Center for Shock, Trauma and Anesthesiology ResearchAndrew N.

Rooks, MD, assistant professor, vice chair and director of residency training in the Department of Family and Community MedicineDavid L. Stewart, MD, associate professor and chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND REHABILITATION NETWORK With more than 20 locations throughout Maryland, the UM Rehabilitation Network offers a full range of physical rehabilitation services to help people recover from illness or injury, such as stroke, joint replacement or traumatic injury. The Network brings together expert teams at facilities within the University of Maryland Medical System, in the Baltimore metro area, the Eastern Shore, Southern Maryland and Harford County. The patient-centered approach tailors therapy to the individual's needs. Patients have access to specialized rehabilitation programs, such as balance therapy, aquatic therapy, amputee walking clinics, speech therapy and hand therapy. There also are programs to benefit patients with neurological conditions, including ALS, aphasia, balance disorders and spinal cord injuries. The UM Charles Regional Rehabilitation Center opened in La Plata, Md., in March 2015, offering sports and orthopaedic rehabilitation services in an outpatient setting. More than 1,000 patients had come to the center in the first two months after it opened. At UM Upper Chesapeake Medical Center and UM Shore Regional Health, patients with Parkinson's disease and other move-ment disorders participate in the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Big and Loud Program. Therapists work with patients on \"big\" movements to help with walking, balance, writing and other activities of daily living, while speech pathologists help the patient improve voice and overall verbal communication. At UM Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute, some patients with spinal cord injuries are now able to use a robotic exoskeleton to stand and walk during therapy sessions. 22 23 UMMS/SOM 20 15 COMMITMENT to a HEALTHIER COMMUNITY 24 27 UMMC, one of the largest employers in Baltimore, employs thousands of city residents. The Medical System and all member hospitals partner with community organizations to build, train and support a strong workforce. Job training is offered to city residents who face challenges such as homelessness and extended unemployment, and more than 35 city residents in this program were hired this year after successfully completing training. Kelsey Good came to UMMC for career training and was later hired full time as a technician sterilizing and preparing instruments for surgery. Youth career programs served more than 400 in FY2015, including summer jobs for 102 students. The University of Maryland Medical System and University of Maryland School of Medicine maintain a deep commitment to Baltimore, the city where each is based. This commitment includes training those who want jobs \u2014 and employing them; educating the commu-nity; preparing the doctors of the future; studying the psychosocial factors that affect health; and anchoring Baltimore's West Side. The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), and its second location, UMMC Midtown Campus, participate in more than 65 health fairs throughout the year, providing free health screenings to check blood pressure, cholesterol, HIV, and body mass index along with risk assessments for vascular disease, stroke, diabetes and glaucoma. In Pediatrics, the Division of Growth and Nutrition, led by Maureen Black, PhD, is currently involved in several studies, including trials to prevent obesity among toddlers and adolescents, follow children prenatally exposed to illegal drugs, and monitor the growth and development of young children as a Children's HealthWatch site. The Center for Injury Prevention and Policy at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center seeks to re-duce the incidence of injuries from preventable causes. Mary Beth Bollinger, DO, leads the Breathmobile, a custom-built pediatric asthma clinic that travels to schools to deliver long-term, reli-able asthma care. UMMC also delivers health education, information and screening to people where they live via a community health van. The program includes a hospital-based intervention program and an initiative to combat domestic violence. Safe Kids \u2014 a program run through Women's and Children's Health \u2014 focuses on preventing unintentional injuries to children. The Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) project, led by Howard Dubowitz, MBChB, FAAP, trains health care providers to identify and address psychosocial problems, such as parental depression, substance abuse and domestic violence, that can endanger children. A new diabetes prevention program at UMMC's two campuses works with people at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Another program, funded by a grant from the Baltimore City Health Department, identifies African-American men who need to control their high blood pressure, and provides healthy grocery store tours and cooking instruction, as well as free gym memberships to help these men improve their health. The Center for School Mental Health, directed by Sharon Stephan, PhD, and Nancy Lever, PhD, serves children and families through a shared family-school-community agenda. Students in the UM SOM Master of Public Health program, led by Diane Marie St. George, PhD, are placed in positions with the Baltimore City Health De-partment, Health Enterprise Zones, federal agencies and other organizations to prepare them for leader-ship roles in public health.

With an All for One approach to our collective goals, we are venturing toward new challenges on both local and global levels. Here are a few highlights and milestones that inspire us to continue. 27 Partners in Success Collaboration between biomedical research investigators has become increasingly important as the pool of public \u2014 and private \u2014 funding for research has declined. Interdisciplinary research teams that blend clinical and basic science have significant advantages when applying for large federal grants. One of the key priorities for the School of Medicine has been fostering joint projects among the diverse groups of research- ers at the School and across the University System of Maryland. The Dean's Challenge Award provided seed money to four of these projects, with the added bonus that many of the runners-up were able to find alter- native funding to get their projects off the ground as well. The UMB-UMBC and UMB-UMCP Seed Grant competi- tions have enhanced and promoted long-term partnerships between faculty at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP), netting a return on investment in the form of successful NIH grant applications. New Tick-Borne Illness Discovered J. Stephen Dumler, MD, professor of pathology, along with colleagues in China, uncovered a previously un- known disease transmitted by ticks. It's possible that the disease could be a substantial health threat to humans and animals in areas where the carrier tick is common, the authors theorized in their paper, since this is an entirely new species of bacteria that has not been seen in humans before. A Probiotic with the Power to Influence Others Claire Fraser, PhD, professor of medi- cine and director of the Institute for Genome Sciences, and her collabora- tors found that one type of probiotic \u2014 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, often known as LGG \u2014 may modify the way other organisms work in the gut, potentially reducing inflammation, which has been linked to cancer and chronic diseases such as diabetes. MERS Treatment May Be Within Reach Matthew Frieman, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immu-nology, in partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., led a team that discovered and validated two thera- peutics that show early promise in preventing and treating Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which can cause severe respiratory symp-toms, and has a death rate of 40 per- cent. These therapeutics are the first to succeed in protecting and treating animal models of the MERS virus. Newly Discovered Pathway Links the Brain to High Blood Pressure John Hamlyn, PhD, professor of physi- ology, and Mordecai Blaustein, MD, professor of physiology and medicine, were among the researchers who found a new link between the brain and increased blood pressure, namely SOM HIGHLIGHTS research a little-known steroid called ouabain (pronounced WAH-bane). Ouabain was discovered in human blood more than 20 years ago by Dr. Hamlyn and Dr. Blaustein, along with scientists at the Upjohn Company. The new study is the first to identify the particular pathway that connects the brain to ouabain's effects on proteins that regulate arterial calcium and contrac- tion. Through this mechanism, oua- bain makes arteries more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation, and as a result the enhanced artery constric- tion promotes chronic hypertension. Hearts Beating in Perfect Time The average heart beats 35 million times a year \u2014 2.5 billion times over a lifetime. Those beats must be pre- cisely calibrated; even a small diver- gence from the metronomic rhythm can cause sudden death. W. Jonathan Lederer, MD, PhD, professor of physi-ology and director of the Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technolo- gy (BioMet), and his colleagues at the Cardiovascular Research Institute of Vermont, found that myosin-binding protein C (C protein) allows the muscle fibers in the heart to work in perfect synchrony. This is the first time the mechanism has been de- scribed; the discovery could eventual- ly help scientists treat heart problems that kill millions of people every year. J. Stephen Dumler, MD Claire Fraser, PhD John Hamlyn, PhD Mordecai Blaustein, MD W. Jonathan Lederer, MD, PhD Thomas MacVittie, PhD Matthew Frieman, PhDUMMS/SOM 20 15 28 31 Radiation Sickness Treatment Neupogen (filgrastim), a chemotherapy drug, was proven effective for the treat- ment of acute radiation injury in research done by Thomas MacVittie, PhD, professor of radiation oncology, and Ann Farese, MA, MS, assistant professor of radiation oncol- ogy. This led the US Food and Drug Ad-ministration to approve the use of the drug to treat the deleterious effects of radiation exposure following a nuclear incident. Brain 'Gender' May Be More Flexible Than We Think During prenatal development, the brains of most animals, including humans, develop specifically male or female characteristics that can be easily seen but are not well understood. Margaret McCarthy, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology, and her colleagues, studied how this differentiation might occur. They found that the process involves a group of enzymes known as DNA methyltransferas- es (DNMTs), which can control expression of genes that play a role in inflammation and immunity, as well as in the sexual differentiation of the brain. Innovative Transfusion Approach Proven Effective Thomas Scalea, MD, professor of surgery, director of the Program in Trauma, and physician-in-chief at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, oversaw a study comparing two different methods of blood transfusion in treating trauma patients. It found that one approach gave patients a significantly better chance of survival within the first 24 hours.Getting a Jump on High-Risk Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Mohummad Minhaj Siddiqui, MD, assistant professor of surgery, led a large-scale study that found targeted biopsy using a new fusion technology that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrasound is 30 percent more effective than standard biopsy in detecting high-risk prostate cancer. In addition, 17 percent fewer low-risk cancers were diagnosed with the new approach, compared to a standard biopsy. Possible Trigger Found for Common Eye Disease Richard Thompson, PhD, associate professor of biochemistry & molecular biology, along with a multidisciplinary international team, found that tiny lumps of calcium phosphate may be an important triggering factor for age- related macular degeneration (AMD), a degenerative eye disease that can cause severe vision loss and blindness. This is the first time these mineral deposits have been implicated in the disease, which affects more than 10 million Americans. Ann Farese, MA, MS Paul Welling, MDThomas Scalea, MDMaking Flu Less DeadlyThe influenza virus can be lethal to those who are infected. What is often just as dangerous is the body's own reaction to the virus. This immune response consists of an inflammatory attack, meant to kill the virus. But if it gets too aggressive, this coun- terattack can end up harming the body's own tissues, causing damage that can lead to death in vulnerable patients. Vladimir Toshchakov, PhD, assistant professor of microbiology & immunology, uncovered new details about how this response plays out. Furthermore, he identified a \"decoy\" molecule that can rein in this runaway inflammatory response. Study Unravels Why Common Blood Pressure Medicine Can Fail Paul Welling, MD, professor of physiology, and his post-doctoral fellow, P. Rick Grimm, PhD, found the specific genes and pathways used by the kidneys to compensate for activity by thiazides, a group of salt-lowering medicines used to treat high blood pressure. These drugs are usually very effective. However, in some patients they are not; in others they lower blood pressure for a while but then stop working. This study revealed a key mechanism of that failure, which Dr. Welling hopes will lead to the development of drugs that will prevent the body from counteracting thiazides. The researchers also identified a molecule that increases when the kidney is acting to counteract thiazides and are looking into how that might be used as a biomarker to allow doctors to quickly and easily detect when thiazides won't work or have stopped working.SOM HIGHLIGHTS Mohummad Minhaj Siddiqui, MD Richard Thompson, PhD Vladimir Toshchakov, PhD 29 Margaret McCarthy, PhDSOM HIGHLIGHTS Saving Millions from HIV The Institute of Human Virology (IHV), directed by Robert C.

UM REHABILITATION & ORTHOPAEDIC INSTITUTE 2200 KERNAN DRIVE, BALTIMORE, MD 21207 410-448-2500 www.umrehabortho.orgUMMS HIGHLIGHTS h he University of Maryland Re- habilitation & Orthopaedic Institute is Maryland's largest and most compre- hensive rehabilitation and orthopaedic specialty hospital. Founded nearly 120 years ago, the 141-bed hospital today provides highly specialized care to people recovering from stroke and neurological diseases as well as spinal cord, brain or other traumatic injury. UM Rehab & Ortho Institute is a leader in neurological conditions, sports med- icine, musculoskeletal disease, robotic technologies to improve movement, and research. As part of the University of Maryland Rehabilitation Network, the hospital is an integral component of the University of Maryland Medical System, and the 200-member medical staff includes faculty physicians at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Offering Specialized Technology In the last year, UM Rehab & Ortho Institute has been recognized for ad- vances in a number of program areas, including the use of state-of-the-art rehabilitation technology as a corner- stone of treatment for many patients, including those recovering from com- plex injuries or illnesses. In fact, the Institute is the only facility in Maryland to offer the ReWalk system, which works like a high-tech body suit allow - ing some individuals with spinal cord injury to stand and walk for the first time in years. The robotic exoskeleton system provides motorized assistance to help patients stand up and move their legs. Therapists work with pa- tients on basic skills, such as sitting and standing, before advancing to walking and more advanced techniques such as climbing up and down stairs. This year, researchers at UM Rehab & Ortho Institute concluded a 4-year, $1.4 million study assessing the use of the ReWalk and aquatic exercise for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. In addition to the ReWalk, the Insti- tute utilizes other advanced technolo-gies, such as the Vector Gait and Safety System, a robotic overhead trolley system that allows for overground gait training, and the Lokomat, a robotic treadmill system designed for patients recovering from spinal cord injuries, brain injury, amputation or stroke. Getting Patients \"Back to Living\" Complementary to the Institute's reha- bilitation services is the Adapted Sports Program, which offers instruction and competitive play in adapted golf, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby for individuals with physical limitations. This year, the Institute was selected by the US Paralympics as a Paralympic Sport Club. This designa- tion increases the hospital's ability to provide disabled athletes in Maryland and Pennsylvania with opportunities to learn about and compete in Para- lympic sports. As a result of this designation, the Institute hosted a free \"Gateway to Gold\" event to promote wheelchair rugby as a Paralympic sport. Gateway to Gold is a nationwide talent iden- tification and development program that introduces youth, adults and veterans with Paralympic-eligible im- pairments to Paralympic sports and leads them to the athlete pipeline for the US Paralympics Team. Other Adapted Sports Program highlights center around the Institute's wheelchair rugby team, the Maryland Mayhem. The team held its inaugural \"Maryland Crabpot Tournament,\" hosting teams from New York, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. It plans to host the two-day event annually for rivals all along the East Coast. Caring for the Caregivers In addition to providing the best care and services for its patients, the Institute is focused on the well-being of those families and caregivers who are supporting a recovering loved one. This year, the Institute broke ground on, completed and opened the Hackerman-Patz House, a home-away-from-home for patients' families, offering affordable lodging along with the supportive community environment of others facing similar situations.
