Fall Equinox is the day where we have equal hours of darkness to equal hours of light. We will explore Balance within ourselves, to see where more love and balance are wished. Where do you need more grounding with the Earth in your life? Where do you wish more flow of emotions with the Water Element? How can there be more passion in Fire Element? When do you need to sing and laugh with the Air Element? Awny and Josey will be offering Purifications with the Sound Bars for everyone that comes! Please be on time for this! We will all craft our very own vision of the 4 Elements on stones washed by the ocean waves. I will be bringing stones from the Pescadero Beach for each person to draw Balance within your self connecting to the 4 Elements! Then we will have our Sound Healing opening up to these new insights and to empower ourselves. I will open Sacred Space and play the beautiful crystal bowl to sing our hearts songs together! We will give gratitude for the harvest of the bounties the Mother Earth. Please RSVP asap to hold a spot. Tell all your Sisters and Brothers and Please Forward!
