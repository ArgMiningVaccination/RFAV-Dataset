SUMMARY OF CHANGES: This Transmittal includ es regulatory revisions based on recent federal regulation changes ( CMS -3346- F; CN). In addition, several updates to the appendices have been made for technical correction and clarity. The psychiatric hospital tags have moved from Appendix AA to Appendix A . Appendix AA is being deleted as surveyors will now refer to Appendix A for the ps ychiatric special condition tags and guidance. Specific references to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) have been removed from A ppendices A, G, and W accordingly, as CMS requires compliance with applicable Federal and State law and adherence to accepted general standards of practice or guidelines for pharmaceutical services and medication administration issued by nationally recognized professional organizations. Appendix H updates the regulatory text based on requirements set forth in the 2008 Conditions for Coverage for ESRD Facilities and als o includes revisions based on recent Federal regulation changes set forth in \"Fire Safety Requirements for Certain Dialysis Facilities (CMS -3334- P).\" Revisions to Appendix W also include renumber -Tags; in serting regulations \u00a7485.601, \u00a7485.603, \u00a7485.604, and \u00a7485.606; and inserting the CAH Distinct Part Unit and Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) C -Tags for reference. This transmittal will assure each of the appendices are updated to reflec t the current regulatory language within the Medicare conditions. More substantive i nterpretive guidance revisions in several sections are pending and will be updated with a future release.

If it is readily producible in such form and format (including in an electr onic form or format when such medical records are maintained electronically); or if not, in a readable hard copy form or such other form or format as agreed by the facility and the individual, and within a reasonable timeframe. The hospital mu st not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their own medical records and must actively seek to meet these requests as quickly as its record keeping system permits. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(d)(2) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release. A-0168 (Rev. The use of restraint or seclusion must be in accordance with the order of a physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient and authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(5) Hospitals must have policies and procedures for the initiation of restraint or s eclusion that identify the categories of licensed practitioners (LPs) that are permitted to order restraint or seclusion in that hospital, consistent with State law. The regulation requires that a physician or other LP responsible for the care of the pati ent to order restraint or seclusion prior to the application of restraint or seclusion. In some situations, however, the need for a restraint or seclusion intervention may occur so quickly that an order cannot be obtained prior to the application of restr aint or seclusion. In these emergency application situations, the order must be obtained either during the emergency application of the restraint or seclusion, or immediately (within a few minutes) after the restraint or seclusion has been applied. The f ailure to immediately obtain an order is viewed as the application of restraint or seclusion without an order. The hospital should address this process in its restraint and seclusion policies and procedures. The policies and procedures should specify who can initiate the emergency application of restraint or seclusion prior to obtaining an order from a physician or other LP. Licensed Practitioner ( LP) For the purpose of ordering restraint or seclusion, an LP is any practitioner permitted by State law and hospital policy as having the authority to order restraints or seclusion for patients. A resident who is authorized by State law and the hospital's residency program to practice as a physician can carry out functions reserved for a physician or LP by the regulation. A medical school student holds no license, and his/her work is reviewed and must be countersigned by the attending physician; therefore, he or she is not licensed or independent. A medical school student is not a LP . Protocols A protocol cannot serve as a substitute for obtaining a physician's or other LP's order prior to initiating each episode of restraint or seclusion use. If a hospital uses protocols that include the use of restraint or se clusion, a specific physician or LP order is still required for each episode of restraint or seclusion use. The philosophy that serves as a foundation for the regulation is that restraint or seclusion use is an exceptional event, not a routine response to a certain patient condition or behavior. Each patient must be assessed, and interventions should be tailored to meet the individual patient's needs. The creation of a protocol can run counter to this philosophy if it sets up the expectation that restrai nt or seclusion will be used as a routine part of care. The use of restraint or seclusion is a last resort when less restrictive measures have been determined ineffective to ensure the safety of the patient, staff or others, should not be a standard response to a behavior or patient need. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(5) Review hospital policies and medical staff by -laws to ascertain clinical practice guidelines that describe the responsibilities of medical staff and clinicians who are privileged to order restraint and seclusion. Do the hospital's written policies identify what categories of practitioners the State recognizes as an LP or as having the authority to order restraint and seclusion? Does the hospital have written policies indicating which practitioners are permitted to order restraint or seclusion in the facility? Do the hospital's written policies conform to State law? Does the hospital have established policies for who can initiate restraint or seclusion? Does the hospital utilize proto cols for the use of restraint or seclusion? If so, is the use of protocols consistent with the requirements of the regulation? Do the medical records reviewed identify the physician or LP who ordered each use of restraint or seclusion? During the medica l record review, verify that a physician or LP order was obtained prior to the initiation of restraint or seclusion. When emergency application of restraint or seclusion was necessary, verify that a physician or LP order was obtained immediately (within a few minutes) after application of the restraint or seclusion. A-0172 (Rev. State law that is more restrictive -- ] \u00a7482.13(e)(8)(ii) - After 24 hours, before writing a new order for the use of restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior, a physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient and authorized to order restraint or seclusion b y hospital policy in accordance with State law must see and assess the patient .. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(8)(ii) At a minimum, if a patient remains in restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior 24 hours after the original order, the physician or other LP must see the patient and conduct a face -to-face re -evaluation before writing a new order for the continued use of restraint or seclusion. Twenty -four hours of restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior is an extreme measure with the potential for serious harm to the patient. State laws ma y be more restrictive and require the physician or other LP to conduct a face-to-face re- evaluation within a shorter timeframe. When the physician or other LP renews an order or writes a new order authorizing the continued use of restraint or seclusion, there must be documentation in the patient's medical record that describes the findings of the physician's or other LPs re-evaluation supporting the continued use of restraint or seclusion. EXCEPTION: Repetitive self -mutilating behaviors - see interpretive guidance for \u00a7482.13(e)(6) . Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(8)((ii) If restr aint or seclusion is used to manage violent or self -destructive behavior for longer than 24 hours, is there documentation of a new written order, patient assessments, and a re- evaluation by a physician or other LP in the medical record? Does the documenta tion provide sufficient evidence to support the need to continue the use of restraint or seclusion? Is there evidence in the medical record that the symptoms necessitating the continued use of restraint or seclusion have persisted? Does the patient's pla n of care or treatment plan address the use of restraint or seclusion? What is the patient's documented clinical response to the continued need for restraint and seclusion? A-0175 condition of the patient who is restrained or secluded must be monitored by a physician, other licensed practitioner or trained staff that have completed the training criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section at an interv al determined by hospital policy. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(10) Ongoing assessment and monitoring of the patient 's condition by a physician, other LP or trained staff is crucial for prevention of patient injury or death, as well as ensuring that the use of restraint or seclusion is discontinued at the earliest possible time. Hospital policies are expected to guide staff in determining appropriate intervals for assessment and monitoring based on the individual needs of the patient , the patient 's condition, and the type of restraint or seclusion used. The selection of an intervention and determination of the necessary frequency of assessment and monitoring should be individualized, taking into consideration variables such as the patient's condition, cognitive status, risks associated with the use of the chosen intervention, and other relevant factors. In some cases, checks every 15 minutes or vital signs taken every 2 hours may not be sufficient to ensure the patient's safety. In others, it may b e excessive or disruptive to patient care (e.g., it may be unnecessary to mandate that a patient with wrist restraints, and who is asleep, be checked every 15 minutes and awakened every 2 hours to take the patient's vital signs). Similarly, depending on t he patient's needs and situational factors, the use of restraint or seclusion may require either periodic (e.g., every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes, etc.) or continual (i.e., moment to moment) monitoring and assessment. Hospital policies should address: frequencies of monitoring and assessment; assessment content (e.g., vital signs, circulation, hydration needs, elimination needs, level of distress and agitation, mental status, cognitive functioning, skin integrity, etc.); providing for nutritional needs , range of motion exercises, and elimination needs; and mental status and neurological evaluations. With the exception of the simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion, one -to-one observation with a staff member in constant attendance is not required by this regulation unless deemed necessary based on a practitioner's clinical judgment. For example, placing staff at the bedside of a patient with wrist restraints may be unnecessary. However, for a more restrictive or risky intervention and/or a patient who is suicidal, self injurious, or combative, staff may determine that continual face -to-face monitoring is needed. The hospital is responsible for providing the level of monitoring and frequency of reassessment that will protect the patient 's safety. Hospitals have flexibility in determining which staff performs the patient assessment and monitoring. This determination must be in accordance with the practitioner's scope of clinical practice and State law. For example, assessment and monitoring are activities within a registered nurse's scope of practice. However, some trained, unlicensed staff may perform components of monitoring (e.g., checking the patient's vital signs, hydration and circulation; the patient's level of distress and agitation; or sk in integrity), and may also provide for general care needs (e.g., eating, hydration, toileting, and range of motion exercises). Section 482.13(f) requires that before applying restraints, implementing seclusion, or performing associated monitoring and care tasks, staff must be trained and able to demonstrate competency in the performance of these actions. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(10) Review hospital policies r egarding assessment and monitoring of a patient in restraint or seclusion. o What evidence do you find that the hospital's monitoring policies are put into practice for all restrained or secluded patients? o Do hospital policies identify w hich categories of staff are responsible for assessing and monitoring the patient? o Do hospital policies include time frames for offering fluids and nourishment, toileting/elimination, range of motion, exercise of limbs and systematic release of restrained limbs? Is this documented in the patient's medical record? Review patient medical records: o Was there a valid rationale for the decision regarding the frequency of patient assessment and monitoring documented in the medical record? o Was documentation consistent, relevant, and reflective of the patient's condition? o Are time frames described for how often a patient is monitored for vital signs, respiratory and cardiac status, and skin integrity checks? o Is there documentation of ongoing patient monitori ng and assessment (e.g., skin integrity, circulation, respiration, intake and output, hygiene, injury, etc)? o Is the patient's mental status assessed? Is this documented in the medical record? o Is the patient assessed regarding continued need for the use of seclusion or restraint? o Is there adequate justification for continued use and is this documented? o Is the level of supervision appropriate to meet the safety needs of the patient who is at a higher risk for injury (e.g., self -injurious, suicidal)? Physician and other licensed practitioner training requirements must be specified in hospital policy. At a minimum, physicians and other licensed practitioners authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law must have a working knowledge of hospital policy regarding the use of restraint or seclusion. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(11) At a minimum, physicians and other LPs authorized to order restraint and seclusion must have a working knowledge of hospital policy regarding the use of restraint and seclusion. Hospitals have the flexibility to identify training requirements above this minimum requirement based on the competency level of their physicians and other LPs , and the needs of the patient population(s) that they serve. Physicians receive training in the assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of a patient's condition as part of their medical school education. However, physicians generally do not receive training regarding application of restraint or implementation of seclusion as part of their basic education. Depending on the level and frequency of involvement that a physician or other LP has in the performance of these activities, additional training may or may not be necessary to ensure the competency of these individuals in this area. The hospital is in the best position to determine if additional physician or other LP training is necessary based on the model of care, level of physician competency, and the needs of the patient population(s) that the hospital serves. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(11) Review the hospital policy regarding restraint and seclusion training requirements for physicians and other LPs. Are the minimum training requirements addressed? Review medical staff credentialing and privileging files to determine if physicians or other LPs involved in restraint and seclusion activities have completed the required training. A-0178 (Rev. When restraint or seclusion is used for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others, the patient must be seen face- to-face within 1 hour af ter the initiation of the intervention -- (i) By a - (A) Physician or other licensed practitioner; or (B) Registered nurse who has been trained in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(12)(i) When restraint or seclusion is used to manage violent or self -destructive behavior, a physician or other LP , or a registered nurse (RN) trained in accordance with the requirements specified under \u00a7482.13(f), must see the patient face -to-face within 1 -hour after the initiation of the intervention. This requirement also applies when a drug or medication is used as a restraint to manage violent or self -destructive behavior. The 1 -hour face -to-face patient evaluation must be conducted in pe rson by a physician or other LP , or trained RN. A telephone call or telemedicine methodology is not permitted. If a patient's violent or self -destructive behavior resolves and the restraint or seclusion intervention is discontinued before the practitioner arrives to perform the 1 -hour face -to- face evaluation, the practitioner is still required to see the patient face -to-face and conduct the evaluation within 1 hour after the initiation of this intervention. The fact that the patient's behavior warranted the use of a restraint or seclusion indicates a serious medical or psychological need for prompt evaluation of the patient behavior that led to the intervention. The evaluation would also determine whether there is a continued need for the intervention, factors that may have contributed to the violent or self -destructive behavior, and whether the intervention was appropriate to address the violent or self - destructive behavior. EXCEPTION: Repetitive self -mutilating behaviors - see interpretive guidance for \u00a7482.13(e)(6) . Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(12)(i) Review the hospital policy regarding the 1 -hour face -to-face evaluation. What categories of practitioners does the hospital policy aut horize to conduct the 1-hour face -to-face evaluation? Interview staff to determine if practice is consistent with hospital policy. A-0182 (Rev. face- to-face evaluation specified in paragraph (e)(12) of this section is conducted by a trained registered nurse, the trained registered nurse must consult the attending physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient soon as po ssible after the completion of the 1 hour face- to- face evaluation. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(e)(14) When a trained RN conducts the required face -to-face evaluation, he or she must consult the attending physician or other LP responsible for the patient's care as soon as possible after the completion of the evaluation. Hospital policy should address the expected time frame for and the components of the consultation with the attending physician or other LP consistent with \"as s oon as possible.\" This consultation should include, at a minimum, a discussion of the findings of the 1- hour face -to-face evaluation, the need for other interventions or treatments, and the need to continue or discontinue the use of restraint or seclusion . A consultation that is not conducted prior to a renewal of the order would not be consistent with the requirement, \"as soon as possible.\" Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(e)(14): Review the relevant hospital restraint and seclusion policy. Does the hospital policy clarify expectations regarding the requirement, \"as soon as possible\"? Does documentation in the patient's medical record indicate consultation with the attending physician or other LP when the 1 -hour face -to-face evaluation was conducted by a tra ined RN? Is practice consistent with hospital [- Hospitals must report deaths associated with the use of seclusion or restraint.] (2) When no seclusion has been used and when the only restraints used on the patient are those applied exclusively to the patient's wrist(s), and which are composed solely of soft, non -rigid, cloth -like materials, the hospital sta ff must record in an internal log or other system, the following information: (i) Any death that occurs while a patient is in such restraints. (ii) Any death that occurs within 24 hours after a patient has been removed from such restraints. (3) The staff must document in the patient's medical record the date and time the death was: (ii) Recorded in the internal log or other system for deaths described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. (4) For deaths described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, entr ies into the log or other system must be documented as follows: (i) Each entry must be made not later than seven days after the date of death of the patient. (ii) Each entry must document the patient's name, date of birth, date of death, name of attendin g physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient medical record number, and primary diagnosis(es). (iii) The information must be made available in either written or electronic form to CMS immediately upon request. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.13(g) (2), (3)(ii), & (4) Hospitals must maintain an internal log or other type of tracking system for recording information on each death that occurs: While a patient is in only 2 -point soft, cloth- like non- rigid wrist restraints and there is no use of seclusion; and Within 24 hours of the patient being removed from 2- point soft, cloth- like non- rigid wrist restraints where there was no use of any other type of restraint or seclusion. Use of the log or tracking system is limited only to patient deaths meeting one of these two criteria. Examples of patient deaths associated with restraints that must still be reported to CMS include: Deaths occurring during or within 24 hours of discontinuation of 2- point soft, cloth -like non- rigid wrist restraints used in combination with any other restraint device or with seclusion; or Deaths associated with the use of other types of wrist restraints, such as 2 -point rigid or leather wrist restraints. These cases would not be included in this internal log or tracking system and would require reporting the death to CMS using telephone, fax, or electronically. The two -point soft wrist restraint death report must be entered into the internal log or tracki ng system within 7 days of the patient's death. The death report log or tracking system entry must include: The patient's name; Patient's date of birth; Patient's date of death; Name of the attending physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care or the patient; Patient's medical record number; and Primary diagnosis(es). Depending on the size and nature of the patient population the hospital serves and the types of services it provides, there will likely be variations in the frequency of restraint use as well as in the incidence of patient deaths. Surveyors should adjust their expectations for the volume of log or tracking system entries accordingly. For example, hospitals with intensive care units might be more likely to us e both soft, 2- point wrist restraints and to have seriously ill patients who die as a result of their disease while such restraints are being used or within 24 hours after their discontinuance. On the other hand, a rehabilitation hospital would be expecte d to use such restraints less frequently, and to have patients who die less frequently while hospitalized. The log or tracking system must be available in written, i.e., hard copy, or electronic form immediately upon CMS's request. CMS will specify the f orm in which the information is to be provided. Generally CMS would request access to the log or tracking system during an on- site survey by CMS staff or State surveyors acting on CMS's behalf when assessing compliance with restraint/seclusion requiremen ts. However, CMS may also request that a copy of portions or the entire log or tracking system be provided, even though no survey is in progress. Accreditation organizations conducting hospital inspections in accordance with a CMS -approved Medicare hospi tal accreditation program are also entitled to immediate access to the log or tracking system. The hospital is not required to make the contents of the log or tracking system available to any other outside parties, unless required to do so under other Fede ral or State law. The hospital must document in the patient's medical record the date and time the death report entry was made into the log or tracking system. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.13(g)(2), (3)(ii), & (4) Does the hospital have restraint/seclusion death reporting policies and procedures that address responsibilities and systems for identifying restraint/seclusion - associated deaths that must be recorded in an internal hospital log/tracking system, and for implementing the reporting and recordkeeping requirements? Ask the hospital how it ensures that each death that must be captured in the log/tracking system is identified and entered. Interview inpatient unit staff to determine whether they have had patients who die while 2 -point soft wrist restrain ts are being used without seclusion or within 24 hours of their discontinuance. If yes, ask the hospital to demonstrate that it has recorded such deaths. If the hospital's log or tracking system relies upon staff identification of reportable deaths, inte rview several applicable staff members to determine whether they are aware of the hospital's policy and know when and where to report internally a restraint/seclusion -associated death. Review the log/tracking system for patient deaths associated with use of only 2- point soft wrist restraints to determine if: Each entry was made within 7 days of the patient's death; and Each entry contains all the information required under the regulation. Is the hospital able to make the log or tracking system available immediately on request? Review a sample of medical records of patients whose deaths were entered in the log or tracking system. Does the medical record indicate that only soft, 2 -point wri st restraints were used? Is there documentation in the medical record of the entry into the log or tracking system?

Include a requirement that -- (i) A medical history and physical examination be completed and documented for each patient no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services , and except as provided under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section . The medical history and physical examination must be completed and documented by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(i) The purpose of a medical history and physical examination (H&P) is to determine whether there is anything in the patient's overall condition that would affect the planned course of the patient's treatment, such as a medication allergy, or a new or existing co - morbid condition that requires additional interventions to reduce risk to the patient. The Medical Staff bylaws must include a requirement that an H&P be completed and documented for each patient no more than 30 days prior to or 24 hours after hospital admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia service s except when the patient is receiving an outpatient surgical or procedural services and when the medical staff has developed and maintained a policy (in accordance with \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(v)) that identifies specific patients that do not require a comprehensiv e medical H&P , or any update to it , prior to the specific outpatient surgery or procedure . The H&P may be handwritten or transcribed, but always must be placed within the patient's medical record within 24 hours of admission or registration, or prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, whichever comes first. An H&P is required prior to surgery and prior to procedures requiring anesthesia services, regardless of whether care is being provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis. (71 FR 68676) An H&P that is completed within 24 hours of the patient's admission or registration, but after the surgical procedure, procedure requiring anesthesia, or other procedure requiring an H&P would not be in compliance with this requirement. The med ical history and physical examination must be completed and documented by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy. Section 1861(r) defines a physician as a: Doctor of medicine or osteopathy; Doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine; Doctor of podiatric medicine; Doctor of optometry; or a Chiropractor. In all cases the practitioners included in the definition of a physician must be legally authorized to practice within the State where the hospital is located and providing services within their authorized scope of practice. In addition, in certain instances the Social Security Act attaches further limitations as to the type of hospital services for which a practitioner is considered to be a \"physician.\" For example, a chiropractor is considered a physician only with respect to treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine (to correct a subluxation). Othe r qualified licensed individuals are those licensed practitioners who are authorized in accordance with their State scope of practice laws or regulations to perform an H&P and who are also formally authorized by the hospital to conduct an H&P. Other quali fied licensed practitioners could include nurse practitioners and physician assistants. More than one qualified practitioner can participate in performing, documenting, and authenticating an H&P for a single patient. When performance, documentation, and authentication are split among qualified practitioners, the practitioner who authenticates the H&P will be held responsible for its contents. (71 FR 68675) A hospital may adopt a policy allowing submission of an H&P prior to the patient's hospital admissio n or registration by a physician who may not be a member of the hospital's medical staff or who does not have admitting privileges at that hospital, or by a qualified licensed individual who does not practice at that hospital but is acting within his/her s cope of practice under State law or regulations. Generally, this occurs where the H&P is completed in advance by the patient's primary care practitioner. (71 FR 68675) When the H&P is conducted within 30 days before admission or registration, an update must be completed and documented by a licensed practitioner who is credentialed and privileged by the hospital's medical staff to perform an H&P. (71 FR 68675) (See discussion of H&P update requirements at 42 CFR 482.22(c)(5)(ii).) Surveyors should cite no ncompliance with the requirements of 42 CFR 482.22(c)(5) for failure by the hospital to comply with any of this standard's components. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(i) Review the medical staff bylaws to determine whether they require that a physical examination and medical history be done for each patient no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy. Verify whether the bylaws require the H&P be completed prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services. Review the hospital's policy, if any, to determine whether other qualified licensed individuals are permitted to conduct H&Ps to ensure that it is consistent with the State's scope of practice law or regulations. Verify that non- physicians who perform H&Ps within the hospital are qualified and have been credentialed and privileged in accordance with the hospital's policy. Review a sample of inpatient and outpatient medical records that include a variety of patient populations undergoing both surgical a nd non- surgical procedures to verify that: o There is an H&P that was completed no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration, but, in all cases, prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services , except when an assessm ent is completed and documented pursuant to \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(iii) ; and o The H&P was performed by a physician, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual authorized in accordance with State law and hospital policy. A-0359 (Rev. - Include a requirement that -- (ii) An updated examination of the patient, including any changes in the patient's condition, be completed and documented within 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, when the medical history and physical examination are completed within 30 days before admission or registration, and except as provided under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section . The updated examination of the patient, including any changes in the patient's condition, m ust be completed and documented by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.22(c)(5) (ii) The Medical Staff bylaws must include a requirement that when a medical history and physical examination has been completed within 30 days before admission or registration, an updated medical record entry must be completed and documented in the patient' s medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration, except when the patient is receiving an outpatient surgical or procedural services and when the medical staff has developed and maintained a policy (in accordance with \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(v)) that identifies specific patients that do not require a comprehensive medical H&P , or any update to it , prior to the outpatient surgery or procedure . The examination must be conducted by a licensed practitioner who is credentialed and privileged by the h ospital's medical staff to perform an H&P. In all cases, the update must take place prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services. The update note must document an examination for any changes in the patient's condition since the patient's H&P was performed that might be significant for the planned course of treatment. The physician or qualified licensed individual uses his/her clinical judgment, based upon his/her assessment of the patient's condition and co- morbidities, if any, in relati on to the patient's planned course of treatment to decide the extent of the update assessment needed as well as the information to be included in the update note in the patient's medical record. If, upon examination, the licensed practitioner finds no cha nge in the patient's condition since the H&P was completed, he/she may indicate in the patient's medical record that the H&P was reviewed, the patient was examined, and that \"no change\" has occurred in the patient's condition since the H&P was completed (71 FR 68676). Any changes in the patient's condition must be documented by the practitioner in the update note and placed in the patient's medical record within 24 hours of admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requirement anesthes ia services. Additionally, if the practitioner finds that the H&P done before admission is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise unacceptable, the practitioner reviewing the H&P, examining the patient, and completing the update may disregard the existing H &P, and conduct and document in the medical record a new H&P within 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.22(c)(5)(ii) Review the medical staff bylaws to determine whether they include provisions requiring that, when the medical history and physical examination was completed within 30 days before admission or registration, an updated medical record entry documenting an examination for changes in the patient's conditi on was completed and documented in the patient's medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration. Determine whether the bylaws require that, in all cases involving surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, the update to the H&P must be completed and documented prior to the surgery or procedure. In the sample of medical records selected for review, look for cases where the medical history and physical examination was completed within 30 days before admission or registration. Ve rify that an updated medical record entry documenting an examination for any changes in the patient's condition was completed and documented in the patient's medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration. Verify that in all cases involvin g surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, the update was completed and documented prior to the surgery or procedure.

There must be supervisory and staff personnel for each department or nursing unit to ensure, when needed, the immedi ate availability of a registered nurse for care of any patient. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(b) The nursing service must ensure that patient needs are met by ongoing assessments of patients' needs and provides nursing staff to meet those needs. There must be sufficient numbers, types and qualifications of supervisory and staff nursing personnel to respond to the appropriate nursing needs and care of the patient population of each department or nursing unit. There must be a RN physically present on th e premises and on duty at all times. Every inpatient unit/department/location within the hospital- wide nursing service must have adequate numbers of RNs physically present at each location to ensure the immediate availability of a RN for the care of any p atient. A RN would not be considered immediately available if the RN were working on more than one unit, building, floor in a building, or provider (distinct part SNF, RHC, excluded unit, etc.) at the same time. Staffing schedules must be reviewed and revised as necessary to meet the patient care needs and to make adjustments for nursing staff absenteeism. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(b) Determine that there are written staffing schedules which correlate to the number and acuity of patients. Verify that there is supervision of personnel performance and nursing care for each department or nursing unit. To determine if there are adequate numbers of nurses to provide nursing care to all patients as needed, take into consideration: o Physical layout and size of the hospital; o Number of patients; o Intensity of illness and nursing needs; o Availability of nurses' aides and orderlies and other resources for nurses, e.g., housekeeping services, ward clerks etc.; o Training and experience of personnel; Review medical records to determine if patient care that is to be provided by nurses is being provided as ordered. A-0396 (Rev. The hospital must ensure that the nursing staff develops and keeps current a nursing care plan for each patient that reflects the patient's goals and the nursing care to be provided to meet the patient's needs . The nursing care plan may be part of an interdisciplinary care plan. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(b)(4) Nursing care planning starts upon admission. It includes planning the patient's nursing care to meet the patient's needs and interventions toward meeting patient treatment goals while in the hospital as well as planning for discharge to meet post -hospital needs. A nursing care plan is based on assessing the patient's nursing care needs (not solely those needs related to the admitting diagnosis). The assessment considers the pat ient's treatment goals and, as appropriate, physiological and psychosocial factors and patient discharge planning. The plan develops appropriate nursing interventions in response to the identified nursing care needs. The nursing care plan is kept current by ongoing assessments of the patient's needs and of the patient's response to interventions, assessment of patient treatment goals, and updating or revising the patient's nursing care plan in response to assessments. The nursing care plan is part of the patient's medical record and must comply with the medical records requirements at \u00a7482.24. Hospitals have the flexibility of developing the nursing care plan as part of a larger, coordinated interdisciplinary plan of care. This method may serve to promote communication among disciplines and reinforce an integrated, multi -faceted approach to a patient's care, resulting in better patient outcomes. The interdisciplinary plan of care does not minimize or eliminate the need for a nursing care plan. It does, however, serve to promote the collaboration between members of the patient's health care team. The required documentation for the nursing component of an interdisciplinary care plan remains the same. For other components, the hospital should follow the current documentation policies that it uses to document services provided by other disciplines, such as services provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech- language pathologists, and others. Documentation should follow the standards of practice for those disciplines in addition to any specific requirements that the hospital might want to establish. The documentation must also comply with the requirements of the medical records requirement at \u00a7482.24. (77 FR 29049, May 16, 2012) Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(b)(4) Select a sample of nursing or interdisciplinary care plans. Approximately 6- 12 plans should be reviewed. For each plan reviewed, with respect to the nursing care component: Was the plan initiated as soon as possible af ter admission for each patient? Does the plan describe and reflect patient goals as part of the patient's nursing care assessment and, as appropriate, physiological and psychosocial factors and patient discharge planning? Is the plan consistent with the plan for medical care of the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient? Is there evidence of reassessment of the patient's nursing care needs and response to nursing interventions and, as applicable, revisions to the plan? Was the plan implemented in a timely manner? All licensed nurses who provide services in the hospital must adhere to the policies and procedures of the hospital. The director of nursing service must provide for the adequate supervision and evaluation of all nursing personnel which occur within the responsibility of the nursing service, reg ardless of the mechanism through which those personnel are providing services (that is, hospital employee, contract, lease, other agreement, or volunteer). Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(b)(6) The hospital must ensure that there are adequate numbers of clinical nursing personnel to meet its patients nursing care needs. In order to meet their patient's needs the hospital may supplement their hospital employed licensed nurses with volunteer and or contract licensed nurses. The hospital and the director of the nursing service are responsible for the clinical activities of all nursing personnel regardless of whether they are hospital employees, contracted staff, or volunteers . All licensed nurses who are working at the hospital must adhere to the policies and procedures of the hospital. The hospital and the director of the nursing service are responsible for ensuring that licensed nursing personnel know the hospital's policies and procedures in order to adhere to those policies and procedures. The hospita l and the director of the nursing service ensure that nursing care staff person is adequately supervised and that their clinical activities are evaluated. This supervision and evaluation of the clinical activities of each non -employee nursing staff person must be conducted by an appropriately qualified hospital -employed RN. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(b)(6) Review the method for orienting all licensed nurses to hospital policies and procedures. The orientation should include at least the following: o The hospital and the unit; o Emergency procedures; o Nursing services policies and procedures; and o Safety policies and procedures. Determine if all nursing personnel are appropriately oriented prior to providing care. Confirm with the director of nurses that all nurses performance are evaluated by the hospital at least once a year. If the performance evaluation is not considered confidential, review two evaluations. A-0399 (Rev. The hospital must have policies and procedures in place establishing which outpatient departments, if any, are not required under hospital policy to have a registered nurse present. The policies and procedures must: (i) Establish the criteria such outpatient departments must meet, taking into account the types of services delivered, the general level of acuity of patients served by the department, and the established standards of practice for the services delivered; (ii) Establish altern ative staffing plans; (iii) Be approved by the director of nursing; (iv) Be reviewed at least once every 3 years Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(b)(7) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release. A-0405 (Rev. Administration of Drugs. (1) Drugs and biologicals must be prepared and administered in accordance with Federal and State laws, the orders of the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the patient's care, and accepted standards of practice. (i) Drugs and biologicals may be prepared and administered on the orders of other practitioners not specified under \u00a7482.12(c) only if such practitioners are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies, and medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.... (2) All drugs and biologicals must be administered by, or under supervision of, nursing or other personnel in ac cordance with Federal and State laws and regulations, including applicable licensing requirements, and in accordance with the approved medical staff policies and procedures. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2) According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, medication errors are among the most common medical errors, harming at least 1.5 million people each year.1 It has been estimated that drug- related adverse outcomes were noted in nearly 1.9 million inpatient hospital stays (4.7 percent of all stays), and 838,000 treat -and-release ED visits (0.8 percent of all visits) .2 Although technological advances in electronic order entry, medication administration, and electronic medical records hold a great deal of prom ise for decreasing medication errors, there are a multitude of human and environmental factors that will impact their success. The increasing complexity of medical care and patient acuity present significant challenges that require an approach to medicatio n administration that takes advantage of available technology while recognizing that it must be integrated into the medication administration work processes in a manner that meets the needs of patients and promotes their safety. The regulations at \u00a7482.23(c) and \u00a7482.23(c)(1) promote safety in the preparation and administration of drugs and biologicals to hospital patients by requiring preparation and administration in accordance with: Federal and State law; Accepted standards of practice; Orders of t he practitioner(s) responsible for the patient's care, as permitted under State law, hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations; and Medical staff -approved policies and procedures. Federal and State Law 1Institute of Medicine. Preventing Medication Errors. Washington DC: The National Academies Press, 2007. 2Lucado, Jennifer, et al, Medication -Related Adverse Outcomes in U.S. Hospitals and Emergency Departments. Statistical Brief #109 , April, 2011. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency For Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. Federal law regulates the approval and classification of drugs and biologicals. Individual States establish laws and regulations which specify the scope of practice for various types of licensed healthcare professionals, including which medications they may prescribe and administe r, including controlled substances. Accepted Standards of Practice Hospital policies and procedures for the preparation and administration of all drugs and biologicals must not only comply with all applicable Federal and State laws, but also must be cons istent with accepted standards of practice based on guidelines or recommendations issued by nationally recognized organizations with expertise in medication preparation and administration. Examples of such organizations include, but are not limited to: American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (http://www.ashp.org/default.aspx ) Infusion Nurses Society ( http://www.ins1 .org) Institute for Safe Medication Practices (www.ismp.org ) National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (www.nccmerp.org ) U.S Pharmacopeia ( www.usp.org ) Orders of an authorized practitioner Drugs must be administered in response to an order from a practitioner, or on the basis of a standing order w hich is appropriately authenticated subsequently by a practitioner. (See \u00a7482.23(c)(1) (ii) concerning standing orders.) Generally, the ordering practitioner is the practitioner(s) responsible for the care of the patient. However, other practitioners not specified under \u00a7482.12(c) may write orders for the preparation and administration of drugs and biologicals, if they are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies and procedures, and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations. This includes practitioners ordering outpatient services who do not have privileges in the hospital but who are permitted under their State scope of practice and authorized by hospital and medical staff policy to order outpatient services. In accordance with standard practice, all practitioner orders for the administration of drugs and biologicals must include at least the following: Name of the patient; Age and weight of the patient, to facilitate dose calculation when applicable. Policies and procedures must address weight -based dosing for pediatric patients as well as in other circumstances identified in the hospital's policies. (Note that dose calcul ations are based on metric weight (kg, or g for newborns). If a hospital permits practitioners to record weight in either pounds or using metric weight, the opportunity for error increases, since some orders would require conversion while others would not . Accordingly, hospitals must specify a uniform approach to be used by prescribing practitioners. For example, a hospital could require all prescribers to use pounds or ounces and have the electronic ordering system or the pharmacy convert to metric); Date and time of the order; Drug name; Dose, frequency, and route; Dose calculation requirements, when applicable; Exact strength or concentration, when applicable; Quantity and/or duration, when applicable; Specific instructions for use, when applicable; and; Name of the prescriber. Medical Staff Approved Policies and Procedures The hospital's medical staff must approve policies and procedures for medication administration, consistent with the requirements of Federal and State law and accepted standards of practice. It is recommended that the medical staff consult with nurses, pharmacists, Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement program staff, and others in developing these policies and procedures. The adopted policies and procedures must address key issues related to medication administration, which include but are not limited to: Personnel authorized to administer medication \u00a7482.23(c)(2) requires that all drugs and biologicals are administered by, or under the supervision of, nursi ng or other personnel, in accordance with Federal or State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures. State law requirements include licensure requirements. Policies and procedures must identify categories of licensed personnel and the types of medications they are permitted to administer, in accordance with state laws. The policies and procedures must also address education and training for all personnel administering drugs and biologicals. Medication administration education and training is typically included in hospital orientation or other continuing education for nursing staff and other authorized healthcare personnel. Training or continuing education topics regarding medication administration may include but are not limited to the fo llowing: Safe handling and preparation of authorized medications; Knowledge of the indications, side effects, drug interactions, compatibility, and dose limits of administered medications; Equipment, devices, special procedures, and/or techniques required for medication administration; Policies and procedures must address the required components of the training and if the training provided during hospital orientation imparts sufficient education or whether ongoing in- services or continuing educati on will be required to demonstrate competence. Basic safe practices for medication administration The hospital's policies and procedures must reflect accepted standards of practice that require the following be confirmed prior to each administration of m edication (often referred to as the \"five rights\" of medication administration practice): Right patient: the patient's identity \u2014 acceptable patient identifiers include, but are not limited to: the patient's full name; an identification number assigned b y the hospital; or date of birth. Identifiers must be confirmed by patient wrist band, patient identification card, patient statement (when possible) or other means outlined in the hospital's policy. The patient's identification must be confirmed to be in agreement with the medication administration record and medication labeling prior to medication administration to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct patient. Right medication: the correct medication, to ensure that the medication being given to the patient matches that prescribed for the patient and that the patient does not have a documented allergy to it; Right dose: the correct dose, to ensure that the dosage of the medication matches the prescribed dose, and that the prescription itself does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too low); Right route: the correct route, to ensure that the method of administration - orally, intramuscular, intravenous, etc., is the appropriate one for tha t particular medication and patient; and Right time: the appropriate time, to ensure adherence to the prescribed frequency and time of administration. NOTE : the \"5 rights\" focus specifically on the process of administering medications. The medication process is generally recognized as consisting of five stages: ordering/prescribing; transcribing and verifying; dispensing and delivering; administering; and monitoring/reporting. Errors may occur in other components of the process, even when there is strict adherence to the \"5 rights\" of medication administration, for example when there has been a prescribing or a dispensing error. Hospitals are also expected to comply with requirements under the Pharmaceutical Services CoP at \u00a7482.25 and the patient safety requirements under the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement CoP at \u00a7482.21, using a comprehensive systems approach to all components of the medi cation process. For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited Recent literature* identifies up to nine \"rights\" of medication administration including: Right patient Right drug Right route Right time Right dose Right documentation Right action (appropriate reason) Right form Right response However, other sources refer to 8 or 10 \"rights, and some of these topics, such as right action, appear to involve prescribing and/or dispensing. Accordingly, there does not (yet) appear to be consensus about expanding beyond the 5 \"rights.\" *Reference: Elliott, M. and Lis, Y. (2010). The Nine Rights of Medication Administration: An Overview. British Journal of Nursing, Vol. 19, 5, 300-305. Hospitals are encouraged to promote a culture in which it is not only acceptable, but also strongly encouraged, for staff to bring to the attention of the prescribing practitioner questions or concerns they have regarding medication orders. Any questions about orders for drugs or biologicals are expected to be resolved promptly, whether they arise prior to the preparation, dispensing, or administration of the medication. Hospitals must also ensure staff adherence to accepted standards of practice required to prevent healthcare- associated infections related to medication preparation and/or administration , including compounded sterile preparations (CSPs ). Adherence to these standards is assessed under the infection control CoP at 42 CFR 482.42. A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is set by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval process. It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration dat e if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer's approved labeling. A drug or biological is also outdated after its \"beyond- use date\" (BUD), which may be reached before the expiration date, but never later. The BUD i s the date and time after which the medication must not be used, stored or transported. The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and potential for deterioration and microbial growth that may occur during or after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process if it is a compounded medication. The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such information is available. The hospital must maintain and implement policies and procedures that provide clear and consistent direction to pharmacy staff regarding how to determine a BUD when complete BUD information is not available from the manufacturer. Timing of Medication Adminis tration Appropriate timing of medication administration must take into account the complex nature and variability among medications; the indications for which they are prescribed; the clinical situations in which they are administered; and the needs of th e patients receiving them. The chemical properties, mechanism of action, or therapeutic goals of some medications require administration at the exact time prescribed, or within a narrow window of its prescribed scheduled time, to avoid compromising patient safety or achievement of the intended therapeutic effect. However, the therapeutic effect of many other medications is uncompromised by a much broader window of time for administration. Consequently, the application of a uniform required window of time before or after the scheduled time for the administration of all medications, without regard to their differences, could undermine the ability of nursing staff to prioritize nursing care activities appropriately. This could also result in staff work- arounds that jeopardize patient safety due to the imposition of unrealistic or unnecessary time constraints for medication administration. Instead, hospital policies and procedures must specifically address the timing of medication administration, based on th e nature of the medication and its clinical application, to ensure safe and timely administration. The policies and procedures must address at least the following: Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times; Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times; Administration of eligible medications outside of their scheduled dosing times and windows; and Evaluation of medication administration timing policies, including adherence to them. Medications or categories of medication not el igibl e for scheduled dosing times The policies and procedures must identify medications or categories of medication which are not eligible for scheduled dosing times, either in general or in specific clinical applications. These are medications that requ ire exact or precise timing of administration, based on diagnosis type, treatment requirements, or therapeutic goals. The policies and procedures must reflect consideration of factors including, but not limited to, the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed medication; specific clinical applications; and patient risk factors. Examples of medications that hospitals may choose to identify as not eligible for scheduled dosing times may include, but are not limited to: Stat doses (immediate); First time or loa ding doses (initial large dose of a drug given to bring blood, tissue or fluid levels to an effective concentration quickly); One-time doses; doses specifically timed for procedures; Time -sequenced doses timed for serum drug levels; Investigation al drugs; or Drugs prescribed on an as needed basis (prn doses). The policies and procedures must ensure timely administration of such medications. In addition they must specify if the policy for the administration of these medications will be applied hospital -wide or only for specific diagnosis types, hospital units or clinical situations. Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times are those prescribed on a repeated cycle of frequency, such as once a day, BID (twice a day), TID (three times a day), hourly intervals (every 1, 2, 3 or more hours), etc. The goal of this scheduling is to achieve and maintain therapeutic blood levels of the prescribed medication over a period of time. Medication admini stration policies and procedures typically establish standardized dosing times for the administration of all 'scheduled' medications. For example, medications prescribed for BID (twice a day) administration might, under a given hospital's policies and proc edures, be scheduled to be administered at 8am and 8pm. Another hospital might choose to schedule BID medications at 7:30 am and 7:30 pm. Use of these standardized times facilitates the medication administration process, e.g., by providing to the hospita l's pharmacy that morning doses of all BID drugs must be dispensed and delivered to patient units in time for the scheduled administration. For the nursing staff, the scheduled administration time might prompt prioritization of additional activities that may be required, in the case of particular drugs, such as vital sign assessment or the collection and review of blood work, to ensure safe and timely medication administration. Policies and procedures for medications eligible for scheduled dosing times mus t also address: first dose medications, including parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the timing of the first and subsequent doses, which may fall between scheduled dosing times; retiming of missed or omitted doses; medications that will not follow scheduled dosing times; and patient units that are not subject to following the scheduled dosing times. Time -critical scheduled medications Time -critical scheduled medications are those for which an early or lat e administration of greater than thirty minutes might cause harm or have significant, negative impact on the intended therapeutic or pharmacological effect. Accordingly, scheduled medications identified under the hospital's policies and procedures as time -critical must be administered within thirty minutes before or after their scheduled dosing time, for a total window of 1 hour. It is possible for a given medication to be time - critical for some patients, due to diagnosis, clinical situation, various ris k factors, or therapeutic intent, but not time - critical for other patients. Therefore, hospital policies and procedures must address the process for determining whether specific scheduled medications are always time- critical, or only under certain circums tances, and how staff involved in medication administration will know when a scheduled medication is time -critical. Examples of time -critical scheduled medications/medication types may include, Medications prescribed for administration within a specified period of time of the medication order; Medications that must be administered apart from other medications for optimal therapeutic effect; or Medications prescribed more frequently than every 4 hours. Non-time -critical scheduled medications Non-time critical scheduled medications are those for which a longer or shorter interval of time since the prior dose does not significantly change the medication's therapeutic effect or otherwise cause harm. For such medications greater flexibility in the timing of their administration is permissible. Specifically: Medications prescribed for daily, weekly or monthly administration may be within 2 hours before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed 4 hours. Medications prescribed more frequently than daily but no more frequently than every 4 hours may be administered within 1 hour before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed 2 hours. Missed or late administration of medications The hospital's policies and procedures must address the actions to be taken when medications eligible for scheduled d osing times are not administered within their permitted window of time. This includes doses which may have been missed due to the patient being temporarily away from the nursing unit, for example, for tests or procedures; patient refusal; patient inabilit y to take the medication; problems related to medication availability; or other reasons that result in missed or late dose administration. Likewise, policies and procedures must also outline guidelines for the administration and timing of new medications w hich are initiated between standardized dosing times. These policies and procedures must identify parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the rescheduling of missed or late doses and when notification of the physician or other practitioner responsible for the care of the patient is required prior doing so. In either case, the reporting of medication errors that are the result of missed or late dose administration must be reported to the attending physician in a ccordance with requirements at \u00a7482.25(b)(6). See interpretive guidance at \u00a7482.25(b)(6) for more details on internal reporting requirements Evaluation of medication administration timing policies Hospitals must periodically evaluate their medication a dministration timing policies, including staff adherence to the policies, to determine whether they assure safe and effective medication administration. Consistent with the QAPI requirements at 42 CFR 482.21(c)(2), medication errors related to the timing of medication administration must be tracked and analyzed to determine their causes. Based on the results of the evaluations of the policies and the medication administration errors, the medical staff must consider whether there is a need to revise the policies and procedures governing medication administration timing. Assessment/Monitoring of Patients Receiving Medications Observing the effects medications have on the patient is part of the multi -faceted medication administration process. Patients mus t be carefully monitored to determine whether the medication results in the therapeutically intended benefit, and to allow for early identification of adverse effects and timely initiation of appropriate corrective action. Depending on the medication and route/delivery mode, monitoring may need to include assessment of: Clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the efficacy of medication therapy, to anticipate or evaluate toxicity and adverse effects. For some medications, including opioi ds, this may include clinical data such as respiratory status, blood pressure, and oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels ; Physical signs and clinical symptoms relevant to the patient's medication therapy, including but not limited to, somnolence, confusion, agitation, unsteady gait, pruritus, etc. Certain types of medications are considered inherently high risk for adverse drug events. Although mistakes may or may not be more common with these drugs, the consequences of errors are often harmful, sometimes fatal, to patients. (See also the discussion of high - risk medications (typically referred to as \"high -alert\" medications) in the guidance for \u00a7482.25(a)(1)) For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited The Institute for Safe Medication Pra ctices (ISMP) makes available a list of high alert medications, which it defines as those medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. The current list may be found at: http://www.ismp.org/Tools/highAlertMedicationLists.asp In addition, certain factors place some patients at greater risk for adverse effects of medication. Factors including, but not limited to, age, altered liver and kidney function, a history of sleep apnea, patient weight (obesity may increase apnea or smaller patients may be more sensitive to dose levels of medications), asthma, history of smoking, drug - drug interactions, and first -time medication use may contribute to increased risk. Consideration of patient risk factors as well as the risks inherent in a medication must be taken into account when determining the type and frequency of monitoring. Further, to enhance continuity of care/safe medication administration, it is essential to communicate all relevant information regarding patients' medication risk factors and monitoring requirements during hand- offs of the patient to other clinical staff, such as when patients are transferred internally from one unit to another, during shift report at change of shift, etc. This would apply to hand- offs involving not only to nursing staff, but also to any other types of staff who administer medicatio ns, e.g., respiratory therapists. Adverse patient reactions, such as anaphylaxis or opioid- induced respiratory depression, require timely and appropriate intervention, per established hospital protocols, and must also be reported immediately to the pract itioner responsible for the care of the patient. (See the guidance for \u00a7482.23(c)(5) and \u00a7482.25(b)(6), concerning reporting of adverse medication -related events.) An example of vigilant post -medication administration monitoring in the case of a high - alert medication where patient factors may increase risk would be regularly checking vital signs, oxygen level via pulse oximetry, and sedation levels of a post -surgical patient who is receiving pain medication via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Narcotic medications, such as opioids, are often used to control pain but also have a sedating effect. Patients can become overly sedated and suffer respiratory depression or arrest, which can be fatal. Timely assessment and appropriate monitoring is ess ential in all hospital settings in which opioids are administered, to permit intervention to counteract respiratory depression should it occur. (See also the discussion of the requirements for intravenous medications at \u00a7482.23(c)(4)). As part of the monitoring process, staff are expected to include the patient's reports of his/her experience of the medication's effects. Further, when monitoring requires awakening the patient in order to assess effects of the medications, the patient and/or the patient's representative must be educated about this aspect of the monitoring process. In addition, hospitals are encouraged to educate the patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty bre athing or other changes that might be a reaction to medication. Hospital policies and procedures are expected to address how the manner and frequency of monitoring, considering patient and drug risk factors, are determined, as well as the information to be communicated at shift changes, including the hospital's requirements for the method(s) of communication. Documentation Note that documentation of medication administration is addressed in the Medical Records CoP, at \u00a7482.24(c), which specifies the required content of the medical record. Within this regulation \u00a7482.24(c)(vi) requires that the record contain: \"All practitioners' orders, nursing notes, reports of treatment, medication records, radiology, and laboratory reports, and vital signs and ot her information necessary to monitor the patient's condition.\" Documentation is expected to occur after actual administration of the medication to the patient; advance documentation is not only inappropriate, but may result in medication errors. Proper documentation of medication administration actions taken and their outcomes is essential for planning and delivering future care of the patient. See the guidance for the various parts of \u00a7482.24(c) concerning documentation in the medical record. Deficien cies in documentation would be cited under the applicable Medical Records regulation. Survey Procedures \u00a7\u00a7482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(2) Verify that there is an effective method for the administration of drugs. Use the following indicators for asse ssing drug administration: Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by the medical staff and governing body concerning ordering of drugs and biologicals by practitioners. Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by the medical staff covering who is authorized to administer medications, and that the policies are followed. Verify nursing staff authorized to administer drugs and biological are practicing within their State -permitted scope of practice. Are personnel other than nursing personnel administering drugs or biologicals? If yes, determine if those personnel are administering drugs or biologicals in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations, including scope of practice laws, hospital policy, and medical staff by-laws, rules and regulations. Use the above procedures to determine compliance. Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by medical staff addressing the timing of medication administration. Verify that the hospital has, consistent with its policies, identified medications: which are: not eligible for scheduled dosing times; Eligible for scheduled dosing times and are time -critical; and Eligible for scheduled dosing times and are not time -critical. Verify the hospital has established total windows of time that do not exceed the following: 1 hour for time -critical scheduled medications; 2 hours for medications prescribed more frequently than daily, but no more frequently than every 4 hours; and 4 hours for medications prescribed for daily or longer administration intervals. Verify that the hospital's policy describes requirements for the administration of identified time -critical medications. Is it clear whether time -critical medications or medication types are identified as such f or the entire hospital or are unit -, patient diagnosis -, or clinical situation - specific? Review a sample of medical records to determine whether medication administration conformed to an authorized practitioner's order, i.e., that there is an order from an authorized practitioner, or an applicable standing order, and that the correct medication was administered to the right patient at the right dose via the correct route, and that timing of administration complied with the hospital's policies and procedur es. Check that the practitioner's order was still in force at the time the drug was administered. Observe the preparation of drugs and their administration to patients [medication pass] in order to verify that procedures are being followed Is the patient's identity confirmed prior to medication administration? Are procedures to assure the correct medication, dose, and route followed? Are drugs administered in accordance with the hospital's established policies and procedures for safe and timely medication administration? Does the nurse remain with the patient until oral medication is taken? Are patients assessed by nursing and/or other staff, per hospital policy, for their risk to their prescribed medications? Are patients who are at higher risk and/or receiving high- alert medications monitored for adverse effects? Are staff knowledgeable about intervention protocols when patients experience adverse medication -related events? Interview personnel who administe r medication to verify their understanding of the policies regarding timeliness of medication administration. Are they able to identify time -critical and non -time-critical scheduled medications? Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times? Are they able to describe requirements for the timing of administration of time critical and non -time critical medications in accordance with the hospital's for drugs and biologicals may be documented and signed by other practitioners , only if such practitioners are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies, and medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(c)( 3)(iii) All orders for drugs and biologicals, with the exception of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, must be documented and signed by a practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient or who is another practitioner who is authorized by hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, and who is acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws. Flu and pneumonia vaccines Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may be administered per physician -approved hospital policy, i.e., hospital policy approved by the physician members of the medical staff. There must be an assessment of contraindications prior to administration of the vaccine(s). There is no r equirement for authentication by a practitioner when influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are administered to a patient in accordance with hospital policy and State law. Standing orders Nurses or other personnel authorized by hospital policy and in accordance with State law may administer drugs and biologicals in accordance with pre -printed and electronic standing orders, order sets, and protocols for patient orders, collectively referred to in this guidance as \"standing orders,\" to address well - defined clinical scenarios involving medication administration. The requirements governing the hospital's development and use of standing orders are found at the Medical Records CoP, under \u00a7482.24(c)(3). For the nursing services requirement under \u00a7482.23(c) (1) (ii), compliance assessment focuses on whether nurses comply with the hospital's established standing orders policies and procedures when administering drugs or biological in accordance with a standing order. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(c)(3)(iii) Revi ew the hospital's policy for drug and biological orders. Does it require that all administration of drugs or biologicals be based on either an applicable standing order or the order of a practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient or other wise authorized by hospital and medical staff policy and in accordance with State law to write orders? Interview nursing staff to determine whether they initiate medications in accordance with standing orders. Are they familiar with the hospital's polici es and procedures for using standing orders? Are they following the policies and procedures? Ask to see the protocol for a standing order used by nursing staff, and ask nursing staff to explain how their practice conforms to the protocol. Review a sampl e of open and closed patient medical records. Although the regulation applies to both inpatient and outpatient medical records, the sample should be weighted to include more inpatient records. Determine whether all orders for drugs and biologicals, with t he exception of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, are included in the patient's medical record and authenticated by a practitioner who is authorized to write orders by hospital and medical staff policy and in accordance with State law and who is respons ible for the care of the patient. Determine whether all standing orders which were initiated by a nurse were authenticated by an authorized practitioner. Determine whether all orders for drugs and biologicals contain the required elements. A-0410 transfusions and intravenous medications must be administered in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(c)( 4) Intravenous (IV) medications and blood transfusions must be administered in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures. Further, m any of the medications included in the high- alert categories are administered intravenously. (See also the discussion of high- risk/high -alert medications in the guidance for \u00a7482.25(b).) Hospital policies and procedures for blood transfusions and IV medications must be based on accepted standards of practice, and must address at least the following: Vascular Access Route Patients may require a form of vascular access to deliver blood or medications, either venous or arterial, based on the desired treatment plan. Safe administration of blood transfusions and IV medic ations includes the correct choice of vascular access. IV medications, such as fluids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy, may require specific types of access, such as peripheral or central catheters versus implanted port devices, based on the medication's ch emical properties or safety concerns. Hospital policies and procedures must address which medications can be given intravenously via what type of access. Other Patient Safety Practices In addition to the basic safe practices that apply to all medication administration (See the discussion of safe medication administration practices, and medication administration in general, at \u00a7482.23(c)), there are additional safe practices specific to IV medication administration that require consideration, including but not limited to, the following: Tracing invasive lines and tubes prior to administration to ensure the medication is to be administered via the proper route (for example, peripheral catheter versus epidural catheter connections); Avoiding forcing connec tions when the equipment offers clear resistance; Verifying proper programming of infusion devices (concentrations, flow rate, dose rate). Patient Monitoring As discussed in the medication administration guidance for \u00a7\u00a7482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2), patients must be monitored for the effects of medications. To the extent that IV medications have a more rapid effect on the body, it is important that staff administering medications understand each medication and it s monitoring requirements. Policies and procedures for IV medication administration must address appropriate IV medication monitoring requirements, including assessment of patients for risk factors that would influence the type and frequency of monitoring . For example: a 50 year old patient with a history of renal failure is receiving IV vancomycin to treat a wound infection. The hospital policy for IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, requires the patient's kidney function to be monitored daily with b lood draws. Based on review of the lab results, a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient would be expected to determine on a timely basis whether or not the antibiotic dose needs to be adjusted to protect kidney function or prevent drug toxicity while achieving the desired therapeutic effects. Staff administering the medication would be expected to review the lab results as well, and to raise with a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient any concerns they might have about wheth er an adjustment in the medication is needed. Hospital policies and procedures related to monitoring patients receiving IV medications are expected to address, but are not limited to, the following: Monitoring for Fluid & Electrolyte Balance Whenever IV medications and blood transfusions are administered, the patient may become at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Hospital policies and procedures must address monitoring and treatment for fluid and electrolyte imbalances that may occur with blood transfusions and IV medications. Monitoring Patients Receiving High -alert Medications, Including IV Opioids Policies and procedures related to IV medication administration must address those medications the hospital has identified as high- alert medications and the monitoring requirements for patients receiving such drugs intravenously. At a minimum, hospitals are expected to address monitoring for over -sedation and respiratory depression related to IV opioids for post -operative patients Opioids are a class of medication used frequently in hospitals to treat pain. The sedating effects of opioids make it diffic ult at times to properly assess the patient's level of sedation. It can be erroneously assumed that patients are asleep when they are actually exhibiting progressive symptoms of respiratory compromise - somnolence, decreased respiratory rate, and decrease in oxygen levels. These symptoms, if unrecognized, can progress to respiratory depression and even death. Certain characteristics, in addition to those discussed in the medication administration guidance for \u00a7\u00a7482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2), place patients receiving opioids at higher risk for oversedation and respiratory depression. These additional factors include, but are not limited to3: Snoring or history of sleep apnea No recent opioid use or first -time use of IV opioids Increased opioid dose requirement or opioid habituation Longer length of time receiving general anesthesia during surgery Receiving other sedating drugs, such as benzodiazepines, antihistamines, sedatives, or other central nervous system depressants Preexisting pulmonary or cardiac disease Thoracic or other surgical incisions that may impair breathing Of particular concern are patients receiving IV opioids post -operatively. The effects of IV opioids in post -operative patients must be monitored vig ilantly via serial assessments of pain, respiratory status, and sedation levels. Hospitals must have policies and procedures related to the use of high- alert medications, including IV opioids for post -operative patients. Policies and procedures must addr ess, at a minimum, the process for patient risk assessment, including who conducts the assessments, and, based on the results of the assessment, monitoring frequency and duration, what is to be monitored, and monitoring methods. The policies and procedure s must also address whether and under what circumstances practitioners prescribing IV opioids are allowed to establish protocols for IV opioid administration and monitoring that differ from the hospital -wide policies and procedures. The frequency of the s erial assessments and duration of the monitoring timeframe for post-operative patients receiving IV opioids must be determined based on at least the following considerations : Patient risk for adverse events; Opioid dosing frequency and IV delivery method. (push or patient -controlled analgesia (PCA)); Duration of IV opioid therapy. 3 Jarzyna D., Junquist C., Pasero C., et al. American Society for Pain Management Nursing - Guidelines on Monitoring for Opioid- Induced Sedation and Respiratory Depression. Pain Management Nursing, Vol 12, No. 3 (September), 2011: pp 118- 145 Regardless of the above factors, at a minimum monitoring must include the following: Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiratory rate) Pain level; Respiratory status; Sedation level; sedation levels are important indicators for the clinical effects of opioids. Sedation is a useful assessment parameter to observe the effects of opioids since sedation typically precedes respiratory depression4. See t he blue box below for information on sedation assessment methods. In addition to vigilant nursing assessment at appropriate intervals, hospitals may choose to use technology to support effective monitoring of patients' respiratory rate and oxygen levels. For additional information regarding recommendations of expert organizations on post - operative opioid monitoring, including technology -supported monitoring, see blue boxes below. The practices described in the blue boxes below are not required under the regulations. The assessment and monitoring process must be explained to the patient and/or the patient's representative, to communicate the rationale for vigilant monitoring, including that it might be nece ssary to awaken the patient in order to assess effects of the medications. In addition, hospitals are encouraged to educate the patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty breathing or other changes that might be a reaction to medication.

It also calls for the monitoring system to be linked with a notification system to clinical staff who can respond immediately. It calls for an escalation protocol so that if a staff person does not acknowledge the alert in 60 seconds a second person will be notified. The Patient Safety Movemen t Foundation - Actionable Patient Safety Solution (APSS) #1: Failure to Rescue: Post -Operative Respiratory Depression. January 13, 2013 Adverse patient reactions require timely and appropriate intervention, per established protocols, and must also be reported immediately to the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. (See the guidance for \u00a7482.23(c)(5) and \u00a7482.25(b)(6), concerning reporting of adverse medication -related events.) For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation APSF calls for every patient receiving postoperative opioid analgesics to be managed based on the following clinical considerations*: Individualize the dose and infusion rate of opioid while considering the unique aspects of each patient's history and physical status. Make continuous monitoring of oxygenation (pulse oximetry) the routine rather than the exception. Assess the need for supplemental oxygen, especially if pulse oximetry or intermittent nurse assessment are the only methods of identifying progressive hypoventilation. When supplement al oxygen is indicated, monitoring of ventilation may warrant the use of technology designed to assess breathing or estimate arterial carbon dioxide concentrations. Continuous monitoring is most important for the highest risk patients, but depending on cli nical judgment, should be applied to other patients. APSF also has issued a video on opioid induced http://apsf.org/resources_video4.php *Stoelting, a Cure? APSF Newsletter 2009;24:2. Blood Components and Blood Administration Procedures According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 13,785,000 units of whole blood and red blood cells were transfused in the United States in 20115. The collection, testing, preparation, and storage of blood and blood components are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. However, administration of blood products via transfusion is governed by \u00a7482.23(c)(4). Blood transfusions can be life -saving. However, like IV medications, blood transfusions are not without risk of harm to patients. Transfusion reactions and/or errors can be fatal. In addition to the safe practices and other safety considerations that apply to all IV medication administration, policies and procedures must address blood administration procedures that are consistent with accepted standards of transfusion practice, including but not limited to: Confirming the following prior to each blood transfusion: the patient's identity verification of the right blood product for the right patient The standard of practice calls for two qualified individuals, one of whom will be administering the transfusion, to perform the confirmation. Requirements for patient monitoring, including frequency and documentation of monitoring How to identify, treat, and report any adverse reactions the patient may experience during or related to transfusion. Staff Training and Competencies Intravenous (IV) medications and blood transfusions must be administered by qualified personnel, regardless of whether they are practitioners or non- practitioners. Generally IV medications and blood transfusions are administered to patients by registered nurses (RNs), consistent with State law governing scope of practice, and approved medical staff policies and procedures. Among other things, per sonnel must be able to demonstrate competency in venipuncture, in accordance with State law and hospital policy. If other types of vascular access are utilized, staff must have demonstrated competency in appropriate usage, care, and maintenance. Staff mu st also be trained in early detection of and timely intervention for IV opioid- induced over -sedation and respiratory depression. 5 The 2011 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Report. Retrieved September 27,2013 from http://www.hhs. gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011- nbcus.pdf Education and training regarding these procedures are typically included in the nurse's hospital orientation. Nursing staff w ho receive training for intravenous medication administration and/or blood transfusion administration during hospital orientation or during other continuing education programs would meet the requirements of this regulation. Content of the training must address each required component of the approved medical staff policies and procedures. Other non- practitioners, for example, licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational nurses, with demonstrated competence may also administer IV medications and blood transfusions if they are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice law, and the hospital's approved medical staff policies and procedures. (77 FR 29050, May 16, 2012) For non- practitioners, the appropriate competencies must be documented in the qualified staff person's employee record. All State law and scope of practice requirements must be met regarding the administration of intravenous medications and blood transfusions, as applicable. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(c)(4) Interview nursing staff on different units who administer IV medications and blood transfusions. Are staff knowledgeable with respect to: Venipuncture techniques; Safe medication administration practices, including general practices applying to all types of medications and practices concerning IV tubing and infusion pumps; Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance; Patient assessment for risk related to IV medic ations and appropriate monitoring; Early detection and intervention for IV opioid- induced respiratory depression in post -operative patients; With respect to blood transfusions: Blood components; Process for verification of the right blood product for t he right patient; and Transfusion reactions: identification, treatment, and reporting requirements. Review the files for a sample of staff who administer blood products and IV medications, for evidence that competency was assessed and training was provided as appropriate. If able, observe blood transfusion and IV medication administration to assess staff adherence to accepted standards of practice. Were safe medication administration practices used? Was the transfused patient correctly identified and matched to the correct blood product prior to administration? Was the appropriate access used for IV medications? Were appropriate steps taken with regard to IV tubing and infusion pumps? Are patients being monitored post -infusion for adverse reactions? If staff appear to not be following accepted standards of practice for patient risk assessment related to IV medications, particularly opioids, and appropriate monitoring of patients receiving IV medications and/or blood transfusions, review policies and procedures for IV medication administration and blood transfusion to determine if they address safe practices considerations. Review a sample of medical records. Are blood transfusions and IV medications administered in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures? Are blood transfusions and IV medications administered by personnel who are working within their scope of practice in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies? A-0411 There must be a hospital procedure for reporting transfusion reactions, adverse drug reactions, and errors in administration of drugs. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23 (c)(5) Adverse drug reactions and drug administration errors There is a similar but more detailed and prescriptive requirement concerning internal hospital reporting of adverse drug reactions, drug administration errors and incompatibilities under the Pharmaceutical Services CoP at \u00a7482.25(b)(6). Therefore, it is not necessary for hospitals to establish a different procedure in the case of adverse drug reactions and drug administration errors for such events when nurses administer drugs or transfusions. Consult the guidance for \u00a7482.25(b)(6) to see what must be reported, to whom, and in what timeframe. Failure to make required reports concerning adverse drug reactions and errors in administration of drugs should be cited under \u00a7482.23(c)(5) when the drug was administered by a nurse, as well as under \u00a7482.25(b)(6). Transfusion reactions Transfusion reactions can occur during or after a blood transfusion. A patient's immune system recognizes the foreign blood product and attempts to destroy the transfused cells. Incompatible blood products are typically the cause of transfusion reactions. Symptoms may include back pain, bloody urine, hives, chills, fainting, dizziness, fever, flank pain, and skin flushing. More serious complications may include acute kidney failure, anemia, respiratory distress, shock and even de ath. Transfusion reactions are serious and can be life -threatening. The hospital must have policies and procedures in place for the internal reporting of transfusion reactions. The policies must include procedures for reporting transfusion reactions imm ediately to the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. The transfusion reaction must also be reported to the hospital -wide quality assessment performance improvement program as an adverse event, in accordance with the QAPI CoP at 42 CFR 482 .21(c)(2). The transfusion reaction must be documented in the patient's medical record, including the prompt notification of the responsible practitioner. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.23(c)(5) For adverse drug events and medication administration errors, foll ow the survey procedures for \u00a7482.25(b)(6). Deficiencies are to be cited under both \u00a7482.23(c)(5)and \u00a7482.25(b)(6) when the drug or transfusion related to an adverse drug reaction, transfusion reaction or medication administration error relates to a drug or transfusion administered by a nurse. Request the hospital policy and procedure for internal reporting of transfusion reactions. Interview nursing staff responsible for administering blood transfusions to determine whether they are familiar with and comply with the hospital's policies. Ask to see if there are any transfusion -related incident reports. Is there evidence that the transfusion reaction was reported immediately to the practitioner responsible for the patient's care? Was it reported to th records must document the following, as appropriate: (i) Evidence of -- (A) A medical history and physical examination completed and documented no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services , and except as provided under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section .

Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.23(c) (4)(i)(C) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release. A-0500 (Rev. of Services In order to provide patient safety, drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in accordance with applicable standards of practice, consistent with Federal and State law. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.25(b) Drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations, and in accordance with applicable standards of practice. Applicable standards of practice include compliance with all Federal and State laws, regulations, and guidelines. The procedures established to prevent unauthorized usage and distribution must provide for an accounting of the receipt and disposition of drugs subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Other sources of additional guidelines could include, but are not limited to: American Society of Health -System Pharmacists, American College of Clinical Phar macy, American Pharmacists Association, United States Pharmacopeia, etc. The hospital must have a process in place for medication orders to be received in the pharmacy and dispensed in a safe and timely manner. Safe dispensing of medications must be in accordance with accepted standards of practice and includes, but is not lim ited to, the following: Implementing systems such as dose limits, pre -printed orders, special labeling, or double checks to minimize adverse drug events, especially for high alert medications; Reviewing all medication orders (except in emergency situati ons) for appropriateness by a pharmacist before the first dose is dispensed. A process is established for resolving questions with the prescribing practitioner and the discussion and outcome are documented in the patient's medical record or pharmacy copy of the prescriber's order; This review should include: Therapeutic appropriateness of a patient's medication regimen; Therapeutic duplication in the patient's medication regimen; Appropriateness of the drug, dose, frequency, and route of administration; Real or potential medication -medication, medication -food, medication- laboratory test and medication- disease interactions; Real or potential allergies or sensitivities; and Other contraindications. Medications dispensed by the hospital are retrieved when recalled or discontinued by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety reasons; Policies and procedures that address the use of medications brought into the hospital by patients or their families when self -administration of medications is permitted by hospital policy; and Having a system in place to reconcile medications that are not administered (e.g., left in the patient's medication drawer) when the pharmacy inventories patient medications or restocks patie nt medications. For example, did the patient refuse the medication, was there a clinical or treatment reason the medication was not used, or was the medication not used due to an error? Monitoring the Effects of Medications The pharmaceutical service may be responsible for monitoring the effects of medication(s) specified per hospital policy to assure medication therapy is appropriate and minimizes the occurrence of adverse events. Typically this occurs with anticoagulant therapy and antibiotics prescrib ed for the pharmacy to establish or adjust the dosage (i.e.; \"pharmacy to dose\" order). In such cases, the pharmacy's monitoring process includes: Clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the efficacy of medication therapy to anticipate or evaluate toxicity and adverse effects; Physical signs and clinical symptoms relevant to the patient's medication therapy; Assessing the patient's own perceptions about side effects, and, when appropriate, perceived efficacy. (See also the Nursing CoP discussion regarding monitoring of patients at \u00a7482.23(c)(4)). Survey Procedures \u00a7482.25(b) Are medication orders routinely reviewed by the pharmacy before the first dose? What evidence can the hospital present that such reviews take place? Are questions regardin g medication orders resolved with the prescriber and a written notation of these discussions documented in the patient's medical record or pharmacy copy of the prescriber's order? Does the hospital pharmacy have a system for monitoring the effects of medication therapies for cases specified per hospital policy? Does the hospital retrieve and remove medications available or patient use when the hospital has been informed of a drug recall? A-0501 compounding, packaging, and dispensing of drugs and biologicals must be under the supervision of a pharmacist and performed consistent with State and Federal laws. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.25(b)(1) All pharmaceutical services involving compounding, packaging, or dispensing of drugs and biologicals, must be conducted by or under the supervision of a pharmacist and performed consistent with State and Federal laws. The hospital must adopt and implement written policies and procedures to ensure all medications are prepared by authorized personnel. Compounded Preparations Hospitals use many medications that need to be reconstituted, mixed or which otherwise may be considered \"compounded\" preparations. Some may be compounded in the hospital pharmacy and/or the hospital may obtain some or all from external sources. The external sources could include: (1) Manufacturers; (2) registered outsourcing facilities, and/or compounding pharmacies. Regardless of the source, if accepted standards for safe compounding are not met, compounded medications may contain less or more than the intended dose and/or may be chemically or microbiologically contaminated, with potentially devastating or even lethal consequences for the patients who receive them. Use of Registered Outsourcing Facilities The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), signed into law on November 27, 2013, contains provisions relating to the oversight of compoundi ng of human drugs. The DQSA created a new section 503B in the FDCA under which a compounder may elect to become an \"outsourcing facility.\" The law defines an \"outsourcing facility\" as a facility at one geographic location or address that is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; has elected to register as an outsourcing facility; and complies with all of the requirements of section 503B of the FDCA. Facilities that elect to register as outsourcing facilities, per section 503B: Must comply with the FD A's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. The CGMP requirements make sure that a product is sa fe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. The FDA's publishes the most current versions of its draft and final regulations and guidance related to compounding on its website: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharma cy Com pounding/default.htm ; Will be inspected by FDA according to a risk -based schedule; and Must meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and providing FDA with certain information about the products they compound. In a January 2014 letter to purchasers of compounded medications (available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCom pounding/ucm380596.htm ), the Commissioner of the FDA encouraged the use of registered outsourcing facilities and noted that,\"[a]s a purchaser of compounded drugs, you can play an important role in improving the quality of compounded drugs by requiring compounding pharmacies that supply drugs to your facility to registe r as outsourcing facilities. Once they register, you and the patients you serve can be assured that FDA will inspect these facilities on a risk -based schedule, hold them to CGMP requirements, monitor the adverse event reports they are required to submit to the agency, and require appropriate labeling.\" FDA has posted a list of Registered Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Facilities, including the end date of the last FDA inspection related to compounding, whether investigators observed any significant obj ectionable conditions, and whether other FDA actions were taken based on the last inspection, at: http://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecompliance regulatoryinformation/pharmacycomp oun ding/ucm378645.htm Note that these registered outsourcing facilities are also popularly referred to as \"503B pharmacies.\" Use of Compounding Pharmacies Compounding pharmacies, not registered as an outsourcing facility with the FDA, are popularly referred to as \"503A pharmacies\" and generally are subject to oversight only by their State pharmacy board. If a hospital obtains compounded medications from a compounding pharmacy rather than a manufacturer or a registered outsourcing facility, then the hospital must demonstrate how it assures that the compounded medications it receives under this arrangement hav e been prepared in accordance with accepted professional principles for compounded drugs as well as applicable State or Federal laws or regulations. For example, does the contract with the vendor include provisions: Ensuring that the hospital has access t o quality assurance data verifying that the vendor is adhering to current standards of practice for compounding medications and can the hospital document that it obtains and reviews such data? Requiring the vendor to meet the requirements of Section 503A of the FDCA concerning pharmacy compounding of human drug products? Medications Compounded by the Hospital's Pharmacy Only the pharmacy compounds or admixes all sterile medications, intravenous admixtures, or other drugs except in em ergencies or when not feasible (for example, when there is a need for emergency or immediate patient administration of a compounded s terile preparation). In addition, all compounding of medications used or dispensed by the hospital must be performed consis tent with standards of safe practice applicable to both sterile and non- sterile compounding. Compounded medications, whether non- sterile or sterile, may be subject to physical and chemical contamination and unintended variations in strength. Microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins are particularly hazardous with respect to compounded medications that are intended to be sterile. For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited ASHP Research and Education FoundationTM \"Outsourcing Sterile Products Preparation: Contractor Assessment Tool\" The ASHP Research and Education FoundationTM offers a tool that hospitals may find useful for assessing vendors that provide compounded sterile preparations. The tool can be found at: http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/PracticeTools/Ster ileProductsTo ol.aspx and click on \"Start using Sterile Products Outsourcing Tool now.\" Packaging and Labeling of Medications Safe medication use includes proper packaging and labeling to reduce the risk of error. For individual drug containers: each floor stock drug container is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, and expiration date. Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a beyond- use date (BUD ). In addition, where applicable, each patient's individual drug container is expected to be labeled with the patient's full name and quantity of the drug dispensed. If the unit dose system is utilized, each single unit dose package is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD. Dispensing of Medications Medications must be dispensed by the hospital in a manner that is safe and meets the need s of the patient: Quantities of medications are dispensed which minimize diversion and potential adverse events while meeting the needs of the patient; Medications are dispensed in a timely manner. The hospital must have a system that ensures that medication orders get to the pharmacy and medications get back to patients promptly; Whenever possible, medications are dispensed in the most ready to administer form available from the manufacturer or, if feasible, in unit dose that have been repackaged by the pharmacy; The hospital consistently uses the same dose packaging system, or, if a different system is used, provides education about the use of the dose packaging system; For Information Only Certain provisions of the FDCA address the labeling of prescription drugs generally (e.g., section 503(b)(2) of the FDCA). Section 503B of the FDCA includes labeling requirements for drugs compounded by registered outsourcing facilities (see section 503B(a)(10)). Although hospitals are expected to comply with these requirements, surveyors conducting a Medicare survey do not assess compliance with other Federal laws. All concerns, issues or questions are clarified with the individual prescriber before dispensing; and Medications dispensed by the hospital are retrieved when recalled or discontinued by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety reasons. Medications must be available for administration to patients when needed, including when the pharmacy is not open. Methods to accomplish this when the pharmacy is not open could include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: automated dispensing units outside the pharmacy, night cabinets, contracted services after hours via telepharmacy contracting, on- call pharmacists, etc. Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs) for medications are a secure option for medication storage since they ensure locked storage of medications and allow for electronic tracking of controlled substances and other drugs. These cabinets often have embedded security features, such as login and password or biometric identification so that they can only by accessed by authorized personnel. Policies and procedures must address who can access medications during after- hours. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.25(b)(1) Determine that only pharmacists or pharmacist- supervised personnel compound, package and dispense drugs or biologicals in accordance with State and Federal laws and regulations and accepted standards of practice by: Interviewing pharmacy and hospital staff to determine who prepares and dispenses drugs and biologicals; Observing on site preparation and dispensing operations; Inspecting drug storage areas. Can the hospital demonstrate that compounded medications used and/or dispensed by the hospital are being compounded consistent with standard operating procedures and quality assurance practices ? Can the pharmacy director provide evidence that compounded medications used and/or dispensed by the hospital are being compounded consistent with standard operating procedures and quality assurance practices ? If the hospital obtains compounded products from external compounding sources, are the external source(s) registered with the FDA as outsourcing facilities? If not, can the hospital demonstrate that it systematically evaluates and monitors whether the outs ide compounding pharmacy adheres to accepted standards for safe compounding? Can the pharmacy director explain the risk level(s) of the CSPs being produced in-house and/or obtained from external sources? If any CSPs are produced in the hospital: Ask f or one or more examples of situations in which a BUD had to be determined for a compounded sterile medication (CSP) based on the policy. Interview pharmacy personnel assigned to carry out this function within the hospital and/or to assess how this is done by external source(s) of CSPs. Is there evidence that the BUDs are determined consistent with the hospital's policies and procedures? Interview staff who engage in sterile and non- sterile compounding. Are they knowledgeable about applicable levels of aseptic practices? Ask the pharmacy director to demonstrate how the following are accomplished to ensure that sterile compounding practices are consistent with standards for the risk level(s) of CSPs being produced for/dispensed to hospital patients: Verification of compounding accuracy and sterility; Environmental quality and controls, including environmental sampling; testing and monitoring; and cleaning and disinfection; Personnel training and competency assessment, including but not limited to accuracy/precision in identifying and measuring ingredients; cleansing and garbing; aseptic manipulation skills; environmental quality and disinfection; appropriate work practices within and adjacent to the direct compounding area; verification/calibration of equipment; sterilization; and post- production quality checks. Review the hospital's procedures for maintaining the quality of CSPs during storage, transport and dispensing. Are CSPs packaged in a manner to protect package integrity and sterility? How are CSP -specific requirements with respect to motion, light exposure, temperature and potentially hazardous contents addressed? How does the hospital ensure that such information is effectively conveyed to non- pharmacy health care personnel and/or to patie nts/caregivers, if applicable? Can the hospital document that it is systematically monitoring and tracking adherence to all of the quality assurance and personnel training and competency standards described above? Have any problems or risks been identifie d? If so, did the hospital take effective action to protect patients, if relevant, and to effectively remedy the problem/risk? A-0505 ot herwise unusable drugs and biologicals must not be available for patient use. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.25(b)(3) The hospital must have a pharmacy labeling, inspection, and inventory management system that ensures that outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable drugs and biologicals are not available for patient use. This would include drugs that are the subject of a manufacturer's recall. A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is set by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the FDA approval process. It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration date if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer's approved labeling. A drug or biological is also outdated after its \"beyond- use date\" (BUD), which may be reached before the expiration date, but never later. The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and potential for deterioration and microbial growth that may occur during or after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process if it is a compounded medication. The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such information is available. The hospital must maintain and implement policies and procedures that provide clear and consistent direction to pharmacy staff regarding how to determine a BUD when complete BUD information is not available from the manufacturer. The policies and procedures must be based on accepted professional principles . For individual drug containers: e ach floor stock drug container is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, and expiration date. Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as wel l as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD. In addition, w here applicable, each patient's individual drug container is expected to be labeled with the patient's full name and quantity of the drug dispensed. If the unit dose system is utilized, each single unit dose package is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.25(b)(3) Spot-check the labels of individual drug containers to verify that they conform to Federal and State laws, and/or contain the following minimal information: Each patient's individual drug container bears his/her full name, and strength and quantity of the drug dispensed. Appropriate accessory a nd cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD; Each floor stock container bears the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number of equivalent, expiration date; If the unit dose system is utilized, verify that each single unit dose package bears name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD; Inspect patient -specific and floor stock medications to identify expired, mislabeled or unusable medications . Blood and Blood Components (1)Potentially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious blood and blood components. Potentially HIV infectious blood and blood components are prior collections from a donor - (i) Who tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence of HIV infection on a later donation; (ii) Who tests positive on the su pplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing required by FDA; and (iii) For whom the timing of seroconversion cannot be precisely estimated. (2) Potentially hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious blood and blood components. Potent ially HCV infectious blood and blood components are the blood and blood components identified in 21 CFR 610.47. (3) Services furnished by an outside blood collecting establishment. If a hospital regularly uses the services of an outside blood collecting establishment, it must have an agreement with the blood collecting establishment that governs the procurement, transf er, and availability of blood and blood components. The agreement must require that the blood collecting establishment notify the hospital -- (i) Within 3 calendar days if the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from a donor who tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence of HIV or HCV infection on a later donation or who is determined to be at increased risk for transmitting HIV or HCV infection; (ii) Within 45 days of the test, of th e results of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test for HIV or HCV, as relevant, or other follow -up testing required by FDA; (iii) Within 3 calendar days after the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from an infectious donor, whenever records are available, as set forth at 21 CFR 610.48(b)(3). (4) Quarantine of blood and blood components pending completion of testing. If the blood collecting establishment (either internal or under an agreement) notif ies the hospital of the reactive HIV or HCV screening test results, the hospital must determine the disposition of the blood or blood component and quarantine all blood and blood components from previous donations in inventory. (i) If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing required by FDA is negative, absent other informative test results, the hospital may release the blood and blood components from quarantine. (ii) If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing required by FDA is positive, the hospital must - (A) Dispose of the blood and blood components; and (B) Notify the transfusion recipients as set forth in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. (iii) If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) t est or other follow -up testing required by FDA is indeterminate, the hospital must destroy or label prior collections of blood or blood components held in quarantine as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46(b)(2), 610.47(b)(2), and 610.48(c)(2). (5) Recordkeeping by the hospital. The hospital must maintain -- (i) Records of the source and disposition of all units of blood and blood components for at least 10 years from the date of disposition in a manner that permits prompt retrieval; and (ii) A fully funded plan to transfer these records to another hospital or other entity if such hospital ceases operation for any reason. (6) Patient notification. If the hospital has administered potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood or blood components (either directly through its own blood collecting establishment or under an agreement) or released such blood or blood components to another entity or appropriate individual, the hospital must take the following actions: (i) Make reasonable attempts to notify the patien t, or to notify the attending physician who ordered the blood or blood component and ask the physician to notify the patient, or other individual as permitted under paragraph (b)(10) of this section, that potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood or blood c omponents were transfused to the patient and that there may be a need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling. (ii) If the physician is unavailable or declines to make the notification, make reasonable attempts to give this notification to the patient, legal guardian or relative. (iii) Document in the patient's medical record the notification or attempts to give the required notification. (7) Time frame for notification. For donors tested on or after February 20, 2008. For notifications resulting from donors tested on or after February 20, 2008 as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46 and 21 CFR 610.47 the notification effort begins when the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that it received potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood and blood components. The hospital must make reasonable attempts to give notification over a period of 12 weeks unless -- (i) The patient is located and notified; or (ii) The hospital is unable to locate the patient and documents in the patient's medical record the extenuating circumstances beyond the hospital's control that caused the notification timeframe to exceed 12 weeks. (8) Content of notification. The notification must include the following information: (i) A basic explanation of the need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling. (ii) Enough oral or written information so that an informed decision can be made about whether to obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling. (iii) A list of programs or places where the person can obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling, including any requirements or restrictions the program may impose. (9) Policies and procedures. The hospital must establish policies and procedures for notification and documentation that conform to Federal, State, and local laws, including requirements for the confidentiality of medical records and other patient information. (10) Notification to legal representative or relative. If the pa tient has been adjudged incompetent by a State court, the physician or hospital must notify a legal representative designated in accordance with State law. If the patient is competent, but State law permits a legal representative or relative to receive the information on the patient's behalf, the physician or hospital must notify the patient or his or her legal representative or relative. For possible HIV infectious transfusion recipients that are deceased, the physician or hospital must inform the deceased patient's legal representative or relative. If the patient is a minor, the parents or legal guardian must be notified. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.27(b) This regulation requires the hospital to have a system in place to take appropriate action when notified that blood or blood components it received are at increased risk of transmitting HIV or HCV . Except as otherwise provided in this section \u2014 (i) The hospital must meet the applicable provisions and must proceed in accordance with the Life Safety Code ( NFPA 101 and Tentative Interim Amendments TIA 12 -1, TIA 12-2, TIA 12-3, and TIA 12-4.)

Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61 The clinical record should provide informat ion that indicates need for admission and treatment, treatment goals, changes in status of treatment and discharge planning, and follow -up and the outcomes experienced by patients. The structure and content of the individual patient's record must be an acc urate functional representation of the actual experience of the individual in the facility. It must contain enough information to indicate that the facility knows the status of the patient, has adequate plans to intervene, and provides sufficient evidence of the effects of the intervention, and how their interventions served as a function of the outcomes experienced. You must be able to identify this through interviews with staff, and when possible with individuals being served, as well as through observati ons.

Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(a)(1) Definition: Legal Status is defined in the State statutes and dictates the circumstances under which the patient was admitted and/or is being treated - i.e., voluntary, involuntary, committed by court, evaluation and recertification are in accordance with state requirements . Determine through interview with hospital staff the terminology they use in defining \"legal status.\" If evaluation and recertification is required by the State, determine that legal documentation supporting this status is present. Changes in legal status should also be recorded with the date of change. A-1623 (Rev. provisional or admitting diagnosis must be made on every patient at the time of admission, and must incl ude the diagnosis of intercurrent diseases as well as the psychiatric diagnosis. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(a)(2) There is an admission or working psychiatric diagnosis (including rule -out diagnoses) written in the most current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the approved International Classification of Dise ases (ICD) nomenclature. This diagnosis is made and entered into the chart of each patient at the time of the admission examination. The final diagnosis may differ from the initial diagnosis if subsequent evaluation and observation support a change. If a diagnosis is absent, there must be justification for its absence. For example, if a patient was psychotic on admission and was not accompanied by family or significant others. Intercurrent (other than psychiatric) diagnoses must be documented when they a re made. Attention should be paid to physical examination notes, including known medical conditions, even allergies and recent exposure to infections, illness, or substance abuse, and to available laboratory or test reports which identify abnormal findings to see that these are reflected by appropriate diagnosis. These diagnoses may be found in a variety of locations in the medical record, e.g., the identification/face sheet, the finding of admission physical examination, the psychiatric evaluation the \"ad mission work up \" or the physician's progress notes. Diagnostic categories should include physical illness when present. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(a)(2) Are abnormal physical examination findings and/or laboratory findings justified by further diagnosti c testing and/or development of an intercurrent diagnosis, and, if so, was such done? If an identified physical illness requires immediate treatment, is the treatment being given? How will an identified physical illness be likely to impact on the patient's eventual outcome? To what extent has this potential impact been addressed by the team? A-1624 reasons for admission must be clearly documented as stated by the patient and/or others significantly involved. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(a)(3) The purpose of this regulation is to provide an understanding of what caused the patient to come to the hospital, and the patient's response to admission. The hospit al records the statements and reason for admission given by family and by others, as well as the patient (preferably verbatim), with informant identified, in a variety of locations, e.g., in transfer and admission notes from the physician, nurses and socia l workers. Records should not contain vague, ill -defined reports from unknown sources. Records should record \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where,\" \"when,\" and \"why.\" Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(a)(3) Can the patient describe problems, stresses, situations experienced prior to hospitalization or do they still exist? Who is the informant? Did the informant witness the patient's behavior? If not, on what basis has the informant come to know the patient' s behavior? Has staff elicited whether the patient has exhibited similar behavior previously? If so, what was different this time to make hospitalization necessary? Were there other changes/events in the patient's environment (death, separations of signi ficant others) which contributed to the need for hospitalization? If so, has staff explored how these will impact in the patient's treatment? Has this been addressed by the treatment team? Has there been an interruption or change in the patient's medicati on which may have been a factor in patient's hospitalization? social service records, including reports of interviews with patients, family members, and others, must provide an assessment of home plans and family attitudes, and community resource contacts as well as a social history. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(a)(4) The purpose of the social work assessment is to determine the current baseline social functioning (strengths and deficits) of the patient, from which treatment interventions and discharge plans are to be formulated. Patient length of stay is a key factor influencing hospital documentation policy, i.e., establishing timeframes for completion, documentation, and filing of the psychosocial assessment, and treatment planning in the medical record. A psychosocial history/assessment must be completed on all patients. Three key components to be addressed: A. Factual and Historical Information 1. Specific reasons for the patient's admission or readmission; 2. A description of the patient's past and present biopsychosocial functioning;3. Family and marital history, dynamics, and patient's relationships with family and significant others; 4. Pertinent religious and cultural factors; 5. History of physical, sexual and emotional abuse; 6. Significant aspects of psychiatric, medical, and substance abuse history and treatment as presented by family members and significant others; 7. Educational, vocational, employment, and military service history; 8. Identification of community resources including previously used treatment sources; 9. Identification of present environmental and financial needs. B. Social Evaluation 1. Patient strength and deficit s; 2. High risk psychosocial issues requiring early treatment planning and intervention - i.e., unattended child(ren) in home; prior noncompliance to specific treatment and/ or discharge interventions; and potential obstacles to present treatment and discharge planning. C. Conclusions and Recommendations Assessment of Sections A and B shall result in the development of (C) recommendations related to the following areas: 1. Anticipated necessary steps for discharge to occur; 2. High risk patient and/or fami ly psychosocial issues requiring early treatment planning and immediate intervention regardless of the patient's length of stay;3. Specific community resources/ support systems for utilization in discharge planning - i.e., housing, living arrangements, financial aid, and aftercare treatment sources; 4. Anticipated social work role(s) in treatment and discharge planning. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(a)(4) Does the psychosocial history/assessment indicate: 1. Clear identification of the informants(s) and sources of information? 2. Whether information is considered reliable? 3. Patient participation to the extent possible in provision of data relative to treatment and discharge planning? 4. Integration of significant data including identified high risk psychosocial issues (problems) into the treatment plan? 5. How does the hospital insure the information is reliable? A-1626 indicated, a complete neurological examination must be recorded at the time of the admission physical examination. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(a)(5) Upon admission the patient should receive a thorough history and physical examination with all indicated laboratory examinations. These investigations must be sufficient to discover all structural, functional, systemic and metabolic disorders. A thorough history of the patient's past physical disorders, head trauma, accidents, substance dependence/abuse, exposure to toxic agents, tumors, infections, seizures or temporary loss of consciousness, and headaches, will alert the physician to look for the presence of continuing pathology or possible sequelae any of which may turn out to be signific ant and pertinent to the present mental illness. Equally important is a thorough physical examination to look for signs of any current illness since psychotic symptoms may be due to a general medical condition or substance related disorder. The screening neurological examination As part of the physical examination, the physician will perform a \"screening\" neurological examination. While there is no precise definition of a screening neurological examination in medical practice such examination is expected to assess gross function of the various divisions of the central nervous system as opposite to detailed, fine testing of each division. Gross testing of Cranial Nerves II through XII should be included. Statements such as \"Cranial Nerves II to XII intact\" are not acceptable. These areas may be found in various parts of the physical examination and not just grouped specifically under the neurological. In any case where a system review indicate positive neurological symptomatology, a more detailed examinatio n would be necessary, with neurological work -up or consultation ordered as appropriate after the screening neurological examination was completed. Complete neurological examination. A complete, comprehensive neurological examination includes a review of the patient's history, physical examination and for psychiatric patients, a review of the psychiatric evaluation. The neurologist/psychiatrist himself/herself also takes a history to obtain the necessary information not already available in the medical re cord or referral form. The neurological examination is a detailed, orderly survey of the various sections of the nervous system. As an example, whereas a simple reading of a printed page will be sufficient to assess grossly the patient's sight (cranial ner ve II) in a complete neurological examination, the neurologist may test visual acuity with a snellen chart, perform a fundoscopic examination of both eyes (sometimes after dilating the pupils) and he/she will examine the patient's visual fields. In the exa mination of the motor system, the power of muscle groups of the extremities, the neck and trunk are tested. Where an indication of diminished strength is noted, testing of smaller muscle groups and even individual muscles are tested. In a complete neurolog ical examinations all the systems are examined, but the physician will emphasize even more the areas pertinent to the problem for which the examination was requested. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(a)(5) Did the presence of an abnormal physical finding or la boratory finding justify the need for further diagnostic testing, or for the development of an intercurrent diagnosis? If the finding justified further follow -up in either situation, was such follow -up done? Is there evidence that a screening neurological examination was done and recorded at the time of the physical examination? Was the screening neurological or history indicative of possible involvement (tremors, paralysis, motor weakness or muscle atrophy, severe headaches, seizures, head trauma? If indicated, was a complete, comprehensive neurological exam ordered, completed and recorded in the medical record in a timely manner? A-1630 Evaluation. Each patient must receive a psychiatric evaluation that must \u2014 Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b) The psychiatric evaluation is done for the purpose of determining the patient's diagnosis and treatment and, therefore, it must contain the necessary information to justify the diagnosis and planned treatment. The psychiatric evaluation is a total appraisal or assessment of the patient's illness. It is the physician's assessment of the contributing factors and forces in the evolution of the patient's illness including the patient's perception of his or her illness. Through the psychiatric evaluation the physician seeks to secure a biographical -historical perspective of the patient's personality, with a clear psychological picture of the patien t as a specific human being with his or her individual problems. While performing the psychiatric evaluation, the physician reaches an understanding of the patient's basic personality structure, of the patient's developmental period, of his or her value sy stems, of his or her past medical history including surgical procedures and other treatments, his or her past psychological traumatic experiences, his or her defense mechanisms, his or her supporting systems, any precipitating factors and how all these may have impacted and interplayed with each other to result in the present illness. In the psychiatric evaluation the patient should emerge as a dynamic human being with a past, a present and a potential future with a thread of logical continuity. The psychiatric evaluation includes all the requirements described in this standard and the information necessary to justify the diagnosis and treatment. A physician's signature is necessary. In those cases where the mental status portion of the psychiatric evaluat ion is performed by a non- physician, there should be evidence that the person is credentialed by the hospital, legally authorized by the State to perform that function, and a physician review and countersignature is present, where required by hospital poli cy or State law. In order to satisfy the requirements \u00a7482.61(b) (1 -7) of this standard, and to meet the standards of medical practice, the psychiatric evaluation should include the following component parts: Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(b) The patient's chief complaints and/or reaction to hospitalization, recorded in patient's own words where possible. Why is the patient in the hospital? Was it his/her idea? (Does he/she feel ill/disturbed/frightened?) Is the patient in the hospital against his/her will? Who decided to hospitalize/why? Past history of any psychiatric problems and treatment, including prior precipitating factors, diagnosis, course and treatment. Has the patient been chronically ill? Continuously/repeatedly? How severely has the past illness/treatment interfered with the patient's development and/or adjustment? Are there persistent symptoms/signs/behaviors that must be addressed and treated in order to favorably impact on the future psychiatric course? What medications or supports helped him/her improve in the past? Are the same resources available to impact on the patient's treatment duri ng this episode? Past family, educational, vocational, occupational and social history. To what extent, if any, is there a presence or absence of familial predisposition? What is the patient's educational level? Was he/she a good student? Is he/she stil l interested in learning? What jobs has the patient held? For how long? Is he/she now employed/unemployed? For how long? Has he/she ever worked? How does the patient get along with people? As a child, did he/she have friends? Does he/she have friends now? Within the psychiatric evaluation does one find the specific signs and symptoms, and other factors, that justify the diagnosis? A-1631 hours of admission; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(1) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release A-1632 (Rev. history Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(2) The psychiatric evaluation must include the non- psychiatric medical history including physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities and treatment. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(b)(2) Does the evaluation include: Relevant past surgery? Past medical conditions and disabilities especially those of a chronic nature? Have these contributed to the patient's psychiatric condition? How? Are any of these conditions still present to any significant degree? Are they likely to impact on the patient's recovery/remission? Should they be addressed immediately? Does the facility have the capability to intervene? If not, how is the need to be met? mental status; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(3) The mental status must describe the appearance and behavior, emotional response, verbalization, thought content, and cognition of the patient as reported by the patient and observed by the examiner at the time of the examination. This description is appropriate to the patient's condition. Explore the mental status for descriptions of the patient's presentation during the examination that are relevant to the diagn osis and treatment of the patient. An example of a portion of the patient interview: The patient periodically states the examiner's name correctly during this examination after hearing it once, accurately describes his past history in great detail, precise ly characterizes his present situation, can list events in logical sequence that have led to his present illness, but believes that his pre -admission insomnia, anorexia, and 35 pound weight loss over the past four months are totally the result of his sexua l promiscuity of ten years ago and have nothing to do with his concurrent use of 50 to 60 mg. of Amphetamine daily.\" From this information one can conclude that the patient is oriented, his memory is intact, but that he has poor judgment and no insight. It is not acceptable just to write \"oriented, memory intact, judgment poor, and insight nil,\" without any supportive information. A-1634 of illness and the circumstances leading to admission; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(4) In a hospitalized patient, the identified problem should be related to the patient's need for hospital admission. The psychiatric evaluation includes a history of present illness, including onset, precipitating factors and reason for the current admission, signs and symptoms, course, and the results of any treatment received. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(b)(4) How long has the patient been ill? Was it a gradual or sudden onset? Is this a recurrence? What were the precipitating factors? What happened? What symptoms, signs, behaviors made this hospitalization necessary? What treatment has the patient already r eceived before coming to the hospital? Is any medication he received listed? \u00a7482.61(b)(5) The problem statement should describe behavior(s) which require change in order for the patient to function in a less restrictive setting. The identified problems may also include behavioral or relationship difficulties with significant others which require ac tive treatment in order to facilitate a successful discharge. A-1636 and Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(6) inventory of the patient's assets in descriptive, not interpretive fashion. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(b)(7) Although the term strength is often used interchangeably with assets, only the assets that describe personal factors on which to base the treatment plan or which are useful in therapy represent personal strengths. Strengths are personal attributes i.e., knowledge, interests, skills, aptitudes, personal experiences, education, talents and employment status, which may be useful in developing a meaningful treatment plan. For purposes of the regulation, words such as \"youth,\" \"pretty,\" \"Social Security income,\" and \"has a car\" do Plan. Each patient must have an individualiz ed, comprehensive treatment plan based on an inventory of the patient's strengths and disabilities. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(1) The patient and treatment team collaboratively develop the patient's treatment plan. The treatment plan is the outline of what the hospital has committed itself to do for the patient, based on an assessment of the patient's needs. The facility selects its format for treatment plans and treatment plan updates. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.61(c)(1) Determination of compliance regarding treatment plans is accomplished by the surveyor using the following methods, and to the extent possible, the following order: 1. Observation of the patient and staff at planned therapies/meetings, in various settings both on and off the patient units, in formal and informal staff -patient interactions and in a variety of daily settings; 2. Interviews with patients, families, treatment staff and others involved directly or indirectly with active treatment; 3. Reviews of scheduled treatment programs (individual, group, family meetings, therapeutic activities, therapeutic procedures); 4. Attendance at multidisciplinary treatment planning meetings, if time permits; and 5. Medical record review. Has the information gaine d from assessing/evaluating the patient been utilized to create an individualized treatment plan? A disability is any psychiatric, biopsychosocial problem requiring treatment/intervention. The term disability and problem are used interchangeably. The trea tment plan is derived from the information contained in the psychiatric evaluation and in the assessments/diagnostic data collected by the total treatment team. Based on the assessment summaries formulated by team members of various disciplines, the treatment team identifies which patient disabilities will be treated during hospitalization. Patient strengths that can be utilized in treatment must be identified. (See also \u00a7482.61(b)(7).) Treatment planning depends on several variables; whether the admission is limited to crisis intervention, short -term treatment or long -term treatment. The briefer the hospital stay, the fewer disciplines may be involved in the patient's treatment. There must be evidence of periodic review of the patient's response and progr ess toward meeting planned goals. If the patient has made progress toward meeting goals, or if there is a lack of progress, the review must justify: (1) continuing with the current goals and approaches; or (2) revising the treatment plan to increase the po ssibility of a successful treatment outcome. Consideration must be given to the type of psychiatric program(s) under review to determine the timeframe for treatment plan review. The interval within which treatment plan reviews are conducted is determined by the hospital, however, the hospital's review system must be sufficiently responsive to ensure the treatment plan is reviewed: whenever a goal(s) has been accomplished; when a patient is regressing; when a patient is failing to progress; or when a patie nt requires a new treatment goal. The facility is expected to pursue aggressively the attendance of all relevant participants at the team meetings. Question any routine and regular absences of individuals who would be expected to attend. Is the treatment p lan individualized, i.e., patient -specific, or is there a predictable sameness from plan to plan? When packaged plans or programs are used, do staff include needed individual adaptations in the plan? Are the patient's observed behaviors consistent with the problems and strengths identified in the plan or update? Have the views which the patient communicated to the surveyor regarding problems which require treatment during hospitalization and plans for discharge, been incorporated in the plan or update ? A-1641 (Rev. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(i) The substantiated diagnosis serves as the basis for treatment interventions. A substantiated diagnosis is the diagnosis identified by the treatment team to be the primary focus upon which treatment planning will be based. It evolves from the synthesis of data from various disciplines. At the time of admission, the patient may have been given an initial diagnosis or a rule - out diagnosis. At the time of treatment planning, a substantiated diagnosis must be recorded. It may be the same as the initial diagnos is, or, based on new information and assessment, it may differ. Rule -out diagnoses, by themselves are not acceptable as a substantiated diagnosis. Data to substantiate the diagnosis may be found in, but is not limited to, the psychiatric evaluation, the medical history and physical examination, laboratory tests, medical and other psychological consults, assessments done by disciplines involved in patient evaluations and information supplied from other sources such as community agencies and significant oth ers. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(i) What specific problems will be treated during the patient's hospitalization? Does the treatment plan identify and precisely describe problem behaviors rather than generalized statements i.e., \"paranoid,\" \"aggres sive,\" \"depressed?\" or \"ineffective coping,\" \"alteration in mood?\" Are physical problems identified and included in the treatment plan if they require treatment, or interfere with treatment, durin g the patient's range goals; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(ii) Based on the problems identified for treatment, short- term and long -range goals are developed. Whether the use of short -term or a combination of short -term and long -range goals is appropriate is dependent on the length of hospital stay. Short -term and long- range goals include specific dates for expected achievement. As goals are achieved, the treatment plan should be revised. When a goal is modified, changed or discontinued without achievement, the plan should be reviewed for relevancy, and updated as needed. In crisis intervention and short -term treatment there may be only one timeframe for treatment goals. As the length of hospital stay increases (often because of the long -term chronic nature of the patient's illness), both long -range and short -term goals are needed. The long- range goal is achieved through the development of a series of short -term goals, i.e., smaller, logical sequential steps which will result in reaching the long -range goal. Both the short -term and long -range goals must be stated as expect ed behavioral outcomes for the patient. Goals must be related to the problems identified for treatment. Goals must be written as observable, measurable patient behaviors to be achieved. Discharge criteria may be included as long -range goals. Survey Proced ures \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(ii) How do treatment plan goals relate to the problems being treated? Do goals indicate the outcomes to be achieved by the patient? Are the goals written in a way that allow changes in the patient's behavior to be measured? If no t apparent, what criteria do staff use to measure success? How relevant are the treatment plan goals to the patient's condition? Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(iii) This requirement refers to all of the planned treatment modalities used to treat the patient during hospitalization. Having identified the problems requiring treatment, and definin g outcome goals to be achieved, appropriate treatment approaches must be identified. Modalities include all of the active treatment measures provided to the patient. It describes the treatment that will be provided to the patient. It describes the treatme nt that will be provided by various staff. A daily schedule of unit activities does not, in itself, constitute planned modalities of treatment. It is expected that when a patient attends various treatment modalities/activities, it is a part of individualized planning with a specific purpose and focus for that patient. Simply \"naming\" modalities (i.e., individual therapy, group therapy, occupational therapy, medication education) is not acceptable. The focus of the treatment must be included. Simply \"stating\" modality approaches (i.e., \"set limits,\" needed\") is not acceptable. Modality approaches must be specifically described in order to assure consistency of approach. Observation of staff implementing treatment, both in structured and non- structured settings, is a major criterion to determine whether active treatment is being provided in accordance with planned treatment. It must be clear to you that the active treatment received by the patient is internally consistent and not simply a series of disconnected specific modalities delivered within certain scheduled intervals. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(iii) Are qualified staff observed following the methods, approaches and staff intervent ion as stated? Can staff explain the focus of the modality they have provided? Are observed treatment methods, approaches and interventions from all disciplines included in the plan? Do the pieces of the treatment plan work together to achieve the gr eatest possible gain for the patient? Does the hospital integrate its activities, therapies, treatments, and patient routines to work for the patient's therapeutic interest first, and its own convenience second? Do the disciplines present at observed treatment planning meetings represent all of the patient's needs? If the patient attends treatment planning, how do the staff prepare the patient to participate? If the patient does not attend, what reasons do staff give to explain the absence? Is ther e a process to enable staff to reach a consensus regarding how treatment will be carried out? Is the patient included in the decision- making, whenever possible? Are the final decisions regarding treatment approaches defined clearly by the end of the discussion? How does the patient get to know his/her treatment regime? How does the treatment team encourage the patient to accept responsibility for engaging in the treatment regime, rather than accepting it passively? A-1644 the treatment team; and Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c )(1)(iv) There are no \"correct\" number of staff who comprise the treatment team. The disciplines involved in the patient's treatment depend upon the problems to be treated, the short -term and long -range goals and the treatment approaches and modalities used to achieve the goals. The intent of the regulation is to insure that each individual on the treatment team who is primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with particular aspects of the patient's individualized treatment program is identified. I dentification of the staff should be recorded in a manner that includes the name and discipline of the individual. If other professionals or paraprofessionals provide care, the facility has the latitude to decide the manner with which it will identify them on the treatment plan. The patient, as well as family/significant others, should be aware of the staff responsible for various aspects of treatment. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(iv) Are staff who are designated in the treatment plan observed carryin g out treatment activities and therapies? Is the information in the plan consistent with surveyor observations? Are the patients able to name the staff responsible for implementing their treatment? Is this information consistent with the treatment plan? documentation to justify the diagnosis and the treatment and rehabilitation activities carried out. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(v) When the progress and treatment notes are reviewed, the content of the notes must relate to the treatment plan. The notes must indicate what the hospital staff is doing to carry out the treatment plan and the patient's response to the interventions. Surve y Procedures \u00a7482.61(c)(1)(v) Are the treatment notes relative to the identified problems? Are the treatment notes indicative of the patient's response to treatment? Do the progress notes relate to specific patient problems or progress? A-1650 treatment received by the patient must be documented in such a way to assure that all active therapeutic efforts are included. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(c)(2) Active treatment is an essential requirement for inpatient psychiatric care. Active treatment is a clinical process involving ongoing assessment, diagnosis, intervention, evaluation of care and treatment, and planning for discharge and aftercare, under the direction of a psychiatrist. The patient is in the hospital because it has been determined that the patient requires intensive, 24 hour, specialized psychiatric intervention that cannot be provided outside the psychiatric hospital. The medical record mus t indicate that the hospital adheres to the patient's right to be counseled about medication, its intended effects, and the potential side effects. If the patient requires, because of danger to self or others, a more restrictive environment, the hospital m ust indicate that the staff attempted to care for the patient in the least restrictive setting before progressing to a more restrictive setting. Through observation, look for evidence that each patient is receiving all the aspects of treatment to which the hospital has committed itself based upon his/her assessment, evaluation and plan of care. It is the hospital's responsibility to provide those treatment modalities with sufficient frequency and intensity to assure that the patient achieves his/her optimal level of functioning. Through observation and interviews, look for evidence that each patient's rights are being addressed and protected. There should be policies and procedures in place to address the following areas: informed consent, confidentiality, privacy, and security. Expect to see detailed policies and procedures regarding the therapeutic use of restrictions, such as visitors, mail, and phone calls. Seclusion and restraint policies and procedures must address patient protection and safety while i n a restricted setting. Clarification of the types of notes found in the medical record. Treatment notes are recordings in the medical record that indicate provision of, and a patient's response to, a specific modality. This modality may be drug therapy, individual, family, marital, or group therapy, art therapy, recreational therapy, and any specialized therapy ordered by the physician or anyone credentialed by the facility, in accordance with the State law, to write orders in the medical record. A comb ined treatment and progress note may be written. Progress notes are recordings in the medical record that are written by persons directly responsible for the care and active treatment of the patient. Progress notes give a chronological picture of how the patient is progressing toward the accomplishment of the individual goals in the treatment plan. These are frequently shift notes, weekly notes, or monthly notes. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(c)(2) Does the patient know his/her diagnosis? What did the pat ient contribute to the formulation of the treatment plan? Goals of treatment? If the patient receives medication, does the patient understand the reason for the medication? The name of the medication? The dose prescribed? The time of administration? The desired effects? The potential side effects? If medication is changed, is there a rationale for the change? Are staff members recording their observations relative to the patient's response to the treatment modalities, including medication? Is there evidence that the patient was afforded the opportunity to participate in his/her plan of care? What progress has the patient made? Has the patient achieved his/her optimal level of functioning? If not, why? Are these reasons/barriers reflected in the curr ent treatment plan? Do treatment and progress notes support these insights? Does the observed status of the patient in the various treatment modalities correspond to the progress note reports of status? Do all treatment team members document their observations and interventions so that the information is available to the entire team? If a restrictive procedure is used (e.g., restraint and/or seclusion), is there evidence that attempts were made systematically to treat the patient in the least restr ictive manner? Is there evidence that the rights of the patient were protected while in the restrictive setting in accordance with Federal and State law and accepted standards of practice? A-1655 Progress. Progress notes must be recorded by the physician(s), psychologists, or other licensed independent practitioner(s) responsible for the care o f the patient as specified in \u00a7482.12(c); nurse, social worker and, when appropriate, others significantly involved in active treatment modalities. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(d) Refer to \u00a7482.61(c)(2) Interpretive Guidelines for clarification between treatment notes and progress notes. The recording of progress is evidence of individual patient performance. Specifically, the progress notes recorded by the professional staff, or others responsible for the patient's treatment, must give a chronological picture of the patient's progress or lack of progress towards attaining short and long- range goals outlined in the individual treatment plan. Progress notes should relate to the goals of the treatment plan. Notes that state, \"pati ent slept well\" or \"no complaints\" constitute observations and do not indicate how the patient is responding to treatment and progressing towards set goals. Frequency alone does not determine the adequacy of progress notes. Expect to see greater frequency when patients are more acutely ill and/or in a crisis of some kind. Notes should be dated and signed (signature and title or discipline). Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(d) Are the physicians who are significantly involved in active treatment modalities/interv entions actually documenting progress? Do the progress notes relate to the goals of the treatment plan? Do they include precise statements of progress? Is there a correlation between what is observed by the surveyor and what is described in the notes? Do the notes give a clear picture of the patient's progress or lack thereof, during the course of hospitalization? In reviewing the patient's progress, are aftercare/discharge plans being evaluated? Are the nurses who are significantly involved in active treatment modalities/interventions actually documenting progress? Are the social workers that are significantly involved in active treatment modalities/interventions plan actually documenting progress? Are staff from other disciplines, i.e., rehabilita tive therapy and psychology, which are significantly involved in active treatment modalities/interventions actually documenting progress? frequency of progress notes is determined by the condition of the patient but must be recorded at least weekly for the first 2 months and at least once a month thereafter . . .

Are the progress notes related to the goals of the treatment plan? A-1670 Discharge planning and discharge summary. The record of each patient who has been discharged must have a discharge summary that includes a recapitulation of the patient's hospitalization and... Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482 .61(e) The record of each patient who has been discharged should indicate the extent to which goals established in the patient's treatment plan have been met. As part of discharge planning, staff consider the discharge alternatives addressed in the psychosocial assessment and the extent to which the goals in the treatment plan have been met. The surveyor should refer to hospital policy for discharge timeframes. The discharge summary should contain a recapitulation of the patient's hospitalization, which is a summary of the circumstances and rationale for admission, and a synopsis of accomplishments achieved as reflected through the treatment plan. This summary includes the reasons for admission, treatment achieved during hospitalization, a baseline of the psychiatric, physical and social functioning of the patient at the time of discharge, and evidence of the patient/family response to the treatment interventions. A-1671 of each patient who has been discharged must have a discharge summary that includes] . . . recommendations from appropriate services concerning follow -up or aftercare as well as ... Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(e) The patient's discharge summary should describe the services and supports that are appropriate to the patient's needs and that will be effective on the day of discharge. Examples include: A complete description of arrangements with treatment and other community reso urces for the provision of follow -up services. Reference should be made to prior verbal and written communication and exchange of information; A plan outlining psychiatric, medical/physical treatment and the medication regimen as applicable; Specific appointment date(s) and names and addresses of the service provider(s); Description of community housing/living arrangement; Economic/financial status or plan, i.e., supplemental security income benefits; Recreational and leisure resources; and A complete description of the involvement of family and significant others with the patient after discharge. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.61(e) How does the discharge planning process verify appointment source(s), dates and addresses? How was the patient inv olved in the discharge and aftercare planning process? Were discharge related documents made available to the patient, family, community treatment source and/or any other appropriate sources? Is there indication that the discharge planning process included the participation of multidisciplinary staff and the patient? Have the results been communicated to the post- hospital treatment entity? Is there evidence that contact with the post -hospital treatment entity included communication of treatment recommendations (including information regarding the patient's medications)? Is a contact person named, and does the patient have a specific appointment date and time for the initial follow -up visit? A-1672 of each patient who has been discharged must have a discharge summary that includes ] ... a brief summary of the patient's condition on discharge. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.61(e) The patient's discharge planning process should address anticipated problems after discharge and suggested means for intervention, i.e., accessibility and availability of community resources and support systems including transportation, special problems related to the patient's functional ability to participate in aftercare planning. The discharge summary and/or plan should contain information about the status of the patient on the day of discharge, including psychiatric , physical and functional condition. A-1680 Participation: Special Staff Requirements for Psychiatric Hospitals The hospital must have adequate numbers of qualified professional and supportive staff to evaluate patients, formulate written, individualized comprehensive treatment plans, provide active treatment measures and engage in discharge planning. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62 The purpose of this Condition of Participation is to ensure that the psychiatric hospital is adequately staffed with qualified mental health professionals and supportive staff to carry out an intensive and comprehensive active treatment program and to protect and promote the phy sical and mental health of the patients. Through observation, interview and record review determine if numbers and/or deployment of qualified staff is a concern. Review incident reports, medication error reports, patient and staff injury reports, for indi cations that staffing is an issue. Adequate numbers are defined to mean the numbers, and deployment, of staff with qualifications to evaluate, plan, implement and document active treatment. Do not look at numbers alone. The hospital is responsible for or ganizing its available staff and administrative duties along with patient appointments, treatment plan meetings, treatment sessions, activities, materials, equipment and patient assignments to wards and groups in such a way that results in patients achievi ng the maximum therapeutic benefit. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.62 Assess the adequacy of the Special Staffing Condition by: 1. Observing sampled patients and others during structured sessions and in unstructured settings. You should be able to observe behavioral evidence of a rational organization of resources. 2. Next, interview patients and staff to determine whether or not necessary treatment modalities and other services are being provided in a timely manner. 3. Next review the medical records of patients in the sample to ascertain if necessary active treatment assessments, treatments, evaluations and activities have been conducted and documented. 4. Also, review other records such as restraint and seclusion records, incident reports, medication error reports, reports of patient/staff injuries, etc., to determine the extent to which staffing levels or deployment contributed to negative patient outcomes. 5. Evaluate all outcome data in light of the success or failure observed during the survey relevant to each patient receiving active treatment, and achieving desired outcomes of care. This is the primary basis for evaluating the adequacy of the hospital's staffing under this Special Condition. A-1685 The hospital must employ or undertake to provide adequate numbers of qualified professional, technical, and consultative personnel to: (1) Evaluate Patients. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(a)(1) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(a)(1) Is there adequate staff to assure that the admission work -ups (assessment, diagnostic data gathering) are completed in a timely manner? Is there evidence that there is continuing evaluation of the patient's progress and response to treatment? Are evaluati ons must employ or undertake to provide adequate numbers of qualified professional, technical, and consultative personnel to:] (2) Formulate written individualized, comprehensive treatment plans; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(a)(2) Staffing mus t be sufficient so that members of the patient's treatment team and others responsible for evaluation and assessment can contribute their respective data for consideration in the formulation of the treatment plan. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(a)(2) Was there sufficient discipline participation at the treatment team meeting to assure formulation of a treatment plan that meets the patient's individualized needs? What problems prevent staff members from attending treatment meetings? Do they relate to staffing? Are the assessments/evaluations absent or delayed to the extent that they are not useful to the treatment team for the purpose of planning individualized t reatment? A-1687 must employ or undertake to provide adequate numbers of qualified professional, technical, and consultative personnel to:] (3) Provide active treatment measures; and Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(a)(3) Active treatment occurs when the patient receives treatment interventions that are delivered under the direction of a physician, and which are specific to patient strengths, disabilitie s, and problems identified in the treatment plan. Treatment interventions and other services are furnished in accordance with accepted standards of professional practice. Although the active treatment process must be identifiable in documentation, it must be first and foremost observable and evident in daily practice. Treatment interventions need to be individualized, in that the patient receives assistance with resolving or ameliorating the problems/circumstances that led to hospitalization. Expect to see treatment focused on the unique needs of individual patients. For example, several patients may be referred to \"Anger Management Group,\" but the focus of discussion and therapeutic intervention may differ depending on the individual patient's particular i ssue regarding managing anger. Whether structure must be imposed by staff or whether the patient can direct his or her own activities for periods of time (without staff supervision), is based on the patient's ability to engage in constructive, appropriate behavior (without engaging in harm to self or others). Be certain that the patient's time on the unit is maximized toward the further development of appropriate desired outcomes, including but not limited to leisure and recreation. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(a)(3) Through observation, interviews and record reviews, can you determine that patients receive active treatment? Is the distribution of staff consistent with particular patient needs? Is appropriate staffing sufficient to carry out treatment plans? Does the patient attend therapies that are relevant to the identified problems that brought the patient to the hospita l? Are staff absences and/or vacancies preventing the patient from receiving active treatment? Are patients not attending therapeutic activities off the unit because there is no staff to escort them? Are therapeutic groups not available on the unit for patients who are not able to go off the unit? Are patients observed not engaged in activities while staff attend to administrative tasks? Are active treatment sessions or activities carried out at discrete time intervals exclusively? Or is active treatment implemented as the patient's needs emerge during the course of the day, as well? Does a review of quality assurance data reveal a pattern of serious incidents occurring on particular shifts and/or days of the week? What do patients report to the sur veyor are their treatment modalities? Do patient interviews indicate that patients believe the treatment being provided is helpful? Does the scheduling of activities and their content relate directly to the patient's treatment objectives or are the act ivities/content generalized, non- therapeutic \"time- fillers\"? Can staff describe how their activities relate to the patient's treatment objectives? At any point in time, in any of the patient's experiences in the hospital is the thrust of the patient's treatment plan observable during the staff and/or patient interactions? Is there a consistent, observable pattern of evidence that hospital staff provide, reinforce and otherwise implement measures to achieve active treatment objectives? A-1688 must employ or undertake to provide adequate numbers of qualified professional, technical, and consultative personnel to:] (4) Engage in discharge planning . Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(a)(4) The patient together with all relevant professionals caring for the patient should be expected to participate in the discharge planning process. Staffing should be sufficient to facilitate this outcome, to the maximum extent possible. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(a)(4) Do patients participate in their discharge planning process? If not, why? Do staff interviews elicit information that staff working with patients are aware of the discharge plans for those patients? Do record review and interviews indicate that all relevant staff have participated in discharge planning? A-1690 medical staff. Inpatient psychiatric services must be under the supervision of a clinical director, service chief, or equivalent who is qualified to provide the leadership required for an intensive trea tment program ... Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(b) Inpatient psychiatric services include the following functions: admission interviews, assessments and evaluations; psychiatric and medical work -ups; treatment team leadership; medication management; on -call provision of emergency psychiatric and medical treatment; provision of individual, group and family therapies; provision of clinical supervision to other professionals and paraprofessionals; provision of medical and psychiatric educational workshops and conferences for all staff; and provision of consultation to staff for clinical and/or administrative matters. The clinical director is ultimately responsible for the medical and psychiatric care that is provided to patients. The clinical director should ascertain that quality improvement programs are in place to monitor all areas of patient care, and should implement educational programs for all levels of staff. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.62(b) Just prior to the end of the survey, schedule a meeting with the clinical director. By the time of this meeting, you should already have conducted required observation, interviews and record reviews for at least a majority of the patients in the sample. Collect any additional information that is necessary to conside r in light of outcomes observed for patients, including: the qualifications of the clinical director; the leadership exhibited for the scope of psychiatric/medical treatment programs needed by patients; and the rationale for medical staffing coverage. If n ecessary, follow -up on letters of complaint previously reported serious problems, discrepancies with Data Collection Medical Staff Coverage (CMS -729). A-1691 and qualifications of doctors of medicine and osteopathy must be adequate to provide essential psychiatric services . Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(b) The number of full -time, part- time and consulting staff, who are board certified within each catego ry and their availability to the hospital must be adequate to provide psychiatric services, as described above. Adequacy is considered in light of the following: 1. Number of admissions, discharges and current patients by treatment units; 2. Size of the hospital; 3.

Availability of physicians to participate in tr eatment planning; 7. Availability of psychiatrists to consult with non- psychiatric physicians about psychotropic medication regimens; and 8. Availability of physicians to consult with multi- disciplinary staff about treatment issues. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(b) How many staff are board certified? Fully trained? How many full -time/part- time specialties are represented? How are medical staff deployed? To what programs/units are they assigned? Why? How much time do physicians spend on the units? Based on observations, interviews, and medical record reviews is coverage adequate to meet the needs of sampled patients? To meet the needs of other patients observed during the survey? A-1692 clinical director, service chief or equivalent must meet the training and experience requirements for examination by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, or the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychia try. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(b)(1) A physician is qualified to take the examinations for board certification upon successful completion of a psychiatric residency program approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and/or the American Osteopathic Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(b)(1) Review the clinical director's personnel folder or ask the clinical director if he/she has one of the following: a. Certification of the American Board of Psychiat ry and Neurology and/or certification of the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry. b.

After 1988, it has to be a four year accredited program. A-1693 (Rev. director must monitor and evaluate the quality and appropriateness of services and treatment provided by the medical staff. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(b)(2) Services and treatment prescribed to patients must be in accordance with appropriate and acceptable s tandards of practice. In states that allow psychologists to have admitting privileges, it is still the responsibility of the clinical director to oversee the quality of the patient's treatment. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62 (b)(2) What mechanisms does the director use to monitor and evaluate the work of the medical staff (personal interviews? Quality Improvement reports? incident reports?)? When problems are discovered by the clinical director, how are they corrected? Are services, notes, and reports ti mely? Are medications used appropriately for the patient's of medical personnel. Doctors of medicine or osteopathy and other appropriate professional personnel must be available to provide necessary medical and surgical diagnostic and treatment services. If medical and surgical diagnostic services and treatment are not available within the institution, the institution must have an agreement with an outside source of these services to ensure that they are immediately available or a satisfactory agreement must be established for transferring patients to a general hospital that participates in the Medicare program. Interpretiv e Guidelines \u00a7482.62(c) Contracts or other arrangements with individuals and/or providers assure that medical and surgical services are available to meet the needs of the patients. Review the medical and surgical services provided by the hospital during t he interview with the clinical director. Discuss contract or arrangements with the clinical director for services provided off grounds. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(c) How did the hospital meet the medical/surgical/diagnostic needs represented by each patient in the sample? Were these done timely? Appropriately? If contracts are not current or available, how are these services provided for the patient, if needed? Is there evidence of negative outcomes as a result of these arrangements? Are reports from other services such as pharmacy, radiology, and clinical laboratory timely? services. The hospital or unit must have a qualified director of psychiatric nursing services. In addition to the director of nursing, there must be adequate numbers of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and mental health workers to provide nursing care necessary under each patient's act ive treatment program and to maintain progress notes on each patient. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(d) Psychiatric nursing functions may include the following: supervision of paraprofessional staff; assessment, planning, provision, and evaluation of psychiatric nursing care to patients; medication teaching; management of the therapeutic milieu; provision of mandatory and voluntary in- service training to all staff; and provision of specialized treatments and therapies, such as individual, group and fam ily therapies, that require the clinical expertise of a professional psychiatric nurse. Expect to see evidence of orientation programs as well as ongoing continuing education programs for Licensed Practical Nurses and mental health workers that stress individualized treatment interventions. Determine that there is a qualified Director of Nursing (DON) providing the required leadership and supervision for the psychiatric nursing department. A-1701 (Rev. director of psychiatric nursing services must be a registered nurse who has a master's degree in psychiatric or mental health nursing or its equivalent from a school of nursing accredited by the National League for Nursing, or be qualified by education and experience in the care of the mentally ill . . . Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(d)(1) During the interview with the DON, assess his/her educational background and psychiatric nursing and leadership skills. If the DON has less than a Master's Degree in Psychiatric Nursing, expect to see evidence of experience and on -going training in psychiatric nursing. Documented consultation from a nurse with a Master's in Psychi atric Nursing constitutes on- going training. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(d)(1) Are nursing assessments completed on all patients? Do the multidisciplinary treatment plans reflect nursing input which include specific nursing interventions for nursing problems (e.g. violence toward self/others, physical/medical crises)? Is nursing care evaluated by an R.N., with changes in the care b ased on the patient's progress or lack thereof? Are intrusive techniques (e.g. seclusion, restraint, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and/or medical procedures) and patient incidents (e.g. medication errors, patient falls, patient -to-patient and patient -to-staff injuries) monitored in accordance with hospital policy, State statutes and safe nursing practice? Are nursing personnel observed relating to patients in a therapeutic manner? A-1702 demonstrate competence to participate in interdisciplinary formulation of individual treatment plans; to give skilled nursing care and therapy; a nd to direct, monitor, and evaluate the nursing care furnished. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(d)(1) Based on structured observations of the patients in the sample and other patients in the hospital, patient and staff interviews and medical record review, ascertain that nursing services are provided in accordance with safe, acceptable standards of nursing practice. Information obtained from the DON should include: implementation of continuous quality improvement programs; provision of orientation, in -service and continuing education programs for nursing personnel especially in the areas of psychiatric nursing, nursing process, prevention and management of violence, CPR and Universal Precautions. A-1703 staffing pattern must ensure the availability of a registered nurse 24 hours each day. . . . Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(d)(2) Guidance is pending and will be updated in future release A-1704 (Rev. must be adequate numbers of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and mental health workers to provide the nursing care necessary under each patient's active treatment program. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(d)(2) The evaluation of sufficient numbers and level of RNs, LPNs and mental health workers is based on the patient characteristics as seen in structured observations of patients in the sample and other patients in the hospital, patient interviews, and as evidenced in medical records and other data related to patients (e.g. incident reports, seclusion/restraint reports). Patient care assignments should be appropriate to the skills and qualifications of the nursing personnel providing patient care. There should be evidence that all nursing personnel have education, experience and/or training in psychiatric care. Mental health workers spend the majority of their workday interacting with patients. Exp ect to see evidence that they are receiving on -going supervision and training. Mental health workers should be assigned patient care duties and therapeutic modalities that reflect their educational level, psychiatric training, and experience. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.62(d)(2) The nursing staffing patterns should be reviewed on a sample of approximately 25% of the certified wards. The staffing, including levels of nursing personnel, should be reviewed for the day(s) of the survey and evaluated based on the level of needs present ed by the patients. Additional staffing patterns shall be reviewed if a problem or concern is evidenced. Decisions regarding extent of additional data (number of wards and dates) to be reviewed shall be based on the degree of problem/concern. Patient need assessment/patient acuity shall be reviewed for any wards as deemed necessary based on problems/concerns found in the sampling review. If your observations and/or interviews indicate a staffing problem, you may want to consider the following variables in assessing adequacy of nursing personnel coverage: 1. Organization and types of services provided to patie nts by the nursing department; 2. Number and levels of nursing care needs of patients, including average length of stay, acuity of patients and nursi ng care requirements; 3. Number and levels of nursing personnel based on the roles and functions required of nursing; 4. Number of suicidal/assaultive patients; 5. and 7. Number and ty pe of accidents and/or injuries; 8. Amount and complexity of medication regimens; 9. Medication errors; 10. Use of P.R.N. (as needed) medications; 11. Medical (physical) procedures; 12. Assignment and utilization of \"pool\" nursing personnel (those staf f who are hired through a contract service and are not employees of the hospital). Contractual staff should receive orientation and training necessary for assigned functions, and should be supervised by employees of the hospital; 13. Availability of RNs to supervise/consult with nursing/non- nursing personnel about patient care; 14. Availability of RNs to assess and implement care in crisis situations; 15. Availability of RNs to interact with patients in structured activities; and 16. Involvement of patients with personnel. A-1710 Services. The hospital must provide or have available psychological services to meet the needs of the patients. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(e) Psychology services may include the following: diagnostic testing and diagnostic formulations on request from physicians; provision of individual, group and family therapies; participation in multi- disciplinary treatment conferences; and program development and evaluation. The number of full -time, part- time and consulting psychologists must be adequate to provide necessary services to patients. Arrangements with outside resources must assure that necessary patient services will be provided. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(e) Did the patients in the sample have a need for psychological services or testing? Were they provided in a timely manner and with sufficient intensity? Did any of the patient s in the sample indicate a need for psychological services, but none were requested? What types of psychological services are offered? (e.g., assessments, therapy) Do certain groups of patients receive testing routinely? Dementia?, Children?, Adolescen ts? Why? Once tests are performed, are results reported in sufficient time to be integrated in the patient's active treatment and treatment plan? How does the hospital or Psychological Service Department determine whether or not: it meets the needs of patients? Its services are underutilized or over -utilized? Why have psychological services staff been deployed in the manner that they have? A-1715 . There must be a director of social services who monitors and evaluates the quality and appropriateness of social services furnished. The services must be furnished in accordance with accepted standards of practice and established policies and procedures. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482. 62(f) Social work functions may include the following functions: Intake or admission screening, psychosocial assessment of a newly admitted patient; developing an update or detailed re -assessment of the patient; high -social risk case finding; contact with family and others significant in the patient's life. Such functions may include patient and family education, support, and advocacy; providing coordination/liaison with community -based social and mental health agen cy(ies) regarding the pre -admission status of the patient; participating as a member of the treatment team in development of treatment planning and subsequent planned interventions (modalities). Such modalities may include supportive, individual, couple, f amily, or group therapy, aimed at meeting specified goals identified in the treatment plan. Continuity of care is an important social work principle and may be demonstrated through case management and a major role in discharge planning. Activities, in conjunction with the patient wishes, may include contact with patient's family, identifying and assisting in referral of the patient to community -based agency(ies) at the time of discharge. Finally, post -discharge follow -up may be done to assure that linkage of the patient with community resources has occurred to reduce re -hospitalization. Determine who completed the assessment required by \u00a7482.61(a)(4) and initiated preliminary discharge planning. When staff other than a Social Worker perform these duties, t he Director of Social Work or a Master's level social worker (MSW) qualified supervisory staff member should be involved to oversee the quality and appropriateness of service provided. Patient and staff interviews, structured observations and review of se lected medical records yield the information necessary to determine how well social work has met the needs of the patients. The surveyor should evaluate these data to determine adequacy of qualified and support staff deployed to patient areas and their dut ies. The social work policies for service provision to the patient should describe: the organizational structure of the department (program) and the range of services performed by the department. Survey Procedure \u00a7482.62(f) Just prior to the end of the survey, schedule a meeting with the Director of Social Work. By the time of the meeting, you should already have conducted required observations, interviews and record reviews for at least a majority of the patients in the sample. Collect any additional i nformation that is necessary to consider in light of outcomes observed for patients, including: the qualifications of the director; the leadership exhibited for the scope of services needed by the patient; and the rationale for social work staffing coverag e. How does the director periodically audit the quality of social work services furnished? What are the outcomes of audits conducted? What percentage of psychosocial assessments was completed and available in written form at the time of the interdisciplinary treatment plan? How does the patient's social needs as addressed by the social worker in the psychosocial assessment compare against the goals developed in the interdisciplinary treatment plan? Has social work staff provided active treatment in acco rdance with the patient's treatment plan? Accepted standards of practice are based on policy statements adopted by the National Association of Social Workers and a definition of social work practice in health care adapted by the Consortium of Health Care Social Work Organizations. Staff should adhere to the facility's personnel requirements. A-1716 director of the social work department or service must have a master's degree from an accredited school of social work or must be qualified by education and experience in the social services needs of the mentally ill. If the director does not hold a master's degree in social work, at least one staff member must have th is qualification. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(f)(1) The duties, functions, and responsibilities of the director of social services/social work should be clearly delineated and documented in the facility's policies and procedures. If the director is not MSW qualified and at least one staff member is MSW qualified, verify the duties, functions, and responsibilities of the MSW. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(f)(1) What are the director's qualifications, experience and scope of duties within this position? If a MSW staff member, other than the director, is performing any of these duties, what are this staff member's experience and scope of duties performed? Why wer e these duties delegated? To what extent is the director's knowledge of the social work needs of the various wards? Why has the social work staff and services provided throughout the hospital been deployed in the manner it has? A-1717 service staff responsibilities must include, but are not limited to, participating in discharge, planning, arranging for follow -up care, and developing mechanisms for exchange of appropriate information with sources outside the hospital. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(f)(2) Social work contact with the patient, family, and significant others should occur during, or as soon as possible, after the admission. High -risk case finding should result in significant data being available for early integration into the treatment plan and subsequent social work action as indicated. The treatment team should consider, for possible inclusion into the patient's treatment plan, th e anticipated social work role and expected interventions as recommended in the psychosocial assessment . Treatment and discharge planning activities, liaison/follow -up efforts should be based upon the goals, including discharge goals, and staff responsibi lities specified in the treatment plan. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(f)(2) Are social work staff routinely involved in providing services to the patient that are identified in the treatment plan? To what extent do social work staff provide discharge planning services to the patient in the way of: supportive individual, couple, family, or group therapy focused on discharge goals of the patient? Carrying out a liaison role with community resource providers? Have social work staff assured that adequate inf ormation is provided to post -hospital The provide a therapeutic activities program. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482. 62(g) A variety of therapeutic and rehabilitative activities are selectively used as therapeutic tools in providing active treatment to the psychiatric patients. Therapeutic activities focus upon the development and maintenance of adaptive skills that will improve the patient's functioning. In contrast, leisure activities provide the patient with individualized opportunities to acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes about meaningful leisure involvement and experience s. A patient may need treatment and/or remediation of functional behavior(s) prior to leisure involvement. However, for some psychiatric patients the priority need may be for leisure education and activities. A-1725 must be appropriate to the needs and interests of patients and be directed toward restoring and maintaining optimal levels of physical and psychosocial functioning. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a74 82.62(g)(1) The hospital is responsible for ensuring consistent availability and provision of individualized therapeutic activities and rehabilitative services based on patient needs. The selection of individualized therapeutic and rehabilitative staff modalities should be based on patient need and goals set in the patient's treatment plan. Rehabilitative services may include educational, occupational, recreational, physical, art, dance , music, and speech therapies and vocational rehabilitation evaluation and counseling. There are other disciplines that also serve patients . Consultants include but are not limited to the following: educational instructors, registered occupational therapis t/certified occupational therapy assistant, certified therapeutic recreation specialist, certified therapeutic recreation assistant, speech -language pathologist has certificate of clinical competence, registered and certified music therapist, registered ar t therapist, and registered physical therapist. The qualified vocational specialist may perform duties of a rehabilitation counselor, vocational evaluator, or the work adjustment specialist. A-1726 of qualified therapists, support personnel, and consultants must be adequate to provide comprehensive therapeutic activities consistent with each patient's active treatment program. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.62(g)(2) Qualified staff should complete their respective discipline assessments for use in multidisciplinary treatment planning. Specific role(s) and modalities to be implemented by rehabilitative staff must be determined by goals set in the patient's treatment plan. Qualified therapists who provide clinical services and administrative staff should utilize established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to conduct consistent timely review of the quality and appropriateness of therapeutic and rehabilitative services delivered to patients. Survey Procedures \u00a7482.62(g)(2) Is there evidence that sampled patients and staff are familiar with the goals and staff interventions described in the patient's treatment plan? Are these observed interventi ons being carried out? What is the patient's response? Are these interventions and activities of sufficient frequency and intensity to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit? What are the qualifications, experience, duties and responsibilities of the Therapeutic Activities Director and discipline supervisor(s)? How is the program organized? Did the patients in the sample have a need for any therapeutic activities? Were their needs met? Did any of the patients in the sample indicate a need for therapeuti c activities, but none were considered? What kinds of services are provided to the patient population? Are activity areas/sites accessible and available to meet the patient's individual needs? Are the facilities and resources adequate to enable implemen tation of goals set in the patient's treatment plan? Does the program utilize available community resources to provide opportunities for socialization, leisure, and therapeutic and/or rehabilitation activities for patients who can participate outside the hospital setting? Are current activity schedules clearly posted for patient and staff reference and use? Are the scheduled activities related to the particular patient area and specific treatment needs of patients? Are patient needs met consistently at all times including evenings and weekends? If a large number of patients are assigned to the same therapeutic activity, do patients have individualized goals within their treatment plans? Why have therapeutic activities staff been deployed in the mann er they have?

(4) These policies are reviewed at leas t biennially by the group of professional personnel required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and reviewed as necessary by the clinic . (2) & (4) The clinic must have written policies governing the clinical services provided. At least one RHC physician and one RHC PA or NP must participate in the development of the clinic's written policies and providing advice to the RHC's management on appropriate clinical policies. In addition, there must be at least one physician, NP, or PA who is not on the RHC's staff who parti cipates in the development of the clinical policies. The clinic must identify in writing the names of all individuals involved in developing clinical policies. The clinical practitioners who participate in the policy development provide advice to the RHC 's leadership. The RHC's leadership is not required to accept this advice, but if it exercises its authority to reject or modify the patient care policy advice of the practitioners it must be able to ensure that any changes it makes are clinically appropr iate and supportable. The clinic's patient care policies must be reviewed at least biennially or more frequently when appropriate, by a group that also contains at least one RHC physician, one RHC NP or PA, and one outside healthcare practitioner.

Does it document the rationale for its rejection of the advice? Is there documentation of the policies recommended by the practitioners as well as of any changes made by the RHC's leadership? (3) The policies include: (iii) Rules for the storage, handling, and administration of drugs and biologicals. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7 491.9(b)(3)(iii) The RHC's written patient care policies must address storage, handling, and administration of drugs and biologicals within the RHC. The policies must be in accordance with accepted professional principles of pharmacy and medication administration practice s. Accepted professional principles include compliance with applicable Federal and State law and adherence to standards or guidelines for pharmaceutical services and medication administration issued by nationally recognized professional organizations, inc luding, but not limited to: U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) (www.usp.org) ; the American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (http://www.ashp.org/ ); the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (http://www.ismp.org/default.asp ); the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention ( www.nccmerp.org ); the Institute for Healthcare Improvement ( http://www.ihi.org/ihi ); and the Infusion Nurses Society (http://www.ins1.org ). The RHC's policies must address the following: Stora ge of drugs and biologicals Consistent with accepted professional principles, RHC's must demonstrate appropriate storage and preparation of medications under proper conditions of sanitation, temperature, light, moisture, ventilation, segregation, and security. Proper environmental conditions Where the manufacturer's FDA -approved package insert specifies environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, exposure to light, etc., for storage of drugs, the RHC is expected to follow the labelled conditions. RHC's must exercise caution in administering any drug or biological that is not labelled to indicate proper storage conditions or that may have been stored under inadequate conditions. Security The RHC must have policies and procedures that are consistent with State and Federal law to address how drugs and biologicals are stored and secured, including who is authorized access to the drug storage area. Drugs and biologicals must be stored in a secure manner to prevent unmonitored access by unauthorized individuals. Drugs and biologicals must not be stored in areas that are readily accessible to unauthorized persons. For example, if medications are kept in a private office, or other area where patients and visitors are not allowed without the supervision or presence of a health care professional, they are generally considered secure. Areas restricted to authorized personnel only would generally be considered \"secure areas.\" RHCs are permitted f lexibility in the storage of non -controlled drugs and biologicals when delivering care to patients, and in the safeguarding of drugs and biologicals to prevent tampering or diversion. An area in which staff members are actively providing care to patients or preparing to receive patients, i.e. setting up for injections, would generally be considered a secure area. When a patient care area is not staffed, both controlled and non- controlled substances are expected to be locked, in accordance with state and F ederal law. If the RHC uses cart(s) containing drugs or biologicals, whenever the cart is in use and unlocked, someone with authorized access to the drugs and biologicals in the cart must be within close eyesight of and directly monitoring the cart. That person could be a nurse, a physician, or other individual who in accordance with State and Federal law and RHC policy is authorized access to the drugs and biologicals in the cart. That individual must monitor the cart and be aware of other people's activities near the cart. He/she is responsible for the security of the drugs and biologicals in the cart. Record keeping for the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs. The U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classi fies drugs that are controlled in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act into five \"schedules,\" ranging from Schedule I substances, which have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, to Schedule V substances, w hich have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. The RHC is required to accurately track the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs used in the RHC. Components of a record system for scheduled drugs would include: Locked storage of scheduled drugs when not in use; Accountability procedures to ensure control of the distribution, use, and disposition of all scheduled drugs; Tracking movement of all scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the RHC to the point of departure either through administration to the patient, destruction, or return to the manufacturer. This system provides documentation on scheduled drugs in a readily retrievable manner to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs. Prompt reconciliation of any discrepancies in count. The RHC is capable of readily identifying loss or diversion of all controlled substances in such a manner as to minimize the time frame between the actual loss or diversion to the time of detection and determination of the extent of loss or diversion. Handling drugs and biologicals. \"Handling\" includes reconstituting or mixing medications in accordance with directions contained in approved labeling provided by the drug's manufacturer. Compounding \"Handling\" also includes compounding or admixing of sterile intravenous preparations or of other drugs, either on- or off- site, using either facility staff or a contracted pharmacy service. Generally, RHCs are not settings that use compounded sterile preparations (CSPs) nor are CSPs typically furnished as part of the RHC's services. However, some RHCs may provide additional services beyond RHC services and these might include use of CSPs. If an RHC uses CSPs, it is responsible to ensure that compounding is performed consistent with accepted professional principles. Generally even if an RHC uses CSPs, it would not be likely to have its own pharmacy that could meet the standards of practice for preparation of CSPs; it is more likely that an RHC that uses CSPs would be acquiring them from an external source. The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), signed into law on November 27, 2013, contains provisions relating to the oversight of compounding of human drugs. The DQSA created a new section 503B in the FDCA under which a compounder may elect to become an \"outsourcing facility.\" The law defines an \"outsou rcing facility\" as a facility at one geographic location or address that is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; has elected to register as an outsourcing facility; and complies with all of the requirements of section 503B of the FDCA. Facilities that elect to register as outsourcing facilities: Must comply with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packi ng of a drug product. The CGMP requirements make sure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. The FDA's publishes the most current versions of its draft and final regulations and guidance related to compounding on its website: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Phar macyCompounding/default.htm; Will be inspected by FDA according to a risk -based schedule; and Must meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and providing FDA with certain information about the products they compound. In a January 2014 letter to purchasers of compounde d medications (available at http://ww w.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompo unding/ucm380596.htm ), the Commissioner of the FDA encouraged the use of registered outsourcing facilities and noted that,\"[a]s a purchaser of compounded drugs, you can play an important role in improving the quality of compounded drugs by requiring compounding pharmacies that supply drugs to your facility to register as outsourcing facilities. Once they register, you and the patients you serve can be assured that FDA will inspect these f acilities on a risk -based schedule, hold them to CGMP requirements, monitor the adverse event reports they are required to submit to the agency, and require appropriate labeling.\" FDA has posted a list of Registered Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Fac ilities, including the end date of the last FDA inspection related to compounding, whether investigators observed any significant objectionable conditions, and whether other FDA actions were taken based on the last inspection, at: http://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformati on/pharmacycompoun ding/ucm378645.htm Note that these registered outsourcing facilities are also popularly referred to as \"503B pharmacies.\" Use of Compounding Pharmacies If an RHC uses compounded medications and obtains them from a compounding pharmacy rather than a manufacturer or a registered outsourcing facility, then the RHC must demonstrate how it assures that the compounded medications it receives under this arrangement have been prepared in accordance with accepted professional principles for compounded drugs as well as applicable State or Federal laws or regulations. For example, does the contract with the vendor include provisions: Ensuring that the RHC has access to quality assurance data verifying that the vendor is adhering to standards of practice for compounding medications , and can the RHC document that it obtains and reviews such data? Requiring the vendor to meet the requirements of Section 503A of the FDCA concerning pharmacy compounding of human drug products? Note that these types of compounding pharmacies are also popularly referred to as \"503A pharmacies\" and generally are subject to oversight only by their State pharmacy board. Expiration & Beyond Use Dates A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is se t by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the FDA approval process. It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration date if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer's approved labeling. A drug or biological is also outdated after its \"beyond- use date\" (BUD), which may be reached before the expiration date, but never later. The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and pote ntial for deterioration and microbial growth that may occur during or after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process if it is a compounded medication. The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such information is available. Basic safe practices for medication administration within the RHC The RHC's patient care policies must reflect accepted standards of practice that require the following information be confirmed prior to each administration of medication that takes place in the RHC (such as administration of vaccines or medications via in jection): Right patient: ensuring the patient's identity. Acceptable patient identifiers include, but are not limited to: the patient's full name; an identification number assigned by the RHC; or date of birth. Identifiers must be confirmed by patient identification card, patient statement (when possible), or other means outlined in the RHC's policy. The patient's identification must be confirmed to be in agreement with the medication administration record and medication labeling prior to medication ad ministration to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct patient. Right medication: the correct medication, to ensure that the medication being given to the patient matches that prescribed for the patient and that the patient does not have a documented allergy to it; Right dose: the correct dose, to ensure that the dosage of the medication matches the prescribed dose, and that the prescription itself does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too low); Right route: the correct route, to ensure that the method of administration - orally, intramuscular, intravenous, etc. - is the appropriate one for that particular medication and patient; and Right time: the appropriate time, to ensure adherence to the pr escribed frequency and time of administration. NOTE : the \"5 rights\" focus specifically on the process of administering medications. The medication process is generally recognized as consisting of five stages: ordering/prescribing; transcribing and verif ying; dispensing and delivering; administering; and monitoring/reporting. Errors may occur in other components of the process, even when there is strict adherence to the \"5 rights\" of medication administration, for example when there has been a prescribing or a dispensing error. RHCs are encouraged to promote a culture in which it is not only acceptable, but also strongly encouraged, for staff to bring to the attention of the prescribing practitioner questions or concerns they have regarding medication orders. Any questions about orders for drugs or biologicals are expected to be resolved promptly. Survey Procedures \u00a7 491.9(b)(3)(iii) Are drugs and biologicals stored in a secure manner? o Are drugs stored in areas not accessible to unauthorized personnel? o When drugs or biologicals are kept in a patient care area during hours when patient care is not provided, are they locked up? o Conduct a spot check of drug use and other inventory records to ensure that drugs are properly accounted for. When ap plicable, determine if the RHC has a system that tracks movement of all scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the RHC to the point of departure, either through administration to the patient, destruction of the drug, or return to the manufacturer. o Does this system provide documentation on scheduled drugs in a readily retrievable manner to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs? o Review records of scheduled drugs over a recent time period. Is there evidence of discrepancies, and if so, of efforts by the RHC to reconcile and address the discrepancies? Interview the person responsible for drug storage as well as other RHC staff to determine their understanding of the RHC's controlled drug policies. If the RHC uses CSPs and obtains them from an external source that is not an FDA registered outsourcing facility, can it demonstrate that it systematically evaluates and monitors whether these sources adhere to accepted professional principles for safe compounding? Spot-check to identify if expired or unusable medications, including when applicable medications that are past their BUD, are being used for patient care in the RHC. Ask what type of personnel administer drugs and biologicals within the RHC, including, i f applicable, IVs. Are they practicing within their permitted scope? Observe medication administration to verify whether staff members confirm the \"5 rights\" of medication administration, i.e., the correct medication was administered to the right patient at the right dose via the correct route, and that timing of administration complied with the RHC's policies and procedures? . carries out, or arranges for, a biennial evaluation of its total program . (b) The evaluation includes review of: (1) The utilization of clinic . . . services, including at least the number of patients served and the volume of servi ces; (2) A representative sample of both active and closed clinical records; and (3) The clinic's . . . health care policies. (c) The purpose of the review is to determine whether: (1) The utilization of services was appropriate; (2) The established policies were followed; and (3) Any changes are needed. Interpretative Guidelines \u00a7491.11(a) - (c) The clinic's program evaluation must be reviewed at least biennially . This evaluation may be done by RHC staff or through arrangement with other appropriate professionals. The RHC must have documentation of who conducts the review or portions of the review, and what their qualifications are to do so. The evaluation must include, at a minimum, the number of patients served and the volume of services provided. The evaluation should be able to determine whether the RHC provides appropriate types and volume of services based upon the needs of its patient population. It should also be able to evaluate whether RHC patient policies were followed and whether or not changes to the policies or to procedures are warranted. A RHC that has been certified for less than one year may not have done a program evaluation. However, the RHC must have a written plan that specifies who is to do the evaluation, when and how it is to be done, and what will be covered within the evaluation. The evaluation must also include a review of a representative sample of both active and closed clinical records of RHC patients. The sample must also include at least 5 percent of the RHC's current patients or 50 records, whichever is less. The purpose of the review is to determine whether utilization of the RHC's services was appropriate, i.e., whether practitioners adhere to accepted standards of practice and adhere to the RHC's guidelines for medical man agement when diagnosing or treating patients. The review also must evaluate whether all personnel providing direct patient care adhere to the RHC's patient care policies. The evaluation of practitioners must be conducted by an MD or DO; if there is only one MD or DO practicing in the RHC, it is expected that the RHC will arrange for an outside MD/DO to review the selected sample of records of RHC patients cared for by the RHC's MD/DO. The evaluation of whether the RHC's patient care policies were followe d may be conducted by an MD/DO, a non- physician practitioner, an RN, or other personnel who meet the RHC's qualifications criteria. The evaluation findings must be documented in a summary report, and must include recommendations, if any, for corrective actions to address problems identified in the evaluation. If a RHC has developed a QAPI program and that program meets/exceeds the regulatory requirements for a Program Evaluation, the QAPI program would be acceptable. Survey Procedures \u00a7 491.1 1 (a) - (c) Is there evidence that the evaluation is completed at least biennially and includes review of the number of patients served and the volume of services provided? Is there evidence of a review of a representative sample of RHC records? Does the sample incl ude the required minimum number of records? Who conducts which portions of the review? Are they qualified to do so? Is there evidence of findings and recommendations from the review, and do the findings address each required component?

(7) Section 1861(s)(2)(F) of the Act, which authorizes coverage for renal dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2017 by a renal dialysis facility or provider of services currently paid under section 1881(b)(14) of the Act to an individual with AKI. (b) Scope. The provisions of this part establish the conditions for coverage of services under Medicare and are the basis for survey activities for the purpose of determining whether an ESRD facility's services may be covered. \u00a7 494.10 Definitions Dialysis facility means an entity that provides outpatient maintenance dialysis services, or home dialysis training and support services, or both. A dialysis facility may be an independent or hospital -based unit (as described in \u00a7413.174(b) and (c) of this chapter) that includes a self -care dialysis unit that furnishes only self -dialysis services. Discharge means the termination of patient care services by a dialysis facility or the patient voluntarily terminating dialysis when h e or she no longer wants to be dialyzed by that facility. Furnishes directly means the ESRD facility provides the service through its own staff and employees or through individuals who are under direct contract to furnish these services personally for the facility. Home dialysis means dialysis performed at home by an ESRD patient or caregiver who has completed an appropriate course of training as described in \u00a7494.100(a) of this part. Self-dialysis means dialysis performed with little or no professional assistance by an ESRD patient or caregiver who has completed an appropriate course of training as specified in \u00a7494.100(a) of this part. Transfer means a temporary or permanent move of a patient from one dialysis facility to another that requires a transm ission of the patient's medical record to the facility receiving the patient.

V198 CFR 494.40 (a): 5.2.6 Chemical injection systems 6.2.6 Chemical injection systems 5.2.6 Chemical injection systems Chemical injection systems consist of a reservoir that contains the chemical to be injected, a metering pump, and a mixing chamber located in the main water line. Chemical injection systems also include some means of regulating the metering pump to control the addi tion of a chemical. This system should be designed to tightly control the addition of the chemical. The control system should ensure that a chemical is added only when water is flowing through the pretreatment cascade and that it is added in fixed proporti on to the water flow or based on some continuously monitored parameter, such as pH, using an automated control system. If an automated control system is used to inject the chemical, the controlling parameter should be independently monitored. There should also be a means of verifying that the concentrations of any residuals arising from the chemical added to the water are reduced to a safe level before the water reaches its point of use. When acid is added to adjust pH, a mineral acid should be used. 6.2.6 Chemical injection systems Systems for chemical injection should be monitored according to the manufacturer's instructions. If a facility designs its own system, procedures should be developed to ensure proper preparation of the chemical, adequate mixing of the injected chemical with the water flowing through the pretreatment cascade, and reduction to a safe level of the concentration of any chemical residuals before the point of water use. The facility should also verify that the injected chemical does n ot degrade the performance of downstream devices, including the primary purification process. The adequacy of these procedures must be verified using an independent laboratory. Verification can be accomplished by testing samples from the chemical reservoir and the water line after the point of injection for at least three batches of chemical. When the chemical to be injected is prepared at a facility from powder or by dilution of a liquid concentrate, the chemical injection reservoir must be labeled with the name of the chemical and its concentration, the date the solution was prepared, and the name of the person who mixed the solution. Each batch of chemical should be tested for correct formulation before use. A batch of chemical must not be used or transferred to the injection system reservoir until all tests are completed. The test results \u2014and verification that they meet all applicable criteria \u2014should be recorded and signed by the individual performing the tests. Protective clothing and an appropri ate environment, including ventilation adequate to meet applicable OSHA environmental exposure limits, should be provided when chemicals for injection are prepared in a dialysis facility.

A centr ifugal pump made of inert materials is necessary to distribute the purified water and aid in effective disinfection. 7 Strategies for bacterial control 7.1 General To minimize biofilm formation, there should always be flow in a piping system. A minimum velocity of 3 ft/sec in the distal portion of the loop of an indirect feed system and a minimum velocity of 1.5 ft/s in the distal portion of a direct feed system are recommended when the system is operating under conditions of peak demand. Dead -end pipes and unused branches and taps that can trap fluid must be eliminated because they act as reservoirs of bacteria and are capable of continuously inoculating the entire volume of the system. These measures also minimize the possibility that pockets of residu al disinfectant could remain in the piping system after disinfection.

Bacteria and endotoxins shall not exceed the levels specified in and endotoxin testing should be conducted at least monthly. For a newly - installed water distribution piping system, or when a change has been made to an existing system, it is recommended that weekly testing be conducted for 1 month to verify that bacteria or endotoxin levels are consistently within the allowed limits. Monitoring should be accomplished by taking samples from the first and last outlets of the water distribution loop and the outlets supplying reuse equipment and bicarbonate concentrate mixing tanks. If the results of this testing are unsatisfactory, additional testing (e.g., ultrafilter inlet and outlet, RO product water, and storage tank outlet) should be undertaken as a troubleshooting strategy to identify the source of contamination, after which appropriate corrective actions can be taken. Bacteria and endotoxin levels shall be measured as specified in ANSI/AAMI RD62:2001 (see 2.3).

Every record must be accurate, legible, and promptly completed. Medical records must include at least the following: (1) Patient identification; (2) Significant medical history and results of physical ex amination (as applicable) ; (3) Pre-operative diagnostic studies (entered before surgery), if performed; (4) Findings and techniques of the operation, including a pathologist's report on all tissues removed during surgery, except those exempted by the governing body; (5) Any allergies and abnormal drug reactions; (6) Entries related to anesthesia administration; (7) Documentation of properly executed informed patient consent; and (8) Discharge diagnosis. Interpretive Guidelines: \u00a7416.47(b) The medical record must contain all of the required elements listed in the regulation. Specifically: The identity of the patient must be clear through use of identifiers such as name, date of birth, social security number, etc. A medical history an d physical assessment (H&P), completed as applicable and entered into the medical record in accordance with the requirements at \u00a7416.52, as well as the results of the pre -surgical assessments specified at \u00a7416.42 and \u00a7416.52. If pre -operative diagnostic studies were performed, they must be included in the medical record prior to the start of surgery. An operative report that describes the surgical techniques and findings. A pathologist's report on all tissues removed duri ng surgery must also be included, unless the governing body has adopted a written policy exempting certain types of removed tissue from this requirement. Depending on the type of surgery performed in the ASC, tissue may or may not routinely be removed duri ng surgery; no pathologist's report is required when no tissue has been removed. The governing body's policy on exemption should provide the clinical rationale supporting the exemption decision. For example, an ASC that performs cataract removal and implan tation of an artificial lens might exempt from the pathologist's report requirement the ocular lens removed in routine procedures where there is no indication suggesting the presence of other disease for which a pathology analysis should be required. On the other hand, it generally would not be reasonable to exempt intestinal polyps removed during a colonoscopy, since a pathologist's analysis of the tissue would be required to confirm whether or not the polyp(s) were malignant growths. The patient's his tory of allergies or abnormal drug reactions prior to the surgery, as well as any allergies or abnormal drug reactions that occurred during or after the surgery prior to discharge. Information related to the administration of anesthesia during the proc edure and the patient's recovery from anesthesia after the procedure. Documentation of a properly executed informed patient consent. A well -designed informed consent process would most likely include a discussion of the following elements: A descri ption of the proposed surgery, including the anesthesia to be used; The indications for the proposed surgery; Material risks and benefits for the patient related to the surgery and anesthesia, including the likelihood of each, based on the availabl e clinical evidence, as informed by the responsible practitioner's clinical judgment. Material risks could include risks with a high degree of likelihood, but a low degree of severity, as well as those with a very low degree of likelihood, but a high degre e of severity; Treatment alternatives, including the attendant material risks and benefits; Who will conduct the surgical intervention and administer the anesthesia; Whether physicians other than the operating practitioner will be performing important tasks related to the surgery. Important surgical tasks include: opening and closing, dissecting tissue, removing tissue, harvesting grafts, transplanting tissue, admini stering anesthesia, implanting devices and placing invasive lines; and Whether, as permitted by State law, qualified medical practitioners who are not physicians will perform important parts of the surgery or administer the anesthesia, and if so, the t ypes of tasks each type of practitioner will carry out; and that such practitioners will be performing only tasks within their scope of practice for which they have been granted privileges by the ASC. Documentation of the patient's discharge diagnosis. The record should also include the patient's disposition, i.e., whether the patient was discharged to home (including to a nursing home for patients already resident in a nursing home at the time of surgery), or transfer to another healthcare facility, in cluding emergent transfers to a hospital. Survey Procedures: \u00a7416.47(b) Evaluate the sample of open and closed records selected for review to determine whether they contain all of the required elements. For open records of patients whose surgery has not yet begun, focus on the elements that must be present before surgery, e.g., H&P (as applicable) , immediate pre -surgical assessment, informed consent, etc. The absence of any required element must be cited as standard -level noncompliance. The absence of a number of elements from a number of medical records might warrant citation of condition- level noncompliance. Likewise the absence of one element from a number of medical records - e.g., lack of informed consent to surgery - should warrant citation of co ndition- level noncompliance. Ask the ASC's leadership if the ASC removes tissue during surgery and, if so, does it exempt any or all classes of tissue removed from the requirement for analysis by a pathologist? If yes, ask to see the policy and its rationale, to determine whether it was adopted by the governing body and whether the clinical rationale for the exemption is reasonable. Q-0261 (Rev. ) \u00a7416.52(a) : Standard: Patient Assessment and Admission . (1) The ASC must develop and maintain a policy that identifies those patients who require a medical history and physical examination prior to surgery. The policy must -- (i) Include the timeframe for medical history and physical examination to be compl eted prior to surgery. (ii) Address, but is not limited to, the following factors: patient age, diagnosis, the type and number of procedures scheduled to be performed on the same surgery date, known comorbidities, and the planned anesthesia level. (iii) Be based on any applicable nationally recognized standards of practice and guidelines, and any applicable State and local health and safety laws.

Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.608 Failure of the CAH to meet a Federal, State or local law may only be cited when the Federal, State or local authority having jurisdiction has made both a determinat ion of noncompliance and has taken a final adverse action as a result. Refer or report suspected violations to the appropriate Federal, State, or local agency. C-0812 (Rev. with Federal Laws and Regulations The CAH is in compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations related to the health and safety of patients. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.608(a) Each CAH must be in compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations related to the health and safety of patients. This includes other Medicare regulations and Federal laws and regulations not specifically addressed in the CoPs. State Survey Agenci es are expected to assess the CAH's compliance with the following Medicare provider agreement regulation provisions when surveying for compliance with \u00a7485.608(a): Advance Directives An advance directive is defined at 42 CFR 489.100 as \" a written instruction, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State), relating to the provision of health care when the individual is incapacitated .\" In accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR 489.102(a), the advance directives regulations apply to CAHs. The CAH patient (inpatient or outpatient) has the right to formulate advance directives, and to have CAH staff implement and comply with the individua l's advance directive. The regulation at 42 CFR 489.102 specifies the rights of a patient (as permitted by State law) to make medical care decisions, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate, at the individual's option, advance directives. In the advance directive, the patient may provide guidance as to his/her wishes concerning provision of care in certain situations; alternatively, the patient may delegate decision -making authority to another individual, as permitted by State law. (In addition, the patient may use the advance directive to designate a \"support person,\" as specified in \u00a7485.635(f), for purposes of exer cising the patient's visitation rights.) When a patient who is incapacitated has executed an advance directive designating a particular individual to make medical decisions for him/her when incapacitated, the CAH must, when presented with the document, pr ovide the designated individual the information required to make informed decisions about the patient's care. The CAH must also seek the consent of the patient's representative when informed consent is required for a care decision. The explicit designati on of a representative in the patient's advance directive takes precedence over any non -designated relationship and continues throughout the patient's inpatient stay or, as applicable, outpatient visit, unless the patient ceases to be incapacitated and exp ressly withdraws the designation, either orally or in writing. \u00a7489.102 also requires the CAH to: Provide written notice of its policies regarding the implementation of patients' rights to make decisions concerning medical care, such as the right to formulate advance directives. If an individual is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate, the CAH may provide the advance directive information required under \u00a7489.100 to the individual's \"family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrog ate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law.\" (\u00a7489.102(e)) \u00a7489.102(b)(1) requires that notice of the CAH's advance directive policy be provided at the time an individual is admitted as an inpatient . However, the CAH should also consider providing the advance directive notice at the time of registration, to outpatients (or their representatives) who are in the emergency department, who are in an observation status, or who are undergoing same- day surgery. The notice must include a clear and precise statement of limitation if the CAH cannot implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience. At a minimum, a statement of limitation should: Clarify any differences between institution -wide conscience objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians or other practitioners; Identify the State legal authority permitting such an objection; and Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected by the conscience objection. It should be noted that this provision allowing for certain conscience objections to implementing an advance directive is narrowly focused on the directive's content related to medical conditions or procedures. This provision would not allow a CAH or individual physician or practitio ner to refuse to honor those portions of an advance directive that designate an individual as the patient's representative and/or support person, given that such designation does not concern a medical condition or procedure. Issuance of the written notice of the CAH's advance directive policies to the patient or the patient's representative must be documented in the patient's medical record. Document in a prominent part of the patient's medical record whether or not the patient has executed an advance dir ective; Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; Assure compliance with requirements of State law concerning advance directives and infor m individuals that complaints concerning the advance directive requirements may be filed with the State survey and certification agency; Provide for the education of staff concerning its policies and procedures on advance directives. The right to formula te advance directives includes the right to formulate a psychiatric advance directive (as allowed by State law); and Provide community education regarding advance directives and the CAH must document its efforts. A psychiatric advance directive is akin to a traditional advance directive for health care. This type of advance directive might be prepared by an individual who is concerned that at some time he or she may be subject to involuntary psychiatric commitment or treatment. The psychiatric advance directive may cover a range of subjects, and may name another person who is authorized to make decisions for the individual if he or she is determined to be legally incompetent to make his/her own choices. It may also provide the patient's instru ctions about hospitalization, alternatives to hospitalization, the use of medications, types of therapies, and the patient's wishes concerning restraint or seclusion. The patient may designate who should be notified upon his/her admission to the CAH, as well as who should not be permitted to visit him or her. State laws regarding the use of psychiatric advance directives vary. In accordance with State law, a psychiatric advance directive should be accorded the same respect and consideration that a tradit ional advance directive for health care is given. CAHs should carefully coordinate how the choices of a patient balance with the rights of other patients, staff, and individuals in the event that a dangerous situation arises. However, even if State law h as not explicitly spoken to the use of psychiatric advance directives, consideration should be given to them. When the patient is, for whatever reason, unable to communicate his/her wishes, the preferences expressed in the psychiatric advance directive can give critical insight to the CAH's professional staff as they develop a plan of care and treatment for the patient. Required CAH Disclosures to Patients: Physician Ownership 42 CFR 489.3 defines a \"physician -owned hospital\" as any participating hospital, including a CAH, in which a physician or immediate family member of a physician (as defined in \u00a7411.351) has an ownership or investment interest in the CAH, except for those satisfying an exception found at \u00a7411.356(a) or (b). Surveyors are not required to make an independent determination regarding whether a CAH meets the Medicare definition of \"physician -owned,\" but they must ask whether the CAH is physician -owned. However, the notice requirement does not apply to any physician- owned CAH that does not have at least one referring physician (as defined at \u00a7411.351 of this chapter) who has an ownership or investment interest in the CAH or who has an immediate family member who has an ownership or investment interest in the CAH. In such cases, the CAH must sign an attestation statement that it has no referring physician with an ownership or investment interest or whose immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest in the CAH. The CAH must maintain this attestation in its records. 42 CFR 489.20(u)(1) requires that all physician- owned CAHs provide written notice to their patients at the beginning of each patient's CAH inpatient stay or outpatient visit stating that the CAH is physician -owned, in order to assist the patient in making an informed decision about his or her care. A planned inpatient stay or outpatient visit which is subject to the notice requirement begins with the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned CAH admission for inpatient care or for an outpatient service subject to notice. An unplanned inpatient stay or outpatient visit subject to the notice requirement begins at the earliest point at which the patient presents to the CAH. The notice must disclose, in a manner reasonably designed to be understood by all patients, that the CAH is physician -owned and that a list of owners or investors who are physicians or immediate family members of physicians is available upon request. If the patient (or so meone on behalf of the patient) requests this list, the CAH must provide it at the time of the request. 42 CFR 489.20(u)(2) provides that physician -owned CAHs must require each physician owner who is a member of the hospital's medical staff to agree, as a condition of obtaining/retaining CAH medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients they refer to the CAH their ownership or investment interest or that of any immediate family member in the CAH. The CAH must req uire that this disclosure be made at the time of the referral and the requirement should be reflected in the hospital's policies and procedures governing privileges for physician owners. The CAH may exempt from this disclosure requirement any physician owner who does not refer any patients to the CAH. 42 CFR 489.12 permits CMS to refuse to enter into a provider agreement with a physician -owned CAH applicant that does not have procedures in place to notify patients of physician ownership in the hospital, as required under \u00a7483.20(u). 42 CFR 489.53 (c) permits CMS to terminate the provider agreement of a physician - owned CAH if the CAH fails to comply with the requirements at \u00a7489.20(u). MD/DO 24/7 On -Site Presence 42 CFR 489.20(w) mandates that if there is no doctor of medicine or osteopathy present in the CAH 24 hours per day, seven days per week the CAH must provide written notice to all inpatients at the beginning of a planned or unplanned inpat ient stay, and to outpatients for certain types of outpatient visits. The purpose of the requirement is to assist the patient in making an informed decision about his/her care. CAHs that have an MD/DO (including residents wh o are MDs or DOs) on -site 24/7 do not need to issue any disclosure notice about emergency services capability. The notice must be provided to all inpatients and to those outpatients who are under observation or who are having surgery or any other procedure using anesthesia. The notice must be provided at the beginning of the planned or unplanned inpatient stay, or applicable outpatient visit. A planned inpatient stay or outpatient visit which is subject to the notice requirement begins with the provision of a package of informati on regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned CAH admission for inpatient care or for an outpatient service subject to notice. An unplanned inpatient stay or outpatient visit subject to the notice requirement begins at the ear liest point at which the patient presents to the CAH. Individual notices are not required in the CAH's dedicated emergency department (DED) (as that term is defined in 42 CFR 489.24(b)), but the DED must post a notice conspicuously, in a place or places l ikely to be noticed by all individuals entering the dedicated emergency department. The posted notice must state that the CAH does not have a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and must indicate how the CAH will meet the medical needs of any patient with an emergency medical condition, as defined in 42 CFR 489.24(b ) [the EMTALA definition], at a time when th ere is no doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy present in the CAH. If an emergency department patient is determined to require admission, then the individual notice provisions of 42 CFR 489.20(w) would apply to that patient. Before admitting an in patient or providing outpatient services requiring notice, the CAH must obtain a signed acknowledgement from the patient stating that he/she understands that a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy may not be present during all hours services are furnished to him/her. In the event of an unplanned surgery or inpatient admission to treat an emergency medical condition , it may in some cases be necessary in the interest of the patient's safety to proceed with treatment before the required notice can be g iven and acknowledgement can be obtained. In such circumstances the CAH must provide notice and obtain acknowledgement as soon as possible after the patient's stay or visit begins. For a CAH that participates in Medicare with multiple campuses providing inpatient services (e.g., a main provider campus and a separate remote location for a psychiatric or rehabilitation distinct part unit (DPU)) under one CMS Certification Number) a sep arate determination is made for each campus/location with inpatient services as to whether the disclosure notice is required. For example, if a CAH has a main campus with 25 inpatient beds and a remote location with 10 psychiatric DPU beds and 10 rehabili tation DPU beds, and a physician is present 24/7 on the main campus, but not at the DPU remote location, the CAH is required to provide the disclosure notice at the DPU location. No notice is required for patients coming to the main provider campus. In t his same example, if the CAH also has a provider - based, off -campus ambulatory surgery department, no notice is required at that off - campus surgery site, since the CAH's main campus does have an MD/DO present 24/7. 42 CFR 489.53 (c) permits CMS to terminate a provider agreement with a CAH if the CAH fails to comply with the requirements at \u00a7489.20(w) when it does not have an MD or DO on -site 24/ 7. Other Federal Requirements Other Federal requirements also apply to patient health and safety in the CAH. For example, Federal laws and regulations govern both the disposal of medical waste and occupational health. However, surveyors are not expected to be knowledgeable about the requirements of other Federal agencies and therefore do not assess compliance with non- CMS regulations. A surveyor who suspects a CAH may not be in compliance with other Federal requirements may refer the matter to the appropriate Federal agency. If CMS is notified or becomes aware of another Federal agency's final enforcement action, action will be taken only if the final enforcement action remains in effect. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.608(a) Assessing Compliance with Advance Directives Requirements Review the CAH's advance directive notice. Does it advise inpatients or applicable outpatients, or their representatives, of the patient's right to formulate an advance directive and to have CAH staff comply with the advance directive (in accordance with State law)? Does it include a clear, precise, and valid statement of limitation if the CAH cannot implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience? Review the records of a sample of patients for evidence of CAH compliance with advance directive notice requirements. Does every inpatient or applicable outpatient record contain documentation that notice of the CAH's advance directives policy was provided at the time of admission or registration? Is there documentation of whether or not each patient has a n advance directive? For those patients who have reported an advance directive, has a copy of the patient's advance directive been placed in the medical record? What mechanism does the CAH have in place to allow patients to formulate an advance directive or to update their current advance directive? Is there evidence that the CAH is promoting and protecting each patient's right to formulate an advance directive? Determine to what extent the CAH complies, as permitted under State law, with patient advanc e directives that delegate decisions about the patient's care to a designated individual. Determine to what extent the CAH educates its staff regarding advance directives. Interview staff to determine their knowledge of the advance directives of the patients in their care. Determine to what extent the CAH provides education for the patient population regarding one's rights under State law to formulate advance directives. Assessing Required Disclosures Physician Ownership If the CAH indicates that it is physician -owned but is exempt under \u00a7489.20(v) from the disclosure requirement of \u00a7489.20(u)(2), ask to see the signed attestation that it does not have any referring physicians with an ownership/investment interest or whose immediate family member was has an ownership/investment interest in the CAH. (As with any other on- the-spot correction of a deficiency during a survey, creation of an attestation at the time of a survey does not mean that there was no deficiency and that the CAH would not be cited.) If the CAH is physician -owned but not exempt from the physician ownership disclosure requirements: Verify that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to assure that written notices are provided to all patients at the beginning of an inpatient or outpatient stay. Review the notice the CAH issues to each patient to verify that it discloses, in a manner reasonably designed to be understood by all patients, that the CAH meets the Federal definition of \"physician -owned,\" that a list of owners and investors who are physicians or immediate family members of physicians is available upon request, and that such list is provided to the patient at the time the request is made by or on behalf of the patient. Determine through staff interviews, observation, and a review of policies and procedures whether the CAH furnishes its list of physician owners and investors at the time a patient or patient's representative requests it. Determine through staff interviews and review of policies, procedures, and staff records whether a physician -owned CAH's medical staff membership and admitting privileging requirements include a requirement that, as a condition of continued membership or admitting privileges, physician owners who refer patients to the CAH agree to provide written disclosure of their own or any immediate family member's ownership or investmen t interest to all patients at time of the referral to the CAH. MD/DO 24/7 On -site Presence Determine through interviews, observation, and medical record review whether an MD/DO is present in the CAH 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. For each required location where an MD/DO is not present: Verify that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to assure that written notices that a MD/DO is not present at all times are provided at the beginning of a planned or unplanned inpatie nt stay or outpatient visit to all inpatients and to all outpatients receiving observation services, surgery or another procedure requiring anesthesia. Verify that there is a signed acknowledgement by the patient of such disclosure, obtained by the CAH prior to the patient's admission or before applicable outpatient services were provided. Ask a sample of inpatients and affected outpatients whether they were provided notice about an MD/DO not being present at all times in the CAH. Verify that the CAH's emergency department has signage with the appropriate disclosure information. Review the notice the CAH issues to verify that it indicates how the CAH will meet the medical needs of any patient who develops an emergency medical condi tion at a time when no physician is present at that CAH, including any remote location. Other Federal Requirements Surveyors do not assess compliance with Medicare payment provisions or non- Medicare requirements. However, a surveyor may refer suspected noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations to the appropriate agency having jurisdiction (e.g., hazardous chemical and waste issues to EPA, blood- borne pathogens and TB control to OSHA, Compliance With State and Local Laws and Regulations All patient care services are furnished in accordance with applicable State and local laws and regulations. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.608(b) There are wide variations in the States' practice acts relative to the extent to which MD/DOs may delegate responsibilities to nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. Some states have updated their practice acts to include definitions and specific references to permitted/prohibited activities, supervision/guidance required by a MD/DO, and local situations in which nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants may function. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.608(b) Prior to going on the survey, determine what professional specialists provide patient care services at the CAH and review State practice act requirements. C-0816 (Rev. CAH The CAH is licensed in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.608(c) Prior to the survey, determine whether the CAH is subject to licensure requirements and verify th at the licensing agency has approved the CAH as meeting the standards for licensure as set forth by the agency of the State or locality responsible for licensing CAHs. C-0818 or Registration of Personnel Staff of the CAH are licensed, certified, or registered in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.608(d) All staff required by the State to be licensed must possess a current license. The CAH must ensure that these personnel are in compliance with the State's licensure laws. The laws requiring licensure vary from state to state. Examples of healthcare professi onals that a state may require to be licensed could include: nurses, MD/DOs, physician assistants, dieticians, x -ray technologists, dentists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, respiratory technicians and facility administrators. All CAH staff must meet all applicable standards required by State or local law for CAH personnel. This would include at a minimum: Certification requirements; Minimum qualifications; and Training/education requirements. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.608(d) Verify for those personnel required to be licensed by the State, that the CAH has established, and follows, procedures for determining that personnel providing patient care services are properly licensed. Check a sample of personnel files to verify that licensure in formation is up to date. Verify that appropriate categories of staff and personnel are licensed in accordance with State requirements. Verify state licensure compliance of the direct care personnel, as well as administrators and supervisory personnel, and any contracted personnel. Verify that there are procedures in place to guarantee licensure of employees working at the CAH under contract or agreement. Review CAH policies regarding certification, licensure, and registration of personnel. Are the CAH policies compliant with State and local laws? Are the personnel in compliance with CAH policy? and Location Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610 The CAH must meet the location requirements of \u00a7485.610(b) and \u00a7485.610(c) at the time of the initial survey. Compliance with these location requirements must be reconfirmed at the time of every subsequent recertification (including the recertification of a deemed status CAH whose accreditation has been renewed). If the CAH moves, its eligibility for continued CAH status must be reassessed in accordance with \u00a7485.610(b) and (c). If a CAH that has been certified on the ba sis of having been designated by the State as a necessary provider moves, its eligibility for continued CAH status must be reassessed in accordance with \u00a7485.610(b) and \u00a7485.610(d). The facility is -- (1) A currently participating hospital that meets all conditions of participation set forth in this subpart; (2) A recently closed facility, provided that the facility -- (i) Was a hospital that ceased operations on or after the date that is 10 years before November 29, 1999; and (ii) Meets the criteria for designation under this subpart as of the effective date of its designation; or (3) A health clinic or a health center (as defined by the State) that-- (i) Is licensed by the State as a health clinic or a health center; (ii) Was a hospital that was downsized to a health clinic or a health center; and (iii) As of the effective date of its designation, meets the criteria for designation set forth in this subpart. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(a) Confirm that a CAH meets the basic status requirement prior to scheduling the survey. The appropriate RO will reverify the status requirement prior to approving a CAH for Medicare certification. C-0826 (Rev. in a Rural Area or Treatment as Rural The CAH meets the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section or the requirements of paragraph (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section. (1) The CAH meets the following requirements: (i) The CAH is located outside any area that is a Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budg et, or that has been recognized as urban under \u00a7412.64(b), excluding paragraph (b)(3) of this chapter; (ii) The CAH has not been classified as an urban hospital for purposes of the standardized payment amount by CMS or the Medicare Geographic Classificat ion Review Board under \u00a7412.230(e) of this chapter and is not among a group of hospitals have been redesignated to an adjacent urban area under \u00a7412.232 of this chapter. (2) The CAH is located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, but is being treated as being located in a rural area in accordance with \u00a7412.103 of this chapter. (3) Effective for October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2006, the CAH does not meet the location requirements in either pa ragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and is located in a county that, in FY 2004, was not part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, but as of FY 2005 was included as part of such Metropolitan Statistical Area as a result of the most recent census data and implementation of the new Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions announced by the Office of Management and Budget on June 3, 2003. (4) Effective for October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2011, the C AH does not meet the location requirements in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and is located in a county that, in FY 2009, was not part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, but as of FY 2010, was included as part of such Metropolitan Statistical Area as a result of the most recent census data and implementation of the new Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions announced by the Office of Management and Budget on November 20, 2008. (5) Ef fective on or after October 1, 2014, for a period of 2 years beginning with the effective date of the most recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS, the CAH no longer meets the location require ments in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and is located in a county that, prior to the most recent OMB standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS and the most recent Census Bureau data, was located in a rural area as defin ed by OMB, but under the most recent OMB standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS and the most recent Census Bureau data, is located in an urban area. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(b) Among other requirements, pursuant to 42 CFR 485.610(b), all CAH applicants and existing CAHs, including necessary provider CAHs, must either be: located in a rural area; or treated as rural in accordance with 42 CFR 412.103 in order to be eligible fo r CAH designation and certification. (The temporary provisions at 42 CFR 485.610(b)(3) and (4) have expired and no longer apply.) Only the CMS Regional Office makes the determination whether a CAH applicant or existing CAH meets the rural location requir ement, following the instructions below. However, State Survey Agencies (SA) may wish to make informal assessments prior to conducting a survey, following the guidance provided in Section 2256A of the SOM. If the SA's informal assessment suggests the CAH applicant or existing CAH is not rural, it should consult with the RO before conducting a survey. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.610(b) Conduct an informal assessment of the CAH's rural status, following the procedures in Section 2256A of the SOM, and if it appears the CAH no longer has rural status, confer with the CMS RO prior to scheduling the initial or recertification survey. to Other Facilities or Necessary Provider Certification] The CAH is located more than a 35 -mile drive (or, in the case of mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads available, a 15- mile drive) from a hospital or another CAH, or before January 1, 2006, the CAH is certified by the State as being a necessary provider of health care services to residents in the area. A CAH that is designated as a necessary provider on or before December 31, 2005, will maintain its necessary provider designation af ter January 1, 2006. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(c) A CAH that has not been designated by a State as a necessary provider prior to December 31, 2005 must be located more than a 35- mile drive (or in the case of mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads available, a 15- mile drive) from any other CAH or hospital. An exception is made for Indian Health Service (IHS) or Tribal CAHs and hospitals that are located less than the 35 or 15 miles from another hospital or CAH. Given that IHS a nd Tribal CAHs and hospitals serve distinctly different populations, IHS CAHs and hospitals are excluded from consideration when determining the proximity of non-IHS hospitals seeking CAH certification to other CAHs or hospitals. For the same reason, when an IHS or Tribal hospital applies for certification to participate in Medicare as a CAH, CMS will consider only its proximity to other IHS and Tribal CAHs and hospitals in determining whether it meets the location requirement under section 485.610(c). If a CAH is located on an island and the location meets the following characteristics, the CAH is considered to be in compliance with the distance requirements relative to other hospitals and CAHs under \u00a7485.610(c): The island is entirely surrounded by wate r; The CAH is the only hospital or CAH on the island; and The island is not accessible by any roads. CAHs located on islands that meet the criteria above are still required to comply with the rural location requirement under \u00a7485.610(b). A CAH that can document that it was designated by a State as a necessary provider CAH prior to January 1, 2006, does not have to meet the location relative to other facilities standard at \u00a7485.610(c). As of January 1, 2006, States do not have the authority to designate any new necessary provider CAHs. Necessary provider CAHs that were designated prior to that date are grandfathered by statute, subject to certain conditions if they relocate (see the discussion related to \u00a7485.610(d)). ROs and SAs should have the documentation related to a CAH's original designation as a necessary provider in the file on each CAH. If they do not, they should ask the CAH to supply copies of the original necessary provider designation documents. For applicants seeking a new CAH provider a greement, or for CAHs that seek to relocate and do not have a grandfathered necessary provider designation, ROs will review the application and make the determination whether it satisfies the CAH location relative to other facilities standard at \u00a7485.610(c ), using the guidance found in Chapter 2, \u00a72256A of the State Operations Manual. At the conclusion of its review, the RO will notify the SA of its determination. Existing CAHs that are not grandfathered necessary provider CAHs must be periodically evaluated to determine whether there are any more recently certified Medicare- participating hospitals that are not more than a 35- mile drive, or 15- mile drive, as applicable, from the CAH. In the event that an existing CAH that is not a grandfathered necessary provider no longer meets the minimum distance requirement, it is provided the opportunity to avoid termination of its provider agreement by converting to a certified Medicare hospital after demonstrating compliance with the hospital CoPs. C-0832 (Rev. CAHs With a Necessary Provider Designation A CAH that has a necessary provider designation from the State that was in effect prior to January 1, 2006, and relocates its facility after January 1, 2006, can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section based on the necessary provider designation only if the relocated facility meets the requirements as specified in paragrap h (d)(1) of this section. (1) If a necessary provider CAH relocates its facility and begins providing services in a new location, the CAH can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section based on the necessary provider designation only if the CAH in its new location -- (i) Serves at least 75 percent of the same service area that it served prior to its relocation; (ii) Provides at least 75 percent of the same services that it provided prior to the relocation; and (iii) Is staffed by 75 percent of the same staff (including medical staff, contracted staff, and employees) that were on staff at the original location. (2) If a CAH that has been designated as a necessary provider by the State begins providing services at another location after January 1, 2006, and does not meet the requirements in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the action will be considered a cessation of business as described in \u00a7489.52(b)(3). Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(d) Renovation or expansion of a CAH's existing building or addition of building(s) on the existing main campus of the CAH is not considered a relocation. However, as discussed in the adoption of this regulation (70 FR 47472), all newly -constructed, necessary provider CAH facilities, including entirely new replacement facilities constructed on the same site as the existing CAH main campus, are considered relocated facilities. The determination of whether or not CAHs with a necessary provider designation have met the requirements at \u00a7485.610(d) will be made by the RO, generall y prior to an SA or accreditation survey. The RO will utilize the evaluation criteria set forth in the SOM, Chapter 2, \u00a72256F to make this determination. At the conclusion of its review, the RO will notify the SA of its results. C-0834 Requirements for CAHs (1) If a CAH with a necessary provider designation is co -located (that is, it shares a campus, as defined in \u00a7413.65(a)(2) of this chapter, with another hospital or CAH), t he necessary provider CAH can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section only if the co - location arrangement was in effect before January 1, 2008, and the type and scope of services offered by the facility co -located with th e necessary provider CAH do not change. A change of ownership of any of the facilities with a co -location arrangement that was in effect before January 1, 2008, will not be considered to be a new co- location arrangement. (3) If either a CAH or a CAH that has been designated as a necessary provider by the State does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, by co- locating with another hospital or CAH on or after January 1, 2008, [or creates or acquires an off -campus provider -based location or off -campus distinct part unit on or after January 1, 2008, that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section,] the CAH's provider agreement will be subject to termination in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7489.53(a)(3) of t his subchapter, unless the CAH terminates the off -campus arrangement or the co -location arrangement, or both. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(e)(1) & (3) A CAH may not be co -located with another hospital or CAH, because this would violate the minimum dis tance requirement found at \u00a7485.610(c). However, some CAHs that were designated as necessary providers prior to January 1, 2006, and therefore exempted from this distance requirement, also chose to co -locate with another hospital. Co- location occurs when a necessary provider CAH shares the same campus and/or building in which the CAH is currently located with another hospital or necessary provider CAH. For example, a necessary provider CAH shares the same campus with an unrelated psychiatric or rehabilit ation hospital. Effective January 1, 2008, grandfathered necessary provider CAHs may no longer enter Standard: Off -campus and co -location requirements for CAHs. A CAH may continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph(c) of this section based only if the CAH meets the following: into co- location arrangements with another CAH or hospital (72 FR 66878). However, necessary provider CAHs that had co- location arrangements in effect p rior to January 1, 2008, are permitted to continue these arrangements as long as the type and scope of services offered by the facility co -located with the CAHs do not change. An example of a change in type of services would be when a hospital that provides only rehabilitation services chooses to provide general hospital acute care services. An example of a change in scope of services would be when a grandfathered necessary provider CAH is currently co-located with a 20 bed psychiatric hospital and the ps ychiatric hospital now decides to increase the number of beds to 30. The determination of whether or not CAHs with a grandfathered necessary provider designation have met the requirements at \u00a7485.610(e)(1) is made by the RO. If the SA or accreditation organization (AO) becomes aware of a co -location arrangement, the SA or AO must notify the RO. The RO will utilize the co -location guidance in \u00a72256G of the SOM to determine if such CAHs satisfy the co -location requirements at \u00a7485.610(e)(1). The RO will notify the CAH as well as the SA (and the AO, if applicable) of its determination. A CAH found out of compliance with the requirements is subject to termination of its Medicare provider agreement under \u00a7489.53(a)(3). In such cases the CAH is placed on a 90-day termination track, as outlined in \u00a73012 of the SOM. If the CAH corrects the situation, by terminating the co -location arrangement that led to the non- compliance during this 90 day period, then the provider agreement is not terminated. A facility facing termination of its CAH designation as a result of non -complianc e with \u00a7485.610(e)(1) could also continue to participate in Medicare by converting to a hospital, assuming that the facility satisfies all requirements for participation as a hospital in the Medicare program under the provisions at 42 CFR Part 482. Under this scenario, the CAH would apply to convert back to a hospital, with the effective date coinciding with the date of termination of CAH status. A new CMS Certification Number (CCN) would be assigned accordingly. Requirements for CAHs. A CAH may continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph(c) of this section based only if the CAH meets the following:] (2) If a CAH or a necessary provider CAH operates an off -campus provider -based location, excluding an RHC as defined in \u00a7405.2401(b) of this chapter, but including a department or remote location, as defined in \u00a7413.65(a)(2) of this chapter, or an off -campus d istinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit, as defined in \u00a7485.647, that was created or acquired by the CAH on or after January 1, 2008, the CAH can continue to meet the location requirement of paragraph (c) of this section only if the off -campus prov ider- based location or off-campus distinct part unit is located more than a 35 mile drive (or, in the case of mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads available, a 15 mile drive) from a hospital or another CAH. (3) If either a CAH or a CA H that has been designated as a necessary provider by the State [does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, by co- locating with another hospital or CAH on or after January 1, 2008, or ] creates or acquires an off -campus provider -based location or off -campus distinct part unit on or after January 1, 2008, that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the CAH's provider agreement will be subject to termination in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7489.53(a)( 3) of this subchapter, unless the CAH terminates the off -campus arrangement or the co -location arrangement, or both. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.610(e)(2) & (3) Section 42 CFR 485.610(e)(2) requires that if a CAH operates an off -campus provider - based facility as defined in \u00a7413.65(a)(2) (except for a rural health clinic (RHC)) or off - campus rehabilitation or psychiatric distinct part unit as defined at \u00a7485.647, that was created or acquired on or after January 1, 2008, then the off -campus facility must meet the requirement at 42 CFR 485.610(c) to be more than a 35 mile drive (or 15 miles in the case of mountainous terrain or an area with only secondary roads) from any other CAH or hospital. Off -campus CAH facilities that were in existence prior to Janu ary 1, 2008, are not subject to this requirement. If a non- IHS or non- Tribal CAH operates an off -campus provider -based facility, its proximity to an IHS or Tribal CAH or hospital is not considered when assessing compliance with the requirements of this se ction. Similarly, if an IHS or Tribal CAH operates an off -campus provider -based facility, its proximity to a non- IHS or non- Tribal CAH or hospital is not considered when assessing compliance. The drive to another hospital or CAH is to be calculated from the provider -based facility's location to the main campus of the other hospital or CAH. The distance to another hospital or CAH requirement does not apply to the following types of facilities/services, because such facilities or services are not eligible f or provider -based status in accordance with \u00a7413.65(a)(1)(ii): Ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs); Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORFs); Home Health Agencies (HHAs); Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs); Hospices; Independent diagnostic testing facilities furnishing only services paid under a fee schedule, such as facilities that furnish only screening mammography services, facilities that furnish only clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, or facilities that furnish only some c ombination of these services; ESRD facilities; Departments of providers that perform functions necessary for the successful operation of the CAH, but for which separate CAH payment may not be claimed under Medicare or Medicaid, e.g., laundry, or medical records department; and Ambulances. In the case of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), although CMS rules permit them to be provider -based departments of a hospital or CAH, it is unlikely that there are new FQHCs that meet the provider -based cri teria, since the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) requirements for separate FQHC governance make it unlikely an FQHC could meet provider -based governance requirements. However, there are grandfathered FQHCs that were in operation prior to April 7, 2000 which are permitted to retain their provider -based status. Those CAHs seeking a provider -based determination for newly created or acquired provider -based departments, remote locations and/or psychiatric or rehabilitation units located off -campus must submit an attestation to the Regional Office (RO), as specified in \u00a72254H of the SOM, who makes the determination of whether it satisfies the CAH provider -based criteria at \u00a7485.610(e)(2), and the provider -based rules at \u00a7413.65. At the concl usion of its review, the RO will notify the CAH and the SA (and accreditation organization (AO), if applicable) of its determination. If the SA or AO becomes aware of a provider -based off -campus facility that appears not to comply with the provider -based location requirements, the SA or AO must notify the RO. The RO will utilize the guidance in \u00a72254H of the SOM to determine if the CAH satisfies the provider -based location requirements at \u00a7485.610(e)(2). The RO will notify the CAH as well as the SA (and the AO, if applicable) of its determination. A CAH found out of compliance with the off -campus location requirements at \u00a7485.610(e)(2) is subject to termination of its Medicare provider agreement. In such cases the CAH is placed on a 90 -day termination track, as outlined in \u00a73012 of the SOM. If the CAH corrects the situation, by terminating the off -campus provider -based arrangement that led to the non- compliance during this 90 day period, then the provider agreement is not terminated. A facility facing termination of its CAH status as a result of non -compliance with \u00a7485.610(e)(2) could also continue to participate in Medicare by converting to a hospital, assuming that the facility satisfies all requirements for participation as a hospital in the Medicare program under the provisions at 42 CFR Part 482. Under this scenario, the CAH would apply to convert back to a hospital, with the e ffective date coinciding with the date of termination of CAH status. A new CCN number would be assigned accordingly. Participation: Compliance With CAH Requirements at the Time of Application Except for recently closed facilities as described in \u00a7485.610(a)(2), or health clinics or health centers as described in \u00a7485.610(a)(3), the facility is a hospital that has a provider agreement to participate in the Medicare program as a hospital at the time the hospital applies for designation as a CAH. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.612 This COP only applies to initial surveys. All facilities that apply to become a CAH are surveyed using the CAH CoP to determ ine compliance, whether they are: A currently operating CAH; or A re-opened CAH; or A CAH that down -sized to become a clinic. If a facility has never been a Medicare participating hospital and wishes to be a CAH, the facility is a new provider to Medicare and must first meet the certification as a hospital and then put in a change of status request to be a CAH. In these cases, the facility must be surveyed twice. They must be initially surveyed using the hospital CoP and, when the change reques t is received, they must be surveyed again using the CAH CoP. In addition, these facilities are to be treated as new providers to Medicare necessitating completion of an application package as a new Medicare provider. C-0860 (Rev. Network H ospitals In the case of a CAH that is a member of a rural health network as defined in \u00a7485.603 of this chapter, the CAH has in effect an agreement with at least one hospital that is a member of the network for: Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.616(a) Section 485.603 defines a rural health network as an organization that includes at least one hospital that the State has designated or plans to designate as a CAH, and at least one hospital that furnishes acute care (hospital) services. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.616(a) If the CAH is a member of a rural health network having a communications system, ask to see the agreement. How does the CAH participate with other hospitals and facilities in the network communications system? o Is a communications log kept at the facility? o Ask staff if there have been difficulties in contacting network members. If so, ask how the CAH deals with communication delays. How does the network's communications system compare with any available communications equipment in the CAH? When the network communications system is not in operation, how does the CAH communicate and share patient data with other network members? Review any policies and procedures related to the operation of any communications system. How is the CAH staff educated on the use of any communication system utilized in the facility? Review any written agreements with the local EMS service. C-0864 (Rev. development and use of communications systems of the network, including the network's system for the electronic sharing of patient data, and telemetry and medical records, if the network has in operation such a system; and C-0868 of emergency and non -emergency transportation between the facility and the hospital. C-0870 Credentialing and Quality Assurance Each CAH that is a me mber of a rural health network shall have an agreement with respect to credentialing and quality assurance with at least -- (1) One hospital that is a member of the network; (2) One QIO or equivalent entity; or (3) One other appropriate and qualified ent ity identified in the State rural health care plan. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.616(b) Other qualified entities could include another CAH or any licensed firms, businesses, or agencies that provide credentialing and QA services. The location for these other qualified entities is not limited to local entities. Agreements for QA need to include medical record review as part of the determination of the quality and medical necessity of medical care at the CAH. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.616(b) Review any agreements related to credentialing or quality assurance to determine the level of assistance to be provided and the responsibilities of the CAH. Review policies and procedures to determine how information is to be obtained, utilized, and how confidential ity of information will be maintained. C-0872 (Rev. of telemedicine physicians and practitioners. (1) The governing body of the CAH must ensure that, when telemedicine services are furnished to the CAH's patients through an agreement with a distant - site hospital, the agreement is written and specifies that it is the responsibility of the governing bod y of the distant- site hospital to meet the following requirements with regard to its physicians or practitioners providing telemedicine services: (i) Determine, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are eligible candidates for appointment to the medical staff. (ii) Appoint members of the medical staff after considering the recommendations of the existing members of the medical staff. (iii) Assure that the medical staff has bylaws. (iv) Approve medical staff bylaws and ot her medical staff rules and regulations. (v) Ensure that the medical staff is accountable to the governing body for the quality of care provided to patients. (vi) Ensure the criteria for selection are individual character, competence, training, experi ence, and judgment. (vii) Ensure that under no circumstances is the accordance of staff membership or professional privileges in the hospital dependent solely upon certification, fellowship or membership in a specialty body or society. (2) When telemedicine services are furnished to the CAH's patients through an agreement with a distant -site hospital, the CAH's governing body or responsible individual may choose to rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions made by the governing body of the distant -site hospital regarding individual distant -site physicians or practitioners. The CAH's governing body or responsible individual must ensure, through its written agreement with the distant -site hospital, that the following provisions are met: (i) The distant- site hospital providing telemedicine services is a Medicare -participating hospital. (ii) The individual distant -site physician or practitioner is privileged at the distant -site hospital providing the telemedicine services, which provi des a current list of the distant -site physician's or practitioner's privileges; (iii) The individual distant -site physician or practitioner holds a license issued or recognized by the State in which the CAH is located; and (iv) With respect to a dis tant- site physician or practitioner, who holds current privileges at the CAH whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services, the CAH has evidence of an internal review of the distant -site physician's or practitioner's performance of these privileges and sends the distant -site hospital such information for use in the periodic appraisal of the individual distant -site physician or practitioner. At a minimum, this information must include all adverse events that result from the telemedicine services provided by the distant -site physician or practitioner to the CAH's patients and all complaints the CAH has received about the distant -site physician or practitioner. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.616(c) \u00a7485.616(c)(1)&(2) \"Telemedicine,\" as the term is used in this regulation, means the provision of clinical services to patients by physicians and practitioners from a distance via electronic communications. The distant -site telemedicine physician or practitioner provides clinical services to the CAH patient either simultaneously, as is often the case with teleICU services, for example, or non- simultaneously, as may be the case with many teleradiology services. \"Simultaneously\" means that the clinical services (for example, assessment of the patient with a c linical plan for treatment, including any medical orders needed) are provided to the patient in \"real time\" by the telemedicine physician or practitioner, similar to the actions of an on -site practitioner when called in by a patient's attending physician t o see the patient. \"Non- simultaneously\" means that, while the telemedicine physician or practitioner still provides clinical services to the patient, such services may involve after -the-fact interpretation of diagnostic tests in order to provide an assessm ent of the patient's condition and do not necessarily require the telemedicine practitioner to directly assess the patient in \"real time.\" This would be similar to the services provided by an on -site radiologist who interprets a patient's x -ray or CT scan and then communicates his or her assessment to the patient's attending physician who then bases his or her diagnosis and treatment plan on these findings. . (See 76 FR 25552, May 5, 2011) A CAH may make arrangements with a distant -site Medicare- participating hospital for the provision of telemedicine services to the CAH's patients by physicians or practitioners granted privileges by the distant- site hospital. If a CAH enters into an agreement for telemedicine services with a distant -site hospital, the agreement must be in writing. Furthermore, the written agreement must specify that it is the responsibility of the distant- site hospital to conduct its credentialing and privileging process for those of its physicians and practitioners providing telemedic ine services such that the distant -site hospital: Determines, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are eligible candidates for privileges or membership on the distant -site hospital's medical staff. Appoints members and grants medical staff privileges after considering the recommendations of the existing members of the distant -site hospital's medical staff. Assures that the distant -site hospital's medical staff has bylaws. Approves the distant -site hospital's medical staff byla ws and other medical staff rules and regulations. Ensures that the medical staff is accountable to the distant- site hospital's governing body for the quality of care provided to patients. Ensures the criteria for granting medical staff membership/privile ges to an individual are the individual's character, competence, training, experience, and judgment. Ensures that under no circumstances is the accordance of distant -site hospital medical staff membership or privileges dependent solely upon certification, fellowship or membership in a specialty body or society. Since the distant -site hospital must also participate in Medicare, it has an independent obligation to comply with these same requirements for all of its medical staff under \u00a7\u00a7482.12(a)(1) through (a) (7). Nevertheless, the written telemedicine services agreement between the CAH and the distant -site hospital must explicitly include a provision addressing the distant -site hospital's obligation to comply with these provisions. The CAH's governing bo dy (or the individual responsible for the CAH if it has no governing body) has the option, when considering granting privileges to telemedicine physicians and practitioners, to rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site hospi tal for these physicians and practitioners. In order to exercise this alternative credentialing and privileging option, the CAH's governing body must ensure that its written agreement with the distant- site hospital addresses all of the following: That th e distant -site hospital participates in the Medicare program. If the distant- site hospital's participation in Medicare is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, at any time during the agreement, then as of the effective date of the termination, the CAH may no longer receive telemedicine services under the agreement; That the distant -site hospital provides a list to the CAH of all its physicians and practitioners covered by the agreement, including their privileges at the distant - site hospital. The list may not include any physician or practitioner who does not hold privileges at the distant -site hospital. The list must be current, so the agreement must address how the distant -site hospital will keep the list current; That each physician or practitioner who provides telemedicine services to the CAH's patients under the agreement holds a license issued or recognized by the State where the CAH is located. States may have varying requirements as to whether they will recog nize an out -of-state license for purposes of practicing within their State, and they may also vary as to whether they establish different standards for telemedicine services. The licensure requirements governing in the State where the CAH whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services is located must be satisfied, whatever they may be; and That the CAH has evidence that it reviews the telemedicine services provided to its patients and provides feedback based on this review to the distant -site hospital for the latter's use in its periodic appraisal of each physician and practitioner providing telemedicine services under the agreement. At a minimum, the CAH must review and send information to the distant -site hospital on all adverse events that resu lt from a physician or practitioner's provision of telemedicine services and on all complaints the CAH has received about a telemedicine physician or practitioner. If the CAH's governing body or responsible individual does not rely on the privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital, then it must for each physician or practitioner providing telemedicine services under an agreement follow the CAH's standard process for review of credentials and granting of privileges to physicians and practitioners. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.616(c)(1)&(2) Ask the CAH's leadership whether it uses telemedicine services. If yes, Ask to see a copy of the written agreement(s) with the distant- site hospital(s). Does each agreement include the required elements concerning credentialing and privileging of the telemedicine physicians and practitioners by the distant- site hospital? Does the CAH have documentation indicating that it granted privileges to each telemedicine physician and practitioner? Does the documentation indicate that the CAH's governing body or responsible individual made the privileging decision based on the privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital? If yes: Does the agreement address the required elements concerning the distant -site hospital' s Medicare participation, appropriate licensure of telemedicine physicians and practitioners, current list of telemedicine physicians and practitioners with privileges, and review by the CAH of the telemedicine physicians' and practitioners' services? Ask to see the list provided by the distant -site hospital of the telemedicine physicians and practitioners, including their privileges and pertinent licensure information. Ask for evidence that the CAH conducts the required review of the telemedicine services provided by the telemedicine physicians and practitioners, including any associated adverse events and complaints, and that it provides the required feedback to the distant -site hospital. C-0874 (Rev. 200, 02 -21-20) \u00a7485.616(c)(3) The governing body of the CAH must ensure that when telemedicine services are furnished to the CAH's patients through an agreement with a distant - site telemedicine entity, the agreement is written and specifies tha t the distant- site telemedicine entity is a contractor of services to the CAH and as such, in accordance with \u00a7485.635(c)(4)(ii), furnishes the contracted services in a manner that enables the CAH to comply with all applicable conditions of participation f or the contracted services, including, but not limited to, the requirements in this section with regard to its physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services. \u00a7485.616(c)(4) When telemedicine services are furnished to the CAH's patients through an agreement with a distant -site telemedicine entity, the CAH's governing body or responsible individual may choose to rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions made by the governing body of the distant -site telemedicine entity regarding i ndividual distant -site physicians or practitioners. The CAH's governing body or responsible individual must ensure, through its written agreement with the distant- site telemedicine entity, that the following provisions are met: (i) The distant -site telemedicine entity's medical staff credentialing and privileging process and standards at least meet the standards at (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii). (ii) The individual distant -site physician or practitioner is privileged at the distant -site telemedicine entity provid ing the telemedicine services, which provides a current list to the CAH of the distant -site physician's or practitioner's privileges at the distant -site telemedicine entity. (iii) The individual distant -site physician or practitioner holds a license issued or recognized by the State in which the CAH whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services is located. (iv) With respect to a distant -site physician or practitioner, who holds current privileges at the CAH whose patients are receiving the telemedicine serv ices, the CAH has evidence of an internal review of the distant -site physician's or practitioner's performance of these privileges and sends the distant -site telemedicine entity such information for use in periodic appraisal of the distant -site physician or practitioner. At a minimum, this information must include all adverse events that result from the telemedicine services provided by the distant -site physician or practitioner to the CAH's patients and all complaints the CAH has received about the dista nt-site physician or practitioner. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.616(c)(3)&(4) For the purposes of this rule, a distant -site telemedicine entity is defined as an entity that -- (1) provides telemedicine services; (2) is not a Medicare- participating hospital; and (3) provides contracted services in a manner that enables a CAH using its services to meet all applicable CoPs, particularly those requirements related to the credentialing and privileging of physicians and practitioners providing telemedicin e services to the patients of a CAH. A distant -site telemedicine entity would include a distant- site hospital that does not participate in the Medicare program that is providing telemedicine services to a Medicare- participating CAH. (See 76 FR 25553, May 5, 2011) A CAH may have an agreement with a distant -site telemedicine entity for the provision of telemedicine services to the CAH's patients by physicians or practitioners granted privileges by the distant- site telemedicine entity. If a CAH enters into an agreement for telemedicine services with a distant -site telemedicine entity, the agreement must be in writing. Furthermore, the written agreement must specify that under the agreement the distant -site telemedicine entity is a contractor providing serv ices to the CAH, and that, in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7485.635(c)(4)(ii), the distant -site telemedicine entity furnishes its telemedicine services in a manner that enables the CAH to comply with all applicable CAH Conditions of Participation (C oPs), including, but not limited to, the specific requirements governing telemedicine services. Under \u00a7485.635(c)(4)(ii,) the CAH's governing body or responsible individual is obligated to ensure that all contractors of services furnish those services in a manner that enables the CAH to comply with all applicable CoPs. The CAH's governing body (or the individual responsible for the CAH if it has no governing body) has the option, when considering granting privileges to telemedicine physicians and practiti oners, to rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site telemedicine entity for these physicians and practitioners. In order to exercise this alternative credentialing and privileging option, the CAH's governing body must ensur e through its written agreement with the distant- site telemedicine entity that all of the following requirements are included in the agreement and that the contractor fulfills these requirements: The distant -site telemedicine entity's medical staff creden tialing and privileging process and standards at least meets the standards at \u00a7485.616(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii). In other words, the distant -site telemedicine entity must at a minimum: Determine, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are eligible candidates for medical staff privileges or membership at the telemedicine entity; Appoint members and grant medical staff privileges after considering the recommendations of the existing members of its medical staff; Assure that i ts medical staff has bylaws; Approve its medical staff's bylaws and other medical staff rules and regulations; Ensure that the medical staff is accountable to the distant- site telemedicine entity's governing body for the quality of care provided to patients; Ensure the criteria for granting distant- site telemedicine medical staff membership/privileges to an individual are the individual's character, competence, training, experience, and judgment; and Ensure that under no circumstances is the accordance of medical staff membership or privileges dependent solely upon certification, fellowship or membership in a specialty body or society. The distant -site telemedicine entity provides to the CAH a list of all its physicians and practitioners covered by the agreement, including their privileges at the distant- site telemedicine entity. The list may not include any physician or practitioner who does not hold privileges at the distant -site telemedicine entity. The list must be current, so the agreement mu st address how the distant -site telemedicine entity will keep the list current; Each physician or practitioner who provides telemedicine services to the CAH's patients under the agreement holds a license issued or recognized by the State where the CAH is located. States may have varying requirements as to whether they will recognize an out -of-state license for purposes of practicing within their State, and they may also vary as to whether they establish different standards for telemedicine services. The licensure requirements governing in the State where the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services is located must be satisfied, whatever they may be; and The CAH reviews the performance of the physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services to its patients and provides a written review to the distant -site telemedicine entity for the latter's use in its periodic appraisal of each physician and practitioner providing telemedicine services under the agreement. At a minimum, the CAH must review and send information to the distant -site telemedicine entity on all adverse events that result from a physician's or practitioner's provision of telemedicine services and on all complaints the CAH has received about a telemedicine phys ician or practitioner. If the CAH's governing body or responsible individual does not rely on the privileging decisions of the distant -site telemedicine entity, then it must for each practitioner providing telemedicine services under an agreement follow t he CAH's standard process for review of credentials and granting of privileges to physicians and practitioners. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.616(c)(3)&(4) Ask the CAH's leadership whether it uses telemedicine services. If yes, Ask to see a copy of the written agreement(s) with the distant- site telemedicine entity(ies). Does each agreement explicitly state that the distant- site telemedicine entity will provide telemedicine services in a manner that enables the CAH to comply with all applicable CoPs? Does the CAH have documentation indicating that it granted privileges to each telemedicine physician and practitioner? Does the documentation indicate that the CAH's governing body or responsible individual made the privileging decision based on the privil eging decisions of the distant -site telemedicine entity? If yes: Does the written agreement with the distant- site telemedicine entity address the required elements concerning the distant -site telemedicine entity's utilization of a medical staff credentialing and privileging process that meets the requirements of the hospital CoPs, licensure of telemedicine physicians and practitioners, current list of telemedicine physicians and practitioners with privileges at the distant- site telemedicine entity, and w ritten review by the CAH of the telemedicine physicians' and practitioners' services? Is there a list provided by the distant -site telemedicine entity of the telemedicine physicians and practitioners covered by the agreement, including their privileges an d pertinent licensure information? Is there evidence that the CAH reviews the services provided by the telemedicine physicians and practitioners, including any adverse events and complaints, and provides written feedback to the distant -site telemedicine entity? Ask the CAH how it verifies that the telemedicine entity fulfills the terms of the agreement with respect to its credentialing and privileging process and otherwise assures that services are provided in a manner that enables the CAH to meet all applicable CAH requirements? (Surveyors do not attempt to independently verify whether or not the distant -site telemedicine entity's credentialing and privileging process fulfills the regulatory requirements. Surveyors focus only on what actions the CAH tak es to ensure that the distant -site telemedicine entity complies with the terms of the Participation: Emergency Services The CAH provides emergency care necessary to meet the needs of its inpatients and outpatients. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.618 All emergency services must be provided as a direct service in the CAH. The ED cannot be a provider -based off -site location. Emergency needs of patients must be met in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. Acceptable standards of practice include maintaining compliance with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and guidelines governing all services provided in the CAH'S emergency department, as well as any standards and recommendations promoted by or established by nationally recognized professional organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Association for Respiratory Care, American Society of Emerge ncy Medicine, American College of Surgeons, American Nursing Association, etc. The CAH'S emergency services must be under the direction of a qualified member of the CAH'S medical staff. The CAH'S medical staff establishes criteria for the qualifications for the director of the CAH'S emergency services in accordance with State law and acceptable standards of practice. The CAH'S medical staff must establish policies and procedures governing the medical care provided in the emergency services or emergency d epartment. Emergency services or emergency department policies must be current and revised as necessary based on the ongoing monitoring conducted by the medical staff and the emergency service or department QA activities. The CAH'S emergency services mus t be integrated into the CAH- wide QA program. The medical staff must establish criteria, in accordance with State law, regulations, and guidelines, delineating the qualifications a medical staff member must possess in order to be granted privileges for the provision of emergency care services. Qualifications include necessary education, experience and specialized training, consistent with State law and acceptable standards of practice. The CAH must staff the emergency department with the appropriate numbers and types of professionals and other staff who possess the skills, education, certifications, specialized training and experience in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility. There must be suffici ent medical and nursing personnel to respond to the emergency medical needs and care of the patient population being served. The CAH must determine the categories and numbers of MD/DOs, specialists, RNs, EMTs, and emergency department support staff the CA H needed to mee t its anticipated emergency needs. The medical staff must establish criteria, in accordance with State law and regulations and acceptable standards of practice delineating the qualifications required for each category of emergency services staff (e.g., emergency physicians, specialist MD/DO, RNs, EMTs, mid -level practitioners, etc.). The CAH must conduct ongoing assessments of its emergency needs in order to anticipate the policies, procedures, staffing, training, and other resources that m ay be needed to address likely demands. Emergency care necessary to meet the needs of its inpatients and outpatients would include the provision of respiratory services as needed by the CAH'S emergency patients. When respiratory services are provided those services must be provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. The scope of diagnostic and/or therapeutic respiratory services offered by the CAH should be defined in writing, and approved by the medical staff. The CAH must provide the appropriate equipment and qualified personnel necessary to furnish all services offered in a safe manner in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. There should be written policies for the delivery of any services provided. The policies and pr ocedures must be developed and approved by the medical staff and include the participation of any mid -level practitioners working in the ED. The written policies should address the following services, as appropriate: Each type of service provided by the CAH; The qualifications, including job title, licensure requirements, education, training and experience of personnel authorized to perform each type of respiratory care service and whether they may perform it without supervision; Equipment assembly and operation; Safety practices, including infection control measures; Handling, storage, and dispensing of therapeutic gases; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Procedures to follow in the advent of adverse reactions to treatments or interventions; Pulmonary function testing; Therapeutic percussion gas administration; Administration of medications; and Procedures for obtaining and analyzing blood samples (arterial blood gases). Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618 Verify that emergency services are organized under the direction of a qualified member of the medical staff. Verify that procedures and policies for emergency medical services (including triage of patients and any respiratory services provided) are established, evaluated, and updated on an ongoing basis. Verify that there are sufficient medical and nursing personnel qualified in the needs anticipated by the facility and that there are specific assigned duties for emergency care Review any policies and procedures for emergency services in the CAH. What evidence indicates that the CAH is capable of providing necessary emergency care for its inpatients and outpatients? Review a sample of patient records for patients treated in the emergency services department to see if the CAH followed its own policies and procedures. Verify that emergency services are provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. Interview staff to determine that they are knowledgeable, within their own level of participation in emergency care including: Parenteral administration of electrolytes, fluids, blood and blood components; Care and management of injuries to extremities and central nervous system; Prevention of contamination and cross infection; and Provision of emergency respiratory services. Determine if the CAH provides any degree of respiratory care services and that the type and amount of respiratory care provided meets the needs of the patients and is delivered in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. Review the CAH policies and procedures to verify that the scope of the diagnostic and/or therapeutic respiratory care services provided is defined in writing and approved by the medical staff. Review staffing schedules to determine that the number and type of staff available is appropriate to the volume and types of treatments furnished. If blood gases or other laboratory tests are performed as part of the delivery of respiratory services, verify that there is a current CLIA certificate. C-0882 services are available on a 24- hours a day basis. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.618(a) The CAH \"makes available 24 -hour emergency services.\" This does not mean that the CAH must remain open 24 hours a day when it does not have inpatients (including swing -bed patients). A CAH that does not have inpatients may close with no staff present, provided that it has an effective system in place to meet the requirement. The system must ensure that a practitioner with training and experience in emergenc y care is on call and immediately available by telephone or radio, and available on site within 30 minutes, (or 1 hour in certain frontier areas), 24 hours a day. In addition to these items, the CAH must maintain the types, quality and numbers of supplies , drugs and biologicals, blood and blood products, and equipment required by state and local law and in accordance with accepted standards of practice. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(a) Ascertain by record review of patients admitted through the emergency de partment, interviews with staff, patients, and families, and/or observations that ED services were made available to patients presenting on a 24 -hour a day basis. How does the CAH ensure that emergency services are made available on a 24 -hour a day basis? Supplies, and Medication Equipment, supplies, and medication used in treating emergency cases are kept at the CAH and are readily available for treating emergency cases. The items available must include the following: Interpretive Guidance \u00a7485.618(b) In addition to these items, the CAH must maintain the types, quality and numbers of supplies, drugs and biologicals, blood and blood products, and equipment required by State and local law and in accordance with accepted standards of practice. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(b) How does the CAH ensure that the required equipment, supplies and medications are always readily available in th e CAH? Interview staff and tour the ER to ascertain compliance and ability to provide emergency services. C-0886 (Rev. commonly used in life -saving procedures, including analgesics, local anesthetics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidotes and replacement solutions. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(b)(1) How does the CAH ensure that staff knows where drugs and biologicals are kept? How is the inventory maintained? Who is responsible for monitoring drugs and biologicals? How are drugs and biologicals and supplies commonly used in life -saving procedures, including airways, endotracheal tubes, ambu bag/valve/mask, oxygen, tourniquets, immobilization devices, nasogastric tubes, splints, IV therapy supplies, suction machine, defibrillator, cardiac monitor, chest tubes, and indwelling urinary catheters. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(b)(2) How does the CAH ensure that required equipment and supplies are readily available to staff? How does the CAH ensure that staff knows where emergency equipment and supplies are kept? How is the supply inventory maintained? Who is responsible for monitoring supplies? How are supplies replaced? When was the last time emergency supplies were used? Is there an equipment maintenance schedule (e.g., for the defibrillator)? Ask staff if equipment has ever failed to work when needed. Examine sterilized equipment (e.g., tracheostomy sets) for expiration dates when applicable. Examine the oxygen supply system to determine functional capabilities. Check the force of the vacuum (suction) equipment to see that it is in operating condition. C-0890 (Rev. and Blood Products The facility provides, either directly or under arrangements, the following -- (1) Services for the procurement, safekeeping, and transfusion of blood, including the availability of blood products needed for emergencies on a 24 -hours a day basis. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.618(c)(1) This requirement can be met at a CAH by providing blood or blood products on an emergency basis at the CAH, either directly or through arrangement, if that is what the patient's condition requires. There is no requirement in the regulation for a CAH to store blood on site, although it may choose to do so. In some cases, it may be more practical to transport a patient to the source of the blood supply than to bring blood to the patient at the CAH. A facility that has the capability of providing blood services on site would be in compliance even if, in virtually all cases, the patients were actually taken to the blood rather than vice versa. A CAH that performs CLIA tests on blood on- site must have a CLIA certificate and is subject to survey under CLIA. A CAH that is only storing blood for transfusion and refers all relat ed testing out to another laboratory, is not performing testing as defined by CLIA. However, under this regulation, the CAH must ensure that blood is appropriately stored to prevent deterioration, including documenting refrigerator temperatures. The provision of blood services between the CAH and the testing laboratory should be reflected in the written agreement or arrangement between the two. Also, if the CAH is collecting blood, it must register with the Food and Drug Administration. \"Availability \" in this context, means that the blood and blood products must be accessible to CAH staff in time to effectively treat emergency patients at the CAH. In order to comply with this requirement, a CAH must demonstrate that it has the capability (i.e., an effect ive system is in place regardless of whether, in actual practice, it has been utilized) of making blood products available to its emergency patients 24 hours a day. If a CAH performs type and compatibility testing it must have the necessary equipment, (i.e., serofuge and heat block), as well as typing and cross matching reagents, some of which have a 30- day expiration date. Another way for a CAH to meet this requirement would be to properly store 4 units of O negative packed red blood cells (the univer sal donor type) for availability at all times for emergencies only. CAHs that choose to store O negative packed red blood cells for emergency release of uncross matched blood will require a release form to be signed by a doctor, prior to transfusion, acknowledging that the blood has not been cross matched for the patient. Facilities that elect to store units of O negative packed red blood cells should be able to demonstrate that they have an arrangement (e.g., with the Red Cross or other similar product provider) for the provision of fresh units of O negative packed red blood cells. C-0892 (Rev. facilities that meet the requirements of 42 CFR part 493, subp art K, and are under the control and supervision of a pathologist or other qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy. If blood banking services are provided under an arrangement, the arrangement is approved by the facility's medical staff and by the pers ons directly responsible for the operation of the facility. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(c)(2) If blood banking services are provided on site, what evidence shows that the blood facility is under the control and supervision of a pathologist or other qualif ied MD/DO? For blood banking services provided under arrangement, what evidence shows that the CAH medical staff and the person responsible for CAH operations have approved the arrangement? C-0894 Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, there must be a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a physician assistant, a nurse practitioner or a clinical nurse specialist with training or experience in emergency care on call and immediately available by telephone or radio contact, and available on site within the following timeframes: (i) Within 30 minutes, on a 24- hour a day basis, if the CAH is located in an area other than an area described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; or (ii) Within 60 minutes, on a 24- hour a day basis, if all of the following requirements are met: (A) The CAH is located in an area designated as a frontier area (that is, an area with fewer than six residents per square mile based on the latest population data published by the Bureau of the Census) or in an area that meets criteria for a remote location adopted by the State in its rural health care plan, and approved by CMS, under section 1820(b) of the Act. (B) The State has determined under criteria in its rural health care plan, that allowing an emergency response time longer than 30 minutes is the only feasible method of providing emergency care to residents of the area served by the CAH. (C) The State maintains documentation showing that the response time of up to 60 minutes at a particular CAH it designates is justified because other available alternatives would increase the time needed t o stabilize a patient in an emergency. (2) A registered nurse with training and experience in emergency care can be utilized to conduct specific medical screening examinations only if \u2014 (i) The registered nurse is on site and immediately available at the CAH when a patient requests medical care; and (ii) The nature of the patient's request for medical care is within the scope of practice of a registered nurse and consistent with applicable State laws and the CAH's bylaws or rules and regulations. (3) A registered nurse satisfies the personnel requirement specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a temporary period if -- (i) The CAH has no greater than 10 beds; (ii) The CAH is located in an area designated as a frontier area or remote location as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; (iii) The State in which the CAH is located submits a letter to CMS signed by the Governor, following consultation on the issue of using RNs on a temporary basis as part of their State rural health care plan with the State Boards of Medicine and Nursing, and in accordance with State law, requesting that a registered nurse with training and experience in emergency care be included in the list of personnel specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The letter from the Governor must attest that he or she has consulted with State Boards of Medicine and Nursing about issues related to access to and the quality of emergency services in the States. The letter from the Governor must also describe the ci rcumstances and duration of the temporary request to include the registered nurses on the list of personnel specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; (iv) Once a Governor submits a letter, as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a CAH must submit documentation to the State survey agency demonstrating that it has been unable, due to the shortage of such personnel in the area, to provide adequate coverage as specified in this paragraph (d). (4) The request, as specified in paragraph (d)( 3)(iii) of this section, and the withdrawal of the request, may be submitted to us at any time, and are effective upon submission. Interpretive Guidance \u00a7 485.618(d) When State laws are more stringent and require more stringent staffing or expanded opera tional hours, the CAH must staff its emergency department in accordance with state laws. For example, if State law requires the CAH emergency department be open and be staffed with a MD/DO 24/7 then the CAH must comply. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(d) Review on -call schedules to determine how the CAH ensures that a qualified staff member is on call 24 hours a day and available on site at the CAH within 30 minutes, or 60 minutes in certain frontier areas. Interview staff to determine how the CAH staff k nows who is on call. What documentation demonstrates that a MD/DO, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or registered nurse (as allowed under (d)(3)) with emergency training or experience has been on call and available on sit e at the CAH within 30 or 60 minutes, as appropriate? C-0898 With Emergency Response Systems The CAH must, in coordination with emergency response systems in the area, establish procedures under which a doctor of medicine or osteopathy is immediately available by telephone or radio contact on a 24 -hours a day basis to receive emergency calls, provide information on treatment of emergency pat ients, and refer patients to the CAH or other appropriate locations for treatment. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.618(e) The CAH, not the local ambulance service, is responsible for ensuring that an effective procedure is in place to meet this requirement. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.618(e) Verify that the CAH has policies and procedures in place to ensure an MD/DO is available by telephone or radio, on a 24- hour a day basis to receive emergency calls and provide medical direction in emergency situations? What evidence demonstrates that the procedures are followed and evaluated for effectiveness? Interview staff to see how an MD/DO is contacted when emergency instructions are needed. C-0900 Except permitted for CAHs having distinct part units under \u00a7485.647, the CAH maintains no more than 25 inpatient beds. Inpatient beds may be used for either inpatient or swing -bed services. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.620(a) Section 1820(c) (2)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act limits a CAH to a maximum of 25 inpatient beds that can be used for inpatient acute care or swing bed services. The statute also requires CAHs to provide inpatient acute care limited, on an annual average basis, to 96 hours per patient (see interpretive guidelines for \u00a7485.620(b)). Section 1820(c)(2)(E) of the Act also permits a CAH to operate a 10- bed psychiatric distinct part unit (DPU) and a 10- bed rehabilitation DPU, without counting these beds toward the 25- bed inpatient limit. The limit applies to the number of inpatient beds; not to the number of inpatients on any given day. CAHs that were larger hospitals prior to converting to CAH status may not maintain more than 25 inpatient beds, plus a maximum of 10 psy chiatric DPU inpatient beds, and 10 rehabilitation DPU inpatient beds. Any bed used for inpatient services at any time must be counted when assessing compliance with the 25 inpatient bed limit. Beds used for outpatient services, such as observation servi ces, sleep studies, emergency services, etc. do not count towards the CAH's 25- bed limit only if they are never used for inpatient services. Beds Used for Observation Services Beds used solely for patients receiving observation services are not included in the 25- bed maximum, nor in the calculation of the average annual acute care patient length of stay. This makes it essential for surveyors to determine that CAHs with observation beds are using them appropriately, and not as a means to circumvent the CA H size and length - of-stay limits. Inappropriate use of observation services also subjects Medicare beneficiaries to an increased beneficiary coinsurance liability that could have been avoided, had the beneficiary been properly admitted as an inpatient. T his is the case because, as CAHs are not paid under the hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), the beneficiary in an observation status will be liable for a coinsurance charge equal to 20 percent of the CAH's customary charges for the servi ces. Further, as CAHs are also not subject to the preadmission payment window, a Medicare beneficiary would be liable for the coinsurance charges for the observation status services even when subsequently admitted. Depending on the terms of their health insurance coverage, other CAH patients may also face similar increased and avoidable costs when inappropriately placed in an observation status. Observation care is a well -defined set of specific, clinically appropriate services that include ongoing short -term treatment, assessment, and reassessment, that are provided before a decision can be made regarding whether a patient will require further treatment as an inpatient, or may be safely discharged. Observation status is commonly assigned to patients with unexpectedly prolonged recovery after outpatient surgery, and to patients who present to the emergency department and who then require a significant period of treatment or monitoring before a clinical decision is made concerning their next placement. Th e CAH should ensure that once there is sufficient information to render this clinical decision, the patient should be expeditiously admitted, appropriately transferred, or discharged. A patient may be in an observation status even though the CAH furnishes the patient overnight accommodation, food, and nursing care. Observation services are NOT appropriate: As a substitute for an inpatient admission; For continuous monitoring; For medically stable patients who need diagnostic testing or outpatient procedures (e.g., blood transfusion, chemotherapy, dialysis) that are routinely provided in an outpatient setting; For patients awaiting nursing home placement; To be used as a convenience to the patient, his or her family, the CAH, or the CAH's staff; For routine prep or recovery prior to or following diagnostic or surgical services; or As a routine \"stop\" between the emergency department and an inpatient admission. Observation services BEGIN and END with an order by a physician or other qualified licensed practitioner of the CAH. The order for observation services must be written prior to initiation of the service, as documented by a dated and timed order in the patient's medical record. The order may not be backdated. Orders should be clear for the level of care intended, such as \"admit to inpatient\" or \"place in observation.\" ( NOTE : It is not uncommon for hospitals and practitioners to refer to \"admitting\" a patient for observation. Technically, only inpatients are \"admitted,\" while patients receiving observation services are in an outpatient status. However, usage of the term \"admit\" in an order placing a patient in observation status does not violate any CAH CoP and is not cited.) Observation services end when the physician or other qualif ied licensed practitioner orders an inpatient admission, a transfer to another health care facility, or discharge. The inpatient stay begins on the date and time of the new order. Standing orders for observation services are not acceptable, since it is not necessary to employ observation services for every patient in a given category, e.g., every emergency department patient, in order to reach a clinical decision about the appropriate next step in the patient's care. Medicare generally will not pay for observation services lasting more than 48 hours. However, some States may have more stringent limits in their licensure or other regulatory requirements on the length of observation services, e.g., 24 hours. In such cases the State's more stringent limit o n the length of an observation stay applies to Medicare beneficiaries as well, but is not enforced through the Federal survey process, unless the State has taken a final enforcement action. The CAHs must provide appropriate documentation upon surveyor re quest to show that an observation bed is not an inpatient bed. The CAH must be able to document that it has specific clinical criteria for placing a patient in and discharging from, the observation service, and that these criteria are clearly distinguishable from those used for inpatient admission and discharge. CMS expects a CAH to employ the same type of clinical criteria for observation versus inpatient status for all patients, regardless of their payer status. For example, if a CAH were routinely pla cing only Medicare beneficiaries in its dedicated observation unit, then this could suggest that non- clinical criteria were being used in the decision to admit versus place in observation status. This would not only call the observation bed status into question, but could also violate the CAH's provider agreement requirement that prohibits differential treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. (See 42 CFR 489.53(a)(2)). If a CAH maintains beds that are dedicated to observation services, the CAH must be able t o provide evidence, such as the clinical criteria for admission to that unit and how patients in the unit meet those criteria, to demonstrate that its observation beds are not being used for inpatient services. CMS expects there to be a reasonable relatio nship between the size of the CAH's inpatient and observation operations. For example, a 10- bed observation unit in a 25- bed CAH might be disproportionately large, and the surveyor must determine whether the observation unit is actually functioning as an inpatient overflow unit. A CAH observation unit that routinely operates at a high occupancy rate could also be an indicator of the need to probe further. Other Types of Beds Other bed types that do not count toward the 25 inpatient bed limit include, but are not limited to: Examination or procedure tables; Stretchers; Operating room tables; Beds in a surgical recovery room used exclusively for surgical patients during recovery from anesthesia; Beds in an obstetric delivery room used exclusively for OB patients in labor or recovery after delivery of newborn infants; Newborn bassinets and isolettes used for well -baby boarders ( NOTE : If the baby is being held for treatment at the CAH, his or her bassinet or isolette does count towards the CAHs 25- bed limit); Stretchers in emergency departments; and Inpatient beds in Medicare -certified distinct part rehabilitation or psychiatric units. Beds Used for Hospice Services A CAH can dedicate beds to a hospice under arrangement, but the beds must count as part of the maximum bed count. The computation contributing to the 96 hour annual average length of stay does not apply to hospice patients. The hospice patient can be admitted to the CAH for any care involved in their hospice treatment plan or for respite care. Medicare does not reimburse the CAH for the hospice CAH benefit. Medicare reimburses the hospice. The CAH must negotiate payment for services from the hospice through an agreement. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.620(a) Count the number of inpatient beds the CAH maintains, excluding any DPU beds. Ask the CAH how frequently it uses observation services, and for its policies and procedures governing use of observation services. Verify that patients are never pre- registered for observation services; there s hould be no scheduled observation stays. Check to see if the CAH has specific clinical criteria for placement in and discharge from observation status, and that these clinical criteria are clearly distinguishable from those used for inpatient admission and discharge. If there is a separate unit of observation beds, ask the CAH for evidence of how its criteria for placement in the observation unit differ from admission criteria for an inpatient bed. Count the number of beds in the observation unit and com pare them to the number of inpatient beds. The higher the proportion of observation beds, the greater is the CAH's burden to prove these are not being used as inpatient beds. Ask for the occupancy rates for the observation unit; the higher the occupancy rate, particularly if there are more than a couple of beds, the greater is the CAH's burden to prove these are not being used as inpatient beds. Review the medical records for patients who are in observation status at the time of survey. Verify that the medical record includes an order to place the patient in observation status, including the clinical reason for observation, e.g., as \"Place patient in observation to rule out possible myocardial infarction (MI).\" Select a sample of closed medical records for patients who were in an observation status. Verify that the medical record includes an order to place the patient in observation status, as well as a later order to admit, discharge, or transfer the patient. Verify through medical record review that observation services are not ordered as a standing order following outpatient surgery or prior to admission from the emergency department. C-0904 (Rev. Stay The CAH provides acute inpatient care for a period that does not exceed, on an annual average basis, 96 hours per patient. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.620(b) The Fiscal Intermediary (FI) will determine compliance with this CoP. The FI will calculate the CAH'S length of stay based on patient census data. If a CAH exceeds the length of stay limit, the FI will send a report to the CMS -RO as well as a copy of the report to the SA. The CAH will be required to develop and implement a plan of correct ion (POC) acceptable to the CMS Regional Office or provide adequate information to demonstrate compliance. C-0910 (Rev. ment Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.623 This CoP applies to all locations of the CAH, all campuses, all satellites, all provider - based activities, and all inpatient and outpatient locations. The CAH'S departments or services responsible for the CAH'S building and equipment maintenance (both facility equipment and patient care equipment) must be incorporated into the CAH'S QA program and be in compliance with the QA The CAH is constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure access to and safety of patients, and provides adequate space for the provision of servi ces. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.623(a) The CAH's physical facilities must be constructed, designed and maintained such that patients are always accessible and the safety of patients is assured. The CAH's construction must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law, as determ ined by the authorities having jurisdiction to enforce such law. The CAH's physical plant must provide sufficient space to support those services the CAH provides on- site. There must also be adequate space to support all additional services the CAH offe rs. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.623(a) Verify through observation that the physical facilities are large enough for the scope of services the CAH is required to provide on- site, as well as any additional services it offers on -site or at a provider -based, off -site location. The adequacy of the space depends on both the nature of the services provided and the number of patients to whom the CAH typically provides those services. Verify through observation that the CAH's building(s) is/are maintained in a manne r to ensure the safety and well being of patients (e.g., condition of ceilings, walls, and floors, presence of patient hazards, etc.). Verify through observation that the design of the CAH assures that staff can reach patients readily. C-0914 The CAH has housekeeping and preventive maintenance programs to ensure that -- (1) All essential mechanical, electrical, and patient -care equipment is maintained in safe operating condition; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.623(b)(1) In order to ensure all essential mechanical, electrical and patient -care equipment is maintained in safe operating condition, the CAH must identify the essential equipment required to meet its patients' needs for both day -to-day operations and in a likely emergency/disaster situation, such as mass casualty events resulting from natural disasters, mass trauma, disease outbreaks, internal disasters, etc. In addition, the CAH must make adequate provisions to ensure the availability and reliability of equipment needed for its operations and services. Equipment includes both facility equipment, which supports the physical environment of the CAH (e.g., elevators, generators, air handlers, medical gas systems, air compressors and vacuum systems, electrical system s, etc.) and medical equipment, which are devices intended to be used for diagnostic, therapeutic or monitoring care provided to a patient by the CAH (e.g., IV infusion equipment, ventilators, laboratory equipment, surgical devices, etc.). All equipment must be inspected and tested for performance and safety before initial use and after major repairs or upgrades. Equipment to be used for the first time should be inspected and tested for performance and safety in accordance with manufacturer recommendation s, unless a sufficient amount of maintenance history has been acquired, either based on its contractor's records or available publicly from nationally recognized sources, to determine whether the alteration of initial inspection and testing activities and frequencies would be safe. All equipment must be inspected, tested, and maintained to ensure their safety, availability and reliability. Equipment maintenance activities may be conducted using CAH personnel, contracted services, or through a combination of CAH personnel and contracted services. Individual(s) responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and management of equipment maintenance programs and activities must be qualified. The CAH maintains records of CAH personnel qualifications and is able to demonstrate how it assures all personnel, including contracted personnel, are qualified. All equipment maintenance policies, procedures and programs, as well as specific equipment maintenance inventories, activities and schedules fall under the purview of the CAH's clinical maintenance personnel, safety department personnel or other personnel who have been assigned responsibility for equipment maintenance by CAH leadership. CAHs comply with this regulation when they follow the manufacturer -recommended maintenance activities and schedule. CAHs may choose to perform maintenance more frequently than the manufacturer recommends, but must use the manufacturer - recommended maintenance activities in such cases. When equipment is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, the CAH must maintain documentation of those recommendations and the CAH's associated maintenance activity for the affected equipment. Alternate Equipment Management (AEM) Program A CAH may, under cert ain conditions, use equipment maintenance activities and frequencies that differ from those recommended by the manufacturer. CAHs that choose to employ alternate maintenance activities and/or schedules must develop, implement, and maintain a documented AE M program to minimize risks to patients and others in the CAH associated with the use of facility or medical equipment. The AEM program must be based on generally accepted standards of practice for facility or medical equipment maintenance. An example of guidelines for a medical equipment medical equipment maintenance program may be found in the American National Standards Institute/ Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation document: ANSI/AAMI EQ 56:1999/ (R) 2013, Recommended Practice for a Medical Equipment Management Program. Likewise, an example of guidelines for physical plant equipment may be found in the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) 2009 document: Maintenance Management for Health Care Facilities. There may be similar documents issued by other nationally recognized organizations which CAHs might choose to reference. Decision to Place Equipment in an AEM Program The determination of whether it is safe to perform facility or medical equipment maintenance without following the equipment manufacturer recommendations must be made by qualified personnel, regardless of whether they are CAH employees or contractors. CAH s must be able to verify that qualified personnel, employees or contractors, are making the decisions to place equipment in the AEM program, performing the risk -based assessments, establishing the alternate equipment maintenance requirements, managing the AEM program, and performing the maintenance in accordance with the AEM policies and procedures. In the case of medical equipment, a clinical or biomedical technician or engineer would be considered qualified. Highly specialized or complex equipment may require specialized knowledge or training in order for personnel to be considered qualified to make a decision to place such equipment in an AEM program. In the case of facility equipment, a Healthcare Facility Management professional (e.g., facility man ager, director of facilities, vice president of facilities) would be considered qualified. The CAH must maintain records of the qualifications of CAH personnel who make decisions on placing equipment in an AEM program, and must be able to demonstrate how they assure contracted personnel making such decisions are qualified. In determining whether or not to include equipment in an AEM program, and which maintenance strategies to use in developing maintenance activities and frequencies for particular equipme nt, the CAH must take into account the typical health and safety risks associated with the equipment's use. Note that the risk may vary for the same type of equipment, depending on the patient care setting within the CAH where it is used. A CAH is expect ed to identify any equipment in its AEM program which is critical equipment, i.e., biomedical or physical plant equipment for which there is a risk of serious injury or death to a patient or staff person should the equipment fail. Surveyors must focus the ir review of a CAH's AEM program on critical equipment in that program and the CAH's documentation of the factors and evidence it considered in developing an AEM strategy for that equipment. Factors for a CAH to consider when evaluating the risks associat ed with a particular type of equipment include, but are not limited to: How the equipment is used and the likely consequences of equipment failure or malfunction: would failure or malfunction of the equipment CAH -wide or in a particular setting be likely to cause harm to a patient or a staff person? How serious is the harm likely to be? For example, a slightly miscalibrated scale in an adult internal medicine outpatient clinic might not present significant risk of harm. However, a miscalibrated scale in a neonatal intensive care unit could have very serious consequences for patient care. How widespread is the harm likely to be? For example, are many patients exposed to the equipment, resulting in harm due to failure impacting more patients or staff? I f harm would be widespread, even if the harm to each affected individual is not serious, this would be a cause for concern. Information, if available, on the manufacturer's equipment maintenance recommendations, including the rationale for the manufacture r's recommendations; Maintenance requirements of the equipment: Are they simple or complex? Are the manufacturer's instructions and procedures available in the CAH, and if so can the CAH explain how and why it is modifying the manufacturer's instructio ns? If the manufacturer's instructions are not available in the CAH, how does the CAH assess whether the AEM uses appropriate maintenance strategies? How readily can the CAH validate the effectiveness of AEM methods for particular equipment? For example, can the CAH explain how it ensures there is no reduction in the quality of the performance of biomedical equipment subjected to alternate maintenance methods? The timely availability of alternate devices or backup systems in the event of equipment failure or malfunction; and Incident history of identical or very similar equipment - is there documented evidence, based on the experience of the CAH (or its third party contractor), or on evidence publicly reported by credible sources outside the CAH, which: Provides the number, frequency and nature of previous failures and service requests? Indicates use of an AEM strategy does not result in degraded performance of the equipment? Generally multiple factors must be considered, since different types of equipm ent present different combinations of severity of potential harm and likelihood of failure. The CAH is expected to be able to demonstrate to a surveyor the factors it considered in its risk assessment for equipment placed in its AEM program. Equipment not Eligible for Placement in the AEM Program: Some equipment may not be eligible for placement in the AEM program, for one or more of the following reasons: Other Federal law (for example, regulations promulgated by another Federal agency) or State law may require that facility or medical equipment maintenance, inspection and testing be performed strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, or may establish other, more stringent maintenance requirements. In these instances, the CAH must comply with these other Federal or State requirements, but State Surveyors conducting Federal surveys assess compliance only with the CAH Conditions of Parti cipation (CoPs). Other CoPs require adherence to manufacturer's recommendations and/or set specific standards which preclude their inclusion in an AEM program. For example: The National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code (LSC) requirements inc orporated by reference at 42 CFR 485.623(d) have provisions that are pertinent to equipment maintenance, and compliance with these requirements are assessed on Federal surveys. Further, \u00a7485.623(d)(7)(v) requires CAHs to adhere to the manufacturer's maint enance guidelines for alcohol -based hand -rub dispensers. Compliance with these requirements is assessed on Federal surveys. Imaging/radiologic equipment, whether used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, must be maintained per manufacturer's recommen dations. The equipment is a medical laser device. It should be noted that for medical lasers the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers to provide a schedule of maintenance and adequate instructions for service adjustments and service procedures to purchasers and, at cost, to any other parties requesting them. New equipment for which sufficient maintenance history, either based on the CAH's own or its contractor's records, or available publicly from nationally recognized sources, is not available to support a risk- based determination must not be immediately included in the AEM program. New equipment must be maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations until a sufficient amount of maintenance history has been acquired to de termine whether the alteration of maintenance activities or frequencies would be safe. If a CAH later transitions the equipment to a risk- based maintenance regimen different than the manufacturers' recommendations, the CAH must maintain evidence that it h as first evaluated the maintenance track record, risks, and tested the alternate regimen. Alternative Maintenance Frequencies or Activities Maintenance strategies are various methodologies used for determining the most efficient and effective maintenance activities and frequencies. Manufacturers' recommendations may be based on one or more such strategies. A CAH may also use one or more maintenance strategies for its AEM program in order to determine the appropriate maintenance, inspection, and testing a ctivities and frequencies, based upon the nature of the equipment and the level of risk it presents to patient or staff health and safety. The risk to patient health and safety that is considered in developing alternative maintenance strategies must be ex plained and documented in the AEM program. In developing AEM maintenance strategies, CAHs may rely upon information from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to: manufacturer recommendations and other materials, nationally recognized expert associations, and/or the CAH's (or its third party contractor's) own experience. Maintenance strategies may be applied to groups or to individual pieces of equipment. The CAH is expected to adhere strictly to the AEM activities or strategies it has devel oped. Background Information on Types of Maintenance Strategies Preventive Maintenance (Time- based Maintenance) - a maintenance strategy where maintenance activities are performed at scheduled time intervals to minimize equipment degradation and reduce instances where there is a loss of performance. Most preventive maintenance is \"interval -based maintenance\" perfo rmed at fixed time intervals (e.g., annual or semi- annual), but may also be \"metered maintenance\" performed according to metered usage of the equipment (e.g., hours of operation). In either case, the primary focus of preventive maintenance is reliability , not optimization of cost -effectiveness. Maintenance is performed systematically, regardless of whether or not it is needed at the time. Example: Replacing a battery every year, after a set number of uses or after running for a set number of hours, regardless. Predictive Maintenance (Condition -based Maintenance) - a maintenance strategy that involves periodic or continuous equipment condition monitoring to detect the onset of equipment degradation. This information is used to predict future maintenance requirements and to schedule maintenance at a time just before equipment experiences a loss of performance. Example: Replacing a battery one year after the manufacturer's recommended replacement interval, based on historical monitoring that has determine d the battery capacity does not tend to fall below the required performance threshold before this extended time. Reactive Maintenance (Corrective, Breakdown or Run -to-Failure Maintenance) - a maintenance strategy based upon a \"run it until it breaks\" phil osophy, where maintenance or replacement is performed only after equipment fails or experiences a problem. This strategy may be acceptable for equipment that is disposable or low cost, and presents little or no risk to health and safety if it fails. Exam ple: Replacing a battery after equipment failure when the equipment has little negative health and safety consequences associated with a failure and there is a replacement readily available in supply. Reliability -Centered Maintenance - a maintenance strat egy that not only considers equipment condition, but also considers other factors unique to individual pieces of equipment, such as equipment function, consequences of equipment failure, and the operational environment. Maintenance is performed to optimiz e reliability and cost effectiveness. Example: Replacing a battery in an ambulance defibrillator more frequently than the same model used at a nursing station, since the one in the ambulance is used more frequently and is charged by an unstable power supply. Maintenance Tools Tools (e.g., hand tools, test equipment, software, etc.) necessary for performing equipment maintenance must be available and maintained to ensure that measurements are reliable. Tools used for maintenance are not required to be those specifically recommended by the manufacturer, but tools utilized must be capable of providing results equivalent to those required by the equipment manufacturer. AEM Program Documentation For each type of equipment subject to the AEM program, there must be documentation indicating: The pertinent types and level of risks to patient or staff health and safety; Alternate maintenance activities, and the maintenance strategy and any other rationale used to determine those activities; the differences fr om the manufacturer's recommended maintenance activities are made explicit, unless the CAH is unable to obtain the manufacturer's maintenance recommendations, due to the age of the equipment or the manufacturer's restricting the availability of its recomme ndations; Alternate maintenance frequencies to be used, if any, and the maintenance strategy and any other rationale used to determine those frequencies. For equipment identified as presenting a very low risk to patient or staff safety, it could be acceptable to not set a particular frequency but instead indicate a less specific approach, for example, an interval range, such as \"every 12 - 24 months.\" It could also be acceptable to employ periodic \"departmental sweeps\" for such very low risk equipment , where equipment functioning is sampled and operators are polled about its functionality. The date when AEM program maintenance activities were performed and, if applicable, further actions required/taken; and Documentation of any equipment failures (not including failures due to operator error), including whether there was resulting harm to an individual. ( NOTE : equipment failure that is due to operator error and which results in an adverse event or near miss must be documented in accordance with the QAPI CoP, as part of the CAH's required tracking of patient safety -related incidents. However, there is no requirement to include operator failures in equipment maintenance documentation.) When the CAH has multiple identical equipment items, the docume ntation may be generic to that type of equipment, except that documentation of maintenance activities performed must be specific to each item of equipment. Evaluating Safety and Effectiveness of the AEM Program The CAH must have policies and procedures w hich address the effectiveness of its AEM program. In evaluating the effectiveness of the AEM program, the CAH is expected to address factors including, but not limited to: How equipment is evaluated to ensure there is no degradation of performance, particularly for equipment where such degradation may not be readily apparent to staff using the equipment, e.g., miscalibration. How incidents of equipment malfunction are investigated, including: whether or not the malfunction could have been prevented, and what steps will be taken to prevent future malfunctions; and how a determination is made whether or not the malfunction resulted from the use of an AEM strategy; The process for the removal from service of equipment determined to be unsafe or no longer suitable for its intended application; and The use of performance data to determine if modifications in the AEM program procedures are required. Equipment Inventory All CAH facility and medical equipment essential to the operation of the CAH, regardless of whether it is leased or owned, and regardless of whether it is maintained according to manufacturer recommendations or is in an AEM program, is expected to be listed in an inventory which includes a record of maintenance activities. For low cost/l ow risk essential equipment, such as housekeeping cleaning equipment, it is acceptable for the inventory to indicate under one item the number of such pieces of equipment in the CAH, e.g., \"15 vacuum cleaners for cleaning patient rooms and common areas.\" If the CAH is using an AEM program, the equipment managed through that program must be readily separately identifiable as subject to AEM. Critical equipment, whether in an AEM program or not, must also be readily identified as such. To facilitate effective management, a well -designed equipment inventory contains the following information for all equipment included. However, CAHs have the flexibility to demonstrate how alternative means they use are effective in enabling them to manag e their equipment. A unique identification number; The equipment manufacturer; The equipment model number; The equipment serial number; A description of the equipment; The location of the equipment (for equipment generally kept in a fixed locat ion); The identity of the department considered to \"own\" the equipment; Identification of the service provider; The acceptance date; and Any additional information the CAH believes may be useful for proper management of the equipment. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.623(b)(1) Interview personnel in charge of equipment maintenance: Determine if the CAH has identified equipment that is essential for both regular operations and in an emergency situation. Determine if the CAH has made adequate provision s to ensure the availability of those and equipment when needed. Concerning facility and medical equipment: Interview equipment users when surveying the various units/departments of the CAH to determine if equipment failures are occurring and causing problems for patient health or safety. Determine if there is a complete inventory of equipment required to meet patient needs, regardless of ownership. Is critical equipment readily identified? If the CAH employs an AEM program, is equipment in this program readily identified? Determine if the CAH has documentation of the qualifications (e.g., training certificates, certifications, degrees, etc.) of CAH personnel responsible for the AEM program (if one is being used by the CAH) as well as for those performing maintenance. Determine if the CAH is able to demonstrate how it assures contractors use qualified personnel. If the CAH is following the manufacturer -recommended equipment maintenance activities and frequencies : In addition to reviewing maint enance records on equipment observed while inspecting various CAH locations for multiple compliance assessment purposes, select a sample of equipment from the CAH's equipment inventory to determine whether the CAH is following the manufacturer's recommenda tions. Critical equipment which poses a higher risk to patient safety if it were to fail, such as ventilators, defibrillators, robotic surgery devices, etc. should make up the sample majority. For the sample selected, determine if: The CAH has availabl e manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., manufacturer's operation and maintenance manual, standards, studies, guidance, recall information, service records, etc.); Maintenance is being performed in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations If a CAH is using an AEM for some equipment : Does the CAH's inventory include equipment which is not eligible for AEM, for example, any diagnostic imaging or therapeutic radiologic equipment? Determine if the CAH's development of alternate maintenance activities and frequencies for equipment in the AEM program as well as AEM activities are being performed by qualified personnel. Verify the CAH has documented maintenance activities and frequencies for all equipment included in the AEM program; Verify the CAH is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the AEM program. If there is equipment on the inventory the CAH has identified as having such a very low level of risk that it has determined it can use a broad interval range or departmental \"sweeps,\" ask the CA H for the evidence used to make this determination. Does it seem reasonable? Select a sample of equipment in the AEM program. The majority of the sample must include critical equipment which poses a higher risk to patient safety if it were to fail, such as ventilators, defibrillators, robotic surgery devices, etc. For the sample selected: Ask the responsible personnel to explain how the decision was made to place the equipment in an AEM program. Does the methodology used consider risk factors and make use of available evidence? Ask the responsible personnel to describe the methodology for applying maintenance strategies and determining alternative maintenance activities or frequencies for the sampled equipment. Can they readily provide an explanation and point to sources of information they relied upon? Determine if maintenance is being performed in accordance with the maintenance activities and frequencies defined in the AEM program. Verify the CAH is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the AEM maintenance activities for this equipment and taking corrective actions when needed.

(2) [Reserved] Body or Responsible Individual The CAH has a governing body or an individual that assumes full le gal responsibility for determining, implementing and monitoring policies governing the CAH'S total operation and for ensuring that those policies are administered so as to provide quality health care in a safe environment. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.627(a) The CAH must have only one governing body (or responsible individual) and this governing body (or responsible individual) is responsible for the conduct of the CAH as an institution. In the absence of an organized governing body, there must be writte n documentation that identifies the individual or individuals that are responsible for the conduct of the CAH operations. The governing body (or responsible individual) must determine, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are el igible candidates for appointment to the medical staff. It is the responsibility of the governing body (or responsible individual) to appoint, with the advice of the medical staff, the individual practitioners to the medical staff. After considering medical staff recommendations, and in accordance with established CAH medical staff criteria and State and Federal laws and regulations, the governing body (or responsible individual) decides whether or not to appoint new medical staff members or to continue current members of the medical staff. The governing body (or responsible individual) must ensure that the medical staff has bylaws that comply with State and Federal law and the requirements of the CAH CoP. The governing body (or responsible individua l) decides whether or not to approve medical staff bylaws submitted by the medical staff. The medical staff bylaws and any revisions must be approved by the governing body (or responsible individual) before they are considered effective. The governing body (or responsible individual) must ensure that the medical staff is accountable to the governing body (or responsible individual) for the quality of care provided to patients. The governing body (or responsible individual) is responsible for the conduct of the CAH and this conduct would include the quality of care provided to patients. All CAH patients must be under the care of a member of the medical staff or under the care of a practitioner who is under the supervision of a member of the medical staff. All patient care is provided by or in accordance with the orders of a practitioner granted privileges to provide or order that care and is in accordance with State law. Criteria for selection of both new medical staff members and selection of current me dical staff members for continued membership must be based on: Individual character; Individual competence; Individual training; Individual experience; and Individual judgment Survey Procedures \u00a7485.627(a) Verify that the CAH has an organized governing body or has written documentation that identifies the individual that is responsible for the conduct of the CAH operations. Review documentation and verify that the governing body (or responsible individual) has determined and stated the categor ies of practitioners that are eligible candidates for appointment to the medical staff. Have the facility's operating policies been updated to fully reflect its responsibilities as a CAH (e.g., PA responsibilities, provision of required CAH direct services)? What evidence (e.g., minutes of board meetings) demonstrates that the governing body or the individual who assumes responsibility for CAH operation is involved in the day -to-day operation of the CAH and is fully responsible for its operations? Evaluate records of medical staff appointments to substantiate the governing body's (or responsible individual's) involvement in appointments of medical staff members. Confirm that the governing body (or responsible individual) appoints all members to the medical staff in accordance with established policies based on the individual practitioner's scope of clinical expertise and in accordance with Federal and State law. Verify that the medical staff operates under current bylaws that are in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations. Verify that the medical staff operates under current bylaws, rules and policies that have been approved by the governing body (or responsible individual). Verify that any revisions or modifications in the medical staff bylaws, rules, and policies, have been approved by the medical staff and the governing body (or responsible individual). For example, look at the bylaws and check for date of last review and initials by the person(s) responsible. Verify that the governing body (or responsible individual) is periodically apprised of the medical staff evaluation of patient care services provided in the CAH, at every patient care location of the CAH. Verify that any individual providing patient care services is a me mber of the medical staff or is accountable to a member of the medial staff qualified to evaluate the quality of services provided, and in turn, is responsible to the governing body (or responsible individual) for the quality of services provided. Verify that there are written criteria for staff appointments to the medical staff. Verify that selection of medical staff for membership, both new and renewal, is based upon an individual practitioner's compliance with the medical staff's membership criteria. Verify that at a minimum, criteria for selection to the medical staff are individual character, competence, training, experience, and judgment.

C-0970 (1) The CAH has a professional health care staff that includes one or more doctors of medicine or osteopathy, and may include one or more physician ass istants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(a)(1) A CAH may operate with a MD/DO on staff as well as with any combination of mid - level practitioners. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(a)(1) Review listings or organizational charts showing the names of all staff MD/DOs, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants on the CAH staff. Review work schedules showing normal CAH hours of operation and coverage by members of the CAH staff. C-0972 (Rev. ancillary personnel are supervised by the professional staff. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(a)(2) Use organizational charts and staff interviews to deter mine how the CAH ensures that the professional staff supervises all ancillary personnel. C-0974 (Rev. staff is sufficient to provide the services essential to the operation of the CAH. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(a)(3) How does the CAH ensure that staff coverage is sufficient to provide essential services at the facility (e.g., emergency services, direct services, and nursing services)? Review staffing schedules and daily census records. C-0976 doctor of medicine or osteopathy, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant is available to furnish patient care services at all times the CAH operates. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(a)(4) Section 485.635(b)(1) requires CAHs to provide \"those diagnostic and therapeutic services and supplies that are commonly furnished in \"a physician's office\" such as low intensity outpatient services. In order to demonstrate compliance, a CAH must demonstrate that a practitioner is physically present and prepared to treat patients at the CAH when patients present at the CAH outpatient clinic during announced hours of outpatient clinic operation. This requirement does not mean the CAH must have a practitioner physically present in the facility 24 hours per day, nor does it require their presence 24 hours per day when the CAH has inpatients, including swing -bed pati ents. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(a)(4) If the CAH does not have regular announced hours of operation, ask the individual who is principally responsible for the operation of the CAH, when is the CAH is open to the public to provide outpatient services. What kinds of arrangements have been made by the CAH to ensure that a practitioner is available on site at all times the CAH operates to furnish patient care services? C-0978 registered nurse, clinical nurse specialist, or licensed practical nurse is on duty whenever the CAH has one or more inpatients. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(a)(5) Review nursing staff schedules to ensure that a registered nurse, clinical nurse specialist or licensed practical nurse is on duty whenever the CAH has one or more inpatients. C-0980 of medicine or osteopathy-- (i) Provides medical direction for the CAH'S health care activities and consultation for, and medical supervision of, the health care staff; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(i) A CAH must have a MD/DO on its staff. That individual must perform all of the medical oversight functions. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(i) What evidence demonstrates that an MD/DO provides medical direction for the CAH'S health care activities and is available for consultation and supervision of the CAH health care staff?

How does the CAH ensure that an MD/DO periodically reviews these policies? conjunction with the physician assistant and/or nurse practitioner members, periodically reviews the CAH'S patient records, provides medical orders, and provides medical care services to the patients of the CAH; and Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(iii) How does the CAH ensure that an MD/DO periodically reviews CAH patient records in conjunction with staff mid- level practitioners and provides medical care to CAH patients? What evidence demonstrates that there is a periodic review of patient records by the CAH MD/DO(s)? C-0986 medicine or osteopathy- ] (iv) Periodically reviews and signs the records of all inpatients cared for by nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants. (v) Periodically reviews and signs a sample of outpatient records of patients cared for by nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, or physician assistants only to the extent required under State law where State law requires record reviews or co -signatures, or both, by a collaborating physician. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(iv) & (v) All inpatient records for patients whose treatment is/was managed by a nonphysician practitioner in the CAH, i.e., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants, must be reviewed periodic ally by a CAH MD/DO who must sign the records after the review has been completed. The MD/DO review is expected to cover all applicable inpatient records open at the time of the review, as well as all applicable inpatient records closed since the last review. In the case of inpatients whose care is/was managed by an MD/DO, as evidenced by an admission order, progress notes, and/or medical orders, etc., but who also receive services from a non -physician practitioner, a subsequent MD/DO review of the inpatient record is not required. In States where State law requires a collaborating physician to review medical records, co-sign medical records, or both for outpatients whose care is managed by a non- physician practitioner, i.e., a nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, a certified nurse midwife, or a physician assistant, a CAH MD/DO must review and sign a sample of outpatient records. The outpatient medical record sample reviewed must be representative of all non -physician practitioners provi ding care to patients of the CAH. The CAH determines by policy the size of the sample reviewed and signed; however, CMS recommends, but does not require, a sample size of 25% of the records of all outpatient encounters managed by a non -physician practitio ner since the prior MD/DO review. If State law requires MD/DO review or signature of a larger percentage of the outpatient records, the CAH must comply with State law. In States where no physician record review or physician co -signature is required for patients managed by a non -physician practitioner, an MD/DO is not required to review or sign outpatient records of such patients. Neither the regulation nor the preamble to the final rule adopting this regulation (79 Fed. Reg. 27105, May 12, 2014) specify a particular timeframe to satisfy the requirement for \"periodic\" review, but the CAH must specify a maximum interval between inpatient record reviews in its policies and procedures. The CAH is expected to take into account the volume and types of service s it offers in developing its policy. For example, a CAH that has only four certified beds and one MD/DO on staff and which does not always have an inpatient in house would likely establish a different requirement for inpatient record review than a CAH wi th 25 certified beds, multiple MDs/DOs on staff and a high inpatient occupancy rate. Further, there is no regulatory requirement for the review of records to be performed on site and in person. Thus, if the CAH has electronic medical records that can be accessed and digitally signed remotely by the MD or DO, this method of review is acceptable. Therefore, CAHs with and without the capability for electronic record review and signature might also develop different policies for the maximum interval between reviews. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(iv) & (v) Select a sample of inpatient and outpatient records, including both open and closed records. For inpatient records of patients whose care is/was managed by a non -physician practitioner, verify that: An MD/DO has reviewed and signed all records that were open at the time of the review, and all inpatient records that were closed since the MD/DO's last review; and That reviews take place within the timeframe specified by the CAH's policy. If State law requires a physician to review or co -sign (or both) any outpatient records of patients whose care is/was managed by non -physician practitioner, determine whether an MD or DO has reviewed and/or co -signed a representative sample of these records within the timeframe specified in the CAH's policies. Ask the CAH how many outpatient encounters are managed by non- physician practitioners, what sample size its policy requires to have an MD/DO review, and what timeframe its policy specifies for reviews. Ask the CAH to explain how it ensures the sample is representative of the various non-physician practitioners as well as of the various types of outpatient services they provide. Ask the CAH to describe the method it uses to make sure that reviews are performed in a timely manner on a sample that complies with the CAH's policy. Review selected records from the CAH's outpatient sample to verify that there is evidence of an MD or DO review and/or signature. C-0988 (Rev. doctor of medicine or osteopathy is present for sufficient periods of time to provide medical direction, consultation, and supervision for the services provided in the CAH, and is available through direct radio or telephone communication or electronic communication for consultation, assistance with medical emergencies, or patient referral. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(b)(2) An MD/DO must be present in the CAH f or sufficient periods of time to provide overall medical direction, consultation and supervision of the healthcare services the CAH furnishes. Being \"present\" in the CAH means being physically on- site in the CAH. The regulation does not specify a minimum amount of time an MD/DO must spend on- site that applies to all CAHs. Instead, CAHs have the flexibility to develop policies appropriate for their circumstances. With the development of technology such as telemedicine, a CAH may use a variety of ways and timeframes for MDs/DOs to provide the necessary medical direction and oversight. For CAHs that offer a range of more complex services, have more than one MD/DO on staff, and have busy emergency departments and/or extensive outpatient services, an on- site visit by an MD/DO only once every week or every two weeks, for example, would be grossly inadequate. On the other hand, a bi -weekly on -site visit could be unduly burdensome as well as unnecessary for a small CAH in a remote rural area that offers very li mited services and has a low patient volume. CAHs are expected to have adequate staffing to provide the services they have chosen to furnish, including staffing or supervision by MDs/DOs as applicable. CMS expects each CAH to evaluate its services and ad just its MD/DO on -site schedule accordingly, as an appropriate MD/DO schedule must reflect the volume and nature of services offered. Note that \u00a7485.618(d) also establishes a maximum timeframe for an MD, DO, PA, NP, or clinical nurse specialist to be on -call and available to be on -site to provide emergency care, and that \u00a7489.20(r)(2) requires the CAH to maintain an on- call list of MDs/DOs who are available to be on -site as part of the CAH's Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act obligations. The CAH m ust consider all pertinent requirements when developing its policies for MD/DO presence on site. In addition to requiring an MD or DO to be on- site for sufficient periods of time, consistent with the requirement at \u00a7485.618(e), the CAH must also ensure an MD/DO is available through direct radio, telephone or other form of electronic communication, such as video conferencing, for consultation, assistance in handling patient medical emergencies and referral of patients to other healthcare facilities. An MD/ DO providing telemedicine services to the CAH may be used to fulfill the requirement for availability via telecommunications. Further, consistent with the requirements for CAH provision of emergency services at \u00a7485.618(d), unless a, PA, NP, or clinical nurse specialist with training in emergency care is immediately available via one of these telecommunication methods and available on site within the timeframe specified at \u00a7485.618(d)(1), an MD or DO must fulfill these requirements. Survey Procedures \u00a7485 .631(b)(2) Does the CAH have policies and procedures that address the minimum amount of time and frequency of MD or DO presence on- site at the CAH? Can the CAH demonstrate how its policy reflects the volume and type of services the CAH provides such that there is sufficient MD/DO presence on -site to support the services provided? Is there documentation showing that an MD or DO is on- site for the frequency and duration specified in the CAH's policies? Can the CAH demonstrate that an MD or DO is always available by telecommunications contact for consultation, assistance and/or patient referral? C-0990 Nurse Practitioner, and Clinical Nurse Special ist Responsibilities C-0991 (Rev. physician assistant, the nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist members of the CAH'S staff -- (i) Participate in the development, execution and periodic review of the written policies governing the services the CAH furnishes; and Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(c)(1)(i) Interview any mid -level professional staff to ascertain their level of involvement in CAH policy development, execution, and periodic review. Does the CAH ensure that policies are updated to remain consistent with State standards of practice requirements for mid -level practitioners? with a doctor of medicine or osteopathy in a periodic review of the patients' health records. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(c)(1)(ii) How does the CAH ensure that mid- level practitioners at the CAH participate with an MD/DO in the review of their patients' health physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist performs the fol lowing functions to the extent they are not being performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy: (i) Provides services in accordance with the CAH'S policies. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(c)(2)(i) Review policies and procedures. Interview mid -level practitioners to gauge their knowledge and application of CAH policies. C-0997 (Rev. for, or refers patients to, needed services that cannot be furnished at the CAH, and assures that adequate patient health records are maintained and transferred as required when patients are referred. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(c)(2)(ii) Verify that there are policies and procedures for transferring patients to other facilities. C-0998 (Rev. a patient is admitted to the CAH by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist, a doctor of medicin e or osteopathy on the staff of the CAH is notified of the admission. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.631(c)(3) The CAH regulations do permit licensed mid- level practitioners, as allowed by the State, to admit patients to a CAH. However, CMS regulations do require that Medicare and Medicaid patients be under the care of an MD/DO if admitted by a mid -level practitioner and the patient has any medical or psychiatric problem that is present on admission or develops during hospitalization that is outside the sc ope of practice of the admitting practitioner. Evidence of being under the care of an MD/DO must be in the patient's medical record. If a CAH allows a mid -level practitioner to admit and care for patients, as allowed by State law, the governing body (or r esponsible individual) and medical staff would have to establish policies and bylaws to ensure patient safety. As applicable, the patient's medical record must demonstrate MD/DO responsibility/care. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.631(c)(3) Verify that admitting privileges are limited to those categories of practitioners as allowed by State law. Verify that patients are admitted only by those practitioners who are currently licensed and have been granted admitting privileges by the governing body (or responsible individual) in accordance with State laws and medical staff bylaws. Verify that an MD/DO is responsible for and is monitoring the care of each Medicare or Medicaid patient for all medical problems during the hospitalization. If mid -level practitioners a dmit patients, verify that every Medicare/Medicaid patient is being monitored by an MD/DO who is responsible for any medical problem outside the scope of practice of the admitting practitioners. C-0999 (Rev. review of clinical privileges and performance. The CAH requires that \u2014 (1) The quality and appropriateness of the diagnosis and treatment furnished by nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialist, and physician assistants at the CAH are evaluated by a member of the CAH staff who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy or by another doctor of medicine or osteopathy under contract with the CAH. (2) The quality and appropriateness of the diagnosis and treatment furnished by doctors of medicine or osteopathy at the CAH are evaluated by \u2014 (i) One hospital that is a member of the network, when applicable; (ii) One Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) or equi valent entity; (iii) One other appropriate and qualified entity identified in the State rural health care plan; (iv) In the case of distant -site physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services to the CAH's patient under an agreement between the CAH and a distant -site hospital, the distant -site hospital; or (v) In the case of distant -site physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services to the CAH's patients under a written agreement between the CAH and a distant -site telemedicin e entity, one of the entities listed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. (3) The CAH staff consider the findings of the evaluation and make the necessary changes as specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

C-1004 (Rev. of Services Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635 This condition establishes requirements related to patient care policies, required CAH services, and CAH services provided through agreements or arrangements. Assessment of the manner and degree of noncompliance with any one of the following standards in this condition is required in order to determine whether there is noncompl iance with this condition. Policies (1) The CAH's health care services are furnished in accordance with appropriate written policies that are consistent with applicable State law. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(1) The CAH must have written policies governing the health care services the CAH furnishes and these policies must be consistent with applicable State law. As discussed i n relation to the requirements at \u00a7485.608, CMS does not interpret or enforce local law; that is the responsibility of State or local government. If surveyors identify practices related to delivery of health care services that they believe are not consist ent with State law, they should refer the matter to the appropriate State authorities. The regulation requires the CAH to furnish its health care services in accordance with its written policies. In other words, the CAH must not only have written policie s, but must actually adhere to them in delivering services. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(1) Verify that the CAH has written policies covering the health care services that are furnished in the CAH. Observe staff delivering health care services to patients. Is the actual provision of services consistent with the CAH's written policies? policies are developed with the advice of members of the CAH 's professional healthcare staff, including one or more doctors of medicine or osteopathy and one or more physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists, if they are on staff under the provisions of \u00a7485.631(a)(1). \u00a7485.635(a)(4) These policies are reviewed at least biennially by the group of professional personnel required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and reviewed as necessary by the CAH. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(2) & (4) The CAH's written policies governing patient care services must be developed with the advice of members of the CAH's professional healthcare staff. This advisory group must include: At least one MD or DO; and One or more physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists, at least one of these non-physician practitioners if these professionals are included in the CAH's healthcare staff, as permitted at \u00a7485.631(a)(1). A CAH with no non-physician practitioners on staff is not required to obtain the services of an outside non- physician practitioner to serve on the advisory group. The advisory group not only makes recommendations for new CAH patient care policies, but is also expected to review the existing patient care policies at least every 2 years and, if it concludes that changes are needed, recommend those changes. Policies must be reviewed and, as applicable, revised more frequently when required, for example, in response to a change in Federal or State regulations to which the CAH is subject. The CAH must maintain documentation that provides evidence that the advisory group has conducted its reviews and made recommendations concerning patient care policies. Although a CAH's patient care policies are developed and periodically reviewed with the advice of members of the CAH's professional healthcare staff, the final decision on the content of the written policies is made by the CAH's governing body or individual responsible for the CAH, consistent with the requirement at \u00a7485.627(a). If recommendations of the advisory group are rejected, the governing body must include in the record of its adoption of the final written policies its rationale for adopting a different policy than that which was recommended. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(2) & (4) Review any meeting minutes for the group of healthcare professionals that advises the CAH's governing body or responsible individual on patient care policies to determine if the group's com position meets the regulatory requirements. Interview all staff listed as part of the policy development advisory group to determine if they had the opportunity to express opinions and make recommendations to the group, for the group's consideration as a group recommendation. Can the CAH provide documentation that the advisory group developed written recommendations on the CAH's patient care policies for consideration by the CAH's governing body/responsible individual? Is there evidence that the group reviewed the CAH's existing policies at least every 2 years and indicated whether or not it recommended any changes? C-1010 include the following: (i) A description of the services the CAH furnishes, including those furnished through agreement or arrangement. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(i) The CAH's written patient care policies must describe the types of health care services that are available at the CAH, including whether those services are furnished by CAH staff or through agreements or arrangements. The types of health services described must include services provided both on- site and off -site. Healthcare services provided through agreement or under arrangement include those provided through formal contracts, informal agreements, or lease arrangements. Services furnished under arrangem ent or by agreement may include both healthcare services provided on- site at the CAH by a contractor, as well as healthcare services provided to the CAH's patients outside the CAH. For example, the CAH may contract with a laboratory to provide certain laboratory services on -site, and others at an off -site laboratory; or it may contract with an imaging center for provision of certain advanced radiologic diagnostic services, such as MRI, to CAH inpatients who are temporarily moved to the center for the test and then returned to the CAH. The descriptions of the services provided may be brief but informative, for example, statements like \"taking complete medical histories, providing complete physical examinations, laboratory tests including\" (with a list of te sts provided), radiologic tests and their interpretation, surgery (with a list of the types of surgery available) would satisfy this requirement. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(i) Verify that the CAH's healthcare policies identify and describe all healthcare services offered by the CAH, including services provided under arrangement or by agreement. C-1012 (Rev. the following:] (ii) Policies and procedures for emergency medical services. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(ii) The CAH's written patient care policies must include its policies and procedures for providing emergency services, addressing all of the requirements at 42 CFR 485.618. See the interpretive guidelines for \u00a7485.618. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(ii) Verify that written policies and procedures detail how the CAH plans to comply with the requirements of 42 CFR 485.618. Do the written policies and procedures address the following: How the CAH provides 24 hour emergency care to its patients? What equipment, supplies, medications, blood and blood products are maintained onsite and which are readily available for treating emergency cases by agreement at other facilities? What types of personnel are available to provide emergency services and what are their required onsite response times? Do they address how the CAH coordinates with local emergency response systems? C-1014 the following:] (iii) Guidelines for the medical management of health problems that include the conditions requiring medical consultation and/or patient referral, the maintenance of health care records, and procedures for the periodic review and evaluation o f the services furnished by the CAH. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iii) The written policies for the CAH's healthcare services must include guidelines, such as general instructions and protocols, for the medical management of patients' health problems. The guidelines may include directly or reference protocols that are documented elsewhere for the treatment of medical conditions that are commonly presented in the CAH. Because nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assist ants may play a large role in patient care at a CAH, the CAH's policies must address the circumstances under which consultation with an MD or DO should occur and which situations require them to consult with or refer to an MD/DO for advice on how to treat a patient. The CAH's policies must also address the circumstances under which patient referral outside the CAH should occur. The policies must also address maintenance of medical records, consistent with the requirements at \u00a7485.638. See interpretive guidelines for \u00a7485.638. The policies must also address the CAH's procedures for periodical review and evaluation of its services, consistent with the requirements of \u00a7485.641. See interpretive guidelines for \u00a7485.641. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iii) Verify that the CAH's written patient care policies: Address the circumstances under which consultation with other CAH professional healthcare staff, or referral outside the CAH should occur; Address maintenance of medical records, in a manner consistent with the requirements at \u00a7485.638; and Address periodic evaluation of the CAH's healthcare services, in a manner consistent with the requirements at \u00a7485.641. C-1016 following:] (iv) Rules for the storage, handling, dispensation, and administration of drugs and biologicals. These rules must provide that there is a drug storage area that is administered in accordance with accepted professional principles, that current and accurate records are kept of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs, and that outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable dr ugs are not available for patient use. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iv) The CAH must ensure that drugs and biologicals are managed in a manner that is safe and appropriate, and that its pharmacy system provides all drugs and biologicals prescri bed by the CAH's practitioners in a timely manner for administration to its patients. The CAH's written patient care policies must include rules governing pharmacy services within the CAH. The CAH's rules may be in the form of pharmacy services policies and procedures. These CAH rules must address storage, handling, dispensing, and administration of drugs and biologicals within the CAH. The rules must be in accordance with accepted professional principles of pharmacy and medication administration practi ces. Accepted professional principles include compliance with applicable Federal and State law and adherence to standards or guidelines for pharmaceutical services and medication administration issued by nationally recognized professional organizations, including, but not limited to: U.S. Pharmacopeia (www.usp.org) , the American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (http://www.ashp.org/), the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (http://www.ismp.org/default.asp), the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention ( www.nccmerp.org ); the Institute for Healthcare Improvement ( http://www.ihi.org/ihi ); or the Infusion Nurses Society (http://www.ins1.org ). The CAH's rules must address the following: Responsibility for pharmacy services The CAH must identify the qualifications for and designate an individual who has overall responsibility for the CAH's pharmacy services, including development of the rules governing pharmacy services. The CAH and the responsible individual must ensure adh erence to State law requirements governing who may perform pharmacy services as well as requirements for supervision of pharmacy staff. The CAH and responsible individual are also responsible for assuring that pharmacy practices adhere to accepted profess ional principles. The CAH is expected to be able to identify the sources of accepted professional pharmacy practices that it relies upon in developing the CAH's pharmacy rules, policies and procedures. Storage of drugs and biologicals, including the location of storage areas, medication carts, and dispensing machines Consistent with accepted professional principles, CAHs must demonstrate appropriate storage and preparation of medications under proper conditions of sanitation, temperature, light, moistur e, ventilation, segregation, and security. Proper environmental conditions Where the manufacturer's FDA -approved package insert specifies environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, exposure to light, etc., for storage of drugs, the CAH is expected to follow the labeled conditions . CAHs must exercise caution in dispensing or using any drug or biological that is not labeled to indicate proper storage conditions or that may have been stored under inadequate conditions. Security The CAH must have policies and procedures that are consistent with State and Federal law to address who is authorized access to the pharmacy or drug storage area. Drugs and biologicals must be stored in a secure manner to prevent unmonitored access by unauthorized individuals. Drugs and biologicals must not be stored in areas that are readily accessible to unauthorized persons. For example, if medications are kept in a private office, or other area where patients and visitors are not allowed without the supervision or presence of a health care professional (for example, ambulatory infusion), they are generally considered secure. Areas restricted to authorized personnel only would generally be considered \"secure areas.\" CAHs are permitted flexibility in the storage of non- controlled drugs and biologicals when delivering care to patients, and in the safeguarding of drugs and biologicals to prevent tampering or diversion. An area in which staff are actively providing care to patients or preparing to receiv e patients, i.e., setting up for procedures before the arrival of a patient, would generally be considered a secure area. When a patient care area is not staffed, both controlled and non- controlled substances are expected to be locked. Medication carts, anesthesia carts, epidural carts and other non- automated medication carts containing drugs or biologicals (hereafter, all referred to as \"carts\") must be secured when not in use. A CAH's policies and procedures are expected to address the security and monitoring of carts, locked or unlocked, containing drugs and biologicals in all patient care areas to ensure their safe storage and to ensure patient safety. If a cart containing drugs or biologicals is in use and unlocked, someone with authorized access to the drugs and biologicals in the cart must be close by and directly monitoring the cart. That person could be a nurse, a physician, or other individual who in accordance with State and Federal law and CAH policy is authorized access to the drugs and bi ologicals in the cart. That individual must monitor the cart and be aware of other people's activities near the cart. He/she is responsible for the security of the drugs and biologicals in the cart. Handling drugs and biologicals \"Handling\" includes reconstituting or mixing medications in accordance with directions contained in approved labeling provided by the drug's manufacturer. \"Handling\" also includes compounding or admixing of sterile intravenous preparations or of other drugs, either on- or off -site, using either CAH staff or a contracted pharmacy service. CAHs use many medications that need to be reconstituted, mixed or compounded. Whether furnishing the services via CAH staff or a contractor, the CAH is responsible for proper handling of dr ugs and biologicals. Except in emergencies or when not feasible (for example, when the product's stability is short), only the pharmacy performs reconstituting, mixing, admixing or compounding. Compounding All compounding of medications used or dispensed by the CAH must be performed consistent with accepted professional principles applicable to both sterile and non- sterile compounding . Compounded medications, whether non- sterile or sterile, may be subject to physical and chemical contamination a nd unintended variations in strength. Microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins are particularly hazardous with respect to compounded medications that are intended to be sterile. A CAH pharmacy must be administered in accordance with accepted prof essional principles, and therefore must be able to demonstrate how it assures that all sterile and non- sterile compounded preparations dispensed and/or administered to the CAH's patients are being compounded consistent with accepted professional standards to ensure safety. The CAH must be able to provide evidence that the CAH's standard operating procedures for compounding, if performed in- house, and for quality oversight of compounding, regardless of source, are consistent with accepted professional princ iples. Compounding may take place in the CAH's pharmacy on- site and/or the CAH may obtain some or all of its compounded medications from external sources. Regardless of the source, if accepted standards for safe compounding are not met, compounded medications may contain less or more than the intended dose and/or may be chemically or microbiologically contaminated, with potentially serious adverse consequences for the patients who receive them. Use of Outside Compounders (also known as Outsourcing Facilit ies) The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), signed into law on November 27, 2013, contains provisions relating to the oversight of compounding of human drugs. The DQSA created a new section 503B in the FDCA under which a compounder may elect to become an \"outsourcing facility.\" The law defines an \"outsourcing facility\" as a facility at one geographic location or address that is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; has elected to register as an outsourcing facility; and complies with all of the requirements of section 503B of the FDCA. Facilities that elect to register as outsourcing facilities: Must comply with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. The CGMP requirements make su re that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. The FDA's publishes the most current versions of its draft and final regulations and guidance related to compounding on its website: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmacy Compounding/default.htm ; Will be inspected by FDA according to a risk -based schedule; and Must meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and providing FDA with certain information about the products they compound. In a J anuary 2014 letter to purchasers of compounded medications (available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCo mpounding/ucm380596.htm ), the Commissioner of the FDA encouraged the use of registered outsourcing facilities and noted that,\"[a]s a purchaser o f compounded drugs, you can play an important role in improving the quality of compounded drugs by requiring compounding pharmacies that supply drugs to your facility to register as outsourcing facilities. Once they register, you and the patients you serve can be assured that FDA will inspect these facilities on a risk -based schedule, hold them to CGMP requirements, monitor the adverse event reports they are required to submit to the agency, and require appropriate labeling.\" FDA has posted a list of Registered Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Facilities, including the end date of the last FDA inspection related to compounding, whether investigators observed any significant objectionable conditions, and whether other FDA acti ons were taken based on the last inspection, at: http://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/pharmacycomp ounding/ucm378645.htm Note that these registered outsourcing facilities are also popularly referred to as \"503B pharmacies.\" Use of Compounding Pharmacies If a CAH obtains compounded medications from a compounding pharmacy rather than a manufacturer or a registered outsourcing facility, then the CAH must demonstrate how it assures that the compounded medications it receives under this arrangement have been prepared i n accordance with accepted professional principles for compounded drugs as well as applicable State or Federal laws or regulations. For example, does the contract with the vendor include provisions: Requiring the vendor to meet the requirements of Section 503A of the FDCA concerning pharmacy compounding of human drug products? Note that these types of compounding pharmacies are also popularly referred to as \"503A pharmacies\" and generally are subject to oversight only by their State pharmacy board. For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited ASHP Research and Education FoundationTM \"Outsourcing Sterile Products Preparation: Contractor Assessment Tool\" The ASHP Research and Education FoundationTM offers a tool that CAHs may find useful for assessing vendors that provide compounded sterile preparations. http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/PracticeTools/SterileProduc tsTool.aspx and click on \"Start using Sterile Products Outsourcing Tool now.\" Dispensing drugs and biologicals CAHs must comply with applicable State law that governs the qualifications, certification, or licensure of staff who dispense drugs and biologicals. T here must be sufficient numbers and types of personnel to pr ovide accurate and timely medication delivery. Medications must be dispensed in a timely manner. The CAH must have a system that ensures medication orders get to the pharmacy promptly and medications are available for administration to patients when needed, including when the pharmacy is not open. Met hods to accomplish this when the pharmacy is not open could include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: automated dispensing units outside the pharmacy, night cabinets, contracted services after hours via telepharmacy contracting, on- call pharmacists, etc. Concerns, issues or questions pharmacy staff have about any medication order must be clarified with the prescribing practitioner or another practitioner responsible for the care of the patient before dispensing. A CAH may utilize a unit dose system, individual prescription, floor stock system or a combination of these systems, properly stored. Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs) for medications are a secure option for medication storage since they ensure locked storage of medications and allow for electronic tracking of controlled substances and other drugs. These cabinets often have embedded security features, such as login and password or biometric identification so that they can only by accessed by authorized personnel. Policies and procedures must address who can access medications during after - hours. For Information Only - Not Required/Not to be Cited In addition to the required pharmacy policies and procedures above, a well - designed pharmacy service would have policies and procedures addressing medication safety practices such as: Implementation of a do- not-use abbreviation list. CAHs may wish to refer to lists offered by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (http://www.ismp.org/tools/errorproneabbreviations.pdf ) or The Joint Commission (http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/Do_Not_Use_List.pdf) ; A high alert drug list. CAHs may wish to refer to a high alert drug list offered by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (https://www.ismp.org/tools/institutionalhighAlert.asp); For specific high alert medications designated by the CAH, having two health professionals independently check doses CAHs may wish to refer to guidance from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concerning appropriate use of double -checks (http://www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/showarticle.aspx?id=51 ); Quantities of medications are dispensed which minimize diversion and potential adverse events while meeting the needs of the patient; Whenever possible, medications are dispensed in the most ready to administer form available from the manufacturer or, if feasible, in unit doses that have been repackaged by the pharmacy; The CAH consistently uses the same dose packaging system, or, if a different system is used, provides education about the use of the dose packaging system; and The American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (ASHP) rec ommends that floor stocks of medications should be limited to medications for emergency use and routinely used safe items (e.g. mouthwash, antiseptic solutions). When utilizing automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs), the Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommendations include the following: (See: http://www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/articles/20090212.asp and http://www.ismp.org/Tools/guidelines/ADC_Guidelines_Final.pdf ) Security processes are established to ensure adeq uate control of medications outside of the pharmacy and to reduce the potential for medication diversion from ADCs. Utilize biometric user identification or, at a minimum, change user passwords quarterly. Link the ADC to the pharmacy computer to allow for patient \"profiling,\" so that a pharmacist can review each medication order and screen it for safety before the drug is dispensed or accessed by the nurse or other healthcare professional. Limiting the availability of overrides to the ADC system. Limiting access to drugs based on the patients profile so to decrease medication selection errors. Store each medication and strength in an individual lidded ADC compartment that opens only when the specific medication is selected. Document the destruction of medication waste at the time of removal of the medication whenever possible. Record this waste via the ADC, and match the administered dose with ordered dose. Have a process to routinely review/reconcile the documented medication waste. Return all medica tions to a common secure one -way return bin that is maintained by pharmacy, not to an individual pocket or bin within the ADC . Administration of drugs and biologicals to patients CAHs must comply with applicable State law that governs the qualifications, certification, or licensure of staff who administer drugs and biologicals and must adhere to accepted standards of practice for medication administration. See the guidance for \u00a7485.635(d)(3) concerning medication administration by CAH nurs ing staff. Record keeping for the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs The U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifies drugs that are controlled in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act into five \"schedules\", ranging from Schedule I substances, which have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, to Schedule V substances, which have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consi st primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. The CAH is required to accurately track the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs used in the CAH. Components of a record system for scheduled drugs would include: Locked storage of scheduled drugs when not in use. Accountability procedures to ensure control of the distribution, use, and disposition of all scheduled drugs. The record system tracks movement of all scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the hospital to the point of departure either through administration to the patient, destruction or return to the manufacturer. This system provides documentation on scheduled drugs in a readily retrievable manner to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs. Any discrepancies in count are reconciled promptly. The CAH is capable of readily identifying loss or diversion of all controlled substances in such a manner as to minimize the time frame between the actual loss or dive rsion to the time of detection and determination of the extent of loss or diversion. Ensuring that outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable drugs are not used for patient care The CAH must have a pharmacy labeling, inspection, and inventory management system that ensures that outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable drugs and biologicals are not available for patient use. This would include drugs that are the subject of a manufacturer's recall. A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is set by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the FDA approval process. It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration date if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer's approved labeling. A drug or biological is also outdated after its \" beyond- use date \" (BUD), which may be reached before the expiration date, but never later. The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and potential for deterioration and microbial growth that may occur during or after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process if it is a compounded medication. The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such information is available. The CAH must maintain and implement policies and procedures that provide clear and consistent direction to pharmacy staff regarding how to determine a BUD when complete BUD information is not available from the manufacturer For individual drug containers: e ach floor stock drug container is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, and expiration date. Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD . In addition, w here applicable, e ach patient's individual drug container is expected to be labeled with the patient's full name and quantity of the drug dispensed. If the unit dose system is utilized, each single unit dose package is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date . and/or, if applicable, a BUD. For Information Only Certain provisions of the FDCA address the labeling of prescription drugs generally (e.g., section 503(b)(2) of the FDCA). Section 503B of the FDCA includes labeling requirements for drugs compounded by registered outsourcing facilities (see section 503B(a)(10)). Although CAHs are expected to comply with these requirements, surveyors conducting a Medicare survey do not assess compliance with other Federal law. Assessing Adverse Drug Reactions & Medication Administration Errors In accordance with \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(v) the CAH must have a system for staff to report adverse drug reactions and medication administration errors. The pharmacy services is expected to assess all such reports to determine if problems or errors in pharmacy services caused or contributed to the adverse reaction or medication administration error. Where such problems or errors are identified, the CAH is expected to take effective action to address the identified issues. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iv) Has the CAH adopted pharmacy rules that were developed with the advice of the CAH's professional healthcare staff? Has the CAH identified the qualifications of and designated an individual who is responsible for developing and implementing the rules for t he CAH's pharmacy services, consistent as applicable with State and Federal law? Review the qualifications of the responsible individual to verify that they satisfy the CAH's written criteria. Ask CAH practitioners, nursing and pharmacy staff whether the CAH's pharmacy service dispenses prescribed drugs and biologicals in a timely manner. If there is evidence in medical records reviewed of late administration of prescribed medications, probe to determine whether delays are due to pharmacy dispensing delays. Ask the individual responsible for CAH pharmacy services what sources of accepted professional principles of pharmacy practice the CAH relies upon in developing and implementing its CAH pharmacy rules, policies and procedures. Is the source(s) a nationally recognized source? Are drugs and biologicals stored in a secure manner? o Are drugs stored in areas not accessible to unauthorized personnel? o When drugs or biologicals are kept in a patient care area during hours when patient care is not provided, are they locked up? Conduct a spot check of drug use and other inventory records to ensure that drugs are properly accounted for. Determine if the CAH has a system that tracks movement of all scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the CAH to the point of departure either through administration to the patient, destruction of the drug, or return to the manufacturer. o Does this system provide documentation on scheduled drugs in a readily retrievable manner to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs? o Review records of scheduled drugs over a recent time period. Is there evidence of discrepancies, and if so, of efforts by the CAH to reconcile and address the discrepancies? Interview the person responsible for pharmacy services as well as other CAH staff to determine their understanding of the CAH's controlled drug policies. Verify that only a pharmacist or other personnel authorized in accordance with State and Federal law compound, label and dispense drugs or biologicals, regardless of whether the services are provided by CAH staff or under arrangement. o Interview pharmacy and CAH staff to determine how drugs and biologicals are dispensed; o Observe on -site dispensing operations; o Review records to see if dr ugs and biologicals are removed from the pharmacy by unauthorized personnel; Do the CAH's pharmacy rules address ADCs, if used within the CAH? Are the ADCs being used in the manner prescribed by the CAH's rules? Can the CAH demonstrate that compounded medications used and/or dispensed by the hospital are being compounded consistent with standard operating procedures and quality assurance practices ? Does the individual responsible for the pharmacy service, including compounding policies, practices and quality assurance within the CAH, and selecting and overseeing any external sources of compounded medications, have the expertise to conduct effective quality oversight ? Can the individual responsible for the pharmacy services explain the risk level(s) of the CSPs being produced in- house and/or obtained from external sources? If any CSPs are produced in the CAH: Ask for one or more examples of situations in which a BUD had to be determined for a compounded sterile medication (CSP) based on the policy. Interview pharmacy personnel assigned to carry out this function within the CAH and/or to assess how this is done by external source(s) of CSPs. Is there evidence that the BUDs are determined consistent with the CAH's rules, policies and procedures? Interview staff who engage in sterile and non- sterile compounding. Are they knowledgeable about applicable levels of aseptic practices? Ask the individual responsible for pharmacy services to demonstrate how the following are accomplished to ensure that sterile compounding practices are consistent with standards for the risk level(s) of CSPs being produced for/dispensed to CAH patients: Verification of compounding accuracy and sterility. Environmental quality and controls, including environmental sampli ng; testing and monitoring; and cleaning and disinfection; Personnel training and competency assessment, including but not limited to accuracy/precision in identifying and measuring ingredients; cleansing and garbing; aseptic manipulation skills; environm ental quality and disinfection; appropriate work practices within and adjacent to the direct compounding area; verification/calibration of equipment; sterilization; and post-production quality checks. Review the CAH's procedures for maintaining the quality of CSPs during storage, transport and dispensing. Are CSPs packaged in a manner to protect package integrity and sterility? How are CSP -specific requirements with respect to motion, light exposure, temperature and potentially hazardous contents addressed? How does the CAH ensure that such information is effectively conveyed to non- pharmacy health care personnel and/or to patients/caregivers, if applicable? Review the pharmacy rules, policies and pr ocedures for determining BUDs (for medications compounded in- house as well as from external sources). Can the CAH demonstrate that the policies and procedures are consistent with or more stringent than the applicable nationally accepted standards? Can it demonstrate that the pharmacy personnel assigned to determining BUDs when a manufacturer's instructions are not available have the expertise and technical support needed to properly conduct the assessments needed to make such determinations in a manner consistent with standards and hospital policies? Ask for one or more examples of situations in which a BUD had to be determined for a compounded sterile medication (CSP) based on the policy. Interview pharmacy personnel assigned to carry out this function within the CAH and/or to assess how this is done by external source(s) of CSPs. Is there evidence that the BUDs are determined consistent with the CAH's rules, policies and procedures? If the CAH obtains compounded products from an external sour ce that is not an FDA registered outsourcing facility, can it demonstrate that it systematically evaluates and monitors whether these sources adhere to accepted professional principles for safe compounding? Does the CAH have a process for following up on adverse drug reactions and errors in medication administration reported by CAH staff in accordance with \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(v)? If any have been reported, did the CAH thoroughly assess and analyze them? Has the CAH taken effective preventive action to addres s identified issues? Spot-check the labels of individual drug containers to verify that they contain the following minimal information: o Each patient's individual drug container bears his/her full name and strength and quantity of the drug dispensed. Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date, and, when applicable, a BUD. o Each floor stock container bears the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number of equivalent, expiration date, and, when applicable, a BUD. If the unit dose system is utilized, verify that each single unit dose package bears name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date, and, when applicable, a BUD. Spot-check patient -specific and floor stock medications to identify expired, mislabeled or unusable medications, including medications that are past their BUD. C-1018 (Rev. the following:] (v) Procedures for reporting adverse drug reactions and errors in the administration of drugs. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(v) CAH staff must report all drug (medication) administration errors and all adverse drug reactions. This required reporting includes two distinct steps in the reporting of drug (medication) administration errors and adverse drug reactions. The first and highest priority reporting relates to the care of the patient, at time of occurrence. The second reporti ng step is related to the CAH -wide Quality Assurance review as addressed in \u00a7485.641(b). Medication administration error: The National Coordinating Council Medication Error Reporting and Prevention definition of a medication error is \"Any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedure s, and systems, including prescribing; order communication; product monitoring; and use.\" A medication administration error is one that occurs in the phase of the medication process where the drug actually enters the patient by one of various possible routes, e.g ., orally, intravenously, etc. Adverse drug reaction: The American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (ASHP) defines an adverse drug reacti on (ADR) as \"Any unexpected, unintended, undesired, or excessive response to a drug that: 1. Requires discontinuing the drug (therapeutic or diagnostic) 2. Requires changing the drug therapy 3. Requires modifying the dose (except for minor dosage adjustments) 4. Necessitates admission to a hospital 5. Prolongs stay in a health care facility 6. Necessitates supportive treatment 7. Significantly complicates diagnosis 8. Negatively affects prognosis, or 9. Results in temporary or permanent harm, disability, or death. Consistent with the definition, an allergic reaction (an immunologic hypersensitivity occurring as the result of unusual sensitivity to a drug) and an idiosyncratic reaction (an abnormal susceptibility to a drug that is peculiar to the individual) are also considered ADRs .\" Patient Care In the case of ADRs or medication administration errors that are not caught before they reach the patient, a \"report\" must be made to a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. For example, if a medication actually is administered to a patient when it should not be, or the wrong dose is administered, or the wrong route of administration is used, etc., or a medication that should have been administered to the patient has not been administered in a timely manner, then the medication administration error has reached the patient and must be reported to the responsible practitioner. If, on the other hand the wrong dose of a drug is prepared for a patient, but a nurse catches this and does not give that dose to the patient, then a medication administration error has occurred, but the error has not reached the patient, and thus does not need to be reported to the responsible practitioner. Not every medication administration error that reaches the patient causes harm or has the potential to cause harm; it depends both on the drug and on the patient's condition. In the case of all ADRs and any medication administration error that has harmed or has reached the patient and could potentially cause harm, the report to a practitioner must be made immediately after the staff identify the adverse reaction or (potentially) harmful error, to enable a timely assessment and intervention. The report must be made directly in a manner that confirms a practitioner received the report, for example, via a phone call. If the impact of the medication error that reached a patient is unknown, the error must be reported to a practitioner immediately. Documentation of the error or reaction, including notification to the practitioner, must be in th e patient's medical record. Medication administration errors that have reached the patient but result in no harm and do not have the potential to cause harm can be reported to a practitioner during usual working hours. For example, if an over -the counter analgesic dose is missed during the night shift, it can be reported first thing in the morning as no further intervention would be required by the practitioner. CAHs should provide clinical staff with expected guidance on how to respond to these situations. Quality Assurance/Improvement Reporting: Reduction of medication administration errors and ADRs may be facilitated by effective internal CAH reporting that can be used to assess vulnerabilities in the medication process and implement corrective actio ns to reduce or prevent reoccurrences. To facilitate reporting, the CAH must educate staff on medication administration errors and ADRs including the criteria for those errors and ADRs that are to be reported for quality assurance/improvement purposes, a nd how, to whom and when they should be reported. Reporting for quality assurance/improvement purposes covers all identified medication errors, regardless of whether or not they reach the patient, and those ADRs meeting the criteria specified in the CAH' s policies. For Information Only - Not Required/Not to be Cited To improve staff willingness to report medication errors and ADR incidents, CAHs are encouraged to adopt a non- punitive approach that focuses on system issues rather than individual health care professionals. A non- punitive approach is likely to encourage reporting by those who otherwise may fear retribution or CAH disciplinary action. In addition to internal staff reporting, the CAH is expected to take other steps to identify medication administration errors and ADRs. Reliance solely on staff -generated incident reporting fails to identify the majority of adverse drug events. Proactive identification includes observation of medication passes, concurrent and retrospective review of patient's clinical records, implementation of medication usage evaluations for high -alert drugs, and identification of indicator drugs that, when ordered, automatically generate a drug regimen review for a potential adverse drug event. The CAH must asse ss the effectiveness of its internal reporting system to determine whether or not it is identifying as many medication errors and ADRs that would be expected for the size and scope of services provided by the CAH. In making such assessments the CAH could refer to established benchmarks or studies on error or ADR rates published in peer -reviewed journals. For Information Only - Not Required/Not to be Cited CAHs are encouraged to participate in state- wide and national patient safety organizations for reporting of drug administration errors, ADRs, and drug incompatibilities. National organizations include, but are not limited to, the FDA MedWatch Reporting Pr ogram and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Medication Errors Reporting Program. These organizations, along with other patient safety organizations, collect and analyze data, identify trends, and provide feedback and recommendations to hea lth care organizations to reduce the risk of medication related errors and events. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(v) Assess whether the CAH ensures that medication administration errors and ADRs are reported to practitioners in a timely manner. Are nursing staff familiar with the concepts of medication errors that do and do not reach the patient, as well as ADRs? Ask nursing staff what they would do in the case of a medication administration error that reaches the patient or an adverse drug event. Ask nursing staff if they can provide examples of cases where they needed to report an ADR. Is the report to the practitioner documented in the medical record? Review records of medication errors and ADRs to determine that they are reported immed iately in accordance with written procedures, and that medications administered and/or drug reactions are promptly recorded in the patient's medical record. Can the CAH demonstrate that it has a system for reporting/identifying ADRs and medication administration errors for quality assurance/improvement purposes? Interview CAH staff (nursing, pharmacy and medicine) to ascertain awareness of the CAH's policy on reporting medication administration errors and ADRs for quality improvement purposes 1. Does the CAH have evidence of training staff on reporting expectations? 2. Does the CAH rely only upon internal staff incident reporting or does it use other methods to identify potential/actual medication errors and ADRs, as well? Ask the individual responsibl e for the QA program to demonstrate how the CAH determines if the number of medication administration errors and ADRs reported is consistent with the size and scope of services provided by the CAH. Review QA activities for medication administration error s and ADRs to determine if, upon analyses of the reports, potential corrective actions are identified and implemented, if appropriate. C-1020 (Rev. the following:] (vi) Procedures that ensure that the nutritional needs of inpatients are met in accordance with recognized dietary practices . All patient diets, including therapeutic diets, must be ordered by the practitioner responsible for the care of the patients or by a qualified dietitian or qualified nutrition professional as authorized by the medical staff in accordance with State law governing dietitians and nutrition professionals and that the requirement of \u00a7 483.25(i) of this chapter is met with respect to inpatients receiving post CAH SNF care.

Services (1) General (i) The CAH provides those diagnostic and therapeutic services and supplies that are commonly furnished in a physician's office or at another entry point into the health care delivery system, such as a low intensity hospital outpatient department or emergency department. These CAH services include medical history, physical examination, specimen collection, assessment of health status, a nd treatment for a variety of medical conditions. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(b)(1) (i) This regulation addresses the minimum level of outpatient services (with the exception of emergency services - see \u00a7485.635(b)(4)) which a CAH must provide. Such services must be provided on- site at the CAH, but may be provided either by CAH staff or under an arrangement or contract. At a minimum, the CAH must provide those diagnostic and therapeutic services and supplies which are typically found in an ambul atory healthcare setting where patients first come into contact with the healthcare delivery system. The services required to be provided must, at a minimum, reflect the scope and complexity of services provided in a physician's office or in a hospital outpatient or emergency department that furnishes low intensity (i.e., less complex) services. Such services include, but are not limited to: taking a patient's medical history; conducting a physical examination of the patient; specimen collection, assessment of health status, and treatment for a variety of medical conditions. The extent of the CAH's outpatient services is expected to be sufficient to meet the needs of the patients it services for basic ambulatory care services. Further, the CAH's outpati ent services must be integrated with its inpatient services. For those outpatient services that fall only within the scope of practice of a physician or non-physician practitioner, in order to demonstrate compliance, a CAH physician or non- physician pract itioner must be available to treat patients at the CAH when such outpatient services are provided. This requirement does not mean the CAH must have a practitioner physically present in the CAH 24 hours per day, seven days per week. See the discussion of required emergency services at \u00a7485.618(d) concerning required response times for a physician or non- physician practitioner to come to the CAH to provide medical care. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(b)(1)(i) Does the CAH provide on- site outpatient services that are typical of those provided in a physician office or low intensity hospital outpatient or emergency department, including medical history, physical examination, specimen collection, assessment of health status, and treatment for a variety of medical conditions? Determine that the outpatient services are integrated with the appropriate CAH inpatient services in accordance with the needs of the patient care provided. Verify that the types and number of qualified personnel are appropriate for the scope and complexity of the outpatient services offered. Review personnel files or contracts to verify current licensure, certifications and training of staff consistent with applicable State laws. Verify that equipment, staff and facilities are adequate to provide the outpatient services and are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. C-1026 (Rev. General (ii) The CAH furnishes acute care inpatient services. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(b)(1) (ii) In accordance with \u00a7485.620(b), CAHs are required to have an average annual per acute inpatient length of stay that does not exceed 96 hours. Accordingly, CAHs are expected to provide less complex inpatient services in order to comply with the length of s tay requirement. Furthermore, for each Medicare beneficiary, the CAH is required in accordance with Medicare payment law and regulations to have the practitioner who admits the beneficiary as an inpatient certify that the beneficiary may reasonably be expected to be discharged or transferred to a hospital within 96 hours after admission to the CAH. However, while it may be true that CAHs generally are not expected to handle patients requiring complex, specialized inpatient services, such as those services provided by trauma centers, or cardiac surgery centers, CAHs should be able to handle a range of patient needs requiring inpatient admission. CMS does not believe it is in the best interest of patients for them to routinely be transferred to a more dista nt hospital if instead their care can be provided locally without compromising quality or the length of stay requirements (78 FR 50749). Accordingly, acute inpatient services must be furnished to patients who present to the CAH for treatment so long as the CAH has an available inpatient bed and the treatment required to appropriately care for the patient is within the scope of services offered by the CAH. Given the resources of the CAH, the needs of the community it serves, and the variable nature of a CA H's inpatient census, a CAH may not be actively treating inpatients at all times. CAHs may experience significant seasonal variations in the inpatient occupancy rates as well as variations that are a function of the size of the community in which the CAH is located. A CAH is not required to maintain a minimum average daily census of patients receiving inpatient acute care services or maintain a minimum number of beds that are to be used for inpatient services. However, in determining compliance with this requirement factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following: What is the volume of emergency services the CAH provides on average quarterly and annually? What is the number of certified inpatient beds in the CAH? Are there dedicated observation beds in the CAH? If so, how many compared to the number of inpatient beds? What is the average acute care occupancy rate for the CAH's inpatient beds quarterly and annually? What is the volume of acute inpatient admissions in the CAH quarterly and annually? What is the volume of patients placed in observation status in the CAH quarterly and annually? What is the percentage of emergency department patients admitted to the CAH as an inpatient versus transferred to a hospital quarte rly and annually? What is the range, volume and complexity of outpatient services the CAH provides? While there is no specific formula for determining the number of patients a CAH is expected to admit, surveyors must be alert to disproportionate relationships among the CAH's various services. For example, if a CAH has only 4 certified beds and an average of 3 acute care inpatients per month, but has 18 observation beds that have an annual occupancy rate of 85%, has an ED staffed by physicians 24/7 and s ees 9,000 ED patients/year, offers extensive and complex outpatient services, such as chemotherapy, advanced diagnostic imaging, sleep lab services, and same day surgery, but transfers to another hospital from the ED almost all patients who need inpatient admission, then these inpatient services would not be reasonably proportional to the overall mix and volume of services offered by the CAH. Based on data published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in 2008 approximately 8.3 percent of emergency department (ED) visits in a rural \"hospital\" resulted in an inpatient admission, compared to 16 percent for non- rural hospital ED visits. Also, a higher percentage of rural ED patients were likely to be discharged - 91.7% compared to 84% for non- rural hospitals. The AHRQ rural hospital data included both hospitals and CAHs, with CAHs accounting for 51 percent of rural EDs. 6 Other published AHRQ data indicates that, in 2009, 3 6 Hines, A.L., Fraze, T., and Stocks, C. Emergency Department Visits in Rural and Non- Rural Community Hospitals, 2008. HCUP Statistical Brief #116. June 2011. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. ht tp://www.hcup -us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb116.pdf percent of patients who lived in a rural area were transferred f rom the ED where they presented to a hospital, compared to 1.5 percent of all patients nationally who presented to an ED.7 Given that a CAH may offer fewer services than even the average rural hospital and is expected to achieve a 96 -hour average length of stay or less, there is no expectation that every CAH is expected to admit 8 percent of its ED patients. This benchmark can, however, provide a useful starting point for assessing compliance. Generally, if a CAH admits at least 8 percent of its ED patients annually, it would be considered compliant with the requirement to provide inpatient services and surveyors do not have to investigate further. If a CAH admits less than 8 percent of its ED patients annually, this is not in and of itself evidence of noncompliance. More investigation is needed to assess compliance by determining whether the volume of activity and number of staff the CAH has for its ED, other outpatient, and inpatient services are reasonably related to each other. There can be great variation among CAHs in their volume and types of activities, despite their relative similarity in size, making a \"one size fits all\" formula inappropriate. Researchers in one State with 79 CAHs found that they averaged 3,851 ED visits annually, but that visits for individual CAHs ranged from a low of 389, or a little more than one patient per day, to a high of 14,425, or about 40 patients per day. CAHs in this State averaged 19,705 other types of outpatient visits annually, but again the range was ver y large, from a low of 89 to a high of 86,367 per year. For inpatient admissions the annual average was 836, ranging from a low of 100 to a high of 3,8388. Presentation of the data found in this State is not intended to provide benchmarks for CAHs in other States, but rather to emphasize the tremendous range in the volume of activity among CAHs, even within one State. A couple of extreme but illustrative examples are presented below to indicate the types of factors to be considered when assessing whether the CAH satisfies the requirement to provide inpatient services: Example #1: A CAH has a very low volume of ED visits, such as 2 or fewer patients per day on average, discharges over 90% of its annual ED patients, has a total professional health care s taff that consists of one physician who spends a limited amount of time on -site, and one nurse practitioner who works days five days per week. In this case it would not be unreasonable for the CAH to admit a patient for acute inpatient services only occas ionally and transfer a majority of those ED patients who require inpatient services to a hospital. 7 Kindermann, D, Mutter, R. and Pines, J.M.

Rural -relevant Quality Measures for Critical Access Hospitals. June 27, 20211 PowerPoint presentation to the Minnesota Rural Health Conference. http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/orhpc/conf/2011/presentations/2b.pdf Example #2: A CAH has 50 ED visits per day on average, 4 certified inpatient beds, 2 inpatient admissions per month on average (all elective surgery patients who started as outpatient cases), 10 dedicated observation beds and places about 2 ED patients pe r day in observation; transfers out to a neighboring hospital an average of 15 ED patients per week who require admission, has twenty physicians on staff, is performing an average of three thousand outpatient surgeries per year, provides outpatient chemotherapy, cardiology and advanced diagnostic imaging, and has a total of about 40,000 outpatient visits per year, not counting ED visits. This CAH's services are very skewed toward outpatient services, and the needs of its patient population for inpatient se rvices do not appear to be met by the CAH. The CAH might arguably have the staff to provide a larger volume of inpatient services to many of the ED patients who require admission. The CAH would be expected to demonstrate to the surveyor why it could be r easonable for its inpatient capacity and admissions to be so disproportionately small compared to its outpatient services volume and capabilities, and in view of the needs of its ED patients for inpatient services. The surveyor would also review the medic al records of a sample of ED patients transferred out to see if they required services the CAH's professional healthcare staff is not able to provide. (This case might also raise EMTALA issues related to on -call lists and appropriate transfers. See Appendix V) Example #3: A CAH has 25 ED visits per day, 25 certified beds, 23 of which, on average, are used for swing -bed services and are occupied by nursing home or skilled nursing facility residents. The CAH transfers out to a neighboring hospital an average of eight ED patients per week who require admission, and admits an average of one patient per month for acute inpatient services. The CAH has fifteen physicians on staff, is performing an average of 800 outpatient surgeries per year, provides outpati ent chemotherapy, cardiology and advanced diagnostic imaging, and has a total of about 20,000 outpatient visits per year, not counting ED visits. In this situation the CAH's services are skewed towards outpatient and long-term care services and the needs of its patient population for inpatient services do not appear to be met by the CAH. The CAH would be expected to demonstrate to the surveyor why it could be reasonable for its inpatient acute care capacity and admissions to be so disproportionately smal l compared to its outpatient and long term care services and to the needs of its ED patients for inpatient services. The surveyor would also review the medical records of a sample of ED patients transferred out to see if they required services the CAH's professional healthcare staff is not able to provide. (This case might also raise EMTALA issues related to on -call lists and appropriate transfers. See Appendix V) Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(b)(1)(ii) Verify that the CAH is furnishing acute care inpatient services by reviewing data on the number of patients admitted over the prior year. Determine the percentage of ED visits that result in an admission to the CAH. If fewer than eight percent of ED visits lead to an inpatient admission, review data on transfers of ED patients, overall staffing, the volume and type of outpatient services offered, including observation services, and swing bed services to determine whether there is a reasonably proportionate relationship among the various services the CAH provides. Review a sample of records of the patients the CAH transferred and determine if the transfers were appropriate based on the services available at the CAH. C-1028 (Rev. Services The CAH provides basic laboratory services essential to the immediate diagnosis and treatment of the patient that meet the standards imposed under section 353 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 236a). (See the laboratory requirements specified in part 493 of this chapter.) The services provided include the following: (i) Chemical examination of urine by stick or tablet method or both (including urine ketones). (ii) Hemoglobin or hematocrit. (iii) Blood glucose. (iv) Examination of stool specimens for occult blood. (v) Pregnancy tests. (vi) Primary culturing for transmittal to a certified laboratory. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(b)(2) Laboratory services that must be provided on- site at the CAH's main campus are the tests specified in the regulation, which would be considered the minimum necessary for diagnosis and treatment of a patient: Chemical examination of urine by stick or tablet method or both (including urine ketones); Hemoglobin or hematocrit; Blood glucose; Examination of stool specimens occult blood; Pregnancy tests; and Primary culturing for transmittal to a certified laboratory. These services may be provided by CAH staff or under arrangement or agreement with a labor atory, or through a combination of CAH staff and a laboratory under arrangement. Laboratory services, whether provided directly by the CAH or under an arrangement with a laboratory contractor, must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certificate or waiver for all tests performed and meet the laboratory requirements specified in Part 493 of this chapter. Compliance with Part 493 is not assessed by CAH surveyors evaluating compliance with the CAH conditions of participation, but survey ors are expected to refer potential issues they may identify to the program responsible for CLIA certification. Given that the CAH must provide emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the CAH must determine which laboratory services are to be immediately available to meet the emergency needs of patients and how the services are to be provided. The emergency laboratory services available should reflect the scope and complexity of the CAH's emergency services operations. The provision of labora tory services that exceed the minimum tests specified is optional. The scope and complexity of the CAH's laboratory service must be adequate to support the clinical services the CAH offers to patients. Additional laboratory services may be offered direct ly or through arrangement. The CAH should have a written description of all the laboratory services that it provides, including those delivered on routine and stat basis. The laboratory must have written policies and procedures for the collection, preservation, transportation, receipt, and reporting of tissue specimen results. Patient laboratory results and all other laboratory clinical patient records are considered patient medical records and the CAH must comply with the requirements of the clinical records CoP at \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii). Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(b)(2) Ask the CAH to identify which laboratory services it offers. Are the required lab services provided at the CAH's main campus? Does the CAH have a CLIA certificate or waiver, as applicable, for all laboratory tests performed in CAH facilities? Verify that the CAH has a procedure in place for obtaining tests that are needed but unavailable at the CAH laboratory. If the CAH refers specimens to another laboratory for testing, does the CAH have documentation that the referral laboratory is CLIA certified for the appropriate tests? Has the CAH identified laboratory services that must be available to support the emergency services the CAH provides? Ask the staff who furnish emergency services whether these laboratory services are available whenever they provide emergency services. C-1030 (Rev. services furnished by the CAH are provided by personnel qualified under State law, and do not expose CAH patients or personnel to radiation hazards. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(b)(3) Radiologic services encompass many diff erent modalities used for the purpose of medical imaging. Each type of technology gives different information about the area of the body being studied or treated, related to possible disease, injury, or the effectiveness of medical treatment. All the mo dalities use some form of radiation, such as ionizing radiation (radiography, computed tomography, fluoroscopy), which has enough energy to potentially cause damage to DNA, and other forms of radiation (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) to view the human body in order to diagnose, monitor, or treat medical conditions. Radiological services furnished by the CAH may be provided by CAH staff or under arrangement. The CAH must maintain and have available diagnostic radiological services to support the services the CAH provides to meet the needs of its patients. These services must be available at all times the CAH provides services, including emergency services. The CAH has the flexibility to choose the types and complexity of radiologic services offered. They may offer only a minimal set of services or a more complex range of services (including nuclear medicine). All radiological services provided by the CAH, including diagnostic, therapeutic, and nuclear medicine, must be provided in accordance w ith acceptable standards of practice and must meet professionally approved standards for safety. The scope and complexity of radiological services offered should be specified in writing and approved by the governing body (or responsible individual). Acceptable standards of practice include maintaining compliance with appropriate Federal and State laws, regulations and guidelines governing radiological services, including facility licensure and/or certification requirements, as well as any standards and recommendations promoted by nationally recognized professions such as the American Medical Association, Radiological Society of North America, Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging, American Society of Radiologic Technologists, American College of Cardiology, American College of Neurology, American College of Physicians, American College of Radiology, etc. Qualified Radiologic Personnel There must be written policies that are developed and approved by the governing body or responsible individual and are consistent with State law, that designate which personnel are qualified to use the radiological equipment and administer procedures. When telemedicine is used to provide teleradiology services, radiologists who interpret radiological tests must satisfy the telemedicine privileging requirements \u00a7485.616(c)(3). In addition to radiologists, there are other types of healthcare personnel w ho, depending on State law and the scope and complexity of the CAH's radiologic services, may be involved in the delivery of radiologic services in the CAH, including radiologic technologists and medical physicists. Radiologic technologists perform diagnostic imaging examinations and administer radiation therapy treatments. They are educated in anatomy, patient positioning, examination techniques, equipment protocols, radiation safety, radiation protection and basic patient care. For Information Only - Not Required/Not to be Cited Well -designed radiologic services include a medical physicist, who, in conjunction with the person responsible for radiologic services, performs or supervises the pertinent procedures necessary to assure the safe and effective delivery of radiation to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic result. The responsibilities of the medical physicist include: protection of the patient and others from potentially harmful or excessive radiation; establishment of adequate protocols to ensure accurate patient dosimetry; the measurement and characterization of radiation; the determination of delivered dose; advancement of procedures necessary to ensure image quality; development and direction of quality assurance programs; and assistance to other health care professionals in optimizing the balance between the beneficial and deleterious effects of radiation ( www.aapm.org ). CAHs are encouraged to involve a medical physicist in the calibrati on of the imaging equipment and monitoring of radiation dosage exposures. Safety from Radiation Hazards The CAH must adopt and implement policies and procedures that ensure safety from radiation hazards for patients and personnel. The CAH must implement and ensure compliance with its established safety standards. The policies must address at least the following: Adequate radiation shielding for patients, personnel and facilities, which includes: Shielding built into the CAH's physical plant, as appropriate; Types of personal protective shielding to be used, under what circumstances, for patients, including high risk patients as identified in radiologic services policies and procedures, and CAH personnel; Types of containers to be used for various radioactive materials, if applicable, when stored, in transport, in use, and when disposed; Clear signage identifying hazardous radiation areas; Labeling of all radioactive materials, including waste, with clear identification of all material(s); Transportation of radioactive materials between locations within the CAH; Security of radioactive materials, including determining who may have access to radioactive materials and controlling access to radioactive materials; Periodic testing of equipme nt for radiation hazards; Periodic checking of staff regularly exposed to radiation for the level of radiation exposure, via exposure meters or badge tests ; Storage of radio nuclides and radio pharmaceuticals as well as radioactive waste; and Disposal of radio nuclides, unused radio pharmaceuticals, and radioactive waste. Radiologic Equipment Maintenance The CAH must have policies and procedures in place to ensure that periodic inspections of radiology equipment are conducted, and that problems identified are corrected in a timely manner. The CAH must ensure that equipment is inspected and maintained in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations, as applicable, and the manufacturer's recommendations. The CAH must have a system in pl ace to correct identified problems. The CAH must have evidence of its inspections and corrective actions. Radiology Records The CAH radiology records are to be treated in the same manner as any other part of a medical record. The medical records CoP at \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii) requires that the CAH maintain reports of physical examinations, diagnostic and laboratory test results, and consultative findings. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(b)(3) Interview the person responsible for radiologic services. Ask what radiologic services the CAH offers at its main campus. At off -site locations ask how the CAH ensures patient needs for radiologic se rvices are met, if applicable. Ask how the CAH ensures that radiologic services are provided consistent with acceptable s tandards of practice. Safety: Determine if the radiologic services staff is familiar with the policies and procedures related to safety. Verify that patient shielding (aprons, etc.) are properly maintained and routinely inspected by the CAH. Observe ar eas where radiologic testing is done and check for safety problems. Verify that hazardous materials are clearly labeled. Review records to verify that they are tracked, handled and stored properly in a safe manner with the requisite containers. Review records to verify that periodic tests of radiology personnel by exposure meters or test badges are performed. Equipment maintenance: Review the inspection records to verify that periodic inspections and maintenance are conducted in accordance with the m anufacturer's recommendations. Determine whether any problems identified are properly corrected in a timely manner and the correction is maintained over time. Qualified Personnel: Are studies interpreted only by qualified staff approved to do so by the CAH's governing body or responsible individual? Determine which staff are using various pieces of radiological equipment and/or administering patient procedures. Review their personnel folders to determine if they meet the qualifications for tasks they pe rform, as established in the CAH's policies and consistent with state law. Ask staff to explain the protocol for the procedures/studies they administer. Ask to see the CAH's written protocols and verify that the staff is adhering to them. C-1032 (Rev. In accordance with the requirements of \u00a7485.618, the CAH provides medical services as a first response to common life - threatening injuries and acut e illness. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(b)(4) Emergency services must be provided by the CAH at the CAH campus either by CAH staff or by individuals providing services under arrangement or agreement. The individuals providing the services must have the ability to recognize a patient's need for emergency care at all times. The CAH must provide medically appropriate initial interventions, treatment and stabilization of any patient who requires emergency services. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(b)(4) The survey procedures for \u00a7485.618 apply. Provided Through Agreements or Arrangements (1) The CAH has agreements or arrangements (as appropriate) with one or more providers or suppliers participating under Medicare to furnish other services to its patients, including (5) In the case of distant -site physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services to the CAH's patients under a written agreement between the CAH and a distant -site telemedicine entity, the distant -site telemedicine entity is not required to be a Medicare -participating provider or supplier. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(1)&(c)(5) All agreements for provid ing health care services to the CAH's patients must be with a provider or supplier that participates in the Medicare program, except in the case of an agreement with a distant -site telemedicine entity for the provision of telemedicine services. The agreem ents should describe routine procedures (e.g., for obtaining outside laboratory tests); and there should be evidence in the agreement or arrangement that the governing body (or responsible individual) is responsible for these services provided under agreem ent or arrangement. Individual agreements or arrangements should be revised when the nature and scope of services provided has changed. The governing body (or responsible individual) has the responsibility for ensuring that CAH services are provided acco rding to acceptable standards of practice, irrespective of whether the services are provided directly by CAH employees or indirectly by agreement or arrangement. The governing body must take actions through the CAH'S QA program to: assess the services fu rnished directly by CAH staff and those services provided under agreement or arrangement, identify quality and performance problems, implement appropriate corrective or improvement activities, and to ensure the monitoring and sustainability of those correc tive or improvement activities. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(c)(1)&(c)(5) Determine whether the CAH verifies that every entity providing health care services to the CAH's patients under an agreement participates in Medicare, with the exception of a distant -site telemedicine entity providing telemedicine services under an agreement or has agreements or arrangements (as appropriate) with one or more providers or suppliers participating under Medicare to furnish other services to its patients, including \u2014] (i) Services of doctors of medicine or osteopathy; \u00a7485.635(c)(2) If the agreements or arrangements are not in writing, the CAH is able to present evidence that patients referred by the CAH are being accepted and treated. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(i) & \u00a7485.635(c)(2) In accordance with \u00a7485.631(a)(1), the CAH is required to have at least one doctor of medicine or osteopathy (MD or DO) on its staff who is responsible for the functions described in \u00a7485.631(b). CAHs are free to have additional MDs or DOs on staff, part - or full -time. MDs and DOs who have been credentialed and privileged to provide services on -site at the CAH are part of the CAH's professional healthcare staff, even if they are not at the CAH full -time; they would not be considered to be providing servic es under an arrangement and would not be covered by these regulatory provisions. These regulations also do not apply to MDs and DOs who provide telemedicine services to the CAH's patients, even when they are provided under arrangement. (See \u00a7485.616(c) a nd \u00a7485.635(c)(5) concerning telemedicine requirements.) Under \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(i) & \u00a7485.635(c)(2) , the CAH must have policies and procedures for referring patients it discharges who need additional specialized MD or DO services not available at the CAH. The policies and procedures must at a minimum identify the services for which the CAH has referral arrangements or agreements, as well as the information to be provided to referred patients. MDs and DOs to whom the CAH refers its patients must participate in Medicare. The CAH is not required to have referral arrangements in writing, but if it does not, then it must be able to document that patients it has referred to an outside MD or DO have been offered appointments and treatment. Survey Procedures \u00a74 85.635(c)(1)(i) & \u00a7485.635(c)(2) Verify that the CAH has arrangements with one or more MDs or DOs for referral of discharged CAH patients who need medical services not available at the CAH. Are the referral arrangements in writing? If not, can the CAH document that patients referred to an outside MD or DO have been offered appointments and treatment? Does the CAH have policies and procedures addressing referral of discharged patients? Are the CAH's practitioners and staff who handle the discharge of patients familiar with these policies and procedures? C-1038 has agreements or arrangements (as appropriate) with one or more providers or suppliers participating under Medicare to furnish other services to its patients, including \u2014] (ii) Additional or specialized diagnostic and clinical laboratory services that are not available at the CAH; and \u00a7485.635(c)(2) If the agreements or arrangements are not in writing, the CAH is able to present evidence that patients referred by the CAH are being accepted and treated. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(ii) & \u00a7485.635(c)(2) In accordance with \u00a7485.635(b)(2), the CAH is required to furnish, either directly by the CAH staff, under arrangement or agreement, or through a combination of CAH staff and a laboratory under arrangement basic laboratory services essential to the immediate diagnosis and t reatment of the patient that meet the standards imposed under section 353 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 236a). These services must be provided on- site at the CAH and may be provided either by CAH staff or under an arrangement with a laborato ry. The CAH is also free to provide additional laboratory services on- site, beyond the minimum required services. The provision at \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(ii) does not apply to laboratory services provided on -site. Instead, this provision addresses the requireme nt for the CAH to have an arrangement or agreement, as appropriate, with a laboratory that can provide additional or specialized clinical laboratory services that are not available at the CAH. The arrangement or agreement may provide either for the CAH to draw the specimens to be examined and send them to the outside laboratory. The CAH is not required to have a written agreement or arrangement, but if it does not, it is expected to be able to document that an outside laboratory to which it sends specimens provides the CAH with test results. Laboratories that provide additional diagnostic and clinical laboratory services to a CAH under agreement or arrangement must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certificate or waiver for all tes ts performed and meet the laboratory requirements specified in Part 493 of this chapter. The CAH is expected to have evidence of the outside laboratory to which it refers patients holding a current CLIA certificate or waiver. The CAH must have policies a nd procedures for additional or specialized laboratory services provided under arrangement or agreement which address at least the following: the specific laboratory services provided under arrangement; and the collection, preservation, transportation, rec eipt, and reporting of tissue specimen results. Likewise, although the CAH is expected to provide radiology services in accordance with \u00a7485.635(b)(3) , it is also expected to have an arrangement or agreement, as appropriate, with other providers or suppliers of diagnostic imaging services, including advanced diagnostic imaging services, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, etc. The CAH is not required to have a written agreement or arrangement, but if it does not, it is expected to be able to document that an outside diagnostic imaging facility to which it sends patients provides the CAH with the resulting studies and reports. Patient diagnostic imaging studies and reports, laboratory results and all other laboratory clinical pat ient records must be included in the patient's medical record and meet all requirements at \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii). Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(ii) & \u00a7485.635(c)(2) Verify that the CAH has an agreement or arrangement with an outside laboratory and an outside diagnostic imaging facility for services not provided in the CAH. Ask the CAH how it ensures that the laboratory with which it has an agreement or arrangement holds the necessary CLIA certification. If the agreement or arrangement is not in writing, can the CAH document that it is sending specimens to an outside laboratory and patients to an outside diagnostic imaging facility when needed, and that it is receiving test results? Do policies and procedures address which imaging and lab services are provided under arrangement, as well as, for lab services, collection, preservation, transportation, receipt, and reporting of tissue specimen results? C-1040 has agreements or arrangements (as appropriate) with one or more providers or suppliers participating under Medicare to furnish other services to its patients, including \u2014] (iii) Food and other services to meet inpatients' nutritional needs to the extent these services are not provided directly by the CAH. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(iii) If the CAH does not provide all food and other services required to meet the nutritional needs of the CAH's inpatients using CAH staff, then the CAH must provide these services under an agreement or arrangement. The CAH must assure that dietary services provided under an agreement or arrangement are provided in accordance with the CAH's policies adopted as required by \u00a7485.635( a)(3)(vii). Unless the CAH is a grandfathered co -located CAH (see \u00a7485.610(e)(1)) that has an arrangement with the co- located facility to provide food services to the CAH's inpatients, it is expected that the CAH's vendor provides dietary services on -site at the CAH in order to meet the needs of the CAH's inpatients. Surveyors assess compliance with the requirements of \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(vii) in the same manner, regardless of whether the services are provided by CAH staff or a vendor. In the case of a grandf athered co -located CAH that obtains food services from the co- located facility, surveyors must assess the food service operations in the co- located facility as part of the CAH survey. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(c)(1)(iii) Verify that the CAH has an agreement or arrangement with a vendor to provide dietary services to inpatients if the CAH does not use its own staff to provide these services. C-1042 (Rev. CAH maintains a list of all services furnished under arrangements or agreements. The list describes the nature and scope of the services provided. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(3) The CAH must maintain a list of all patient car e services furnished by the CAH through arrangements or agreements. The list must be updated each time a contracted service is added or removed. For each service the list must include, at a minimum, the following information: The service(s) being offered; The individual(s) or entity providing the service(s); Whether the services are offered on - or off- site; Whether there is any limit on the volume or frequency of the services provided; and When the service(s) are available. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(c)(3) Review the list of contracted services and verify that it contains all required information. Ask the CAH for evidence that the list is updated whenever there are changes. Ask various CAH staff during the course of the survey whether they work directly for the CAH or some other entity; check that services provided by staff employed by outside entities are on the list of contracted services. C-1044 (Rev. person principally responsible for the operation of the CAH under \u00a7485.627(b)(2) of this chapter is also responsible for the following: (i) Services furnished in the CAH whether or not they are furnished under arrangements or agreemen ts. (ii) Ensuring that a contractor of services (including one for shared services and joint ventures) furnishes services that enable the CAH to comply with all applicable conditions of participation and standards for the contracted services. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(c)(4) The person principally responsible for the operation of the CAH, in accordance with \u00a7485.627(b)(2), i.e., the CAH's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is responsible for the operation of all patient care services furnish ed at the CAH. This includes services provided directly by CAH staff and services provided by the CAH under arrangement or agreement. It includes not only care provided directly to patients, but also services related to patient care, such as environmental cleaning, instrument cleaning and sterilization, laundry, pharmacy services, laboratory services, etc. (This requirement for the CEO to be responsible does not relieve the CAH's governing body of its ultimate responsibility for the CAH's total operation in those CAHs where there are both a governing body and a CEO.) The CEO must take actions to assure that all services furnished by the CAH through a contractor comply with the applicable requirements of the CAH's CoPs. When assessing compliance of a ser vice provided by a contractor with the CoPs, deficiencies cited under other CoPs warrant a citation of this requirement, because the CEO has failed to assure that the contractor provides services in a manner that allows the CAH to comply with the CoPs. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(c)(4)(i) Ask the CAH's CEO to demonstrate how he or she provides oversight of all contracted services related to patient care. Ask for specific examples of how the CEO assures that services furnished in the CAH comply with the CoPs (e.g., policies and procedures, by -laws, etc.) that the individual responsible for its operations is responsible for all services provided through arrangements or agreements. C-1046 (Rev. Services Nursing services must meet the needs of patients. (1) A registered nurse must provide (or assign to other personnel) the nursing care of each patient, including patients at a SNF level of care in a swing -bed CAH. The care must be provided in accordance with the patient's needs and the specialized qualifications and competence of the staff available. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(d) & (d)(1) In order to meet the needs of patients, nursing servic es must be a well -organized service of the CAH. The CAH designates an individual who is responsible for nursing services, including development of policies and procedures for nursing services. The designated individual is generally expected to be a regis tered nurse. Various titles may be used for the responsible nurse leader may have (e.g., director of nursing services, nurse executive, chief nursing officer, or nurse manager). The nurse leader is responsible for the overall management and evaluation of nursing care in the CAH, including, but not limited to: Development and maintenance of nursing policies and procedures; Supervision of nursing staff, either directly, or, depending on the size of the CAH, indirectly through other nursing managers; and Ongoing review and analysis of the quality of nursing care. As required at \u00a7485.631(a)(5), t he CAH must have a registered nurse, clinical nurse specialist, or licensed practical nurse on duty whenever the CAH has one or more inpatients (including patients in a swing bed receiving long term care services). The CAH must also ensure that, for outpatient nursing services, appropriate nursing staff are available in accordance with State law and CAH policy. For both inpatient and outpatient services there must be sufficient numbers of supervisory and non- supervisory nursing personnel with the appropriate education, experience, licensure (as applicable), competence and specialized qualifications to respond to the nursing needs of the patient population of each CAH department or nursing unit. Staffing schedules must be reviewed and revised as necessary to meet patient care needs and to make adjustments for nursing staff absenteeism. The CAH must have a procedure for assigning and coordinating the nursing care for every CAH patient. A registered nurse must either provide directly, or assign to other staff, the required nursing care for each CAH patient, including patients receiving swing bed services. The RN making the assignment must conside r the specialized qualifications and competence of the CAH's available nursing staff in order to meet patients' nursing care needs. Nursing care duties may be assigned to appropriate personnel, such as a licensed practical nurse, nursing assistant or nurs e's aide, so long as such assignment is consistent with state law and the individual has the qualifications and competence to perform the assigned tasks. The CAH must ensure that all CAH nursing staff are adequately trained and oriented, aware of CAH nurs ing policies and procedures, supervised, and that their clinical activities are evaluated. If temporary outside agency nurses are employed to address temporary nurse staffing needs, determine how are these nurses oriented and supervised. (NOTE: Regular nursing services may be provided under arrangement instead of using CAH employees, but in this case the CAH is responsible for the ongoing training and supervision of these regular nursing staff.) Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(d)(1) Determine whether an RN has been designated responsible for nursing services at the CAH. Observe the nursing care in progress to determine the adequacy of staffing and to assess the delivery of care. Sources of information to use in the evaluation of the nursing services are: staffing schedules, nursing care plans for inpatients , credentialing and training files (including contracted staff), and QA activities and reports. Interview the registered nurse responsible for nursing services and ask the follow ing-- How are the nursing needs of patients determined? Who makes this determination? How are staff assigned to provide nursing care to patients? How does the CAH ensure that care provided meets the needs of each patient? How are staff trained and oriented? If temporary outside agency nurses are used, how are they oriented and supervised? Review nursing assignments in one or more inpatient units, the emergency department, and one other outpatient department. Did an RN make the assignments? Was the complexity of patient care needs and the competence and specialized qualifications of the nursing staff taken into consideration? Review written staffing schedules; do they adhere to the CAH's policies and procedures for staffing levels and types of nursing personnel? Verify that there is supervision of personnel performance and nursing care for each nursing unit. If there are temporary agency nurses providing services, interview one or more to determine if they are familiar with the nursing policies and procedures of the unit or department where they are working. Review personnel files to determine that nursing staff have required licenses and competencies. C-1048 (Rev. registered nurse or, where permitted by State law, a physician assistant, must supervise and evaluate the nursing care for each patient, including patients at a SNF level of care in a swing -bed CAH. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(d)(2) The nursing care of each patient of the CAH must be supervised by a registered nurse or a physician assistant where permitted by State law. Even where permitted under State law, a CAH is not required to have nursing care supervised by a physician assistant. This is simply an option for the CAH. For inpatients, including patients receiving long term care services in swing beds, evaluation of their nursing care includes evaluating the care for each patient upon admission and, when appropriate, on an ongoin g basis in accordance with accepted standards of nursing practice and CAH policy. Evaluation would include assessing the patient's care needs, patient's health status/conditioning, as well as the patient's response to interventions. Nursing care plans are not developed for outpatients, so the focus of the evaluation would be on adherence to generally acceptable standards of nursing care practice, including requirements at \u00a7485.635(d)(3) for medication administration. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(d)(2) Determine that a registered nurse (or physician assistant where permitted by State law and CAH policy) supervises and evaluates the nursing care for each patient. Interview one or more registered nurses (or physician assistants, if appli cable) who supervise and evaluate the nursing care for CAH patients. C-1049 (Rev. and intravenous medications must be administered by or under the supervision of a registered nurse, a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or, where permitted by State law, a physician assistant, in accordance with written and signed orders, accepted standards of practice, and Federal and State laws. Interpretive Guid elines \u00a7485.635(d)(3) As required at \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iv), t he CAH must have written policies and procedures for the administration of all drugs and biologicals that adhere to accepted standards of practice and Federal and State laws. In accordance with \u00a7485.635(d)(3), all medication administration must be consistent with accepted standards of practice, as well as Federal and State laws. Examples of nationally recognized organizations with expertise in medication administration include, but are not limited to: National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (www.nccmerp.org ); Institute for Healthcare Improvement ( http://www.ihi.org/ihi ); U.S. Pharmacopeia ( www.usp.org ); Institute for Safe Medication Practices, which offers guidelines specifically on timely medication administration, which can be found at: www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/articles/20110113.asp ; Infusion Nurses Society (http://www.ins1.org). In additi on, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes evidenced- based practice guidelines and recommendations on medication preparation and administration practices, designed to reduce the risk of infection associated with these activities. Who May Administer Medications? Drugs and biologicals, including intravenous (IV) medications, must be administered by, or under the supervision of, an MD or DO; an RN, or, where permitted by State law, a PA. Other personnel, such as LPN's, may administer medications when permitted by State law and CAH policy, so long as they are supervised by an MD, DO, RN or, where permitted by State law, a PA. The CAH's written policies must delineate the categories of clinical staff authorized to administer medicatio n at the CAH. Medication Orders Drugs and biologicals, including intravenous (IV) medications, may only be administered in accordance with orders written and signed by a practitioner who is authorized by CAH policy, and in accordance with State law, to w rite orders and who is responsible for the care of the patient as specified under \u00a7485.631(b)(1)(iii). Accepted standards of practice Based on accepted standards of practice for medication administration, the CAH must assure compliance with the following requirements concerning: Minimum content of medication orders; Policies and procedures for verbal and standing orders; Self-administration of medications, if the CAH permits this; Training; Basic Safe Practices; Timing of Medication Administration; Assessment/Monitoring of Patients Receiving Medications; Intravenous (IV) medications; and Documentation Content of the medication order In accordance with accepted standards of practice, the minimum elements that must be present in orders for all drugs and biologicals to ensure safe preparation and administration include: Name of patient; Age and weight of patient, to facilitate dose c alculation when applicable. Policies and procedures must address weight -based dosing for pediatric patients as well as in other circumstances identified in the CAH's policies. ( NOTE: Dose calculations are based on metric weight (kg, or g for newborns). If a CAH permits practitioners to record weight in either pounds or using metric weight, the opportunity for error increases, since some orders would require conversion while others would not. Accordingly, CAHs must specify a uniform approach to be used by prescribing practitioners. For example, a CAH could require all prescribers to use pounds or ounces and have the electronic ordering system or the pharmacy convert to metric); Date and time of the order; Drug name; Exact strength or concentration, when applicable; Dose, frequency, and route; Dose calculation requirements, when applicable; Quantity and/or duration, when applicable; Specific instructions for use, when applicable; and Name of the prescriber. Verbal and Standing Orders Although the regulation requires medication administration be based on a written, signed order, this does not preclude the CAH from using: Verbal orders; or Standing orders. In the case of both verbal and standing orders, a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient must authenticate the order in writing as soon as possible after the fact. The CAH must adopt policies and procedures regarding verbal and standing orders. (NOTE: CAHs that have a distinct part psychi atric and/or rehabilitation unit must follow the hospital CoPs for all services provided in those units, including the hospital requirements for verbal and standing orders.) For verbal orders, CAH policies must, at a minimum, address the following: Descr ibe situations in which verbal orders may be used, as well as limitations or prohibitions on their use; Provide a mechanism to establish the identity and authority of the practitioner issuing a verbal order; List the elements required for inclusion in the verbal order process; Establish protocols for clear and effective communication and verification of verbal orders. CMS expects nationally accepted read -back verification practice to be implemented for every verbal order; Identify the categories of clinical staff who are authorized to receive and act upon a verbal order; and Provide for prompt documentation in the medical record of the receipt of a verbal order. For standing orders, CAH policies must, at a minimum, address the following: The proce ss by which a standing order is developed; approved; monitored; evaluated and updated when needed; For each standing order, which staff may initiate it and under what circumstances; (under no circumstances may a CAH use standing orders in a manner that r equires any staff not authorized to write patient orders to make clinical decisions outside of their scope of practice in order to initiate such orders); and The requirements for subsequent authentication by a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. For Information Only - Not Required/Not to Be Cited Verbal Orders CAHs are encouraged to minimize the use of verbal orders as much as possible and not permit their use merely as a convenience to practitioners. Verbal orders carry a highe r risk of miscommunication and error and thus should only be used when necessary. With the increasing use of Electronic Health Records and Computerized Physician Order Entry systems, the need for verbal orders is expected to decline. Standing Orders There is no standard definition of a \"standing order\" in the healthcare community, but the orders,\" for patient are various ways in which the term \"standing orders\" has been applied. The lack of a standard definition for these terms and their interchangeable and indistinct use by health care facilities professionals may result in confusion CAHs are encouraged to focus on those situations where their use of \"standing orders\" permits treatment that is outside the scope of practice of a non -practitioner, such as a nurse, to be initiated by the non- practitioner without a prior specific order from a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. Such tr eatment is typically initiated when a patient's condition meets certain pre -defined clinical criteria. For example, standing orders may be initiated as part of an emergency response or as part of an evidence -based treatment regimen where it is not practic al for a nurse to obtain either a written, authenticated order or a verbal order from a practitioner prior to the provision of care. Appropriate use of standing orders can contribute to patient safety and quality of care by promoting consistency of care, based on objective evidence . Much of the evidence on the effectiveness of standing orders has been narrowly focused on aspects of their use by Rapid Response Teams addressing inpatient emergencies. However, standing orders may also be appropriate in othe r clinical circumstances, including, but not limited to: Protocols for triaging and initiating required screening examinations and stabilizing treatment for emergency department patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute asthma, myocardial infa rction, stroke, etc. (This does not relieve a CAH of its obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to have qualified medical personnel complete required screening and, when applicable, provide stabilizing treatment in a time ly manner.) Post-operative recovery areas. Timely provision of immunizations, such as certain immunizations for newborns, for which there are clearly established and nationally recognized guidelines. CAHs are encouraged to address at least the following in their standing orders policies and procedures: Review and approval of each standing order by a multi -disciplinary team that includes the following individuals or their designees: the MD/DO providing medical direction and the individuals designated re sponsible for nursing and pharmacy services. The CAH should be able to document that the standing order is consistent with nationally recognized and evidence -based guidelines. This does not mean that there must be a template standing order available in national guidelines which the CAH copies, but rather that the content of each standing order the CAH uses is consistent with nationally recognized, evidence -based guidelines for providing care. Clear, specific criteria in the protocol for the order for aut horized non- practitioners to initiate the execution of the order, for example, the specific clinical situations, patient conditions, or diagnoses by which initiation of the order would be justified. Instructions that the clinical staff receive on the con ditions and criteria for using standing orders as well as any individual staff responsibilities associated with the initiation and execution of standing orders. At least annual review of each standing order as well as a process for the identification and timely completion of any requisite updates, corrections, modifications, or revisions based on changes in nationally recognized, evidence -based guidelines. Among other things, reviews should consider: Whether there have been any preventable adverse patient events resulting from the use of the standing order, and if so, whether changes in the order would reduce the likelihood of future similar adverse events. The review would not be expected to address adverse events that are a likely outcome of the course of patient's disease or injury, even if the order was applied to that patient, unless there is concern that use of the standing order exacerbated the patient's condition; and Whether a standing order has been initiated and executed in a manner consistent with the order's protocol, and if not, whether the protocol needs revision and/or staff need more training in the correct procedures. Self-Administration of Medications The CAH may choose to allow practitioners to write orders allowing patients to self -administer CAH -issued drugs and biologicals or drugs the patient has brought from home into the CAH for use during their stay, e.g., an insulin pen for a diabetic patient. If the CAH does permit this, it must develop policies and procedur es for self -administration of drugs by patients or their informal caregivers. Training Medication administration education and training is typically included in the CAH's orientation or other continuing education programs for nursing staff and other authorized healthcare personnel. Training or continuing education topics regarding medication administration may include but are not limited to the following: Safe handling and preparation of drugs, biologicals, and IV medications; Knowledge of the indications, side effects, drug interactions, compatibility, and dose limits of administered medications; and Equipment, devices, special procedures, and/or techniques required for medication administration. Policies and procedures must address the requi red components of the training and if the training provided during CAH orientation imparts sufficient education or whether ongoing in- services or continuing education will be required to demonstrate competence. Basic safe practices for medication administ ration The CAH's policies and procedures must reflect accepted standards of practice that require the following be confirmed prior to each administration of medication (often referred to as the \"five rights\" of medication administration practice): Right patient: the patient's identity \u2014 acceptable patient identifiers include, but are not limited to: the patient's full name; an identification number assigned by the CAH; or date of birth. Identifiers must be confirmed by patient wrist band, patient identification card, patient statement (when possible) or other means outlined in the CAH's policy. The patient's identification must be confirmed to be in agreement with the medication administration record and medication labeling prior to medication administr ation to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct patient. Right medication: the correct medication, to ensure that the medication being given to the patient matches that prescribed for the patient and that the patient does not have a doc umented allergy to it; Right dose: the correct dose, to ensure that the dosage of the medication matches the prescribed dose, and that the prescription itself does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too low); Right rout e: the correct route, to ensure that the method of administration - orally, intramuscular, intravenous, etc., is the appropriate one for that particular medication and patient; and Right time: the appropriate time, to ensure adherence to the prescribed frequency and time of administration. NOTE: The \"5 rights\" focus specifically on the process of administering medications. The medication process is generally recognized as consisting of five stages: ordering/prescribing; transcribing and verifying; dispensing and delivering; administering; and monitoring/reporting. Errors may occur in other components of the process, even when there is strict adherence to the \"5 rights\" of medication administration, for example when there has been a prescribing or a dispensing error. CAHs are also expected to comply with requirements for pharmacy services at \u00a7485.635(a)(3)(iv), using a systems approach to all components of the medication process. For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited Recent literature* identifies up to nine \"rights\" of medication administration including: Right patient Right drug Right route Right time Right dose Right documentation Right action (appropriate reason) Right form Right response However, other sources refer to 8 or 10 \"rights, and some of these topics, such as right action, appear to involve prescribing and/or dispensing. Accordingly, there does not (yet) appear to be consensus about expanding beyond the 5 \"rights.\" *Reference: Elliott, M. and Lis, Y. (2010). The Nine Rights of Medication Administration: An Overview. British Journal of Nursing, Vol. 19, 5, 300 -305. CAHs are encouraged to promote a culture in which it is not only acceptable, but also strongly encouraged, for staff to bring to the attention of the prescribing practitioner questions or concerns they have regarding medication orders. Any questions about orders for drugs or biologicals are expected to be resolved promptly. Timing of Medication Administration Appropriate timing of medication administration must take into account the complex nature and variability among medications; the indications for which they are prescribed; the clinical situations in which they are administered; and the needs of the patients receiving them. The chemical properties, mechanism of action, or therapeutic goals of some medications require administration at the exact time prescribed, or within a narrow window of its prescribed scheduled time, to avoid compromising patient safety or achievement of the intended therapeutic effect. However, the therapeutic effect of many other medications is uncompromised by a much broader wi ndow of time for administration. Consequently, the application of a uniform required window of time before or after the scheduled time for the administration of all medications, without regard to their differences, could undermine the ability of nursing s taff to prioritize nursing care activities appropriately. This could also result in staff work- arounds that jeopardize patient safety due to the imposition of unrealistic or unnecessary time constraints for medication administration. Instead, CAH policie s and procedures must specifically address the timing of medication administration, based on the nature of the medication and its clinical application, to ensure safe and timely administration. The policies and procedures must address at least the followi ng: Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times; Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times; Administration of eligible medications outside of their scheduled dosing times and windows; and Evaluation of medication administration timing policies, including adherence to them. Medications or categories of medication not eligibl e for scheduled dosing times The policies and procedures must identify medications or categories of medication which are not eligible for scheduled dosing times, ei ther in general or in specific clinical applications. These are medications that require exact or precise timing of administration, based on diagnosis type, treatment requirements, or therapeutic goals. The policies and procedures must reflect considerat ion of factors including, but not limited to, the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed medication; specific clinical applications; and patient risk factors. Examples of medications that CAHs may choose to identify as not eligible for scheduled dosing times may include, but are not limited to: Stat doses (immediate); First time or loading doses (initial large dose of a drug given to bring blood, tissue or fluid levels to an effective concentration quickly); One-time doses; doses specifically timed for procedures; Time doses timed for serum drug levels; Investigational drugs; or Drugs prescribed on an as needed basis (PRN doses). The policies and procedures must ensure timely administration of such medications. In addition they must specify if the policy for the administration of these medications will be applied throughout the CAH or only for specific CAH units or specific clinical situations or types of diagnoses. Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times Medications eligib le for scheduled dosing times are those prescribed on a repeated cycle of frequency, such as once a day, BID (twice a day), TID (three times a day), hourly intervals (every 1, 2, 3 or more hours), etc. The goal of this scheduling is to achieve and maintain therapeutic blood levels of the prescribed medication over a period of time. Medication administration policies and procedures typically establish standardized dosing times for the administration of all 'scheduled' medications. For example, medications prescribed for BID (twice a day) administration might, under a given CAH's policies and procedures, be scheduled to be administered at 8am and 8pm. Another CAH might choose to schedule BID medications at 7:30 am and 7:30 pm. Use of these standardized times facilitates the medication administration process, e.g., by providing to the CAH's pharmacy that morning doses of all BID drugs must be dispensed and delivered to patient units in time for the scheduled administration. For the nursing staff, the scheduled administration time might prompt prioritization of additional activities that may be required, in the case of particular drugs, such as vital sign assessment or the collection and review of blood work, to ensure safe and timely medication administrati on. Policies and procedures for medications eligible for scheduled dosing times must also address: first dose medications, including parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the timing of the first and subsequent doses, which may fall between scheduled dosing times; retiming of missed or omitted doses; medications that will not follow scheduled dosing times; and patient units that are not subject to following the scheduled dosing times. Time -critical scheduled medications Time -critical scheduled medications are those for which an early or late administration of greater than thirty minutes might cause harm or have significant, negative impact on the intended therapeutic or pharmacological effect. Accord ingly, scheduled medications identified under the CAH's policies and procedures as time -critical must be administered within thirty minutes before or after their scheduled dosing time, for a total window of one hour. It is possible for a given medication to be time - critical for some patients, due to diagnosis, clinical situation, various risk factors, or therapeutic intent, but not time - critical for other patients. Therefore, CAH policies and procedures must address the process for determining whether sp ecific scheduled medications are always time- critical, or only under certain circumstances, and how staff involved in medication administration will know when a scheduled medication is time -critical. Examples of time -critical scheduled medications/medicat ion types may include, but Medications prescribed for administration within a specified period of time of the medication order; Medications that must be administered apart from other medications for optimal therapeutic effect; or Medications prescribed more frequently than every 4 hours. Non-time -critical scheduled medications Non-time critical scheduled medications are those for which a longer or shorter interval of time since the prior dose does not significantly change the medication's therapeutic effect or otherwise cause harm. For such medications greater flexibility in th e timing of their administration is permissible. Specifically: Medications prescribed for daily, weekly or monthly administration may be within two hours before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed four hours. Medications prescribed more frequently than daily but no more frequently than every four hours may be administered within one hour before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed two hours. Missed or late administration of m edications The CAH's policies and procedures must address the actions to be taken when medications eligible for scheduled dosing times are not administered within their permitted window of time. This includes doses which may have been missed due to the patient being temporarily away from the nursing unit, for example, for tests or procedures; patient refusal; patient inability to take the medication; problems related to medication availability; or other reasons that result in missed or late dose administr ation. Likewise, policies and procedures must also outline guidelines for the administration and timing of new medications which are initiated between standardized dosing times. These policies and procedures must identify parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the rescheduling of missed or late doses and when notification of the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient is required prior doing so. In either case, errors in the administration of medication must be reported internally as required at \u00a7485.635(a)(1)(v). Evaluation of medication administration timing policies CAHs must periodically evaluate their medication administration timing policies, including staff adherence to the policies, to determine whether they assure safe and effective medication administration. Medication errors related to the timing of medicatio n administration must be tracked and analyzed to determine their causes. Based on the results of the evaluations of the policies and the medication administration errors, the CAH must consider whether there is a need to revise the policies and procedures governing medication administration timing. Assessment/Monitoring of Patients Receiving Medications Observing the effects medications have on the patient is part of the multi -faceted medication administration process. Patients must be carefully monitor ed to determine whether the medication results in the therapeutically intended benefit , and to allow for early identification of adverse effects and timely initiation of appropriate corrective action. Depending on the medication and route/delivery mode, m onitoring may need to include assessment of: Clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the efficacy of medication therapy, to anticipate or evaluate toxicity and adverse effects. For some medications, including opioids, this may include clinical data such as respiratory status, blood pressure, and oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels ; Physical signs and clinical symptoms relevant to the patient's medication therapy, including but not limited to, somnolence, confusion, agitation, unsteady gait, pruritus, etc. Certain types of medications - \"high alert medications\" - are considered inherently high risk for adverse drug events. Although mistakes may or may not be more common with these drugs, the consequences of errors are often harmful, sometimes fatal, to patients For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) makes available a list of high alert medications, which it defines as those medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. The current list may be found at: http://www.ismp.org/Tools/highAlertMedicationLis ts.asp In addition, certain factors place some patients at greater risk for adverse effects of medication. Factors including, but not limited to, age, altered liver and kidney function, a history of sleep apnea, patient weight (obesity may increase apnea or smaller patients may be more sensitive to dose levels of medications), asthma, history of smoking, drug - drug interactions, and first -time medication use may contribute to increased risk. Consideration of patient risk factors as well as the risks in herent in a medication must be taken into account when determining the type and frequency of monitoring. Further, to enhance continuity of care/safe medication administration, it is essential to communicate all relevant information regarding patients' med ication risk factors and monitoring requirements during hand- offs of the patient to other clinical staff, such as when patients are moved from a nursing for tests, during shift report at change of shift, etc. This would apply to hand -offs involving not only to nursing staff, but also to any other types of staff who administer medications, e.g., respiratory therapists. Adverse patient reactions, such as anaphylaxis or opioid- induced respiratory depression, require timely and appropriate intervention, per e stablished CAH protocols. An example of vigilant post -medication administration monitoring in the case of a high - alert medication where patient factors may increase risk would be regularly checking vital signs, oxygen level via pulse oximetry, and sedation levels of a post -surgical patient who is receiving pain medication via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Narcotic medications, such as opioids, are often used to control pain but also have a sedating effect. Patients can become overly sedated and suffer respiratory depression or arrest, which can be fatal. Timely assessment and appropriate monitoring is essential in all parts of the CAH in which opioids are administered, to permit intervention to counteract respiratory depression should it occ ur. (See also the discussion below for intravenous medications.) As part of the monitoring process, staff are expected to include the patient's reports of his/her experience of the medication's effects. Further, when monitoring requires awakening the patient in order to assess effects of the medications, the patient and/or the patient's representative must be educated about this aspect of the monitoring process. In addition, CAHs are encouraged to educate the patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty breathing or other changes that might be a reaction to medication. CAH policies and procedures are expected to address how the manner and frequency of monitoring, considering patient and drug risk factors, are determined, as well as the information to be communicated at shift changes, including the CAH's requirements for the method(s) of communication. IV Medications & Blood Transfusions Many of the medications included in the high -alert categories are administered intravenously. CAH policies and procedures for IV medications must address at least the following: Vascular Access Route Patients may require a form of vascular access to deliver blood or medications, either venous or arterial, based on the desired treatment plan. Safe administration of blood transfusions and IV medications includes the correct choice of vascular access. IV medications, such as fluids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy, may require specific types of access, such as peripheral or central catheters versus implanted port devices, based on the medication's chemical properties or safety concerns. Hospital policies and procedures must address which medications can be given intravenously via what type of a ccess. Other Patient Safety Practices In addition to the basic safe practices that apply to all medication administration, there are additional safe practices specific to IV medication administration that require consideration, including but not limited to, the following: Tracing invasive lines and tubes prior to administration to ensure the medication is to be administered via the proper route (for example, peripheral catheter versus epidural catheter connections); Avoiding forcing connections when the equipment offers clear resistance; Verifying proper programming of infusion devices (concentrations, flow rate, dose rate). Monitoring patients receiving IV medications To the extent that IV medications have a more rapid effect on the body, it is important that staff administering medications via IV understand each medication and its monitoring requirements. Policies and procedures for IV medication administration must address appropriate IV medication monitoring requirements, including assessment of patients for risk factors that would influence the type and frequency of monitoring. For example: a 50 year old patient with a history of renal failure is receiving IV vanc omycin to treat a wound infection. The CAH policy for IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, requires the patient's kidney function to be monitored daily with blood draws. Based on review of the lab results, a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient would be expected to determine on a timely basis whether or not the antibiotic dose needs to be adjusted to protect kidney function or prevent drug toxicity while achieving the desired therapeutic effects. Staff administering the medication would be expected to review the lab results as well, and to raise with a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient any concerns they might have about whether an adjustment in the medication is needed. CAH policies and procedures related to monitoring patients receiving IV medications are expected to address, but are not limited to, the following: Monitoring for Fluid & Electrolyte Balance Whenever IV medications and blood transfusions are administered, the patient may become at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Policies and procedures must address monitoring and treatment for fluid and electrolyte imbalances that may occur with blo od transfusions and IV medications. Monitoring Patients Receiving High -alert Medications, Including IV Opioids Policies and procedures related to IV medication administration must address those medications the CAH has identified as high -alert medications and the monitoring requirements for patients receiving such drugs intravenously. At a minimum, if the CAH provides surgical services, it is expected to address monitoring for over -sedation and respiratory depression related to IV opioids for post -operat ive patients. Opioids are a class of medication used frequently to treat pain. The sedating effects of opioids make it difficult at times to properly assess the patient's level of sedation. It can be erroneously assumed that patients are asleep when the y are actually exhibiting progressive symptoms of respiratory compromise - somnolence, decreased respiratory rate, and decrease in oxygen levels. These symptoms, if unrecognized, can progress to respiratory depression and even death. In addition to those patient characteristics that affect risk of adverse effects from medication discussed above, other factors placing patients receiving IV opioids at higher risk for oversedation and respiratory depression include, but are not limited to9: Snoring or history of sleep apnea 9 Jarzyna D., Junquist C., Pasero C., et al. American Society for Pain Management Nursing - Guidelines on Monitoring for Opioid- Induced Sedation and Respiratory Depression. Pain Management Nursing, Vol 12, No. 3 (September), 2011: pp 118- 145 No recent opioid use or first -time use of IV opioids Increased opioid dose requirement or opioid habituation Longer length of time receiving general anesthesia during surgery Receiving other sedating drugs, such as benzodiazepines, antihistamines, sedatives, or other central nervous system depressants Preexisting pulmonary or cardiac disease Thoracic or other surgical incisions that may impair breathing Of particular concern are patients receiving IV opioids p ost-operatively. The effects of IV opioids in post -operative patients must be monitored vigilantly via serial assessments of pain, respiratory status, and sedation levels. CAHs that provide surgical services must have policies and procedures related to the use of high- alert medications, including IV opioids for post -operative patients. Policies and procedures must address, at a minimum, the process for patient risk assessment, including who conducts the assessments, and, based on the results of the asse ssment, monitoring frequency and duration, what is to be monitored, and monitoring methods. The policies and procedures must also address whether and under what circumstances practitioners prescribing IV opioids are allowed to establish protocols for IV opioid administration and monitoring that differ from the CAH's policies and procedures. The frequency of the serial assessments and duration of the monitoring timeframe for post-operative patients receiving IV opioids must be determined based on at least the following considerations: Patient risk for adverse events; Opioid dosing frequency and IV delivery method. (push or patient -controlled analgesia (PCA)); Duration of IV opioid therapy. Regardless of the above factors, at a minimum monitoring must include the following: Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiratory rate); Pain level; Respiratory status; Sedation level; sedation levels are important indicators for the clinical effects of opioids. Sedation is a useful assessment parameter to observe the effects of opioids since sedation typically precedes respiratory depression10. See the blue box below for information on sedation assessment methods. In addition to vigilant nursing assessment at appropriate intervals, CAHs may choose to use technology to support effective monitoring of patients' respiratory rate and oxygen levels. For additional information regarding recommendations of expert organizati ons on post - operative opioid monitoring, including technology -supported monitoring, see blue boxes below. The practices described in the blue boxes below are not required under the regulations. The assessment and monitoring process must be explained to t he patient and/or the patient's representative, to communicate the rationale for vigilant monitoring, including that it might be necessary to awaken the patient in order to assess effects of the medications. In addition, CAHs are encouraged to educate th e patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty breathing or other changes that might be a reaction to medication.

For Information - Not Required/Not to be Cited Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation APSF calls for every patient receiving postoperative opioid analgesics to be managed based on the following clinical considerations*: Individualize the dose and infusion rate of opioid while considering the unique aspects of each patient's history and physical status. Make continuous monitoring of oxygenation (pulse oximetry) the routine rather than the exception. Assess the need for supplemental oxygen, especially if pulse oximetry or intermittent nurse assessment are the only me thods of identifying progressive hypoventilation. When supplemental oxygen is indicated, monitoring of ventilation may warrant the use of technology designed to assess breathing or estimate arterial carbon dioxide concentrations. Continuous monitoring is most important for the highest risk patients, but depending on clinical judgment, should be applied to other patients.

IV Blood Administration Procedures According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 13,785,000 units of whole blood and red blood cells were transfused in the United States in 201111. The collection, testing, preparation, and storage of blood and blood components are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Blood transfusions can be life -saving. However, they are not without risk of harm to patients. Transfusion reactions and/or errors can be fatal. In addition to the safe practices and other safety considerations that apply to all IV medication administratio n, policies and procedures must address blood administration procedures that are consistent with accepted standards of transfusion practice, including but not limited to: Confirming the following prior to each blood transfusion: the patient's identity verification of the right blood product for the right patient The standard of practice calls for two qualified individuals, one of whom will be administering the transfusion, to perform the confirmation. Requirements for patient monitoring, including frequency and documentation of monitoring How to identify, treat, and report any adverse reactions the patient may experience during or related to transfusion. Documentation Note that documentation of medication administration is addressed in the Medical Records CoP at \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(iii). This regulation requires that the record contain: \"All orders of doctors of medicine or osteopathy or other practitioners, reports of treatments and medications, nursi ng notes and documentation of complications and other pertinent information necessary to monitor the patient's progress, such as temperature graphics, progress notes describing the patient's response to treatment....\" Documentation is expected to occur after actual administration of the drugs or biologicals to the patient; advance documentation is not only inappropriate, but may result in medication errors. Proper documentation of medication administration actions taken and their outcomes is essential for p lanning and delivering future care of the patient. See the guidance for the various parts of \u00a7485.638 concerning documentation in the medical record. Deficiencies in documentation would be cited under the Clinical Records regulation. 11 The 2011 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Report. Retrieved September 27,2013 from http://www.hhs.gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011- nbcus.pdf Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(d)(3) Ask the person responsible for nursing services what type of personnel administer drugs and biologicals, including IVs. Are they practicing within their permitted scope? If anyone other than an MD/DO, RN or PA administers drugs or biologi cals, are they supervised by an RN or, if permitted under State law and CAH policy, a PA? Verify that nursing staff administering drugs have completed training consistent with CAH training policy. Review a sample of medication orders and determine if they contain the required elements: Determine if orders are legible, timed, dated and authenticated with a signature by the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the care of the patient. Was the administration of the medication consistent with th e order, i.e., the correct medication was administered to the right patient at the right dose via the correct route, and that timing of administration complied with the hospital's policies and procedures? Check that the practitioner's order was still in f orce at the time the drug was administered. Ask nursing staff if the CAH permits verbal orders and, if so, what the policy is for a verbal order. If staff are unaware of any policy, or if their description of a policy suggests it is incomplete or inconsi stent with accepted standards of practice, ask to see the written policy. Ask nursing staff whether they initiate medications in accordance with standing orders. Are they familiar with the hospital's policies and procedures for using standing orders? A re they following the policies and procedures? Ask to see the protocol for a standing order used by nursing staff, and ask nursing staff to explain how their practice conforms to the protocol. Determine whether all standing orders which were initiated by a nurse were authenticated by an authorized practitioner. Ask nursing staff if the CAH permits patient self -administration of medications. If yes, does the CAH have policies and procedures addressing this? Is there an order from a practitioner responsi ble for the care of the patient permitting self -administration of medications, either issued by the CAH or brought from home? Observe the preparation of drugs and their administration to patients [medication pass] in order to verify that procedures are b eing followed. Is the patient's identity confirmed prior to medication administration? Are procedures to assure the correct medication, dose, and route followed? Are drugs administered in accordance with the hospital's established policies and procedures for timely medication administration? Does the nurse remain with the patient until medication is taken, unless they are permitted to self -administer? Are patients assessed by nursing and/or other staff, per hospital policy, for their risk to t heir prescribed medications? Are patients who are at higher risk and/or receiving high- alert medications monitored for adverse effects? Are staff knowledgeable about intervention protocols when patients experience adverse medication -related events? Interview personnel who administer medication to verify their understanding of the policies regarding timeliness of medication administration. Are they able to identify time -critical and non -time-critical scheduled medications? Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times? Are they able to describe requirements for the timing of administration of time critical and non -time critical medications in accordance with the hospital's policies? Interview nursing staff who administer IV medications and blood transfusions. Are staff knowledgeable with respect to: Venipuncture techniques; Safe medication administration practices, including general practices applying to all types of medications and practices concerning IV tubing and infusion pumps; Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance; Patient assessment for risk related to IV medications and appropriate monitoring; Early detection and intervention for IV opioid- induced respiratory depression in post -operative patients; With respect to blood transfusions: Blood components; Process for verification of the right blood product for the right patient; and Transfusion reactions: identification, treatment, and reporting requirements. If able, observe blood transfusion and IV medication administration to assess staff adherence to accepted standards of practice. Were safe medication administration practices used? Was the transfused patient correctly identified and matched to the correct blood product prior to administration? Was the appropriate access used for IV medications? Were appropriate steps taken with regard to IV tubing and infusion pumps? Are patients being monitored post -infusion for adverse reactions? If staff appear to not be following accepted standards of practice fo r patient risk assessment related to IV medications, particularly opioids, and appropriate monitoring of patients receiving IV medications and/or blood transfusions, review policies and procedures for IV medication administration and blood transfusion to determine if they address safe practices considerations. C-1050 (Rev. nursing care plan must be developed and kept current for each inpatient. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(d)(4) There mu st be a nursing care plan for every CAH inpatient. Nursing care planning starts upon admission. It includes planning the patient's care while in the CAH as well as planning for transfer to a hospital, to a post -acute care facilit y or for discharge. A nursing care plan is based on assessing the patient's nursing care needs (not solely those needs related to the admitting diagnosis). The assessment considers the patient's treatment goals and, as appropriate, physiological and psyc hosocial factors and patient discharge planning. The plan develops appropriate nursing interventions in response to the identified nursing care needs. One resource for information about nursing care plans is The American Nurses Association http://www.nursingworld.org/EspeciallyforYou/StudentNurses/Thenursingprocess.aspx . The nursing care plan is kept current by ongoing assessments of the patient's needs and of the patient's response to interventions, and updating or revising the patient's nursing care plan in response to assessments. The nursing care plan is part of the p atient's clinical record and must comply with the clinical records requirements at \u00a7485.638. CAHs have the flexibility of developing the nursing care plan as part of a larger, coordinated interdisciplinary plan of care. This method may serve to promote communication among disciplines and reinforce an integrated, multi -faceted approach to a patient's care, resulting in better patient outcomes. The interdisciplinary plan of care does not minimize or eliminate the need for a nursing care plan. It does, how ever, serve to promote the collaboration between members of the patient's health care team. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(d)(4) Select a representative sample of nursing care plans based on the number of inpatient records reviewed. Are the care plans created as soon as possible after admission for each patient? Are the care plans based on the nurse's assessment of the individual patient? Is there evidence that the care plans are reviewed on an ongoing basis? Is there evidence that the nursing care p lan is revised as needed and is there documentation of nursing reassessment? Verify that there is evidence that the nursing care plans have been implemented. C-1052 (Rev. Therapy Services Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech -language therapy pathology services furnished at the CAH, if provided, are provided by staff qualified under State law, and consistent with the requirements for therapy services in \u00a7409.17 of this subpart. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(e) Rehabilitation services are optional CAH services. If a CAH provides any rehabilitative services to its patients, either directly or under arrangement or agreement, either inpatient or outpatient, the services must be provided by staff qualified under State law, and consistent with the requirements for therapy services in \u00a7409.17. Rehabilitation services services can be initiated only upon the order of a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech -language pathology must be furnished in accordance with the regulation at 42 CFR 409.17, which specifies the following rehabilitation services plan of care requirements: Establishment of the plan: \"The plan must be established before treatment begins by one of the following: (1) A physician; (2) A nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist or a physician assistant; (3) The physical therapist furnishing the physical therapy services; (4) A speech -language p athologist furnishing the speech- language pathology services; (5) An occupational therapist furnishing the occupational therapy services.\" Content of the plan: \"The plan: (1) Prescribes the type, amount, frequency, and duration of the physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech- language pathology services to be furnished to the individual; and (2) Indicates the diagnosis and anticipated goals.\" Changes in the plan: \"Any changes in the plan are implemented in accordance with the provider's polici es and procedures.\" Also in accordance with 42 CFR 409.17, rehabilitation services must be provided by qualified physical therapists, physical therapy assistants, occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, and/or speech -language pathologist s who meet the personnel qualifications defined in 42 CFR 484.4. CAHs must have policies and procedures consistent with State law. Rehabilitation services must be provided according to national standards of practice as established by professional organiz ations such as, but not limited to, the American Physical Therapy Association, the American Occupational Therapy Association, and the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(e) If the CAH provides rehabilitation services: Review clinical records of patients who received rehabilitation services. Determine whether the required care plan was developed and implemented. Review employee personnel files to verify the rehabilitation service providers (i.e., physical therapists, physical therapy assistants, occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, and/or speech -language pathologists) have the necessary education, experience, training, and documented competencies to provide rehabilitation services. Ask the CAH wh at national standards of rehabilitation practice provide the basis for its rehabilitation services. Is there supporting documentation? C-1054 visitation rights. A CAH must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the CAH may need to place on such rights an d the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation.... Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(f) Visitation plays an important role in the care of hospital patients, including CAHs. An article published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Assoc iation (Berwick, D.M., and 2004; Vol. 292, pp. 736- 737) discusses the health and safety benefits of open visitation for patients, families, and intensive care unit (ICU) staff and deb unks some of the myths surrounding the issue (physiologic stress for the patient; barriers to provision of care; exhaustion of family and friends). The article ultimately concluded that \"available evidence indicates that hazards and problems regarding ope n visitation are generally overstated and manageable,\" and that such visitation policies \"do not harm patients but rather may help them by providing a support system and shaping a more familiar environment\" as they \"engender trust in families, creating a b etter working relationship between hospital staff and family members.\" CAHs that unnecessarily restrict patient visitation often miss an opportunity to gain valuable patient information from those who may know the patient best with respect to the patient' s medical history, conditions, medications, and allergies, particularly if the patient has difficulties with recall or articulation, or is totally unable to recall or articulate this vital personal information. Many times visitors who may know the patient best act as an intermediary for the patient, helping to communicate the patient's needs to CAH staff. Although visitation policies are generally considered to relate to visitors of inpatients, \"visitors\" also play a role for outpatients who wish to have a support person present during their outpatient visit. For example, a same -day surgery patient may wish to have a support person present during the pre -operative patient preparation or post -operative recovery. Or an outpatient clinic patient may wish to have a support person present during their examination by a physician. Accordingly, CAH visitation policies must address both the inpatient and outpatient settings. CAHs are required to develop and implement written policies and procedures that address the patient's right to have visitors. If the CAH's policy establishes restrictions or limitations on visitation, such restrictions/limitations must be clinically necessary. Furthermore, the CAH's policy must include the reasons for any restrictions/limita tions. The right of a patient to have visitors may be limited or restricted when visitation would interfere with the care of the patient and/or the care of other patients. The regulation permits CAHs some flexibility, so that health care professionals ma y exercise their best clinical judgment when determining when visitation is, and is not, appropriate. Best clinical judgment takes into account all aspects of patient health and safety, including the benefits of visitation on a patient's care as well as p otential negative impacts that visitors may have on other patients in the CAH. Broad examples of clinically reasonable bases for a CAH to impose restrictions or limitations on visitors might include (but are not limited to) when: there may be infection control issues; visitation may interfere with the care of other patients; the CAH is aware that there is an existing court order restricting contact; visitors engage in disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior of any kind; the patient or patient's roommate needs rest or privacy; in the case of an inpatient substance abuse treatment program, there are protocols limiting visitation; and the patient is undergoing care interventions. However, while there may be valid reasons for limiting visitation d uring a care intervention, we encourage CAHs to try to accommodate the needs of any patient who requests that at least one visitor be allowed to remain in the room to provide support and comfort at such times. It may also be reasonable to limit the numbe r of visitors for any one patient during a specific period of time, as well as to establish minimum age requirements for child visitors. However, when a CAH adopts policies that limit or restrict patients' visitation rights, the burden of proof is upon the CAH to demonstrate that the visitation restriction is reasonably necessary to provide safe care. CAHs are expected to provide a clear explanation in their written policy of the clinical rationale for any visitation restrictions or limitations reflected in that policy. CAHs are not required, however, to delineate each specific clinical reason for policies limiting or restricting visitation, given that it is not possible to anticipate every instance that may give rise to a clinically appropriate rationale for a restriction or limitation. If visitation policies differ by type of unit, e.g., separate policies for intensive care units, or for newborn nurseries, the CAH policy must address the clinical rationale for this differentiation explicitly. The CAH's policies and procedures are expected to address how CAH staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling visitor access to patients will be trained so as to assure appropriate implementation of the visitation policies and procedures and avoidance of unnecessary restrictions or limitations on patients' visitation rights. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(f) Verify that the CAH has written policies and procedures that address the right of patients to have visitors. Review the policy to determine if there are limitations or restrictions on visitation. If there are, does the policy explain the clinical rationale for the restrictions or limitations? Is the rationale clear and reasonably related to clinical concerns? Is there documentation of how the CAH ident ifies and trains staff who play a role in facilitating or limiting/restricting access of visitors to patients? Are CAH staff aware of the visitation policies and procedures? Can staff on a given unit correctly describe the CAH's visitation policies for that unit? visitation rights. A CAH must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the CAH may need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation. A CAH must meet the following requirements: (1) Inform each patient ( or support person, where appropriate) of his or her visitation rights, including any clinical restriction or limitation on such rights, in advance of furnishing patient care whenever possible. (2) Inform each patient (or support person, where appropriate ) of the right, subject to his or her consent, to receive the visitors whom he or she designates, including, but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same -sex domestic partner), another family member, or a friend, and his or her right to withdraw or deny such consent at any time. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7482.635(f)(1)&(2) CAHs are required to inform each patient (or the patient's support person, where appropriate) of his/her visitation rights. A patient's \"support person\" does not ne cessarily have to be the same person as the patient's representative designated under an advance directive who is legally responsible for making medical decisions on the patient's behalf. A patient's support person could be a family member, friend, or other individual who supports the patient during the course of the CAH stay. Not only may the support person visit the patient, but he or she may also exercise a patient's visitation rights on behalf of the patient with respect to other visitors, when the pa tient is unable to do so. CAHs must accept a patient's designation, orally or in writing, of an individual as the patient's support person. When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes, there is no advance directi ve designating a representative on file, and an individual provides an advance directive designating an individual as the patient's support person, (it is not necessary for the document to use this exact term), the CAH must accept this designation, provide the required notice of the patient's visitation rights, and allow the individual to exercise the patient's visitation rights on the patient's behalf. When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes and no one has pres ented an advance directive designating them as the patient's support person, but an individual asserts that he or she, as the patient's spouse, domestic partner (including a same -sex domestic partner), parent or other family member, friend, or otherwise, i s the patient's support person, the CAH is expected to accept this assertion, without demanding supporting documentation, provide the required notice of the patient's visitation rights, and allow the individual to exercise the patient's visitation rights o n the patient's behalf. However, if more than one individual claims to be the patient's support person, it would not be inappropriate for the CAH to ask each individual for documentation supporting his/her claim to be the patient's support person. CAHs a re expected to adopt policies and procedures that facilitate expeditious and non- discriminatory resolution of disputes about whether an individual is the patient's support person, given the critical role of the support person in exercising the patient's vi sitation rights. A refusal by the CAH of an individual's request to be treated as the patient's support person with respect to visitation rights must be documented in the patient's medical record must, along with the specific basis for the refusal. The required notice of the patient's visitation rights must be provided, whenever possible, before the CAH provides patient care. The notice to patients must be in writing in a language or manner that the patient (or the patient's support person) can unde rstand. This is consistent with the guidance related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 issued by the Department of Health and Human Services - \"Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National O rigin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons\" (August 8, 2003, 68 FR 47311). In accordance with \u00a7485.608(a), CAHs are expected to comply with Title VI and may use this guidance to assist the CAH in ensuring patient's rights informatio n is provided in a language and manner that the patient understands. Surveyors do not assess compliance with this guidance on limited English proficiency, but may refer concerns about possible noncompliance to the Office of Civil Rights in the applicable Department of Health and Human Services Regional Office. The required visitation rights notice must address any clinically necessary or reasonable limitations or restrictions imposed by CAH policy on visitation rights, providing the clinical reasons for s uch limitations/restrictions, including how they are aimed at protecting the health and safety of all patients. The information must be sufficiently detailed to allow a patient (or the patient's support person) to determine what the visitation hours are a nd what restrictions, if any, apply to that patient's visitation rights. The notice must also inform the patient (or the patient's support person, where appropriate) of the patient's right to: Consent to receive visitors he or she has designated, either orally or in writing, including but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same -sex domestic partner), another family member, or a friend; Receive the visitors he or she has designated, including but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same- sex domestic partner), another family member, or a friend; and Withdraw or deny his/her consent to receive specific visitors, either orally or in writing. The medical record must contain documentation that the required notice w as provided to the patient or, if appropriate, the patient's support person. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(f)(1) & (2) Determine whether the CAH's visitation policies and procedures require providing notice of the patient's visitation rights to each patient or, if appropriate, to a patient's support person and/or, as applicable, the patient's representative . Review the CAH's standard notice of visitation rights. Does it clearly explain the: CAH's visitation policy, including any limitations or restrictions, such as visiting hours, numbers of visitors, or unit -specific restrictions, etc., and the clinical rationale for su ch limitations or restrictions? right of the patient to have designated visitors, including but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic pa rtner (including a same- sex domestic partner), another family member, or a friend, and the right to withdraw or deny consent to visitation? Review a sample of medical records to determine if there is documentation that the required notice was provided and if it was provided in advance of care, unless circumstances made this not feasible. Ask the CAH to identify how the required notice is provided. Ask staff responsible for providing the notice how they accomplish this. Ask the staff if they are familiar with the concept of a patient's \"support person\" and what it means. Ask a sample of current CAH patients or patients' support persons (where appropriate) whether they were provided notice of their right to have visitors. Ask if they were able to have visitors when they wanted to. If not, verify whether the restriction/limitation on visitors was addressed in the CAH's visitation policies and notice, or was inappropriate . Ask a sample of current CAH patients or patients' support persons (where appropri ate) whether the CAH did not limit some or all visitors, contrary to the patient's wishes. C-1058 visitation rights. A CAH must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the CAH may need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction o r limitation. A CAH must meet the following requirements: (3) Not restrict, limit, or otherwise deny visitation privileges on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. (4) Ensure that all visitors enjoy full and equal visitation privileges consistent with patient preferences. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(f)(3)&(4) The CAH's visitation policies and procedures may not use the race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender iden tity, sexual orientation, or disability of either the patient (or the patient's support person, where appropriate) or the patient's visitors (including individuals seeking to visit the patient) as a basis for limiting, restricting, or otherwise denying vis itation privileges. The CAH's policies and procedures must ensure that all visitors (including individuals seeking to visit the patient) enjoy full and equal visitation privileges, consistent with the preferences the patient (or, where appropriate, the pa tient's support person) has expressed concerning visitors. In other words, it is permissible for the patient (or the patient's support person, where appropriate) to limit the visiting privileges of his/her visitors, including providing for more limited vi siting privileges for some visitors than those for others. But it is not permissible for the CAH, on its own, to differentiate among visitors without any clinically necessary or reasonable basis. This includes visitors designated by the patient who have characteristics not addressed specifically in \u00a7485.635(f)(3), when those characteristics do not reasonably relate to a clinically reasonable basis for limiting or denying visitation. For example, it would not be appropriate to prohibit a designated visito r based on that individual's style of dress, unless there was a clinically reasonable basis for doing so. The CAH is responsible for ensuring that CAH staff treat all individuals seeking to visit patients equally, consistent with the preferences of the patient (or, where appropriate, the patient's support person) and do not use the race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability of either the patient (or the patient's support person, where appropriate) or the patient's visitors (including individuals seeking to visit the patient)as a basis for limiting, restricting, or otherwise denying visitation privileges. CAHs are expected to educate all staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling visitors on the CAH's visitation policies and procedures, and are responsible for ensuring that staff implement the CAH's policies correctly. CAHs are urged to develop culturally competent training programs designed to address the range of patients served by the CAH. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(f)(3)&(4) Review the CAH's visitation policies and procedures to determine whether they restrict, limit, or otherwise deny visitation to individuals on a prohibited basis. Ask the CAH how it educates staff to assure that visita tion policies are implemented in a non- discriminatory manner. Ask CAH staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling visitors to discuss their understanding of the circumstances under which visitors may be subject to restrictions/limitations. Are the restrictions/limitations appropriately based on the CAH's clinically -based policies? Ask CAH patients (or patients' support persons, where appropriate) whether the CAH has limited visitors against their wishes? If yes, verify whether the restriction/limitation on visitors was addressed in the CAH's visitation policies and in the patient notice, and whether it was appropriately based on a clinical rationale rather than impermissible discrimination. C-1100 System (1) The CAH maintains a clinical records system in accordance with written policies and procedures. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(1) The CAH must have a system of patient records, pertinent medical information, author identification, and record maintenance that ensures the integri ty of the authentication and protects the security of all record entries. The medical record system must correctly identify the author of every medical record entry. The medical record system must protect the security of all medical record entries. The medical record system must ensure that medical record entries are not lost, stolen, destroyed, altered, or reproduced in an unauthorized manner. All locations where medical records are stored or maintained must ensure the integrity, security and protection of the records. The CAH must have a system in place that ensures that the identity of the author of each entry is correct. The author of every entry must take a specified action to identify himself/herself as the author (or responsible person) of the e ntry, the time and dating of the entry, that the entry is accurate, and that he/she takes responsibility for accuracy of the entry. If the CAH uses computer entries there must be security system in place to ensure the integrity of the record system, to en sure that the author of each entry is correctly identified, to ensure that record entries are not altered or lost, that limits access to medical records to only authorized persons, and ensures that records are not released to unauthorized individuals. For the purposes of this regulation, electronic signatures comply with those medical record entries that include a requirements for a signature. There should be a current list of authenticated signatures, as well as a list of computer codes and signature sta mps (when used for authorship purposes) that have been authorized by the governing body and are protected by adequate safeguards. CAH policies and procedures should provide for appropriate sanctions for unauthorized or improper use of computer codes or si gnature stamps. The CAH must maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient evaluated or treated in any part or location of the CAH. A unit record for both inpatients and outpatients may be used; however, when two different systems are used they must be appropriately cross referenced. When a patient reimbursement status changes from acute care services to swing bed services, a single medical record may be used for both stays as long as the record is sectioned separately. Both sections must include admission and discharge orders, progress notes, nursing notes, graphics, laboratory support documents, any other pertinent documents, and discharge summaries. The medical record must be properly filed and retained. The CAH must have a medical recording system that ensures the prompt retrieval of any medical record, of any patient evaluated or treated at any location of the CAH within the past 6 years. The medical record must be accessible. The CAH must have a medical record system that allows the medical record of any patient, inpatient or outpatient, evaluated and/or treated at any location of the CAH within the past 6 years to be accessible by appropriate staff, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whenever that medical record may be needed. Survey P rocedures \u00a7485.638(a)(1) Verify that a medical record is maintained for each person receiving care. Verify that written procedures ensure the integrity of authentication and protect the security of patient records. Verify that medical records are stored and maintained in locations where the records are secure, with protection from damage, flood, fire, theft, etc., and limits access to only authorized individuals. Verify that records are accurate, completed promptly, easily retrieved and readily accessible, as needed. Verify that there is an established system that addresses at least the following activities of the medical records services: Timely processing and retrieval of records; Protecting the confidentiality of medical information; Compil ing and retrieval of data of quality assurance activities. Verify that the system policies and procedures are reviewed and revised as needed. Verify that the CAH employs adequate medical record personnel who possess adequate education, skills, qualificat ions and experience to ensure the CAH complies with requirements of the medical records regulations and other appropriate Federal and State laws and regulations. Are medical records promptly completed in accordance with State law and CAH policy? Select a sample of past patients of the CAH (inpatient and/or outpatient). Request those patient's medical records. Can the CAH promptly retrieve those records? records are legible, complete, accurately documented, readily accessible, and systematically organized. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(2) All medical records must be accurately written. The CAH must ensure that all medical records accurately and completely document all orders, test results, evaluations, treatments, interventions, care provided and the patient's response to those treatments, interventions and care. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(a)(2) For CAH surveys that are conducted after the i nitial certification survey, examine a sample of records using an adequate sample size to evaluate the scope of services provided. In a very small CAH, look at all inpatient and outpatients records, if appropriate. C-1106 designated member of the professional staff is responsible for maintaining the records and for ensuring that they are completely and accurately documented, readily accessible, and systematically organized. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(3) The CAH must have one unified medical record service with a department head that has been appointed by the governing body (or responsible individual). The director of medical records must have responsibility for all medical records to include both inpatient and outpatient records. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(a)(3) Verify that the CAH employs adequate medical record personnel. Review the organizational structure and policy statements and interview the person responsible for the service to ascertain that the medical records service is structured appropriately to meet the needs of the CAH and the patients. C-1110 (Rev. each patient receiving health care services, the CAH maintains a record that includes, as applicable -- (i) Identification and social data, evidence of properly executed informed consent forms, pertinent medical history, assessment of the health status and health care needs of the patient, and a brief summary of the episode, disposition, and instructions to the patient; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(i) The medical record must include evidence of properly executed informed consent forms for any procedures or surgical procedures specified by the medical staff, or by Federal or State law, if applicable, that require written patient consent. Informed consent means the patient or patient representative is given the information, explanations, consequences, and options needed in order to consent to a procedure or treatment. A properly executed consent form contains at least the following: Name of patient, and when appropriate, patient's legal guardian; Name of CAH; Name of proced ure(s); Name of practitioner(s) performing the procedures(s); Signature of patient or legal guardian; Date and time consent is obtained; Statement that procedure was explained to patient or guardian; Signature of professional person witnessing the consent; Name/signature of person who explained the procedure to the patient or guardian. The medical record must contain information such as progress and nursing notes, documentation, records, reports, recordings, test results, assessments etc. to: Justify admission; Support the diagnosis; Describe the patient's progress; Describe the patient's response to medications; and Describe the patient's response to services such as interventions, care, treatments, etc. The medical record must contain compl ete information/documentation regarding medical history, assessment of the health status and health care needs of the patient, and a summary of the episode, disposition, and instructions to the patient. This information and documentation is contained in a discharge summary. A discharge summary discusses the outcome of the CAH stay, the disposition of the patient, and provisions for follow -up care. Follow -up care provisions include any post CAH appointment, how post CAH patient care needs are to be met, and any plans for post-CAH care by providers such as swing -bed services, home health, hospice, nursing homes, or assisted living. A discharge summary is required following any CAH acute care stay prior to and following a swing- bed admission and discharge. The MD/DO or other qualified practitioner with admitting privileges in accordance with State law and CAH policy, who admitted the patient is responsible for the patient during the patient's stay in the CAH. This responsibility would include developing a nd entering the discharge summary. The MD/DO may delegate writing the discharge summary to other qualified health care personnel such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants to the extent recognized under State law or a State's regulatory mechanis m. The MD/DO may also delegate writing the discharge summary to another MD/DO who is familiar with the patient. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(i) Verify that the medical staff have specified which procedures or treatments require a written informed consent. Verify that medical records contain consent forms for all procedures or treatment that are required by CAH policy. Verify that consent forms are properly executed. Examine a sample of patient records and/or facility records of requests for information contained in patient records to determine if there are signed and dated consent forms, when required, medical history, health status and care needs assessment, and discharge summary in each record, as needed. Review of sample of active and clo sed medical records for completeness and accuracy in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations and CAH policy. The sample should be at least 10 percent of the average daily census, as appropriate. C-1114 (Rev. 200, 21-20) \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii) Reports of physical examinations, diagnostic and laboratory test results, including clinical laboratory services, and consultative findings; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii) All or part of the history and physical exam (H & P) may be delegated to other practitioners in accordance with State law and CAH policy, but the MD/DO must sign the H & P and assume full responsibility for the H & P. This means that a nurse practitioner or a ph ysician assistant meeting these criteria may perform the H & P. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(ii) Determine that the bylaws require a physical examination and medical history be done for each patient. For sampled records, does the appropriate practit ioner sign reports of physical examinations, diagnostic and laboratory test results, and consultative findings? C-1116 orders of doctors of medicine or osteopathy or other practitioners, reports of treatments and medications, nursing notes and documentation of complications, and other pertinent information necessary to monitor the patient's progress, such as temperature graphics, progress notes describing the patient's response to treatment; and Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(iii) The requirement means that the stated information is necessary to monitor the patient's condition and that this and other necessary information must be in the patient's medical record. In order for necessary information to be used it must be promptly filed in the medical record so that health care staff involved in the patient's care can access/retrieve this information in order to monitor the patient's condition and pr ovide appropriate care. The medical record must contain: All practitioner's orders (properly authenticated); All nursing notes; All reports of treatment (including complications and CAH -acquired infections); All medication records (including unfavorable reactions to drugs); All radiology reports; All laboratory reports; All vital signs; and All other information necessary to monitor the patient's condition. All medical records must be promptly completed. Every medical record must be compl ete with all documentation of orders, diagnosis, evaluations, treatments, test results, consents, interventions, discharge summary, and care provided along with the patient's response to those treatments, interventions, and care. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.6 38(a)(4)(iii) Verify that the patient records contain appropriate documentation of practitioners' orders, interventions, findings, assessments, records, notes, reports and other information necessary to monitor the patient's condition. Is necessary information included in patient records in a prompt manner so that health care staff involved in the care of the patient have access to the information necessary to monitor the patient's condition? -21-20) \u00a7485.638(a)(4)(iv) Dated signatures of the doctor of medicine or osteopathy or other health care professional. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.635(a)(4)(iv) Entries in the medical record may be made only by individuals as specif ied in CAH and medical staff policies. All entries in the medical record must be timed, dated, and authenticated, and a method established to identify the author. The identification may include written signatures, initials, computer key, or other code. When rubber stamps are authorized, the individual whose signature the stamp represents shall place in the administrative offices of the CAH a signed statement to the effect that he/she is the only one who has the stamp and uses it. There shall be no deleg ation to another individual. A list of computer or other codes and written signatures must be readily available and maintained under adequate safeguards. There shall be sanctions for improper or unauthorized use of stamp, computer key, or other code signatures. The CAH must have policies and procedures in place and operational before an electronic medical record system would be deemed acceptable. The parts of the medical record that are the responsibility of the MD/DO must be authenticated by this indiv idual. When non- MD/DOs have been approved for such duties as taking medical histories or documenting aspects of physical examination, such information shall be appropriately authenticated by the responsible MD/DO. Any entries in the medical record by house staff or non -MD/DOs that require counter signing by supervisory or attending medical staff members shall be defined in the medical staff rules and regulations. All entries in the medical record must be authenticated. Authentication would include at a minimum: The CAH has a method to establish the identi ty of the author of each entry. This would include verification of the author of faxed orders/entries or computer entries. The author takes a specific action to verify that the entry is his/her entry or that he/she is responsible for the entry, that the entry is accurate. The timing of the entry is noted and correct. Timing documents the time and date of each entry (orders, reports, notes etc.). Timing establishes when an order was given, when an ac tivity happened or when an activity is to take place. Timing and dating entries are necessary for patient safety and quality of care. Timing and dating of entries establishes a baseline for future actions or assessments and establishes a timeline of even ts. Many patient interventions or assessments are based on time intervals or time lines of various signs, symptoms, or events. There must be a specific action by the author to indicate that the entry is, in fact, verified and accurate. Failure to disapprove an entry within a specific time period is not acceptable as authentication. A system of auto -authentication in which a MD/DO or other practitioner authenticates a report before transcription is not consistent with these requirements. There must be a method of determining that the practitioner did, in fact, authenticate the document after it was transcribed. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.635(a)(4)(iv) Verify that entries are authenticated. Verify that the department maintains a current list of authentica ted signatures, written initials, codes, and stamps when such are used for authorship identification. Verify that computer or other code signatures are authorized by the CAH'S governing body and that a list of these codes is maintained under adequate safeguards by the CAH administration. Verify that the CAH'S policies and procedures provide for appropriate sanctions for unauthorized or improper use of the computer codes. Examine the CAH'S policies and procedures for using the system, and determine if doc uments are being authenticated after transcription. For sampled records, are there dated and authenticated signatures by appropriate MD/DOs and/or mid -level Record Information (1) The CAH maintains the confidentially of record information and provides safeguards against loss, destruction, or unauthorized use. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(b)(1) The CAH has sufficient safeguards to ensure that access to all information regarding patients is limited to those individuals designated by law, regulation, policy; or duly authorized as having a need to know. No unauthorized access or dissemination of clinical records is permitted. Clinical records are kept secure and are only viewed when necessary by those persons having a part in the patient's care. The right to confidentiality means safeguarding the content of information, including patient paper records, video, audio, and/or computer stored information from unauthorized disclosure without the specific informed consent of the individual, parent of a minor child, or legal guardian. CA H staff and consultants, hired to provide services to the individual, should have access to only that portion of information that is necessary to provide effective responsive services to that individual. Confidentiality applies to both central records and clinical record information that may be kept at dispersed locations. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(b)(1) Verify that only authorized persons are permitted access to records maintained by the medical records department. Verify that the CAH has a policy to grant patients direct access to his/her medical record if the responsible official (e.g., practitioner responsible for patient's care) determines that direct access is not likely to have an adverse effect on the patient. Verify that medical records are released only for patient care evaluation, utilization review, treatment, quality assurance programs, in- house educational purposes, or in accordance with Federal or State law, court orders, or subpoenas. Verify that copies of medical records are released o utside the CAH only upon written authorization of the patient, legal guardian, or person with an appropriate \"power of attorney\" to act on the patient's behalf, or only if there is a properly executed subpoena or court order, or as mandated by statutes. Verify that precautions are taken to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to or altering patient records. Verify that adequate precautions are taken to prevent physical or electronic altering, damaging or deletion/destruction of patient records or information in patient records. C-1122 policies and procedures govern the use and removal of records from the CAH and the conditions for the release of information. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(b)(2) The CAH'S patient record system must ensure the security of patient records. The CAH must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to patient records and that individuals cannot alter patient records. Patient records must be secure at all times and in all locations. This includes open patient records for patients who are currently inpatients in the CAH and outpatients in outpatient clinics. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(b)(2) Observe the CAH'S security practices for patient records. Are patient records left unsecured or unattended? Are patient records unsecured or unattended in hallways, patient rooms, nurses stations, or on counters where an unauthorized person could gain access to patient records? If the CAH uses electronic patient records, are appropriate security safeguards in place? Is access to patient records controlled? Verify that the CAH has policies and procedures for the use and release of records and that these polici es and procedures are enforced. C-1124 written consent is required for release of information not required by law. C-1126 (Rev. of Records The records are retained for at least 6 years from date of last entry, and longer if required by State statute, or if the records may be needed in any pending proceeding. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.638(c) Medical records are retained in their original form or legally reproduced form in hard copy, microfilm, or computer memory banks. The CAH must be able to promptly retrieve the complete medical record of every individual evaluated or treated in any part or location of the CAH within the last 6 years. In accordance with Federal and State law and regulations, certain medical records may have retention requirements that exceed 6 years (for example: FDA, OSHA, EPA). Survey Procedures \u00a7485.638(c) Determine that records are retained for at least 6 years, or more if required by State or local laws. C-1140 (Rev. Participation: Surgical Services. If a CAH provides surgical services, surgical procedures must be performed in a safe manner by qualified practitioners who have been granted clinical privileges by the governing body, or responsible individua l, of the CAH in accordance with the designation requirements under paragraph (a) of this section. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.639 The provision of surgical services is an optional CAH service. However, if a CAH provides surgical services to its patien ts, the services must be organized and staffed in such a manner to ensure the health and safety of patients. Surgical services that are performed in a safe manner would be performed in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. In accordance with acceptable standards of practice includes maintaining compliance with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations and guidelines governing surgical services or surgical service locations, as well as, any standards and recommendations promoted by or esta blished by nationally recognized professional organizations (e.g., the American Medical Association, American College of Surgeons, Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, etc.) A dditionally, the CAH'S outpatient surgical services must be integrated with the CAH's inpatient surgical services. When the CAH offers surgical services, the CAH must provide the appropriate equipment and types and numbers of qualified personnel necessary to furnish the surgical services offered by the CAH in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. The scope of surgical services provided by the CAH should be defined in writing and approved by the governing body or responsible individual. Superv ision in the OR The operating room must be supervised by an experienced staff member authorized by State law. The supervisor's experience could include education, background working in surgical services, and specialized training in the provision of surgi cal services/management of surgical service operations. The CAH should address its required qualifications for the supervisor of the CAH'S operating rooms in its policies. If the CAH utilizes LPN or operating room technicians as \"scrub nurses,\" those pers onnel must be under the supervision of an RN who is immediately available to physically intervene and provide care, as required in State law. Policies and Procedures Policies governing surgical care should contain: Aseptic surveillance and practice, including scrub techniques Identification of infected and non- infected cases Housekeeping requirements/procedures Patient care requirements Preoperative work -up Patient consents and releases Clinical procedures Safety practices Patient identification procedures Duties of scrub and circulating nurse Safety practices The requirement to conduct surgical counts in accordance with accepted standards of practice Scheduling of patients for surgery Personnel policies unique to the OR Resus citative techniques DNR status Care of surgical specimens Malignant hyperthermia Appropriate protocols for all surgical procedures performed. These may be procedure -specific or general in nature and will include a list of equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to properly carry out job assignments. Sterilization and disinfection procedures Acceptable operating room attire Handling infections and biomedical/medical waste Policies and procedures must be written, implemented and enforced. Surgical services' policies must be in accordance with acceptable standards of medical practice and surgical patient care. Pre-Operative History and Physical (H & P) A complete history and physical must be conducted in accordance with acceptable standards of practice, and the written document placed on the medical record, prior to surgery. All or part of the H & P may be delegated to other practitioners in accordance with State law and CAH policy, but the surgeon must sign the H & P and assume full respons ibility for the H & P. This means that a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant, meeting these criteria, may perform the H & P. In all circumstances, when an H & P has been conducted, but is not present on the chart prior to surgery, or in emergency situations where a complete H & P cannot be conducted prior to surgery, a brief admission note on the chart is necessary. The note should include at a minimum critical information about the patient's condition including pulmonary status, cardiovascular s tatus, BP, vital signs, etc. Informed Consent A properly executed informed consent form contains at least the following: Name of patient, and when appropriate, patient's legal guardian; Name of CAH; Name of procedure(s); Name of practitioner(s) performing the procedure(s) or important aspects of the procedure(s), as well as the name(s) and specific significant surgical tasks that will be conducted by practitioners other than the primary surgeon/practitioner. (Significant surgical tasks include: opening and closing, harvesting grafts, dissecting tissue, removing tissue, implanting devices, altering tissues.); Signature of patient or legal guardian; Date and time consent is obtained; Statement that procedure was explained to patient or guardian ; Signature of professional person witnessing the consent; and Name/signature of person who explained the procedure to the patient or guardian. The responsible practitioner must disclose to the patient any information necessary to enable the patient to evaluate a proposed medical or surgical procedure before submitting to it. Informed consent requires that a patient have a full understanding of that to which he or she has consented. An authorization from a patient who does not understand what he/she i s consenting to is not informed consent. Patients must be given sufficient information to allow them to make intelligent choices from among the alternative courses of available treatment for their specific ailments. Informed consent must be given despite a patient's anxiety or indecisiveness. The responsible practitioner must provide as much information about treatment options as is necessary based on a patient's personal understanding of the practitioner's explanation of the risks of treatment and the pr obable consequences of the treatment. Informed consent means the patient or patient representative is given (in a language or means of communication he/she understands) the information needed in order to consent to a procedure or treatment. An informed c onsent would include at least: an explanation of the nature and purpose of the proposed procedures, risks and consequences of the procedures, risks and prognosis if no treatment is rendered, the probability that the proposed procedure will be successful, and alternative methods of treatment (if any) and their associated risks and benefits. Furthermore, informed consent would include that the patient is informed as to who will actually perform surgical interventions that are planned. When practitioners ot her than the primary surgeon will perform important parts of the surgical procedures, even when under the primary surgeon's supervision, the patient must be informed of who these other practitioners are, as well as, what important tasks each will carry out. Post-Operative Care/Recovery Adequate provisions for immediate post -operative care means: Post operative care must be in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. The post -operative care area or recovery room is a separate area of the CAH. Access is limited to authorized personnel. Policies and procedures specify transfer requirements to and from the recovery room. Depending on the type of anesthesia and length of surgery, the post - operative check before transferring the patient from the r ecovery room should include some of the following: Level of activity Respirations Blood pressure Level of consciousness Patient color If the patients are not transferred to the recovery room, determine that provisions are made for close observation until they have regained consciousness, e.g., direct observation by an RN in the patient's room. Operating Room Register The register should include at least the following information: Patient's name Patient's CAH identification number Date of the operation Inclusive or total time of the operation Name of the surgeon and any assistant(s) Name of nursing personnel (scrub and circulating) Type of anesthesia used and name of person administering it Operation performed Pre and post -op diagnosis Age of patient Operative Report The operative report would include at least: Name and CAH identification number of the patient; Date and times of the surgery; Name(s) of the surgeon(s) and assistants or other practitioners who performed surgical tasks (even when performing those tasks under supervision); Pre-operative and post -operative diagnosis; Name of the specific procedure(s) performed; Type of anesthesia administered; Complications, if any; A description of techniques, fi ndings, and tissues removed or altered; Surgeons or practitioners name(s) and a description of the specific significant surgical tasks that were conducted by practitioners other than the primary surgeon/practitioner (significant surgical procedures include: opening and closing, harvesting grafts, dissecting tissue, removing tissue, implanting devices, altering tissues); and Prosthetic devices, grafts, tissues, transplants, or devices implanted, if any. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.639 Inspect all inpatient and outpatient operative rooms/suites. Request the use of proper attire for the inspection. Observe the practices to determine if the services are provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. Observe: That access to the operative and recovery area is limited to authorized personnel and that the traffic flow pattern adheres to accepted standards of practice; The conformance to aseptic and sterile technique by all individuals in the surgical area; That there is appropriate cl eaning between surgical cases and appropriate terminal cleaning applied; That operating room attire is suitable for the kind of surgical case performed, that persons working in the operating suite must wear only clean surgical attire, that surgical attire is designed for maximum skin and hair coverage; That equipment is available for rapid and routine sterilization of operating room materials and that equipment is monitored, inspected, tested, and maintained by the CAH'S biomedical equipment progr am; and That sterilized materials are packaged, handled, labeled, and stored in a manner that ensures sterility e.g., in a moisture and dust controlled environment and policies and procedures for expiration dates have been developed and are followed in accordance with accepted standards of practice. Review the CAH'S organizational chart displaying the relationship of the operating room service to other services. Confirm that the operating room's organization chart indicates lines of authority and deleg ation of responsibility within the department or service. If LPNs and surgical technologists (STs) are performing circulating duties, verify that they do so in accordance with applicable State laws and approved medical staff policies and procedures. Verify in situations where LPNs and STs are permitted to circulate that a qualified RN supervisor is immediately available to respond to emergencies. Review policies and procedures, to ascertain whether they contain the minimum policies specified in the inter pretive guidelines. Review a sample of medical records of surgical patients to determine if a complete history and physical examination by a surgeon is completed prior to surgery, except in an emergency, and in accordance with the methodology described ab ove. Review a sample of medical records of surgical patients to verify that they contain consent forms. Ascertain that the completed forms contain at least the information specified in the interpretive guidelines. Check to determine that the operating r oom suite has available the items listed. On-call system Cardiac monitor Resuscitator Defibrillator Aspirator (suction equipment) Tracheotomy set (a cricothyroidotomy set is not a substitute) Verify that all equipment is working and, as applicable, in compliance with the CAH'S biomedical equipment inspection, testing, and maintenance program. Verify that the CAH has provisions for post -operative care. Determine that there are policies and procedures that govern the recovery room area. Examine the OR register or equivalent record which lists all surgery performed by the surgery service. Determine that the register includes items specified in the interpretive guidelines. Review a sample of medical records of patients who had a surgical encounter. Verify that they contain a surgical report that is dated and signed by the responsible surgeon and includes the information specified in the interpretive guidelines. C-1142 Qualified Practitioners The CAH designates the practitioners who are allowed to perform surgery for CAH patients, in accordance with its approved policies and procedures, and with State scope of practice laws. Surgery is performed only by -- (1) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy, including an osteopathic practitioner recognized under section 1101(a)(7) of the Act; (2) A doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine; or (3) A doctor of podiatric medicine. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.639(a) Surgical privileges should be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years. A current roster listing each practitioner's specific surgical privileges must be available in the surgical suite and area/location where the s cheduling of surgical procedures is done. A current list of surgeons suspended from surgical privileges or whose surgical privileges have been restricted must be retained in these area/locations. The CAH must delineate the surgical privileges of all prac titioners performing surgery and surgical procedures. The medical staff is accountable to the governing body for the quality of care provided to patients. The medical staff bylaws must include criteria for determining the privileges to be granted to an i ndividual practitioner and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals requesting privileges. Surgical privileges are granted in accordance with the competencies of each practitioner. The medical staff appraisal procedures must evaluate each ind ividual practitioner's training, education, experience, and demonstrated competence as established by the CAH'S QA program, credentialing process, the practitioner's adherence to CAH policies and procedures, and in accordance with scope of practice and oth er State laws and regulations. The CAH must specify the surgical privileges for each practitioner that performs surgical tasks. This would include practitioners such as MD/DOs, dentists, oral surgeons, podiatrists, RN first assistants, nurse practitioner s, surgical physician assistants, surgical technicians, etc. When a practitioner may perform certain surgical procedures under supervision, the specific tasks/procedures and the degree of supervision (to include whether or not the supervising practitioner is in the same OR in line of sight) be delineated in that practitioner's surgical privileges and included on the surgical roster. When practitioners whose scope of practice for conducting surgical procedures requires the supervision of an MD/DO surgeon, the term \"supervision\" would mean the supervising MD/DO surgeon is present in the same room, working with the same patient. Surgery and all surgical procedures must be conducted by a practitioner who meets the medical staff criteria and procedures for the privileges granted, who has been granted surgical privileges in accordance with those criteria established by the governing body (or responsible individual), and who is working within the scope of those granted and documented privileges. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.639(a) Review the CAH'S method for reviewing the surgical privileges of practitioners. This method should require a written assessment of the practitioner's training, experience, health status, and performance. Determine that a current roster lis ting each practitioner's specific surgical privileges is available in the surgical suite and the area where the scheduling of surgical procedures is done. Determine that a current list of surgeons suspended from surgical privileges or who have restricted surgical privileges is retained in these areas/locations. C-1144 and Evaluation (1) A qualified practitioner, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, must examine the patient immediately before surgery to evaluate the risk of the procedure to be performed. (2) A qualified practitioner, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, must examine each patient before surgery to evaluate the risk of anesthesia. (3) Before discharge from the CAH, each patient must be evaluated for proper anesthesia recovery by a qualified practitioner, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.639(b) The pre -anesthesia evaluation must be performed prior to inpatient or outpatient surgery. The pre -anesthesia evaluation must be performed by an individual qualified to administer anesthesia. The pre- operative anesthetic evaluation should include: Notation of anesthesia risk Anesthesia, drug and allergy history Any potential anesthesia problems identified Patient's condition prior to induction of anesthesia The post -anesthesia follow -up report must be writt en on all inpatients and outpatients prior to discharge from surgery and anesthesia services. The post -anesthesia evaluation must be written by the individual who is qualified to administer the anesthesia. An MD/DO may delegate the post -anesthesia assess ment and the writing of the post - anesthesia follow -up report to practitioners qualified to administer anesthesia in accordance with State law and CAH policy. When delegation of the post -anesthesia follow -up report is permitted, the medical staff must addr ess its delegation requirements and methods in its bylaws. The post -anesthesia follow -up report must be documented in the patient's medical record, whether the patient is an inpatient or outpatient of the CAH, and must include at a minimum: Cardiopulmona ry status; Level of consciousness; Any follow -up care and/or observations; and Any complications occurring during post -anesthesia recovery. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.639(b) Review records to determine that each patient has a pre- anesthesia evaluation by an individual qualified to administer anesthesia. The evaluation must be performed prior to surgery. Review medical records to determine that a post -anesthesia follow -up report is written for each patient receiving anesthesia services, by the individual who administered the anesthesia prior to discharge from anesthesia services. Documentation should include those items specified in interpretive guidelines. C-1145 Anesthesia The CAH designates the person who is allowed to administer anesthesia to CAH patients in accordance with its approved policies and procedures and with State scope- of-practice laws. (1) Anesthesia must be administered by only-- (i)A qualified anesthesiologist; (ii) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy other than an anesthesiologist; including an osteopathic practitioner recognized under section 1101(a)(7) of the Act; (iii) A doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine; (iv) A doctor of podiatric medicine; (v) A certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), as defined in Sec. 410.69(b) of this chapter; (vi) An anesthesiologist's assistant, as defined in Sec. 410.69(b) of this chapter; or (vii) A sup ervised trainee in an approved educational program, as described in \u00a7\u00a7 413.85 or 413.86 of this chapter. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.639(c)(1) The medical staff bylaws must include criteria for determining the privileges to be granted to an individual practitioner and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals requesting privileges. The CAH must specify the anesthesia privileges for each practitioner that administers anesthesia, or who supervises the administration of anesthesia by another pr actitioner. The privileges granted must be in accordance with State law and CAH policy. The type and complexity of procedures for which the practitioner may administer anesthesia, or supervise another practitioner supervising anesthesia, must be specified in the privileges granted to the individual practitioner. A dentist, oral surgeon, or podiatrist may administer anesthesia in accordance with State law, their scope of practice and CAH policy. The anesthesia privileges of each practitioner must be spec ified. Anesthesia privileges are granted in accordance with the practitioner's scope of practice, State law, the individual competencies of the practitioner and the practitioner's compliance with the CAH'S credentialing criteria. When a CAH permits opera ting practitioners to supervise CRNA administering anesthesia, the medical staff must specify in the statement of privileges for each category of operating practitioner, the type and complexity of procedures they may supervise. A CRNA may administer anesth esia when under the supervision of the operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed (unless supervision is exempted in accordance with \u00a7485.639(e)). An anesthesiologist's assistant may administer anesthesia when under the supervision of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed. Available to immediately intervene includes at a minimum, that the supervising anesthesiologist or operating practitioner, as applicable, is: Physically located within the operative suite or in the labor and delivery unit; and Is prepared to immediately conduct hands -on intervention if needed; and Is not engaged in activities that could prevent the supervising practitioner from being able to immediately intervene and co nduct hands -on interventions if needed Survey Procedures \u00a7485.639(c)(1) Review the qualifications of individuals authorized to deliver anesthesia. Determine that there is documentation of current licensure or current certification status for all persons administering anesthesia. which a CRNA administers the anesthesia, the anesthetist must be under the supervision of the operating practi tioner except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. An anesthesiologist's assistant who administers anesthesia must be under the supervision of an anesthesiologist. All patients are discharged in the company of a responsible adult, except those exempted by the practitioner who performed the surgical procedure. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.639(d) Any exceptions to this requirement must be made by the attending practitioner and annotated on the clinical record. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.639(d) Verify that the CAH has policies and procedures in place to govern discharge procedures and instructions. C-1150 (Rev. Exemption (1) A CAH may be exempted from the requirement for MD/DO supervision of CRNAs as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the State i n which the CAH is located submits a letter to CMS signed by the Governor, following consultation with the State's Boards of Medicine and Nursing, requesting exemption from MD/DO supervision for CRNAs. The letter from the Governor must attest that he or s he has consulted with the State Boards of Medicine and Nursing about issues related to access to and the quality of anesthesia services in the State and has concluded that it is in the best interests of the State's citizens to opt -out of the current MD/DO supervision requirement, and that the opt -out is consistent with State law. (2) The request for exemption and recognition of State laws and the withdrawal of the request may be submitted at any time, and are effective upon submission. C-1200 (Rev. Infection Prevention and Control and Antibiotic Stewardship Programs The CAH must have active facility -wide programs, for the surveillance, prevention, and control of HAIs and other infectious diseases and for the optimization of antibiotic use through stewardship. The programs must demonstrate adherence to nationally recognized infection prevention and control guidelines, as well as to best practices for improving antibiotic use where applicable, and for reducing the development and transmission of HAIs and antibiotic -resistant organisms. Infection prevention and control problems and antibiotic use issues identified in the programs must be addressed in coordination with the facility -wide quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program.

Participation: Organ, Tissue, and Eye Procurement The CAH must have and implement written protocols that: Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643 The CAH must have written policies and procedures to address its organ procurement responsibilities. C-1503 (Rev. an agreement with an OPO designated under part 486 of this chapter, under which it must notify, in a timely manner, the OPO or a third party designated by the O PO of individuals whose death is imminent or who have died in the CAH. The OPO determines medical suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the CAH, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation , using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the CAH for this purpose; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643(a) The CAH must have a written agreement with an Organ Procurement Organization (OPO), designated under 42 CFR Part 486. At a minimum, the written agreement must address the following: The criteria for referral, including the referral of all individuals whose death is imminent or who have di ed in the CAH; Includes a definition of \"imminent death\"; Includes a definition of \"timely notification\"; Addresses the OPO's responsibility to determine medical suitability for organ donation; Specifies how the tissue and/or eye bank will be notified about potential donors using S notification protocols developed by the OPO in consultation with the CAH- designated tissue and eye bank(s); Provides for notification of each individual death in a timely manner to the OPO (or designated third party) in acco rdance with the terms of the agreement; Ensures that the designated requestor training program offered by the OPO has been developed in cooperation with the tissue bank and eye bank designated by the CAH; Permits the OPO, tissue bank, and eye bank acces s to the CAH'S death record information according to a designated schedule, e.g., monthly or quarterly; Includes that the CAH is not required to perform credentialing reviews for, or grant privileges to, members of organ recovery teams as long as the OPO s ends only \"qualified, trained individuals\" to perform organ recovery; and The interventions the CAH will utilize to maintain potential organ donor patients so that the patient organs remain viable. CAHs must notify the OPO of every death or imminent dea th in the CAH. When death is imminent, the CAH must notify the OPO both before a potential donor is removed from a ventilator and while the potential donor's organs are still viable. The CAH should have a written policy, developed in coordination with the OPO and approved by the CAH'S medical staff and governing body, to define \"imminent death.\" The definition for \"imminent death\" should strike a balance between the needs of the OPO and the needs of the CAH'S care givers to continue treatment of a patient until brain death is declared or the patient's family has made the decision to withdraw supportive measures. Collaboration between OPOs and CAHs will create a partnership that furthers donation, while respecting the perspective of CAH staff. The definit ion for \"imminent death\" might include a patient with severe, acute brain injury who: Requires mechanical ventilation; Is in an intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department; AND Has clinical findings consistent with a Glascow Coma Score that is less than or equal to a mutually -agreed -upon threshold; or MD/DOs are evaluating a diagnosis of brain death; or An MD/DO has ordered that life sustaining therapies be withdrawn, pursuant to the family's decision. CAHs and their OPO should develop a def inition of \"imminent death\" that includes specific triggers for notifying the OPO about an imminent death. In determining the appropriate threshold for the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), it is important to remember that if the threshold is too low, there may b e too many \"premature\" deaths or situations where there is a loss of organ viability. Standards for appropriate GCS thresholds may be obtained from the CAH'S OPO or organizations such as the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. Note that a pat ient with \"severe, acute brain injury\" is not always a trauma patient. For example, post myocardial infarction resuscitation may result in a patient with a beating heart and no brain activity. The definition agreed to by the CAH and the OPO may include al l of the elements listed above or just some of the elements. The definition should be tailored to fit the particular circumstances in each CAH. CAHs may not use \"batch reporting\" for deaths by providing the OPO with periodic lists of patient deaths, even if instructed to do so by the OPO. If the patient dies during a transfer from one CAH to another, it is the receiving CAH'S responsibility to notify the OPO. \"Timely notification \" means a CAH must contact the OPO by telephone as soon as possible after an individual has died, has been placed on a ventilator due to a severe brain injury, or who has been declared brain dead (ideally within 1 hour). That is, a CAH must notify the OPO while a brain dead or severely brain -injured, ventilator -dependent indivi dual is still attached to the ventilator and as soon as possible after the death of any other individual, including a potential non- heart -beating donor. Even if the CAH does not consider an individual who is not on a ventilator to be a potential donor, the CAH must call the OPO as soon as possible after the death of that individual has occurred. Referral by a CAH to an OPO is timely if it is made: As soon as it is anticipated a patient will meet the criteria for imminent death agreed to by the OPO and CA H or as soon as possible after a patient meets the criteria for imminent death agreed to by the OPO and the CAH (ideally, within one hour); AND Prior to the withdrawal of any life sustaining therapies (i.e., medical or pharmacological support). Whenever possible, referral should be made early enough to allow the OPO to assess the patient's suitability for organ donation before brain death is declared and before the option of organ donation is presented to the family of the potential donor. Timely assessm ent of the patient's suitability for organ donation increases the likelihood that the patient's organs will be viable for transplantation (assuming there is no disease process identified by the OPO that would cause the organs to be unsuitable), ensures tha t the family is approached only if the patient is medically suitable for organ donation, and ensures that an OPO representative is available to collaborate with the CAH staff in discussing donation with the family. It is the OPO's responsibility to determine medical suitability for organ donation, and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the CAH, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the CAH for this purpose. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.643(a) Review the CAH'S written agreement with the OPO to verify that it addresses all required information. Verify that the CAH'S governing body has approved the CAH'S organ procurement policies. Review a sample of death records to verify that the CAH has implemented its organ procurement policies. Interview the staff to verify that they are aware of the CAH'S policies and procedur es for organ, tissue and eye procurement. Verify that the organ, tissue and eye donation program is integrated into the CAH'S QA program. ement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be appropriate to assure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potentia l donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with organ procurement; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643(b) The CAH must have an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank. The OPO may serve as a \"gatekeeper\" receiving notification about every CAH death and should notify the tissue bank chosen by the CAH about potential tissue and eye donors. It is not necessary for a CAH to have a separate agreement with a tissue bank if it has an agreement with its OPO to provide tiss ue procurement services; not is it necessary for a CAH to have a separate agreement with an eye bank if its OPO provides eye procurement services. The CAH is not required to use the OPO for tissue or eye procurement but is free to have an agreement with t he tissue bank or eye bank of its choice. The tissue banks and eye banks define \"usable tissues\" and \"usable eyes.\" The requirements of this regulation may be satisfied through a single agreement with an OPO that provides services for organ, tissue and e ye, or by a separate agreement with another tissue and/or eye bank outside the OPO, chosen by the CAH. The CAH may continue current successful direct arrangements with tissue and eye banks as long as the direct arrangement does not interfere with organ pr ocurement. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.643(b) Verify that the CAH has an agreement with at least one tissue bank and one eye bank that specifies criteria for referral of all individuals who have died in the CAH. The agreement must also acknowledge that it is the OPO's responsibility to determine medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, unless the CAH has an alternative agreement with a different tissue and/or eye bank. C-1507 (Rev. in collaboration with the designated OPO, that the family of each potential donor is informed of its option to either donate or not donate organs, tissues, or eyes. The individual designated by the CAH to initiate the request to the family must be a designated requestor. A designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community in the methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643(c) It is the responsibility of the OPO to screen for medical suitability in order to select potential donors. Once the OPO has selected a potential donor, that person's family must be informed of the family's donation options. Ideally, the OPO and the CAH will decide together how and by whom the family will be approached. The individual designated by the CAH to initiate the request to the family must be a designated requestor. A \"designated requestor\" is defined as a CAH -designated individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community. If possible, the OPO representative and a designa ted requestor should approach the family together. The CAH must ensure that any \"designated requestor\" for organs, tissues or eyes has completed a training course either offered or approved by the OPO, which addresses methodology for approaching potential donor families. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.643(c) Verify that the CAH ensures that the family of each potential donor is informed of its options to donate organs, tissues, or eyes, including the option to decline to donate. Review training schedules and pe rsonnel files to verify that all designated requestors have completed the required training. How does the CAH ensure that only designated requestors are approaching families to ask them to donate? discretion and sensitivity with respect to the circumstances, views, and beliefs of the family of potential donors; Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643(d) Using discretion does not mean a judgment can be made by the CAH that certain families should not be approache d about donation. CAHs should approach the family with the belief that a donation is possible and should take steps to ensure the family is treated wit h respect and care. The staff's perception that a family's grief, race, ethnicity, religion or socioeconomic background would prevent donation should never be used as a reason not to approach a family. All potential donor families must be approached and i nformed of their donation rights. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.643(d) Interview a CAH -designated requestor regarding approaches to donation requests. Review the designated requestor training program to verify that it addresses the use of discretion. Review the facility complaint file for any relevant complaints. C-1511 (Rev. that the CAH works cooperatively with the designated OPO, tissue bank and eye bank in educating staff on donation issues, reviewing death records to improve identification of potential donors, and maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes takes place. \u00a7485.643(f) For purpose of these standards, the term \"organ\" means a human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestines (or multivisceral organs). Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.643(e) Appropriate staff, including all patient care staff, must be trained regarding donation issues and how to work with the OPO, tissue bank and eye bank. Those CAH staff who may have to contact or work with the OPO, tissue bank and eye bank staff, must have appropriate training on donation issues including their duties and roles. The training program must be developed in cooperation with the OPO, tissue bank and eye bank, and should include, at a minimum: Consent process; Importance of using discretion and sensitivity when approaching families; Role of the designated requestor; Transplantation and donation, including pediatrics, if appropriate; Quality improvement activities; and Role of the organ procurement organization. Training should be conducted with new employees annually, whenever there are policy/procedure changes, or when problems are determined through the CAH'S QA program. CAHs must cooperate with OPOs, tissue banks and eye banks in regularly/periodically reviewing death records. This means that a CAH must develop policies and procedures which permit the OPO, t issue bank and eye bank access to death record information that will allow the OPO, tissue bank and eye bank to assess the CAH'S donor potential, ensure that all deaths or imminent deaths are being referred to the OPO in a timely manner, and identify area s where the CAH, OPO, tissue bank and eye bank staff performance might be improved. The policies must address how patient confidentiality will be maintained during the review process. The CAH must have policies and procedures, developed in cooperation w ith the OPO, that ensure that potential donors are maintained in a manner that maintain the viability of their organs. The CAH must have policies in place to ensure that potential donors are identified and declared dead within an acceptable time frame by an appropriate practitioner. Survey Procedures \u00a7485.643(e) Review inservice training schedules and attendance sheets. How does the CAH ensure that all appropriate staff have attended an educational program regarding donation issues and how to work with the OPO, tissue bank, and eye bank? Verify by review of policies and records that the CAH works with the OPO, tissue bank, and eye bank in reviewing death records. Verify that the effectiveness of any protocols and policies is monitored as part of the CAH 'S quality improvement program. Validate how often the reviews are to occur. Review the protocols that are in place to guide record reviews and analysis. Determine how confidentiality is ensured. Verify that there are policies and procedures in place t o ensure coordination between the facility staff and the OPO staff in maintaining the potential donor. Determine by review, what policies and procedures are in place to ensure that potential donors are identified and declared dead by an appropriate practi tioner within an acceptable timeframe. CAH Providers of Long- Term Care Services (\"Swing -Beds\"). A CAH must meet the following requirements in order to be granted an approval from CMS to provide post -CAH SNF care, as specified in \u00a7409.30 of this chapter, and to be paid for SNF -level services, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.645 The swing -bed concept allows a CAH to use their beds interchangeably for either acute- care or post -acute care. A \"swing -bed\" is a change in reimbursement status. The patient swings from receiving acute -care services and reimbursement to receiving skilled nur sing (SNF) services and reimbursement. Medicare allows a CAH to operate swing -beds through the issuance of a \"swing -bed approval.\" If the facility fails to meet the swing -bed requirements, and the facility does not develop and implement an accepted plan of correction, the facility loses the approval to operate swing -beds and receive swing -bed reimbursement. The facility does not go on a termination track. If the CAH continues to meet the CoP for the provider type, it continues to operate but loses swing -bed approval. Swing -beds need not be located in a special section of the CAH. The patient need not change locations in the facility merely because his/her status changes unless the facility requires it. The change in status from acute care to swing -bed status can occur within one facility or the patient can be transferred from another facility for swing -bed admission. There must be discharge orders from acute inpatient care services and subsequent admission orders for swing -bed services, the same as if the patient had been transferred to a separately certified skilled nursing facility. The same clinical record may be used for a swing -bed patient, but it must include discharge orders from acute care and admission orders to swing -bed services, and the swi ng-bed services (which may be SNF or NF level services) must be clearly delineated within the clinical record. There is no length of stay restriction for any CAH swing -bed patient. There is no Medicare requirement to place a swing -bed patient in a nursing home and there are no requirements for transfer agreements between CAHs and nursing homes. While there is no length of stay limit for patients in swing -bed status, the intended use for swing beds is for a transitional time period to allow the patient to fully recover to return home or while awaiting placement into a nursing facility. The CAH should document in the patient's medical record efforts made for nursing facility placement. Medicare coverage rules require that, in order to be eligible for coverage of post -hospital swing -bed care, a beneficiary must have a qualifying 3 -day inpatient stay in a participating or qualified hospital or participating CAH prior to admission to a swing - bed. There is no requirement for a CAH to use the MDS form for rec ording the patient assessment or for nursing care planning. Swing -bed patients receive a SNF level of care, and the CAH is reimbursed for providing a SNF level of care, however swing -bed patients are not SNF patients. Swing -bed patients in CAHs are consi dered to be patients of the CAH. NOTE : Swing -beds must not be confused with beds in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or nursing facility (NF), including a distinct part SNF/NF, that shares the same building/campus as the CAH but is a separately certifie d provider with its own Medicare provider agreement. C-1602 CAH must meet the following eligibility requirements: (1) The facility has been certified as a CAH by CMS under \u00a7485.606(b) of this subpart; and (2) The facility provides not more than 25 inpatient beds. Any bed of a unit of the facility that is licensed as a distinct -part SNF at the time the facility applies to the State for designation as a CAH is not counted under paragraph (a) of this section. Interpretive Guidelines \u00a7485.645(a) Eligibility CAHs seeking swing -bed approval are screened prior to survey for their eligibility for swing -beds. However, the CMS RO makes the determination whet her the CAH has satisfied the eligibility criteria, regardless of whether the SA or AO, as applicable, recommends approval of swing -bed status (this responsibility may not be delegated to the SA). The eligibility criteria at 42 CFR 485.645(a) requires: The CAH has a Medicare provider agreement; An initial CAH applicant may seek swing -bed approval. If the CAH applicant meets all Federal Requirements for participation, including those for swing - bed approval, the CAH applicant's approval for swing -bed services will be effective with the CAH's effective date of Medicare participation; as Rural Primary Care Hospitals (RPCHs) on September 30, 1997 These facilities must meet the following requirements: (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a hospital that participated in Medicare as a RPCH on September 30, 1997, and on that date had in effect an approval from CMS to use its inpatient facilities to provide post -hospital SNF care may continue in that status under the same terms, conditions, and limitations that were applicable at the time these approvals were granted.. (2) A CAH that was granted swing -bed approval unde r paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request that its application to be a CAH and swing -bed provider be reevaluated under paragraph (a) of this section. If this request is approved, the approval is effective not earlier than October 1, 1997. As of the date of approval, the CAH no longer has any status under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may not request reinstatement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. C-1606 inpatient RPCH services to a CAH that has qualified as a CAH under the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section is made in accordance with \u00a7413.70 of this chapter. Payment for post -hospital SNF -level of care services is made i n accordance with the payment provisions in \u00a7413.114 of this chapter. C-1608 CAH is substantially in compliance with the following SNF requirements contained in subpart B of part 483 of this chapter: \u00a7485.645(d)(1) Resident (\u00a7483.10(b)(7), (c)(1), (f)(4)(ii) and (iii), (g)(8) and (17), (g)(18) introductory text, (h) of this chapter). \u00a7483.10(b)(7) In the case of a resident adjudged incompetent under the laws of a State by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the resident devolve to and are exercised by the resident representative appointed under State law to act on the resident's behalf.

(5) If the resident subsequently selects another attending physician who meets the requirements specified in this part, the facility must honor that choice. \u00a7483.10(e)(2) The right to retain and use personal possessions, including furnishings, and clothing, as space permits, unless to do so would infringe upon the rights or health and safety of other residents. \u00a7483.10(e)(4) The right to share a room with his or her spouse when marr ied residents live in the same facility and both spouses consent to the arrangement. \u00a7483.10(f)(4)(ii) The facility must provide immediate access to a resident by immediate family and other relatives of the resident, subject to the resident's right to den y or withdraw consent at any time; \u00a7483.10(f)(4)(iii) The facility must provide immediate access to a resident by others who are visiting with the consent of the resident, subject to reasonable clinical and safety restrictions and the resident's right to deny or withdraw consent at any time; \u00a7483.10(g)(8) The resident has the right to send and receive mail, and to receive letters, packages and other materials delivered to the facility for the resident through a means other than a postal service, including the right to: (i) Privacy of such communications consistent with this section; and (ii) Access to stationery, postage, and writing implements at the resident's own expense. \u00a7483.10(g)(17) The facility must \u2014 (i) Inform each Medicaid -eligible resident, in writing, at the time of admission to the nursing facility and when the resident becomes eligible for Medicaid of \u2014 (A) The items and services that are included in nursing facility services under the State plan and for which the resident may not be charged; (B) Those other items and services that the facility offers and for which the resident may be charged, and the amount of charges for those services; and (ii) Inform each Medicaid -eligible resident when changes are made to the items and services specified in \u00a7483.10(g)(17)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. \u00a7483.10(g)(18)[introductory text only] The facility must inform each resident before, or at the time of admission, and periodically during the resident's stay, of services available in the facilit y and of charges for those services, including any charges for services not covered under Medicare/Medicaid or by the facility's per diem rate. \u00a7483.10(h) Privacy and confidentiality. The resident has a right to personal privacy and confidentiality of his or her personal and medical records. (1) Personal privacy includes accommodations, medical treatment, written and telephone communications, personal care, visits, and meetings of family and resident groups, but this does not require the facility to prov ide a private room for each resident.

(i) If a hospital has screened an individual under paragraph (a) of this section and found the ind ividual to have an emergency medical condition, and admits that individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition, the hospital has satisfied its special responsibilities under this section with respect to that individual (ii) This section is not applicable to an inpatient who was admitted for elective (nonemergency) diagnosis or treatment. (iii) A hospital is required by the conditions of participation for hospitals under Part 482 of this chapter to provide care to its inpatients in accordance with those conditions of participation. (3) Refusal to consent to treatment. A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital offers the individu al the further medical examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the examination and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not consent to the examination or treatment. The medical record must contain a description of the examination, treatment, or both if applicable, that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of the person acting on his or her behalf). The written document should indicate that the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the examination or treatment, or both. C-2408 (Rev. 21-20) (4) Delay in treatment. (i) A participating hospital may not delay providing an appropriate medical screening examination required under paragraph ( a) of this section or further medical examination and treatment required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status. (ii)A participating hospital may not seek, or direct an indiv idual to seek, authorization from the individual's insurance company for screening or stabilization services to be furnished by a hospital, physician, or nonphysician practitioner to an individual until after the hospital has provided the appropriate medic al screening examination required under paragraph (a) of this section, and initiated any further medical examination and treatment that may be required to stabilize the emergency medical condition under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (iii) An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not precluded from contacting the individual's physician at any time to seek advice regarding the individual's medical history and needs that may be relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required under paragraph (a) or paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Hospitals may follow reasonable registration processes for individuals for whom examination or treatment is required by this section, including asking whether an individual is insured and, if so, what that insurance is, as long as that inquiry does not delay screening or treatment. Reasonable registration processes may not unduly discourage individuals from rem aining for further evaluation. A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital offers to transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with paragraph (e) of this s ection and informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not consent to the transfer. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and state the reaso ns for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a description of the proposed transfer that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. C-2409 (Rev. 21-20) (1) General If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless - (i) The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the mean ing of paragraph (e)(2) of this section); and (ii)(A) The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer, after being informed of the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of transfe r. The request must be in writing and indicate the reasons for the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and benefits of the transfer. (B) A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) has signed a certifica tion that, based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based; or (C) If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the t ime an individual is transferred, a qualified medical person (as determined by the hospital in its bylaws or rules and regulations) has signed a certification described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section 186 1(r)(1) of the Act) in consultation with the qualified medical person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns the certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based. (2) A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only in those cases in which - (i) The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child; (ii) The receiving facility (A) Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual; and (B) Has agreed to accept transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment. (iii) The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) related to the emergency condition which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the transfer, including available history, recor ds related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided, results of any tests and the informed written conse nt or certification (or copy thereof) required under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, and the name and address of any on -call physician (described in paragraph (g) of this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records (e.g., test results not yet available or historical records not readily available from the hospital's files) must be sent as soon as practicable after transfer; and (iv) The transfer is effected through qua lified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer. C-2410 (Rev. 21-20) A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical person refuses to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against any hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this section. C-2411 (Rev. 200, 02 -21-20) A participating hospital that has specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock -trauma units, neonatal intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral cent ers, which, for purposes of this subpart, means hospitals meeting the requirements of referral centers found at \u00a7412.96 of this chapter) may not refuse to accept from a referring hospital within the boundaries of the United States an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the receiving hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. This requirement applies to any participating hospital with specialized capabilities, regardless of whether the hos pital has a dedicated emergency department.

Survey Protocol Effective: PRE -SURVEY: OFF -SITE PREPARATION Prior to the survey, determine the number and types of transplant programs at the transplant hospital to be surveyed to determine survey team composition. Review each program using the information below: 1.Any prior survey and certification issues, e.g. p revious complaints that indicate further investigation or follow -up; 2. Has the program exceeded a 12 month inactivation period; (X172) 3. Was any inactivation reported to CMS within seven (7) days; (X172) TASK 2 - ENTRANCE ACTIVITIES All transplant program surveys must include these entrance activities: All Transplant Program surveys are unannounced; The entire survey team should enter the hospital together; With the team present, the survey team lead will ask to speak to the Hospital Administrator o r the designated person in charge; All team members must display their surveyor identification badge during on- site surveys. The entrance conference should begin within 20 -30 minutes, or as soon as possible, upon entry to the facility. Activities conducted during the entrance conference include the following: Introduction of surveyors; The Components of the Standard Transplant Program Survey Protocol TASK # Task 1 Pre-survey: Off -site Preparation 2 Entrance Activities 3 Sample Selection 4 Tracer for Selected Patients and Living Donors including Observations of Care, Interviews and Medical Record Review 5 Administrative Review 6 Personnel Record Review (If Indicated) 7 Pre-exit 8 Exit Conference 9 Post Survey Activities Explain that the purpose of the survey is to determine the program's compliance with the Medicare CoPs for each transplant program being surveyed (list the programs). Discuss the projected survey schedule for the survey including the projected time and date for the exit conference. Confirm that the primary transplant surgeon and primary transplant physician are consistent with the information on file with the SA; (if inf ormation is not consistent, the surveyor must confirm that the OPTN was notified of the change.). Determine whether living donor transplants are performed at the transplant program . Determine whether the hospital uses any contracted services that also ser ve that transplant program. As applicable, determine whether adult transplants are performed under a pediatric program or pediatric transplants are performed under an adult program (to enable sample selection). Explain that interviews may be conducted wit h transplant program staff and patients as indicated. Request that surveyors be granted access to medical records as indicated. Identify the areas in the hospital or on the hospital campus where transplant services including inpatient transplant care and outpatient care, are provided. Request that the program create the following lists described below. The surveyor should observe the development of these lists. Lists Requested During Entrance Conference: 1. Each transplant program's complete current active waiting list including the following information: name, date of listing, wait list status, medical record number, age (at time of transplant), race and gender of each patient; 2. List of all patients (to include their medical record number) removed from the waiting list within the past 12 months of each program for reasons other than death or transplant; 3. List of all persons evaluated within the last 12 months by each transplant program who were not placed on the waiting list. (Do not include persons that are currently in the evaluation process). The list should include patient name and medical record number. 4. List of all of the transplants performed within the last 18 months (including patient name, medical record number, age (at time of transplant), and date of transplant); 5. If applicable, list of all of the living donors who were evaluated during the past 12 months denoting those potential donors who proceeded to donation. Include name, medical record number, the organ(s) donated and date of donation within the designated time period; 6. List of all of the transplant recipients and living donors who are currently inpatient(s) and the location of the patient(s) within the hospital; Request Program Administration Materials 1. Request an organizational chart of the transplant program, which includes the chains of command and how the transplant program fits within the overall hospital structure; 2. Request a log of any and all reported adverse events for the past 12 months (extend to 24 months if no reports found in the 12 month log). This list will be used to sele ct the patient sample for adverse events. 3. Inform the administrator that policies, procedures, personnel, and QAPI manuals will be requested, as needed, for review . TASK 3 - SAMPLE SELECTION Refer to the lists requested during the entrance conference (1 -6) above and the adverse event log requested during the entrance conference to accomplish the patient sample selection. The goal is to choose, within the sample, a representation of the overal l transplant program services and patients. Seven categories that must be included in the patient sample; the chart below reflects the minimum number of patients that must be selected randomly for each area. Patients Transplanted <6 months ago Patients Transplanted 7-18 months ago Patients on Current Waitlist Patient Adverse Events Patients Removed from Waitlist Patients Removed from the waiting list within the past 12 months for reasons other than death or transplant Patients Evaluated but not Waitlisted Living Donors (if applicable) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 If a program performs both adult and pediatric transplants under one approval, there must be at least one patient from each age group selected for each category. If there were no patients transplanted within the last six months, add two additional patients to the Patients on Cu rrent Waitlist category sample. Select waitlist patients based upon the time they have been on the waitlist. Review a patient who has been on the list three years o r more and a patient who has been on the list less than 3 years. TASK 4 - TRACER FOR PATIENT AND LIVING DONORS Once the patient sample has been selected, the surveyors will then trace the patient experience from evaluation through discharge planning for those receiving transplants. For those patients who are currently on the waitlist, the surveyor will trace their experience from evaluation until the most current stage in the phases of transplant. During the tracer activities, the surveyor will spend no more than two hours reviewing each medical record to get an overview of the patient experience and identify thos e multidisciplinary team members that must be interviewed based upon findings from the medical record review. During the record review, the surveyor should verify that the plan established for the patient to achieve successful transplantation was individualized for the needs of the par ticular patient. I. Patient Experience- Evaluation Each patient experience should begin with an evaluation regardless of whether they are or are not ultimately placed on the waitlist. This evaluation must include multidisc iplinary involvement to identify all the patient characteristics and attributes to determine suitability for transplant. Multidisciplinary involvement means that each member of the patient care team (designated by the facility) must complete an evaluation of the potential recipient. The evaluation process may appear differently based on the individualized needs of the patient during the evaluation. When reviewing the medical record, identify the members of the multidisciplinary team that have been involve d in the care of the patient, identify recommendations, and review for follow -up on these recommendations. Please note that there are specifics in the evaluation that must occur such as medical evaluation, psychological evaluation, and the informed consent process. Completion of the informed consent process may be documented in a single document or throughout the record. The surveyor must confirm, through medical record documentation, that the facility ensured that the patient has made an informed decisio n to proceed with the process of transplantation. The process includes informing the candidate of medical and psychosocial risks, the right to refuse transplantation, donor risk factors, alternative treatments, potential costs outside insurance, the surgi cal procedure, and the transplant program's patient outcomes. A surgical consent for the actual transplantation surgery does not confirm the informed consent process. II. Patient Experience- Patient Selection (Waitlist Sample) The medical record must inc lude the rationale for the decision to place the patient on the waitlist. This rationale should be consistent with the written criteria of the facility. If not, the record must include rationale for waitlisting outside the criteria. (Evaluated but not Li sted Sample) In instances where a patient was evaluated but not placed on the waiting list, there should be documentation of the reason for not placing the patient on the waitlist and whether the patient was informed of the decision not to place him/her on the wait list based on the evaluation. If there is evidence that the potential candidate meets the wait list criteria but was not listed, there must be documentation by the facility as to why they were not placed on the waitlist. III. Patient Experience - Waitlist Management (Waitlist and Transplant Recipient Sample) For those patients who were placed on the transplant waitlist, there should be evidence of periodic follow up during their time on the wait list. There are no set requirements for the freq uency of the periodic follow -up or any requirement that the follow -up must be conducted by the transplant program. However, based on the identified needs of the patient and the policy of the transplant program the transplant program would see the patients periodically or maintain on -going communication with the patient's community health care providers. While the patient is on the waitlist, under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 482.94(a)(1) there should be evidence that any recommendations made by a multidisciplinary team me mber are being followed up by the team member and that any referrals to multidisciplinary team member are promptly addressed. Please note that the length of time on the waitlist may vary for each individual. IV. Patient Experience- Transplantation (Transplant Recipient Sample) For those patients who received a transplant, the medical record must include evidence that prior to the transplant: an ABO verification occurred (blood type and other vital Data (OVD)); there is evidence that the facility dis cussed any potential risks associated with the organ being offered and whether the patient agrees to accept the organ; and there is a documented surgical consent for the transplant procedure. It is expected that all members of the multidisciplinary team w ill continually assess the patient and provide any recommendations which would facilitate discharge. Recommendations may or may not require ongoing involvement with the team member based upon the individual patient's needs and any complications which may prolong the hospital stay. V. Patient Experience- Living Donation (Living Donor Sample) The record must include documentation of the evaluation process conducted with the living donor. The evaluation includes a final recommendation and justification as to whether the living donor/ is suitable for donation. The donor is notified as to suitability and rationale for the decision. The medical record must include evidence that the Independent Living Donor Advocate (ILDA)/TEAM was made available to the liv ing donor, to include the name and contact information of the ILDA. Every living donor must be assigned and have an interview with the ILDA or ILDA team prior to the initiation of the evaluation and throughout the donation phase. VI. Patient Experience- Patient Care Once the medical record has been reviewed for each sampled patient, the survey should move to the clinical areas where inpatient and outpatient care is provided. During the time the surveyor spends in the clinical areas, all available inpa tient and outpatients receiving transplant care on the unit or in the clinic are interviewed. If an interviewed patient was part of the original sample, then compare the information received from the patient with the information received in his/her medica l record. . If an interviewed patient is not part of the original sample, the medical record must be reviewed and the information compared to the information provided by the patient regarding his/her patient experience. General observations should be made during the time the surveyor spends in the clinical areas. Any concerns, whether related to specifically transplant CoPs or hospital CoPs, should be investigated further as warranted. Interviews with transplant staff in general should be conducted pursuant to medical record findings, patient interview findings, or specific observations. Interviews with both patients and staff should be conducted one -on-one with the surveyor when possible. It is acceptable for surveyors to conduct telephone interviews w ith key personnel in the event that they are unavailable during the survey. TASK 5 - QUALITY ASSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENT Review of Quality Assessment and Performance Review the medical records for the adverse events sample. The surveyor should examine the record for events leading up to the event. In addition, the QAPI materials associated with the adverse event should be reviewed for each sampled event. Review the Q API materials to look for the analysis of the event, actions taken following the event, and safeguards to prevent future occurrence. Review the data the program is tracking associated with the adverse event to ensure there is no recurrence. If the program has effectively addressed all the activities outlined above, the surveyor concludes from the sample review that the program does do QAPI activities reactively. However the QAPI director must be interviewed to determine the proactive activities of the QA PI program and the integration of the transplant program QAPI and the hospital QAPI program. TASK 6 - PERSONNEL RECORD REVIEW If concerns regarding staff education, qualifications, and training for staff providing transplant care are identified during observations or interviews, the surveyor may request applicable personnel records. For staff new to transplant, or who appear unfamiliar with the care of transplant patients, the surveyor validates the presence of orientation education and/or additional t raining to ensure that the staff are prepared to care for patients undergoing transplants. TASK 7 - PRE -EXIT CONFERENCE Survey Team Discussion Meeting Each team member will review and share the evidence he/she has gathered with the other team members. The team should determine any non- compliance and document any such findings including making photocopies of medical records or other documents needed to support the non- compliance. Make all copies prior to the exit conference. TASK 8 - EXIT CONFERENCE A single exit conference will be held regardless of the number of programs surveyed. At the beginning of the exit conference, each participant will identify him/herself. During the conference: Identify each deficiency found and restate those deficiencies being cited; Provide an opportunity for the transplant program to present additional information that may not have been presented during the survey (except for deficiencies cited from the at 482.80); Outline the next steps o The hospital administration wil l recei ve a written form (the CMS -2567 Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction) from the State Survey Agency that describes the survey findings and cited noncompliance de ficiencies. Findings for all programs that were surveyed together will be included on one CMS -2567. Each deficiency will be identified by the applicable program. Following receipt of the CMS -2567 (generally within 10 days of the exit conference), the transplant program must submit a plan of correction within 10 days of receipt of t he CMS - 2567 for each individually cited deficiency. Explain that all findings are preliminary and subject to administrative review. Although it is CMS' general policy to conduct an exit conference, be aware of situations that would justify refusal to continue an exit conference. For example, if the hospital administrator or transplant program administrator is represented by counsel , surveyors may refuse to continue the conference if the lawyer tries to turn it into an evidentiary hearing. If the program records the conference, the surveyor should request a copy for the survey file. TASK 9 - POST SURVEY ACTIVITIES Following the survey, the surveyor will complete the Organ Transplant Hospital Worksheet, Form CMS -670 (Sur vey Team Composition and Workload), and the CMS -2567 forms. Form CMS- 670 and the CMS -2567 are entered into the Automated Survey Process Environment System (ASPEN). There will be a single CMS -2567 form prepared, even if the survey included multiple transplant programs within a hospital. Each regulation that is cited must specify the applicable transplant program to which it applies. ASPEN has been modified to include this information. Once the CMS -2567 is finalized, the SA is responsible for sending the CMS -2567 to the hospital administrator and requesting a plan of correction (note the plan of correction may address more than one type of transplant program). Once an acceptable plan of correction has been submitted, the SA is responsible for scheduling the follow -up visit (if applicable) to ensure that any cited deficiencies have been corrected. III. Alternate Survey Protocol: Pediatric Heart Program (Rev. -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) Survey Protocol for Pediatric Heart Transplant Programs Operating Jointly with Associated Heart Transplant Program Under \u00a7482.76(d), instead of meeting all conditions of participation at \u00a7482.72 through \u00a7482.74 and \u00a7482.80 through \u00a7482.104, a heart transplant program that w ishes to provide transplantation services to pediatric heart patients may be approved to perform pediatric heart transplants by meeting the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 criteria in section 4009(b) (Pub.L.100- 203). The pediatric heart transpl ant program is responsible for providing evidence that: 1. The pediatric transplant program is operated jointly with another Medicare - approved facility. This joint operation may occur pursuant to a structured affiliation between the two hospitals or pursuant to a written agreement; 2. The surgeons who perform the heart transplants at the pediatric hospital are credentialed for cardiac surgery at both hospitals under the unified program; The QAPI programs must be shared by both hospitals and include review, analysis and recommendations for the pediatric transplants; Collaboration between both QAPI programs would consist of reviewing and evaluating the need for any changes between the jointly operated entities; and 3. Demonstrates to the satisfaction of CMS that it is able to provide the specialized facilities, services, and personnel that are required by pediatric heart transplant patients. TASK 1 - PRE -SURVEY PREPARATION OFF -SITE None required: TASK 2 - ENTRANCE ACTIVITIES Meet with the program administrator upon entrance and explain the purpose of the review. Provide an estimated timeframe for the survey and list the materials that will be reviewed. Requested Items for Review: Lists of Transplant Candidates and Patients: Log of the transplants performed including name and date of transplant for both the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated heart transplant program within the past three years; Program Administration: Policies, Procedures, Personnel, and QAPI 1. A copy of the joint operat ing agreement between the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated heart transplant program that is jointly operating this program; 2. An organizational chart of the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated program; 3. Credentials for cardiac transplant surgeons and physicians and confirmation they are permitted to practice at both facilities; and 4. Log of any reported adverse events (by the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated program) and corresponding document ation of the investigation and analysis of those events for the past 12 months. TASK 3 - SAMPLE SELECTION Using the lists of recipients of the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated heart transplant program, select the samples as early in the survey as possible so that the transplant program has time to obtain all the records requested. At any time, the surveyor may add additional records to any sample based on observations or intervi ews. Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients Sample Selection Based on the list of transplants done over, but not prior to, the past three years by the pediatric heart transplant program, select a minimum of five or if less than 5 transplants have been com pleted, all available records pediatric heart transplant recipients and request their medical records for review. TASK 4 - REVIEW OF TRANSPLANT PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS Task 2 describes the number of transplant patient medical records that must be selected for review both in the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated program. Surveyors will focus the review of medical records on the following sections: 1. Evaluations: psychosocial and medical; 2. Patient selection criteria; 3. Informed c onsent documentation; 4. Blood type, ABO and UNOS ID verification; 5. Operative reports; 6. Progress Notes for patient care, staff activities, informed consent discussions, etc.; 7. Multidisciplinary care plan and patient teaching tools for involvement of all key personnel; 8. Discharge planning; and 9. Follow -up (outpatient) chart or section of record. Surveyors will make photocopies of any documents needed to support survey findings. If requested, the surveyor will make the hospital a copy of all items photocopied. The photocopies must include the recipient's anonymous code, the type of document and the date and time the photocopy was made, for example, \"Patient #3, Progress Notes, 2- 25-07, 1400.\" TASK 5 - STAFF INTERVIEW Follow standard protocol for interviews. TASK 6 - PERSONNEL RECORD REVIEW Follow standard protocol for personnel file review. TASK 7 - ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW Operating Agreement Review the operating agreement b etween the pediatric heart transplant program and the associated heart transplant program to ensure that it meets the requirements of the guidelines (Tags X024 through X026). Refer to the QAPI Administrative Review in the standard protocol. Ensure that t he QAPI program is a single, unified program between the jointly operating hospitals. TASK 8 - PRE -EXIT CONFERENCE Review and analyze all the information collected from any observations, interviews, and record reviews to determine whether or not the program meets the requirement of 42 CFR 482.76(d) for approval of a pediatric heart transplant program. The team identifies any non -compliance that may prohibit the alternative approval. Refer to the standa rd survey protocol for discussion by the survey team, determining compliance, and ensuring that any non-compliance is adequately supported. If the program is not in compliance with the requirements of 42 CFR 482.76(d), then the pediatric heart transplant program cannot be approved under the alternate approval requirements. TASK 9 - EXIT CONFERENCE Refer to the standard protocol for the exit conference. However, pediatric heart programs under the alternate approval are only required to meet tags X024 through X026. Therefore, the exit conference will be limited to findings on these requirements. TASK 10 - POST SURVEY ACTIVITIES Refer to standard survey protocol. Approval of a pediatric heart transplant program does not require a separate form CMS -2567, and may be listed with other types of transplant programs surveyed simultaneously. X-001 (Rev. Requirements for Transplant Programs . A transplant program located within a hospital that has a Medicare provider agreement must meet the conditions of participation specified in \u00a7\u00a7482.72 through 482.104 in order to be granted approval from CMS to provide transplant services. (a) Unless specified otherwise, the conditions of participation at \u00a7\u00a7482.72 through 482.104 apply to heart, heart -lung, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas centers. (b) In addition to meeting the conditions of participation specified in \u00a7\u00a7482.72 through 482.104, a transplant program must also meet the conditions of participation specified in \u00a7482.1 through \u00a7482.57, except for \u00a7482.15. Guideline \u00a7482.68 As noted by their definitions in \u00a7482.70, pancreas and intestine programs are approved as a part of their associated \"parent\" appr oval (kidney and liver, , respectively) and therefore these programs are reviewed as a component of the survey of the associated parent transplant program. If any Condition of Participation is found to be out of compliance, then this Condition must also be cited as being out of compliance. Gene ral Requirements for Transplant Program s X-002 (Rev. OPTN Membership. A transplant program must be located in a transplant hospital that is a member of, and abides by the rules and requirements of, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) established and operated in accordance with section 372 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 274). The term \"rules and requirements of the OPTN\" means those rules and requirements approved by the Secretary pursuant to \u00a7121.4 of this title. No hospital that provides transplantation services shall be deemed to be out of compliance wit h section 1138(a)(1)(B) of the Act or this section unless the Secretary has given the OPTN formal notice that he or she approves the decision to exclude the transplant hospital from the OPTN and also has notified the transplant hospital in writing. Guidel ine \u00a7482.72 The hospital in which the organ transplant program(s) is a part of must be a member of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) prior to Medicare approval and for as long as it is approved. In the event that the Secretary issues formal notice of his approval of a recommendation for the exclusion of a program from the OPTN, the associated Medicare approval will be terminated pursuant to non- compliance with 42 CFR Participation: Notification to CMS (a) A transplant program must notify CMS immediately of any significant changes related to the hospital 's transplant program or changes that could affect its compliance with the conditions of participation. Instances in which CMS should receive information for follow -up, as appropriate, include, but are not limited to: Guideline \u00a7482.74 For purpose of this condition and its relative tags at X -012, X -014 and X-015, \"immediately\" means within seven business days of when the transplant program becomes aware that either a change will occur or has occurred. X-012 (Rev. in key staff members of the transplant team, such as a change in the individual the transplant program designated to the OPTN as the program 's \"primary transplant surgeon\" Termination of an agreement between the hospital in which the transplant program is located and an OPO for the recovery and receipt of organs as required by section 482.100; and Guideline \u00a7482.74(a)(2) Outside an approved waiver process, a hospital may not terminate its agreement with its designated OPO. Via a waiver request submitted to CMS, a hospital may request to work with an OPO in another OPO Donation Service Area. Should the waiver be granted, a hospital may then terminate the agreement with its designated OPO. See also 42 CFR 486.308. The transplant program must notify the applicable State Survey Agency (SA) of its hospital's intention to seek a waiver of its designated OPO. The hospital must submit the actual request for an OPO waiver to the Center for Medicare within CMS Central Office in Baltimore. Once the waiver is granted or denied, the hospital must provide a copy of the decisional document to the SA. X-015 the transplant program . \u00a7482.74(b) Upon receiving notification of significant changes, CMS will follow up with the transplant program as appropriate, including (but not limited to): (1) Requesting additional information; (2) Analyzing the information; or (3) Conducting an on -site review. Guideline \u00a7482.74(a)(3) Upon notification of a program's plan for inactivation, CMS may request additional information from the program pertaining to the reason for the inactivation and the communications that have occurred to notify and assist the patients on the program's waitlist in association with the inactivation period. Per \u00a7488.61(e) Transpla nt Program Inactivity, \"A transplant program may remain inactive and retain its Medicare approval for a period not to exceed 12 months.\" Program inactivity does not preclude a program from survey for compliance with the Conditions of Participation during t he inactivation period. If a program's inactivity period exceeds 12 months, it must reactivate, voluntarily withdraw from Medicare participation, or be subject to termination of its Medicare approval. X-031 (Rev. Participation: Data Submission, Clinical Experience, and Outcome Requirements for Initial Approval of Transplant Programs . Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and \u00a7488.61 of this chapter, transplant program s must meet all data submission, clinical experience, and outcome requirements to be granted initial approval by CMS. Guideline \u00a7482.80 The Standards of this Condition are evaluated by the surveyor off -site, prior to the survey. The determination of compliance or non- compliance will be communicated to the program at the time of the survey entrance conference. Since this finding is based upon data submitted to the OPTN prior to the survey, the program may not submit any additional or corrected data, during the survey, to chang e the compliance determination. X-032 (Rev. Submission. No later than 90 days after the due date established by the OPTN, a transplant program must submit to the OPTN at least 95 percent of required data on all transplants (deceased and living donor) it has performed. Required data submissions include, but are not limited to, submission of the appropriate OPTN forms for transplant candidate registration, transplant recipient registration and follow -up and living donor registration and follow -up. Guideline \u00a7482.80 (a) The determination of compliance or non- compliance with this Standard is made prior to the on- site survey. The determination is shared with the program at the time of the survey entrance conference. Since this finding is based upon data submitted to the OPTN prior to the survey, the program may not submit any additional or corrected data, during the survey, to change the compliance determination. X-033 (Rev. To be considered for initial approval, an organ -specific transplant program must generally perform 10 transplants over a 12- month period. Guideline \u00a7482.80(b) Generally means in all instances except where specifically exempted by the regulations. The f ollowing types of programs are subject to a clinical experience requirement of having performed generally 10 transplants over a 12- month period for initial approval: Adult Heart -Only Adult Lung -Only Adult Liver Adult Intestinal and/or Multivisceral For purposes of the clinical experience requirement, multi -organ transplantation will be included as separate transplants for each organ. For example, a combined liver -kidney transplant will account for one liver transplant and one kidney transplant. X-035 (Rev. requirements. CMS will review outcomes for all transplants performed at a program , including outcomes for living donor transplants, if applicable. CMS will review adult and pediatric outcomes separately when a program requests Medicare approval to perform both adult and pediatric transplants. (1) CMS will compare each transplant progr am's observed number of patient deaths and graft failures 1 -year post -transplant to the program 's expected number of patient deaths and graft failures 1 -year post -transplant using the data contained in the most recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Reci pients (SRTR) program - specific report. (2) CMS will not consider a program 's patient and graft survival rates to be acceptable if: (i) A center's observed patient survival rate or observed graft survival rate is lower than its expected patient survival r ate or expected graft survival rate; and (ii) All three of the following thresholds are crossed over: (A) The one -sided p- value is less than 0.05, (B) The number of observed events (patient deaths or graft failures) minus the number of expected events is g reater than 3, and (C) The number of observed events divided by the number of expected events is greater than 1.85. (d) Exceptions (1) A heart- lung transplant program is not required to comply with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for heart -lung transplants performed at the program . (2) An intestine transplant program is not required to comply with the outcome performance requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for intestine, combined liver -intestine or multivisceral transplants performed at the program . (3) A pancreas transplant program is not required to comply with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for pancreas transplants performed at the program . (4) A program that is requesting initial Medicare approval to perform ped iatric transplants is not required to comply with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section prior to its request for approval as a pediatric transplant program . Guideline \u00a7\u00a7482.80(c) and (d)(1) -(4) The program types subject to this requirement and not exempted include: Adult Kidney -Only Adult Heart -Only Adult Lung -Only Adult Liver -Only Pediatric Kidney -Only (Includes only 1 -year graft survival) Pediatric Heart -Only Pediatric Lung -Only Pediatric Liver kidney transplant program that is not Medicare -approved on the effective date of this rule is required to perform at least 3 transplants over a 12 - month period prior to its request for initial approval Transplant Center Process Requirements X-051 (Rev. Participation: Patient and Living Donor Selection. The transplant program must use written patient selection criteria in determining a patient's suitability for placement on the waiting list or a patient's suitability for transplantation. If a program performs living donor transplants, the program also must use written donor s election criteria in determining the suitability of candidates for donation. Guideline \u00a7482.90 Transplant programs are required to develop their own hospital -approved selection criteria to determine suitability for organ transplantation and living donation. There must be evidence that the written selection criteria are followed for the selection of transplant candidates to be placed on the transplant waitlist and, if applicable, potential living donors. Any changes to the hospital -approved, written selection criteria are approved according to the hospital policy approval process. The selection crit eria (medical, psychosocial, financial, etc.) must clearly define all the factors that are considered in determining suitability for transplantation or living donation. These criteria may not exclude groups or individuals without documentation supporting t he exclusionary foundation(s). X-053 to placement on the program 's waiting list, a prospective transplant candidate must receive a psychosocial evaluation, if possible . Guideline \u00a7482.90(a)(1) An evaluation of each candidate's psychosocial status must be conducted in all situations in which it is possible to do so in order to determine suitability for transplantation and/or identify resources that potentially will be needed for the safe care an d discharge of the patient post -discharge. The transplant program must conduct and document the psychosocial evaluation performed on a potential recipient before their placement on the waitlist. The only exception for not completing the psychosocial eval uation prior to placement on the waitlist would be an emergent situation where the need for transplant is imminent or the patient is very young. Justification for not conducting a psychosocial evaluation prior to a potential recipient's placement on the w aitlist must be documented in the medical record. While the transplant program has flexibility in the selection of a specific psychosocial evaluation tool(s) to be used, it is expected that the psychosocial evaluation would be conducted by transplant pr ogram personnel who have the professional qualifications to administer psychosocial evaluations, make resultant assessments and make recommendations to the multidisciplinary team. Evaluations should include, at a minimum, the following: Social, personal, housing, vocational, financial, and environmental supports; Coping abilities and strategies; Understanding of the risks and benefits of transplantation; Ability to adhere to a therapeutic regimen; and Ongoing psychological issues that may impact the success or failure of organ transplantation. X-054 (Rev. a transplant program places a transplant candidate on its waiting list, the candidate's medical record mu st contain documentation that the candidate's blood type has been determined. X-055 a patient is placed on a program 's waiting list or is selected to receive a transplant, the center must document in the patient's medical record the patient selection criteria used. Guideline \u00a7482.90(a)(3) The potential recipient medical record must contain documentation that the multidisciplinary team considered all evaluatio ns in the context of the hospital -approved selection criteria. If the potential recipient does not meet the hospital- approved selection criteria, but was placed on the waiting list anyway, the exception justification for listing must be clearly documented in the potential recipient's medical record. X-056 transplant program must provide a copy of its patient selection criteria to a transplant patient, or a dialysis facility, as requested by a patient or a dialysis facility. Guideline 482.90(a)(4) Interviews with transplant patients and dialysis facilities should confirm the receipt of the written selection criteria upon request. X-058 (Rev. Donor Selection. The living donor selection criteria must be consistent with the general principles of medical ethics. Transplant program s must: (1) Ensure that a prospective living donor receives a medical and psychosocial evaluation prior to donation, Guideline \u00a7482.90(b)(1) Each prospective living donor must receive a medical and psychosocial assessment prior to donation to ensure that any risks to the donor are identified and to assist in the determination of appropriateness for donation. It is expected that a psychosocial evaluation for living donors would address the following: Social, personal, housing, vocational, financial, and environmental supports; Coping abilities and strategies; Understanding of the risks and benefits of donation; Ability to adhe re to a therapeutic regimen; and Mental health history, including substance and alcohol use or abuse and how it may impact the success or failure of organ transplantation. X-071 (Rev. Participation: Organ Recovery and Receipt. Transplant program s must have written protocols for validation of donor -recipient blood type and other vital data for the deceased organ recovery, organ receipt, and living donor organ tr ansplantation processes. The transplanting surgeon at the transplant program is responsible for ensuring the medical suitability of donor organs for transplantation into the intended recipient . X-073 After an organ arrives at a transplant program , prior to transplantation, the transplanting surgeon and another licensed healthcare professional m ust verify that the donor's blood type and other vital data are compatible with transplantation of the intended recipient . Guideline \u00a7482.92(a) The verification occurs once the organ arrives in the operating room, prior to transplantation. The second person verifying the blood type (and other data) may be any licensed health care professional who is in the operating room at the time of the verific ation. The transplant program should identify in its protocols which categories of health care professional(s) may do the second verification. If the transplant surgeon is already scrubbed and gloved, he/she may do a visual verification and sign that verification in the medical record at the end of the surgery. The time of `the visual verification should be entered into the recipient's record by the second person at the time it is done and should state that the verification was visual by the transplant s urgeon. The second person will sign their verification at that time. After the case is concluded, the surgeon confirms his visual verification in the record by either co -signing the verification entry by the second person or writing a separate progress n ote which chronicles the verification (including times). The reference to \"other vital data\" is considered to be the Donor Transplantation. If a program performs living donor transplants, the transplanting surgeon and another licensed healthcare professional at the center must verify that the living donor's blood type and other vital data are compatible with transplantation of the intended recipient immediately before the removal of the donor organ(s) and, if applicable, prior to the removal of the recipient 's organ(s). Guideline \u00a7482.92(b) See above discussion at X073 regarding surgeon a nd other health care professional verification. Verification that the living donor blood type and other vital data are compatible with the intended recipient must occur onsite, after the donor arrival in the operating room but prior to the induction of g eneral anesthesia. The verification must be completed by the transplanting surgeon and another licensed healthcare professional. The program should identify in its protocols which categories of health care professional(s) may do the second verification. Verification by the transplant surgeon and another licensed healthcare professional must be documented. The documentation must include signatures and corresponding date and time of the verification. To ensure that verification is completed immediately bef ore the removal of the donor organ(s), documentation must include the time of donor arrival into the operating room, time of organ verification and time general anesthesia was started. Verification of correct organ for the correct recipient and verificati on that the blood type and other vital data are compatible with the potential recipient must occur immediately before the removal of the living donor organ(s). If the donor organ recovery surgeon is also the transplanting surgeon, verification prior to removal of the living donor organ(s) and verification prior to transplantation must occur separately. X-081 Participation: Patient and Living Donor Management. Transplant programs must have written patient management policies for the transplant and discharge phases of transplantation. If a transplant program performs living donor transpl ants, the program also must have written donor management policies for the donor evaluation, donation, and discharge phases of living organ donation. Guideline \u00a7482.94 Transplantation and Living Donor Care Phases are generally defined as: Transplantation Care Phases: Transplant Phase: Begins when the potential transplant candidate is evaluated for transplantation and continues through completion of the transplantation surgery. Discharge Phase: Begins at the transplant candidate admission t o the hospital and continues through to his/her discharge from the inpatient stay. Living Donor Care Phases: Evaluation Phase: Begins from first presentation by the potential donor until the time he/she enters the OR for the donation surgery. Donation Pha se: Begins from the time the potential donor enters the OR for the donation surgery until the donor is discharged from the inpatient surgery stay. Discharge Phase: Begins at admission to the hospital and continues through the donor's discharge from the inpatient stay. Some transplant programs perform living donor services under arrangement with other hospitals. In these cases, the transplant program retains all responsibility for compliance with management of the living donor. The transplant program must communicate the donor management activities that are required as a part of the living donor organ recovery to the hospital under the arrangement and ensure that the activities are completed appropriately. X-082 Living Donor Care. The transplant program 's patient and donor management policies must ensure that: (1) Each transplant patient is under the care of a multidisciplinary patient care team coordinated by a physician throughout the transplant and discharge phases of transplantation; and (2) If a program performs living donor transplants, each living donor is under the care of a multidisciplinary patient care team coordinated by a p hysician throughout the donor evaluation, donation, and discharge phases of donation. Guideline \u00a7482.94(a) In those instances where it is determined that the transplant recipient or living donor is not receiving or did not receive the services needed as identified by assessment, consultation and the multidisciplinary plan of care, the resulting deficiency should be cited at this regulatory cite. X-083 (Rev. List Management. Transplant program s must keep their waiting lists up to date on an ongoing basis, including: X-085 patients fro m the program 's waiting list if a patient receives a transplant or dies, or if there is any other reason the patient should no longer be on a program 's waiting list; and Guideline \u00a7482.94(b) (2) There may be instances where a recently transplanted recipient is placed back on the wait list. In these instances, documentation must include the original date of removal and the date of the new placement on the list. X-086 (Rev. OPTN no later than 24 hours after a patient's removal from the program 's waiting list. Guideline \u00a7482.94(b) (3) For the purpose of this Standard, the 24 hour period to notify the OPTN of a patient's removal begins at the time of the patient's death; transplantation; the patient's decision to be removed from the list; or notification of death or transplantation from an outside source (family or another transplant hospital if the patient was listed with more than one transplant program). The OPTN is considered to have been automatically notified once the patient is removed from the waitlist in UNET by the transplant p rogram. No additional notification is required by the transplant program to the OPTN. X-087 (Rev. ) \u00a7482.94(c) Standard: Patient Records. Transplant program s must maintain up- to-date and accurate patient management records for each patient who receives an evaluation for placement on a program 's waiting list and who is admitted for organ transplantation. X-088 (Rev. 200, -21-20) \u00a7482.94(c) (1) For each patient who receives an evaluation for placement on a program 's waiting list, the program must document in the patient's record that the patient (and in the case of a kidney patient, the patient's usual dialysis facility) has been informed of his or her transplant status, including notification of: (i) The patient's placement on the program 's waiting list; (ii) The program 's decision not to place the patient on its waiting list; or (iii) The program 's inability to make a determination regarding the patient's placement on its waiting list because further clinical testing or documentation is needed. X-089 (Rev. If a patient on the waiting list is removed from the waiting list for any reason other than death or transplantation, the transplant program must document in the patient's record that the patient (and in the case of a kidney patient, the patient's usu al dialysis facility) was notified no later than 10 days after the date the patient was removed from the waiting list. Guideline \u00a7482.94(c) (2) Transplant programs determine the most appropriate method for communication with the patient and the dialysis f acility. The communication must be evidenced by documentation in the medical record. X-090 (Rev. In the case of patients admitted for organ transplants, transplant program s must maintain written records of: (i) Multidisciplinary patient care planning during the transplant period; and Guideline \u00a7482.94(c) (3) A multidisciplinary care plan includes ongoing assessments to identify any new patient needs and/or to dete rmine if any currently identified patient's needs have changed. A multidisciplinary team must be identified for each patient at the time the evaluation for wait listing begins. This multidisciplinary team participates in the patient care planning from ev aluation through transplantation. At the time of the initial evaluation, each member of the team participates in the evaluation of the patient. It may not be necessary for all team disciplines to see the patient again until transplant is imminent unless there are identified needs. Following the transplant, each discipline must, as appropriate: 1) reassess the recipient following the surgery; 2) see the recipient as often as indicated by identified issues; and 3) see the recipient prior to discharge. X-092 Services. The transplant program must make social services available, furnished by qualified social workers, to transplant patients, living d onors, and their families.... Guideline \u00a7482.94(d) Making social services available means that if a social service need for a recipient/donor/family is identified at any point from evaluation through discharge, the program must provide a qualified social worker to address the need/issue and documentation in the medical record should confirm the social worker intervention. X-093 (Rev. qualified social worker is an individual who meets licensing requirements in the State in which he or she practices; and (1) Completed a course of study with specialization in clinical practice and holds a master's degree from a graduate school of social work accredited by the Council on Social Work Education; or (2) Is working as a social worker in a transplant program as of effective date of this final rule and has served for at least 2 years as a social worker, 1 year of which was in a transplantation program, and has established a consultative relationship with a social worker who is qualified under (d)(1) of this pa ragraph. Guideline \u00a7\u00a7482.94(d)(cont'd) and (d)(1) -(2). Non-MSW employees functioning as a transplant program social worker prior to the June 28, 2007, which is the effective date of the final rule, \"Medicare Program; Hospital Conditions of Participation: Requirements for Approval and Re -Approval of Transplant Centers To Perform Organ Transplants\" (72 FR 15198, Mar. 30, 2007), must have a consultative relationship with an MSW who meets the requirements of \u00a7482.94(d)(1). The purpose of the consultative rel ationship is for the MSW to advise, support and often guide a social worker in their position. A consultative relationship generally would include: Meetings between the MSW and the non -MSW on a routine or re -occurring basis; and Evidence that the MSW is available and responsive for ad hoc consultation with the non- MSW employee. Services. Transplant program s must make nutritional assessments and diet counseling services, furnished by a qualified dietitian, available to all transplant patients and living donors. A qualified dietitian is an individual who meets practice requirements in the State in which he or she practices and is a registered dietitian with the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Guideline \u00a7482.94(e) Transplant programs must have a process in place to ensure that a qualified dietician is available to provide nutritional assessments or diet counseling to all transplant patients and living donors that require such services. Nutritional services include consultation, assessment, intervention(s) and education. If a need is identified by any member of the multidisciplinary team, and a request is made for nutritional services, but the requested services are not provided due to the lack of nutritional staff available in the hospital, a deficiency would be cited. X-099 (Rev. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Transplant program s must develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive, data -driven QAPI program designed to monitor and evaluate performance of all transplantation services, including services provided under contract or arrangement. Guideline \u00a7482.96 The transp lant center develops its transplant program -specific quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program either individually or collaboratively with the transplant hospital QAPI program and functions as a component of the associated hospital QAPI program required at 42 CFR \u00a7482.21. There should be evidence of communication between the two entities to ensure that both entities are actively involved in QAPI activities which address the specific requirements of the transplant CoPs. If the transplan t program has a separate QAPI program, it must provide evidence that it is interrelated with the hospital QAPI plan. A comprehensive transplant QAPI program evaluates and monitors performance of transplantation services across every aspect of the program from the evaluation of a potential recipient/donor candidate through his/her discharge from the hospital. A comprehensive QAPI program approach embraces a broad, multidisciplinary, system - wide perspective. It encompasses all aspects of clinical care and all relevant hospital services and includes input from a broad representation of staff at all levels, including individuals with authority to make decisions about the transplant program's policies, practices and resources. It continuously monitors, evaluates and improves all organ transplantation services for transplant candidates, transplant recipients, potential living donors across all phases of transplantation and living donation, including transplant services provided under contract or arrangement.. A data- driven transplant QAPI program continually uses data to guide quality assessment and performance improvement activities with respect to all transplantation services. The program proactively, systematically and at regular specified intervals: Identifies, implements, assesses and re -assesses the data to be collected for each measure and other information needed to monitor and evaluate performance of transplantation services in all areas; Collects, records and reviews the data for accuracy; Analyzes the data and uses the data/analyses to assess the program's performance; and Uses the results of its analyses to monitor, evaluate and improve the quality and safety of all transplantation/donation services on an ongoing basis. X-100 QAPI Program. The transplant program 's QAPI program must use objective measures to evaluate the center's performance with regard to transplantation activities and outcomes. Outcome measures may include, but are not limited to, patient and donor selection criteria, accuracy of the waiting list in accordance with the OPTN waiting list requirements, accuracy of donor and recipient matching, patient and donor management, techniques for organ recovery, consent practices, patient education, patient satisfaction, and patient rights.... Guideline \u00a7482.96(a) This standard requires transplant QAPI programs to identify , implement, assess and re - assess objective measures to evaluate and improve both their transplantation outcomes as well as the quality, safety and performance of their transplantation activities, a cross all phases of transplant and living donation. Transplantation and living donor care - including but not limited to the potential areas for measurement listed in this standard - involve multiple phases, activities and potential outcomes, each with various aspects that may be amenable to objective measurement. Objective measures can mean t hat a transplant program will select some measures for routine monitoring on an ongoing basis; others will be identified and implemented in order to address, evaluate and monitor a particular problem or opportunity for improvement. Each transplant QAPI pr ogram should identify and implement multiple objective measures that are relevant and meaningful for evaluating its own performance with regard to both transplantation activities and outcomes to: Collect and analyze data to assess its baseline performance and to track performance on the selected measures over time; and Use the information gained to evaluate and improve performance and to ensure that improv ements are sustained over time. Measuring an outcome means measuring the health status of a patient r esulting from health care. For example, the SRTR reports contain a number of objective outcome measures useful for performance monitoring and improvement (such as patient and graft survival), but additional patient outcomes not reported by the SRTR may als o be important for a program to measure (for example, rates of specific intra - and post - operative complications for transplant recipients and living donors). In addition to measuring relevant outcomes, other types of clinical quality measures are needed to evaluate transplantation activities. Each program must critically examine its own services and performance to determine which activities (and which aspects of the activity) within each phase of transplantation or donation should be evaluated and monitor ed using objective measures. X-101 (Rev. transplant program must take actions that result in performance improvements and track performance to ensure that improvements are sustained. Guideline \u00a7482.96(a)(cont'd ) The transplant program must use what it learns from monitoring the objective measures described under Tag X100 to identify and implement actions to improve its performance. The program should review the available evidence, if any, for particular performance improvement strategies and implement activities that are most likely to be effective in addressing the specific factors that are contributing to the program's performance. If successful, performance will need to be monitored over time to verify that improvements are sustained. If not, the program will need to re -evaluate, determine an appropriate alternative course of action, and track performance. X-102 (Rev. Events. A transplant program must establish and implement written policies to address and document adverse events that occur during any phase of an organ transplantation case. (1) The policies must address, at a minimum, the process for the identification, reporting, analysis, and prevention of adverse events. Guideline \u00a7482.96(b)(1) An adverse event is defined at 42 CFR \u00a7482.70 as \"an untoward, undesirable, and usually unanticipated event that causes death or serious injury, or the risk thereof.\" The facility policies should include: A clear definition of what the transplant program considers an adverse event incorporating the CMS regulatory definition; The procedures for internal reporting of adverse events in all phases of transplant recipient or living donor care within the hospital; The process(es) used for analyzing adverse events in the transplant program; The process for developing, evaluating and tracking actions to prevent recurrence; and The required timeframe for reporting, investigating and analyzing adverse events . The policies should also address any external adverse event reporting obligations, such as: External reporting of events to the OPTN, ESRD Network, etc. as required and applicable; Reporting to other federal or state agencies as required by law (e.g., for suspected medical device -related deaths or serious injury, transmission of an infectious disease, etc.); and Reporting to the OPO if a transplant recipient infection is related to an infectious disease present in a transplanted organ to ensure that ot her recipients who received organs from the same donor can be notified. X-103 (Rev. The transplant program must conduct a thorough analysis of and document any adverse event... . Guideline \u00a7482.96(b) (2) A thorough analysis is a planned, systematic investigative process that considers all of the phases of transplantation/living donation in identifying the causes of and factors contributing to an adverse event. The scope and depth of analysis, as well as t he extent of multi- disciplinary involvement, may be scaled in proportion to the scope and severity of the harm experienced and/or the risk of harm involved. A thorough analysis would include, but is not limited to: A description of the key facts of the event in enough detail so that one can clearly understand the facts and chronology of what occurred, the severity of the event, and how the potential recipient or potential living donor was affected; A review of whether similar events have occurred in the past; All of the information needed to identify factors that may have caused or contributed to the outcome, directly or indirectly; Analysis of the information to identify actual and potential vulnerabilities and opportunities to reduce risks and improve care; Use of the results of the analysis to design improvement actions to address the factors that caused or contributed to the event's occurrence, including factors and processes; and Specific plan for implementing, evaluating and monitoring improvement a ctions (timeframes, responsible parties, measurement strategy to assess effectiveness, etc.). must utilize the analysis to effect changes in the transplant program 's policies and practices to prevent repeat incidents. X-109 (Rev. Participation: The transplant program must ensure that all individuals who provide services and/or supervise services at the program including individuals furnishing services under contract or arrangement, are qualified to provide or supervise such services. X-110 (Rev. a Transplant Program . The transplant program must be under the general supervision of a qualified transplant surgeon or a qualified physician -director. The director of a transplant program need not serve full -time and may also serve as a program 's primary transplant surgeon or transplant physician in accordance with \u00a7482.98(b)... . Guideline \u00a7482.98(a) The designated director of a transplant program must be either a transplant surgeon credentialed in the hospital for transplant surgeries or a qualified physician. Qualified physician means a physic ian that is credentialed in the hospital to provide transplant medical services for the specific organ program type. Serving as the director on a less than full time basis means that the director may continue his/her clinical responsibilities in addition to his/her role in general supervision of the program. See Tags X -111 through X -114 for the responsibilities of the director of a transplant program . X-111 director is responsible for planning, organizing, conducting, and directing the transplant program and must devote sufficient time to carry out these responsibilities, which include but are not limited to the following: X-112 Coordinating with the hospital in which the transplant program is located to ensure adequate training of nursing staff and clinical transplant coordinators in the care of transplant patients and living donors. Guideline \u00a7482.98(a) (1) Care of transplant patients and living donors is unique and complex, requiring clarification of roles and responsibilities and appropriate training for nursing staff and clinical transplant coordinators. The director of the transplant center is responsible for coordination with the hospital's Nursing Department to determine the appropriate depth and type of orientation and training that will be provided to nursing staff that care for the transplant patients. Evidence of coordination should include: 1. The transplant director has participated in the development of training and orientation plans for nurses who work or will work with transplant recipients and living donors; 2. The transpl ant director offers ongoing training opportunities for nursing staff; and 3. The transplant director provides feedback to the Nursing Department on the clinical competency of those nursing staff working with transplant recipients or living donors. X-115 (Rev. Surgeon and Physician. The transplant program must identify to the OPTN a primary transplant surgeon and a transplant physician with the appropriate training and experience to provide transplantation services, who are immediately available to provide transplantation services when an organ is offered for transplantation. X-118 (Rev. Transplant Coordinator. The transplant program must have a clinical transplant coordinator to ensure the continuity of care of patients and living donors during the pre -transplant, transplant, and discharge phases of transplantation and the donor evaluation, donation, and discharge phases of donation... . Guideline \u00a7482.98(c) Clinicians other than nurses may also serve in the role of the clinical coordinator. The expectations of the coordinator, as defined by the individual transplant program, will determine the particular professional clinical background required for the coordinator. However, regardless of the clinical background of the coordinator, the most critical factor of this Standard is the requirement for experience and knowledge. Clinical coordinators must have experience working with transplant patients or living donors in any setting. X-120 (Rev. transplant coordinator's responsibilities must include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Ensuring the coordination o f the clinical aspects of transplant patient and living donor care; and (2) Acting as a liaison between a kidney transplant program and dialysis facilities, as applicable. Guideline \u00a7 \u00a7482.98(c)(cont'd) and (c)(1)- (2) Clinical transplant coordinators are important links between transplant recipients/living donors and the transplant program and dialysis facilities, as applicable. A transplant coordinator is often the patient's primary contact for communication and direction on transplantation or donation related activities. This communication involves patients, families, medical team, organ procurement organizations, donor hospitals, and all other members of the transplant team. The primary purpose of the coordinator is to ensure that all the multidisciplinary needs of the patients are met in all phases of transplantation or donation. The coordinator is also the primary contact with the ESRD facility in the case of kidney transplant patients. Evidence of the collaboration between the coordinator and the ESRD includes wait list changes; laboratory results; and changes in medical condition. Living Donor Advocate or Independent Living Donor Advocate Team. The transplant program that performs living donor transplantation must identify either an independent living donor advocate or an independent living donor advocate team to ensure protection of the rights of living donors and pr ospective living donors. Guideline \u00a7482.98 (d) Every potential living donor must be assigned to and have an interview with an Independent Living Donor Advocate (ILDA) or an Independent Living Donor Advocate Team (ILDAT) prior to the initiation of the eva luation and continuing to and through the discharge phase. X122 independent living donor advocate or independent living donor advocate team must not be involved in transplantation activities on a routine basis. Guideline \u00a7482.98(d)(1) Because of the conflict of interest which would be created for an advocate to perform any transplant activities, even on an infrequent basis, the ILDA or ILDAT must not be associated with the transplant program in any capacity even on a temporary or intermittent basis. X-123 (Rev. independent living donor advocate or independent living donor advocate team must demonstrate: (i) Knowledge of living organ donation, transplantation, medical ethics, and informed consent; and (ii) Understanding of the potential impact of family and other external pressures on the prospective living donor's decision whether to donate and the ability to discuss these issues with the donor. Guideline \u00a7482.98(d)(2) The advocate/team must be able to provide evidence of successful training which addressed the topics listed in the standard. Interviews with living donor s confirm that the advocate/team provided information concerning: The organ donation process; The requirements of the informed consent process; The immediate and long -term expectations following donation; The immediate and long -term risks of donation; The expected outcomes for the recipient; The potential financial responsibilities related to donation; and Any alternative treatment(s) for the potential transplant recipient, if available. The living donor medical record should fully chronical the interactions between the advocate or advocate team and donor candidate including the assessed level of understanding by the donor candidate during interactions. X-124 (Rev. 200, The independent living donor advocate or independent living donor advocate team is responsible for: (i) Representing and advising the donor; (ii) Protecting and promoting the interests of th e donor; and (iii) Respecting the donor's decision and ensuring that the donor's decision is informed and free from coercion. Guideline \u00a7482.98(d)(3) The ILDA or ILDAT are primarily the representatives of the donor candidate. There may be instances where the advocate/team advises the potential donor candidate where to seek additional information, encourages the candidate to ask pertinent questions, encourages the candidate to have additional discussions with the family or advises the donor candidate to delay the decision to donate at any point without reprisal if they choose. However, the advocate/team does not advise as to a decision on donation. All discussions and meetings between the potential donor candidate and the advocate/team must center upon the needs, interests and choices of the potential donor. These discussions must not address the needs of the potential recipient. If at any point in the process the donor changes his/her mind and decides not to donate, the advocate must support and intercede on behalf of the donor candidate if indicated. X-125 (Rev. The transplant program must identify a multi -disciplinary transplant team and describe the responsibilities of each member of the team. The team must be composed of individuals with the appropriate qualifications, training, and experience in the relevant areas of medicine, nursin g, nutrition, social services, transplant coordination, and pharmacology. Guideline \u00a7482.98(e) While it is desirable that each multidisciplinary team include a pharmacist member, there may be other disciplines on the team who may also be qualified to provide pharmacology services. Examples of individuals other than a pharmacist who are also qualifi ed to provide pharmacology services on the team, are a physician, advanced nurse practitioner , or physician assistant. X-126 Resource Commitment. The transplant program must demonstrate availability of expertise in internal medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, immunology, infectious disease control, pathology, radiology, blood banking, and patient education as related to the provision of transplantati on services. X-139 Participation: Organ Procurement. The transplant program must ensure that the hospital in which it operates has a written agreement for the receipt of organs with an OPO designated by the Secretary that identifies specific responsibilities for the hospital and for the OPO with respect to organ recovery and organ allocation. Guideline \u00a7482.100 The hospital in which the transplant program is located must have a written agreement with their designated OPO for cooperation with the OPO in the recovery of donor organs. The agreement must meet the requirements of \u00a7482.45. X-149 Participation: Patient and Living Donor Rights. In addition to meeting the condition of participation \"Patients rights\" requirements at \u00a7482.13, the transplant program must protect and promote each transplant patient's and living donor's rights. Consent for Transplant Patients. Transplant program s must implement written transplant patient informed consent policies that inform each patient of: Guideline \u00a7482.102(a) As a standard of practice for any type of surgical procedure, a hospital has the obligation to provide a potential transplant recipient with sufficient information to make an informed decision. Informed consent is a process that requires a health care provider to disclose all available information to a potential recipient who makes the voluntary choice to accept or refuse treatment. Th e transplant physician must ensure each potential recipient that is considered for organ transplantation has full knowledge and understanding of the purpose, possible risks, benefits and other options available to them. The signed hospital surgical conse nt form alone is not considered evidence that the informed consent process for transplant patients was completed to include the requirements of \u00a7482.102(a)(1) -(8). transplant program -specific outcomes, from the most recent SRTR program -specific report, including (but not limited to) the transplant program 's observed and expected 1 -year patient and graft survival, and national 1- year patient and graft survival ; Guideline \u00a7482.102(a) (5) Prior to undergoing an evaluation, the transplant program informs the potential recipient of the location of the SRTR website and explains how the website may be used by the potential recipient to periodically review the transplant data pertaining to the program's performance. The potential recipient should also be provided with a contact at the transplant program whom he/she may contact for any additional questions or assistance with the use of the website. This information allows the patient to make an informed decision about listing with the program. X-158 (Rev. The fact that if his or her transplant is not provided in a Medicare - approved transplant program it could affect the transplant recipient's ability to have his or her immuno -suppressive drugs paid for under Medicare Part B. consent for living donors. Transplant program s must implement written living donor informed consent policies that inform the prospective living donor of all aspects of, and potential outcomes from, living donation. Transplant program s must ensure that the prospective living donor is fully informed about the following: Guideline \u00a7482.102(b) As a standard of practice for any type of surgical procedure, a hospital has the obligation to provide patients with sufficient information to make an informed decision. Informed consent is a process that requires a health care provider to disclose appropriate information to a patient which allows them to make the voluntary choice to accept or refuse treatment. The physician must ensure each patient that is considered for organ donation has full knowledge and understanding of the purpose, possible risks, benefits and other options available to the recipient. Tran splant programs must develop and implement informed consent policies for living donors that delineate the information to be shared and the responsibilities of any transplant staff member that will consult with the patient. The signed informed consent form and/or hospital surgical informed consent form alone is not considered evidence that the informed consent process for the prospective living donor is complete. Transplant programs must provide documentation that ensures the living donor candidate was inf ormed of subparagraphs (1) through (8) of this The fact that communication between the donor and the transplant program will remain confidential, in accordance with the requirements at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164. Guideline \u00a7482.102(b) (1) Requirements in 45 CFR part 160 and subparts A and E of part 164 relate to the privacy of individually identifiable health information and prevention from fraud and abuse related to the provision of or payment for health care for the purpose of protecting the privacy of health information. Requirements in subpart C of 45 CFR part 164 relate to the security standards for the protection of electronic protected health information, notification procedures in the case of breach of unsecured protected health information, and the privacy, uses, and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. Accordingly, any information shared between the living donor candidate and the transplant program may not be shared with the potential recipient and/or the ir families except as permitted by 45 CFR parts 160 and 164. X-163 The availability of alternative treatments for the transplant recipient ; Guideline \u00a7482.102(b)(4) A potential donor must be made aware of all alternative treatments that are available for the potential recipient which may include the possibility of a deceased donor transplant. X-165 (Rev. 200, Issued: (6) The national and transplant program -specific outcomes for recipients , and the national and program -specific outcomes for living donors, as data are available; Guideline \u00a7482.102(b) (6) Prior to undergoing an evaluation, the transplant program informs the potential donor of the location of the SRTR website and explains how the website may be used by the potential recipient to periodically review the transplant data pertaining to the program performance. The po tential recipient should also be provided with a contact at the transplant program whom he/she may contact for any additional questions or assistance with the use of the website. There are currently no national or center specific outcomes for living donor s calculated by the SRTR. X-168 The fact that if a transplant is not provided in a Medicare -approved transplant program it could affect the transplant recipient 's ability to have his or her immuno -suppressive drugs paid for under Medicare Part B. patients. Transplant program s must notify pa tients placed on the program 's waiting list of information about the program that could impact the patient's ability to receive a transplant should an organ become available, and what procedures are in place to ensure the availability of a transplant team. X-170 (Rev. A transplant program served by a single transplant surgeon or physician must inform patients placed on the program 's waiting list of: (i) The potential u navailability of the transplant surgeon or physician; and (ii) Whether the center has a mechanism to provide an alternate transplant surgeon or transplant physician. Guideline \u00a7482.102(c) (1) The absence of a transplant surgeon or physician may impact a transplant candidate's ability to receive a transplant if an organ becomes available. Transplant programs must disclose the possibility of such an event as well as whether the program has a process to provide an alternate transplant surgeon or transplant physician in such an event prior to the potential recipient undergoing evaluation. Any changes that occur following the informed consent process must also be shared with each candidate on the waiting list. X-171 (Rev. At least 30 days before a program 's Medicare approval is terminated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the center must: (i) Inform patients on the program 's waiting list and provide assistance to waiting list patients who choose to transfer to the waiting list of another Medicare -approved transplant program without loss of time accrued on the waiting list; and (ii) Inform Medicare recipient s on the program 's waiting list that Medicare will no longer pay for transplants performed at the program after the effective date of the program 's termination of approval. X-172 (Rev. As soon as possible prior to a transplant program 's voluntary inactivation, the program must inform patients on the program 's waiting list and, as directed by the Secretary, provide assistance to waiting list patients who choose to transfer to the wai ting list of another Medicare -approved transplant program without loss of time accrued on the waiting list. Guideline \u00a7482.102(c) (3) A transplant program may choose to inactivate for reasons including: the inability to meet clinical experience (volume) requirements; temporarily lacking medical or surgical coverage; and a significant change in operations that require a temporary cessation of transplant activity. Transplant programs that intend to become inactive must notify the patient group that will be affected by the inactivity. If the determination is made to inactivate a transplant program or a component of a transplant program, a ll potential recipients on the waiting list would be unable to receive an organ offer during the time period of inactivity. As such, transplant programs must notify all affected patients of the upcoming inactivation.. It must also inform the potential rec ipients of the expected time period of inactivation, if known, and options for waitlisted patients to transfer to another facility. Waiting list patients should receive notification of the program's voluntary inactivation at least 30 days prior to the pla nned inactivation date. Transplant programs determine the method of communication with the potential recipients and the program must be able to document the communication. If a transplant candidate elects to be transferred to a another transplant program, the inactivating transplant program must facilitate communication and help with the exchange of information. The transplant program should coordinate with the receiving facility to place the patient on their waiting list. X-184 (Rev. Additional Requirements Program s. X-185 renal disease (ESRD) services.

The transplant program 's emergency preparedness plans must be included in the hospital's emergency plans. All of the Medicare -approved transplant programs are located within certified hospitals and, as part of the hospital, must be included in the hospital's emergency preparedness plans. The transplant program needs to be involved in the hospital's risk assessment because there may be risks to the transplant program that others in the hospital may not be aware of or appreciate. However, most of the risk assessment of the hospital and transplant program would be the same since the transplant program is located within the hospital. Therefore a separate risk assessment would be unnecessary and overly burdensome. Survey Procedures Verify the transplant program has emergency preparedness policies and procedures.

The emergency plan must address the type of hospitals with which the OPO has agreements and the types of services that the OPO would be able to provide in an emergency. The emergency plan must also identify which staff would assume specific roles in another's absence through succession planning and delegations of authority. Succession planning is a process for identifying and developing staff with the potential to fill key business leadership positions in the company. Succession planning increases the availability of experienced and capable employees that are prepared to assume these roles as they become necessary. During times of emergency, facilities must have internal employees who are capable of assuming various critical roles in the event that current staff and leaders are not available. At a minimum, facilities should designate a qua lified person who is authorized in writing to act in the absence of the administrator or person legally responsible for the operations of the facility. In addition to the facility - and community -based risk assessment, continuity of operations planning gen erally considers elements such as: essential personnel, essential functions, critical resources, vital records and IT data protection, alternate facility identification and location, and financial resources. Facilities are encouraged to refer to and utili ze resources from various agencies such as FEMA and ASPR when developing strategies for ensuring continuity of operations.

A transplant program must develop and maintain mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant program , the hospital in which the transplant program is operated, and the OPO designated by the Secretary, unless the hospital has an approved waiver to work with another OPO, during an emergency. Interpretive Guidelines for \u00a7482.78(b). Trans plant programs must be involved in the development of mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the hospital, transplant program and the designated OPO during emergencies. All transplant programs are located within Medicare participating hospitals. Any hospital that furnishes organ transplants and other medical and surgical specialty services for the care of transplant patients is defined as a transplant hospital (42 CFR 482.70). Therefore, trans plant programs must meet all hospital CoPs at \u00a7\u00a7482.1 through 482.57 (as set forth at \u00a7482.68(b)), and the hospitals in which they are located must meet the provisions of \u00a7 482.15, however, a transplant program is not individually responsible for the emerg ency preparedness requirements in \u00a7482.15. The hospital in which a transplant program is located (i.e., a transplant hospital) would be responsible for ensuring that the transplant program is involved in the development of an emergency preparedness program. This requirement does not oblige a transplant program that agrees to care for another transplant program 's patients during an emergency to put those patients on its waiting lists. We anticipate that most emergencies would be of short duration and that the transplant program that is affected by an emergency will resume its normal operations within a short period of time. However, if a transplant program does arrange for its patients to be transferred to another transplant program during an emergency, both transplant program would need to determine what care would be provided to the transferring patients, including whether and under what circumstances the patients from the transferring transplant program would be added to the receiving transplant program 's waiting lists. Survey Procedures Verify the transplant program has developed mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant program , the hospital in which the transplant program is operated, and the designated OPO.
