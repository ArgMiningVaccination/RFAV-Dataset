Methods We designed and carried out a systemat ic litterature search in relevant electronic databases for systematic reviews and primary resarch. The search was finalised in October 2015. Two researchers independetly reviewed all references for potentia l relevance based on our inclusion criteria. Results Our serach identified 3280 unique references. We judged that 124 of them are potentially relevant to the question of closed loop medication in hospitals. We judged 45 review articles as potentially relevant, we sorted them into the following categories: - Decision support and order set (10) - Electronic prescribing(11) - Electronicc alert systems (3) - Tracking systems and barcode (4) - Several interventions to reduce errors (8) - Generally about health information technology (9) We judged 79 primary studies as potentially relevant, we sorted them into the following categories: - Decision support, reminders and order set (20) - Electronic prescribing (29) - Electronic alert systems (17) - Automated dispensing and barcode (8) - Medication reconsilliation (3) - Closed loop medication (2) Title: Closed loop medication - Systematic literature search with organised references ------------------------------------------ Type of publication: Systematic reference list A systematic reference list is the result of a search for relevant literature according to a specific search strategy. The references resulting from the search are then grouped and presented with their abstracts. ------------------------------------------ Does not answer everything: - No critical evaluation of study quality - No analysis or synthesis of the studies - No recommendations ------------------------------------------ Publisher: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services ------------------------------------------ Updated: Last search for studies: October 2015. 4 Innhold Innhold HOVEDFUNN 2 KEY MESSAGES INNHOLD Styrker av s\u00f8k 10 Resultat av sorteringen 10 S o r t e r i n g a v o v e r s i k t s a r t i k l e n e 1 1 S o r t e r i n g a v p r i m \u00e6 r s t u d i e n e 1 5 VEDLEGG 1 S\u00d8KESTRATEGIER 23 VEDLEGG 2 OVERSIKTSARTIKLER 27 V E D L E G G 3 P R I M \u00c6 R S T U D I E R 4 9 5 Forord Forord Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) - Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination abstraktet det var Elektronisk foreskrivning 11 Elektroniske alarmsystemer (alerts) 3 abstrakt 2.

The effects of computer-aided clinical de- cision support systems on antibiotic prescribing in Pharm Pract 2015;23:24. Abstract: Focal points * A systematic review of international literatu re on clinical deci- sion support was directed at antibiotic prescrib ing in secondary care. * Clinical decision sup- port improved antibiotic prescribing in hospital s by reducing duration of treatment, defined daily dose (DDD) requirements and curtailing co sts allocated to hospit al antibiotics expendi- ture. * Clinical decision support systems have the potential to optimise antibiotic prescribing in secondary care though more detail of opti mal system arrangements are needed. Introduc- tion Antibiotic selection is a dynamically co mplex therapeutic process because of the poten- tial long-term impact on antimicrobial resistan ce, patient safety, quality of care and cost1. Health information technology in the form of clinical decision support (CDS) presents as a promising solution to optimise antibiotic pres cribing across different health care settings. CDS systems come in many formats including computerised physician order entry (CPOE), electronic prescribing (e-Rx) and computerised clinical decision support system (CDSS). There is however little consensus on the configuration of CDS or on the ultimate outcomes from its use. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the international lit-erature published on CDS systems used to suppo rt the use of antibiotics in secondary care and to perform meta-synthesis on data outputs. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in November 2014 using eight electronic databases including MEDLINE, EM- BASE, PUBMED, Web of Science, CINAHL, Co chrane Library, HMIC, and PsycINFO. The search was conducted using a strategy based upon combinations of the following terms: (Electronic prescribing) OR (Clinical decision support) AND (antibiotic or antibacterial or antimicrobial) AND (hospital or secondary care or inpatient). The reference sections of all retrieved articles were also searched for additi onal relevant articles. Editorials, letters, case reports and non-English language articles were excluded. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators independently (with conflicts resolved by a third researcher) and consisted of data on study design, quality, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes and main findings. Results Thirty-eight studies were identified matching the inclusion criteria, which described a wide range of quantitative and qualitative assessments of CDS outcomes. Meta-synthesis of sub-groups highlighted 23 studies describing the four most common out- come measures used, which were the appropriaten ess of antibiotic treatment (11 studies - all showing more appropriate prescribing), defined daily doses (DDDs - 7 studies), cost of anti- biotic treatment (6 studies - all demonstrated reduced costs) and duration of antibiotic treat- ment (4 studies - all showed reduced therapy du ration). Five of these studies examined more than one outcome measure. Of the 7 studies quantifying DDDs prescribed, six demonstrated a reduction in DDDs but one indicated that use of CDS resulted in increased antibiotic DDD use. The remaining 15 studies identified in th e review described a diverse range of 14 other outcome measures (e.g. length of patient stay, compliance with guidelines). Discussion Clini- cal decision support systems have been shown in this systematic review to have the potential to improve antibiotic prescribing in second ary care as measured by robust outcome measures. However, given that the majority of studies identified in this review were con- ducted in the USA or Australia, it is difficult to generalise the results to a UK setting. Further studies should to be conducted in order to evaluate patient specific outcomes such as mortal- ity and also to determine which clinical decision support system characteristics are likely to maximise prescriber adoption and satisfaction. 28 Brown CL, Slight SP, Husband AK, Watson NW, Bates DW. A narrative review of medi- cation-related clinical decision support . J Gen Intern Med 2015;30:S86-S87. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medi cation errors cause substantial patient harm and can occur at any stage of the medication use proc ess. Health information technology, such as Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) an d Clinical Decision Support (CDS), may be used to reduce the likelihood of these errors. Medication-related CDS provides automated guidance and support to clinicians at the point of prescribing. CDS can provide drug-drug in- teraction (DDI) checks, drug allergy checks, do sing guidance, duplicate therapy checks and formulary decision support. CDS has been associated with a range of benefits such as im- proved patient safety, improved standards of ca re and reduction in heal thcare costs. We re- viewed the recent literature around medication-related CDS functionality and reflected upon the issues pertinent to its future development. METHODS: We searched for papers in Med- line Ovid and Embase Ovid, using MeSH terms and key words including 'clinical decision support', 'decision support systems' and 'compu terized physician order entry' with a date range of 2007 to 2014. Specific MeSH terms an d keywords relevant to five basic CDS func- tionalities were also used. We included all pu blication types, all types of CPOE systems and all clinical settings. Only English language pape rs were selected for fu rther review. Reference lists, papers from world leading experts and the 'other citing articles' function were also used to identify additional articles. Titles and abstracts were initially screened to identify relevant papers, followed by the full text by one reviewer. A total of 896 articles were identified across each of the five areas, of which 184 were included. RESULTS: The success of CDS very much depends on users finding alerts valuable and acting on the information received. CDS func- tionality is continually evolving in response to users' needs. Assigning a severity level to DDI alerts has been shown to improve alert accept ance. Additionally, improving alert specificity and severity was found to be an important fact or for realising the benefits of DDI alerts. Maintenance of accurate records and ability to carry out cross-sensitivity checks are key to the production of appropriate drug-allergy checks . Patient specific parameters should be in- corporated into the decision-making algorith ms to improve the accuracy and appropriate- ness of drug-dosage alerts; furthermore, suggest ed doses should be appropriately rounded to facilitate administration and include order sentences sequenced to reflect those most com- monly used. How the CDS system is configured is important for drug-duplication checks and to avoid potentially exposing the patient to toxic drug levels. The knowledge base(s) for drug-formulary alerts must be accurate and reviewed regularly in order to pr oduce relevant alerts and encourage formulary adherence. Finally, co nsideration of human factors principles dur- ing the design and implementation of CDS is critical and has been shown to improve system effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: CDS is still undergoing development. The implementation of automation in healthcare has su rged in recent years and this is likely to continue. Moving forward, integration of patient specific para meters into CDS decision-making checks and consideration of human-factors design principles will be central to obtaining the potential benefits of CDS. Such advancements in CDS shou ld enable it to have a much greater impact for improving patient care. Ranji SR, Rennke S, Wachter RM. Computerised provider order entry combined with clinical decision support systems to improve medication safety: a narrative review . BMJ quality & safety 2014;23(9):773-780. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a major cause of morbidity in hospitalised and ambulatory patients. Co mputerised provider order entry (CPOE) com- bined with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are bein g widely implemented with the goal of preventing ADEs, but the effectiveness of these systems remains unclear., METH- ODS: We searched the specialised database Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Net to identify reviews of the effect of CPOE combined with CDSS on ADE rates in inpatient and outpatient settings. We included systematic and narrative reviews published since 2008 and controlled clinical tr ials published since 2012., RESULTS: We in- cluded five systematic reviews, one narrative review and two controlled trials. The existing literature consists mostly of studies of homegrown systems conducted in the inpatient set- ting. CPOE+CDSS was consistently reported to reduce prescribing erro rs, but does not ap- pear to prevent clinical ADEs in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. Implementation of CPOE+CDSS profoundly changes staff workfl ow, and often leads to unintended conse- quences and new safety issues (such as alert fatigue) which limit the system's safety effects., CONCLUSIONS: CPOE+CDSS does not appear to reliably prevent clinical ADEs. Despite 29 more widespread implementation over the past decade, it remains a work in progress.Copy- right Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Li mited.

The Cochrane data- base of systematic reviews 2013;11:CD002894. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Maintaining therapeutic concentrations of drugs with a nar- row therapeutic window is a complex task. Seve ral computer systems have been designed to help doctors determine optimum drug dosage. Sign ificant improvements in health care could be achieved if computer advice improved health outcomes and could be implemented in rou-tine practice in a cost-effective fashion. This is an updated version of an earlier Cochrane sys- tematic review, first published in 2001 an d updated in 2008., OBJECTIVES: To assess whether computerized advice on drug dosage has beneficial effects on patient outcomes com-pared with routine care (emp iric dosing without computer assistance)., SEARCH METH- ODS: The following databases were searched from 1996 to 2012: EPOC Group Spe- cialized Register, Reference search was conducted for the period January 2012 to January 2013; these results were screened by the authors and potentially relevant studies are list ed in Studies Awaiting Classification. The re- view authors also searched reference lists of relevant studies and re lated reviews., SELEC- TION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled tri-als, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses of computerized advice on drug dosage. The participants were he althcare professionals responsible for patient care. The outcomes were any objectively measured change in the health of patients resulting from computerized advice (such as therapeuti c drug control, clinical improvement, adverse reactions)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Two review authors independently ex- tracted data and assessed study quality. We grou ped the results from the included studies by drug used and the effect aimed at for aminoglyco side antibiotics, amitri ptyline, anaesthetics, insulin, anticoagulants, ovarian stimulation, anti-rejection drugs and theophylline. We com-bined the effect sizes to give an overall effect for each subgroup of studies, using a random- effects model. We furthe r grouped studies by type of outcome when appropriate (i.e. no evi- dence of heterogeneity)., MAIN RESULTS: Fort y-six comparisons (from 42 trials) were in- cluded (as compared with 26 comparisons in th e last update) including a wide range of drugs in inpatient and outpatient settings. All were ra ndomized controlled trials except two studies. Interventions usually targeted doctors, although some studies attempted to influence pre- scriptions by pharmacists and nurses. Drugs ev aluated were anticoagulants, insulin, amino- glycoside antibiotics, theophylline, anti-rejection drugs, anaesthetic agents, antidepressants and gonadotropins. Although all studies used reliable outcome measures, their quality was generally low.This update found similar results to the previous update and managed to iden- tify specific therapeutic areas where the comp uterized advice on drug dosage was beneficial compared with routine care:1. it increased ta rget peak serum concentrations (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 1. 13) and the proportion of people with plasma drug concentrations within the therapeutic range after two days (pooled risk ratio (RR) 4.44, 95% CI 1.94 to 10.13) for aminoglycoside anti biotics;2. it led to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants (SMD for percentage of time spent in target international no rmalized ratio +0.19, 95% CI 0. 06 to 0.33) and insulin (SMD for percentage of time in target glucose range: +1.27, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.98);3. it decreased the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.04);4. it events (rate ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94) and tended to decrease bleeding events for anticoagulants although the difference was not significant (rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.08). It tended to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics (nephrotoxicity: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0. 2 to and drugs infections: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40 );5. it tended to reduce the length of time spent in the hospital although the difference was not significant (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.02) and to achieve comparable or better cost -effectiveness ratios than usual care;6. there was no evidence of differences in mortality or other clinical adverse ev ents for insulin (hypo- glycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs antidepressants.For all outcomes, statistical heterogeneity quantifi ed by I(2) statistics was moderate to high., AUTHORS' CON- CLUSIONS: This review update suggests that co mputerized advice for drug dosage has some benefits: it increases the seru m concentrations for aminoglycoside antibiotics and improves 30 the proportion of people for which the plasma drug is within the therapeutic range for ami- noglycoside antibiotics.It leads to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants and insulin. It decreases the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants. It tends to decrease unwa nted effects for aminogly coside antibiotics and anti-rejection drugs, and it significantly decreases thromboembolism events for anticoagu- lants. It tends to reduce the length of hospit al stay compared with routine care while compa- rable or better cost-effectivene ss ratios were achieved. However, there was no evidence that decision support had an effect on mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypo- glycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that some decision support technical features (such as its integra- tion into a computer physician order entry system ) or aspects of organization of care (such as the setting) could optimize the effect of computerized advice.Taking into account the high risk of bias of, and high heterogeneity betwee n, studies, these results must be interpreted with caution.

Clinical decision support systems to improve utilization of thrombop rophylaxis: a review of the literature and experience with implementation of a computerized physician order entry program . Hospital practice (1 995) 2012;40(3):27-39. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A literature review was conducted of studies investigating the effectiveness of paper- and computer-based cl inical decision support systems (CDSS) used with or without educational programs designed to increase the use of venous thromboembo-lism (VTE) prophylaxis., METHODS: Medline was searched on August 9, 2010, without lim- its on publication year, but with restrictions to English-language articles only. The search terms used of studies regarding the effects of CDSS on VTE pr ophylaxis rates were included. Studies were included if > 1 post-implementation outcome wa s measured, such as rates of VTE, rates of prophylaxis prescribing, or guideline-adheren ce measures., RESULTS: evaluating paper-based different strategies, including risk -assessment forms with prophy- laxis recommendations, standard order sets, and preprinted sticker reminders on patient notes. Paper-based systems consistently improved prophylaxis rates; however, in most stud- ies, there was still room for improvement. Furthermore, the effect of paper-based CDSS on VTE rates was not conclusively established. St udies evaluating computer-based systems used approaches including risk-assessment models in tegrated in the computerized physician or- der entry system, with or without alerts, and automatic reminders on operating schedules., CONCLUSION: Computerized systems are associat ed with substantial improvements in the prescribing of appropriate prophylaxis and reduct ions in VTE events, particularly in medical patients. More robust systems can be established with computer-based rather than paper- based CDSS. A drawback of computerized system s is that some hospitals may not have ade- quate information technology system resources. Chan AJ, Chan J, Cafazzo JA, Rossos PG, Tripp T, Shojania K, et al. Order sets in health care: a systematic review of their effects . Int J Technol Assess Health Care 2012;28(3):235-240. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Order sets are widely used in hospitals to enter diagnosis and treatment orders. To determine the effectivene ss of order sets in improving guideline adher- ence, treatment outcomes, processes of care, e fficiency, and cost, we conducted a systematic review of the literature., METHODS: A comprehe nsive literature search was performed in various databases for studies published between January 1, 1990, and April 18, 2009. A total of eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. No randomized controlled trials were found., RE- SULTS: Outcomes of the included studies were summarized qualitatively due to variations in study population, intervention type, and outc ome measures. There were no important incon- sistencies between the results reported by st udies involving different types of order sets. While the studies generally suggested positive ou tcomes, they were typically of low quality, with simple before-after designs and other methodological limitations., CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of order sets remain eminently plausi ble, but given the paucity of high quality evi- dence, further investigations to formally eval uate the effectiveness of order sets would be highly valuable. 31 Nirantharakumar K, Chen YF, Marshall T, Webber J, Coleman JJ. Clinical decision sup- port systems in the care of inpatients with diabetes in non-critical care setting: systematic review . Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association 2012;29(6):698-708. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computerized clinic al decision support systems have been claimed to reduce prescription errors and impr ove patient care. They may play an important role in the care of hospitalized patients with diabetes., AIM: To collate evidence for the use of clinical decision support systems in improving the care of hospitalized patients with diabetes in a non-critical care setting and to assess th eir effectiveness., METHODS: We searched four databases from 1980 to 2010 without language restrictions. All types of studies other than case reports were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out based on the Centre for Review and Di ssemination guidance. A narrative synthesis was conducted., RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including two cluster randomized controlled trials, eight before-and-after studies and four other descriptive studies. Generally, the quality of the studies was not very high. Ni ne out of 10 studies reported reduction in mean blood glucose or similar measures (patie nt-day-weighted mean blood glucose) during inpatient stay. The reduction using computeriz ed physician order entry system in patient- day-weighted mean blood glucose ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 mmol/l (10.8-15.6 mg/dl). Other beneficial effects during inpa tient stay included reduced us e of sliding scale insulin and greater use of basal-bolus insulin regimen. Only one study found a significant increase in hy-poglycaemic events., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical de cision support systems have been used, of- ten as part of a complex programme, to improve the care of hospitalized patients with diabe- tes. There is some evidence that they may have a beneficial effect, but this needs further con-firmation.Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Authors. Diabetic Medicine \u00a9 2011 Diabetes UK. Stultz JS, Nahata MC. Computerized clinical decision support for medication pre- scribing and utilization in pediatrics . Journal of the American Medical Informatics As- sociation : JAMIA 2012;19(6):942-953. Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accurate and informed prescribing is es- sential to ensure the safe and effective use of medications in pediatric patients. Computerized clinical decision support (CCDS) functionalitie s have been embedded into computerized phy- sician order entry systems with the aim of en suring accurate and in formed medication pre- scribing. Owing to a lack of comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, this review was undertaken to analyze the effect of CCDS impl ementation on medication prescribing and use in pediatrics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using key- words in PubMed to identify research studies with outcomes related to the implementation of medication-related CCDS functionalities., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Various CCDS functionalities have been implemented in pediatric patients leading to different results. Med- ication dosing calculators have decreased ca lculation errors. Alert-based CCDS functionali- ties, such as duplicate therapy and medication allergy checking, may generate excessive alerts. Medication interaction CCDS has been minimally studied in pediatrics. Medication dosing support has decreased adverse drug events , but has also been associated with high override rates. Use of medicati on order sets have improved guideline adherence. Guideline- based treatment recommendations generated by CCDS functionalities have had variable in- fluence on appropriate medication use, with few studies available demonstrating improved patient outcomes due to CCDS use., CONCLUSION: Although certain medication-related CCDS functionalities have shown benefit in medication prescribing for pediatric patients, others have resulted in high override rates and inconsistent or unknown impact on patient care.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To terature on clinical decision-support sys- tems' (CDSS) impact on healthcare practitioner performance and DE-SIGN: Literature search on Medline, Embase, Inspec, Cinahl, Cochrane/Dare and analysis of high-quality systematic reviews (SRs) on CDSS in hospital settings. Two-stage inclusion pro- cedure: (1) selection of publications on predef ined inclusion criteria ; (2) independent meth- 32 odological assessment of preincluded SRs by the 11-item measurement tool, AMSTAR. Inclu- sion of SRs with AMSTAR score 9 or above. SR s were thereafter rated on level of evidence. Each stage was performed by two independent reviewers., RESULTS: 17 out of 35 prein- cluded SRs were of high methodological qual ity and further analyzed . Evidence that CDSS significantly impacted practition er performance was found in 52 out of 91 unique studies of the 16 SRs examining this effect (57%). Only 25 out of 82 unique studies of the 16 SRs re- ported evidence that CDSS positively impact ed patient outcomes (30%)., CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have found any benefits on patient outcomes, though many of these have been too small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinically important effects. There is significant evidence that CDSS can positively im pact healthcare providers' performance with drug ordering and preventive care reminder systems as most clear examples. These out- comes may be explained by the fact that these types of CDSS require a minimum of patient data that are largely available before the advice is (to be) generated: at the time clinicians make the decisions.

The impact of pharmacy computerised clinical decision support on prescribing, clinical and patient outcomes: a systematic review of the literature . The International journal of pharmacy practice 2010;18(2):69-87. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Computerised clinic al decision support systems (CDSSs) are being used increasingly to support evidence-based decision-making by health care profes- sionals. This systematic review evaluated the impact of CDSSs targeting pharmacists on phy- sician prescribing, clinical and patient outc omes. We compared the impact of CDSSs ad- dressing safety concerns (drug interactions, contraindications, dose monitoring and adjust- ment) and those focusing on medicines use in line with guideline recommendations (hereaf- ter referred to as Quality Use of Medicines, or QUM). We also examined the influence of clin- ical setting (institutional versus ambulatory care), system- or user-initiation of CDSS, pre- scribing versus clinical outcom es reported and use of multi-fa ceted versus single interven- tions on and PsycINFO (1990-2009) for adequate and strong quasi-experiments) comparing a CDSS with usua l pharmacy care. Individual study results are reported as positive trends or statistically significant results in the direction of the inten- tions of the CDSS being tested. Studies are aggr egated and compared as the proportions of studies showing the effectiveness of the CDSS on the majority (> or = 50%) of outcomes re-ported in the individual study., KEY FINDINGS: Of 21 eligible studies, 11 addressed safety and 10 QUM issues. CDSSs addressing safety issu es were more effective than CDSSs focusing on QUM (10/11 versus 4/10 stud ies reporting statistically significant improvements in favour of CDSSs on > or = 50% of all outcomes reported; P = 0.01). A number of QUM studies noted the limited contact between pharmacists and p hysicians relating to QUM treatment recom- mendations. More studies demonstrated CDSS benefits on outcomes than clini- cal outcomes (10/10 versus 0/3 studies; P = 0. 002). There were too few studies to assess the impact of system- versus user-initiated CDSS, the influence of setting or multi-faceted inter- ventions on CDSS effectiveness., CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated greater effective- ness of safety-focused compared with QUM-focu sed CDSSs. Medicine safety issues are tradi- tional areas of pharmacy activity. Without good communication between pharmacists and physicians, the full benefits of QUM-focused CDSSs may not be realised. Developments in pharmacy-based CDSSs need to consider these inter-professional relationships as well as computer-system enhancements. Elektronisk foreskrivning Alshahrani F, Marriott J, Cox A. The impact of electronic prescribing systems on the incidence of prescribing errors within in-patients settings: A systematic review . Int J Pharm Pract 2015;23:26-27. Abstract: Focal points * The systematic revie w aimed to evaluate the effects electronic prescribing systems on the incidence of prescrib ing errors among hospitalised patients. * Er- ror analysis indicated that the use of e-prescr ibing systems introduced different types of pre- scribing error. * E-prescribing systems are effe ctive tools in reducing the incidence of pre- scribing errors in hospitalised patients but it is vital that future research adopts more rigor- ous designs and standardised definitions of pr escribing error. Introduction Medication er- rors are a major concern in health care organi sations internationally: these can be associated 33 with dispensing, administration and in particular prescribing. Their occurrence is common within secondary care1 presenting as a signif icant challenge to healthcare providers and a potential threat to patient safety. A recent systematic review of the prevalence, incidence, and nature of prescribing errors in hospital in patients revealed that the median error rates were 7 %of medication orders, 52 errors per 100 admissions, and 24 errors per 1,000 patient days2. Moreover, the errors that do not result in injury to patients can lead to an additional work and/or increase the cost of patients' ca re. Using information technology in prescribing was one of the proposed strategies to reduce prescribing errors and improve patients' safety. The present research focused on the impact of electronic prescribing on the incidence and nature of prescribing errors. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects electronic prescribing systems on the incidence of prescribing errors among hospitalised pa- tients. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in November 2014 using eight electronic databases including CINAHL, EMBASE, ASSIA, HMIC, Psyc INFO, Science library. Two in vestigators conducted data extraction inde- pendently (with conflicts resolved by a third rese archer). Eligible studies included those eval- uating prescribing errors using electronic pr escribing systems conducted in hospital inpa- tient settings, studies evaluating pre and post implementation of e-prescribing system or comparative investigations (handwritten vs e- prescribing) and studies evaluating the num- bers, frequency or rates of prescribing errors arising from medical or non-medical prescrib- ing. The reference sections of all retrieved articl es were also searched for additional relevant articles. Studies detecting prescribing errors on paper-based systems, those conducted in pri- mary care, emergency department, and ambulatory care or aged care settings were excluded. Non-English literature as well as editorial, pe rsonal opinion and letters were also excluded. Results Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion cr iteria. Most studies (85%) were conducted at a single hospital site. Arange of study designs was used to dete ct prescribing errors of which 54% were of a prospective design. 59% (23/39) of the studies examined adult patients, 31% (12/39) involved paediatric patients and 10% (4 /39) screened both populations. The majority of studies (85%, 33/39) demonstrated a signific ant reduction on the incidence of prescribing errors associated with the use of electronic prescribing systems however, 15% (6/39) showed an increased rate or no effects on the incidenc e of prescribing errors. Analysis of the errors encountered in the study outputs, indicated that the use of e-prescribing systems introduced different types of error (e.g. se lection errors from a drop down menu or orders duplication) compared to those found when operating conventional paper based prescribing. Discussion The present study indicated that electronic pr escribing systems generally are effective tools in reducing the incidence of prescribing errors in hospitalised patients thus improving pa- tient safety. This review found that a wide range of electronic prescribing systems with differ- ing features was used in the study outputs. Impo rtantly, a lack of standardised definition and severity scales for prescribing errors was also encountered. ince differe nt study designs (e.g. prospective or retrospective) and methods of error detection (e.g. ob servation or incidence reports) yield different results it is vital that future rese arch adopts more rigorous designs and standardised definition s of prescribing error.

The effectiveness of com- puter system tools on potentially ina ppropriate medications ordered at dis- charge for adults older than 65 years of age: A systematic review . JBI Library of Systematic Reviews 2015;10(13):798-831. Abstract: Background Prescribing potentially inappropriate medications to the elderly leads to adverse health outcomes. The use of computer systems decision making tools has been shown to decrease the incidence of pres cribing potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly; however, these results are ofte n dependent upon other variables, such as pro- vider compliance Objective To examine and synthesize the best available evidence related to the effect of computer systems clinical decision making tools on frequency of ordering poten- tially inappropriate medications at discharge and related unplanned emergency room visits or hospital readmissions in community dwelling patients older than 65 years of age. Inclu- sion criteria Types of participants Adults older than 65 years of age prescribed potentially in- appropriate medications. Types of interventions Electronic or computer based clinical deci- sion making supplement or support related to prescribing of potentially inappropriate medi- cations. Types of outcomes The outcome measures were frequency of ordering potentially in- appropriate medications (PIMs) for patients at discharge, unexpected hospital readmission rate and unexpected emergency room visits of patients who were discharged on PIMs. Types of studies Randomised control trials and quas i-experimental studies. Search strategy The 34 search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies in the English lan- guage from January 2003 through July 2011. A search of PubMED, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition, MasterFILE Premier, Scopus, DARE, Academic Search Premier, Scirus, Embase was conducted. Methodological quality Studies were critically evaluated by two independent reviewers using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Jo- anna Briggs Institute. Data Collection Data were extracted using the standardised data ex- traction instruments from the Joanna Briggs In stitute. Data Synthesis Results from quantita- tive papers were pooled in statistical meta -analysis as appropriate using JBI-MAStARI. Where statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in narrative form. Re- sults A total of five articles, four randomis ed control studies and one quasi-experimental study were included. One study demonstrated that a computerised alert tool along with col- laboration of the health care providers result ed in a statistically significant (p=0.002) de- crease in ordering of PIMs as well as improved medication safety in patients older than 65 years of age. Similarly, a randomised controll ed study demonstrated that computerised phy- sician order entry with decision support significantly (p=0.02) prescribing of PIMs for seniors (odds ratio=0.55, 95% CI=0.34 - 0.89). Another study demonstrated that com- puter-based access to complete drug profiles and alerts reduced the rate of initiation of po- tentially inappropriate prescriptions by 18 % (RR=0.82, 95% CI=0.69-0.98). Yet another study demonstrated that implementation of age specific alerts decreases prescription writing of PIMs from 21.9 prescriptions to 16.8 per 10,000 patients; p value < 0.01. One study demonstrated that age specific alerts reduced prescribing of PIMs from 150.2 to 137.2 pre- scriptions per 10,000 patients; the p value = 0. 75 was not statistically significant. Results from two trials were pooled for meta-analysis, with summary RR = 0.82, and 95%CI (0.76 - 0.88). No studies were found that specifically addressed unexpected hospital readmission or unexpected visits to the emergency room of patients who were discharged on PIMs. Conclu- sions Reduction in prescribing of potentially in appropriate medications occurs when clinical decision making computer support tools, such as drug specific alerts, are available to provid- ers. Implications for practice Computer systems clinical decision making tools have potential for reducing numbers of potentially inappropriate medications prescribed for the community based population older than 65 years of age. Implications for rese arch Future research should continue to explore the effects of computerized cli ical decision making tools on pre-scription writing habits of practitioners for the elderly population. In addition, documenta- tion of unplanned ER visits and unplanned readmission rates needs to be correlated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications.

Computerized pre- scriber order entry in the outpatient oncology Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is an effective treatment in the fight against many cancers. Medication errors in oncology can be particularly serious given the narrow therapeutic window of antineoplastic drugs and their high toxicities. Computerized pre- scriber order entry (cpoe) has co nsistently been shown to redu ce medication errors and ad- verse drug events in various settings, but its use in the oncology setting has not been well es- tablished. To gain a better understanding of th e meaningful use of cpoe systems in the outpa- tient chemotherapy setting, we undertook a sy stematic review of systemic therapy cpoe., METHODS: A province-wide expert panel consisti ng of clinical experts, health information professionals, and specialists in human factor s design provided guidance in the development of the research questions, search terms, databa ses, and inclusion criteria. The systematic re- view was undertaken by a core team consisting of a medical oncologist, nurse, pharmacist, and methodologist. The medline, embase, databases were searched for relevant evidence., RESULTS: The database searches resulted in 5642 hits, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria and were retained. In the oncology setting, cpoe systems generally reduce chemotherapy medication errors; however, specific types of errors increase with the use of cpoe. These systems affect practice both positively and negatively with respect to time, workload, and productivity., CONCLUSIONS: De spite the paucity of oncology-specific re- search, cpoe should be used in outpatient ch emotherapy delivery to reduce chemotherapy- related medication errors. Adopti on by clinicians will be enhanced by cpoe processes that complement current practice and workflow processes. Nuckols TK, Smith-Spangler C, Morton SC, LJ, et al. The ef- fectiveness of computerized order entry at reducing preventable adverse drug 35 events and medication errors in hospital settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis . Systematic reviews 2014;3:56. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Health Technology for Economic and Clin- ical Health (HITECH) Act subsidizes implementation by hospitals of electronic health rec-ords with computerized provider order entr y (CPOE), which may reduce patient injuries caused by medication errors (preventable ad verse drug events, pADEs). Effects on pADEs have not been rigorously quantified, and effects on medication errors ha ve been variable. The objectives of this analysis were to assess the effectiveness of CPOE at reducing pADEs in hos- pital-related settings, and exam ine reasons for heterogeneous e ffects on medication errors., METHODS: Articles were identified using MEDL INE, Cochrane databases, and bibliographies of sy reviews (September 2013). Eligible studies compared CPOE with paper-order entry in acute care hospitals, and examined di- verse pADEs or medication errors. Studies on children or with limited event-detection meth- ods were excluded. Two investigators extracted da ta on events and factors potentially associ- ated with effectiveness. We used random effects models to pool data., RESULTS: Sixteen studies addressing medication errors met pool ing criteria; six also addressed pADEs. Thir- teen studies used pre-post designs. Compared with paper-order entry, CPOE was associated with half as many pADEs (pooled risk ratio (R R)=0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71) and medication errors (RR=0.46, 0.35 to 0.60). rding reasons for hetero geneous effects on med- ication errors, five intervention factors and tw o contextual factors were sufficiently reported to support subgroup analyses or meta-regre ssion. Differences between commercial versus homegrown systems, presence and sophistication of clinical decision support, hospital-wide versus limited implementation, and US versus non-US studies were not significant, nor was timing of publication. Higher baseline rates of medication errors predicted greater reduc- tions (P<0.001). Other context and implementa tion variables CON- CLUSIONS: In hospital-related settings, implem enting CPOE is associated with a greater than 50% decline in pADEs, although the stud ies used weak designs. Decreases in medica- tion errors are similar and robust to variations in important aspects of intervention design and context. This suggests that CPOE implementation, as subsidized under the HITECH Act, may benefit public health. More detailed reporting of the context and process of implementa- tion could shed light on factors asso ciated with greater effectiveness. Porterfield A, Engelbert K, Coustasse A. Electronic prescribing: improving the effi- ciency and accuracy of prescribing in the ambulatory care setting . Perspectives in health information management / AHIMA, American Health Information Management As- sociation ing (e-prescribing) is an impo rtant part of the nation's push to enhance the safety and quality of the prescribing process. E-prescribing allows pro- viders in the ambulatory care setting to send prescriptions electronically to the pharmacy and can be a stand-alone system or part of an integrated electronic health record system. The methodology for this study followed the basic principles of a systematic review. A total of 47 sources were referenced. Results of this rese arch study suggest that e-prescribing reduces prescribing errors, increases efficiency, and helps to save on healthcare costs. Medication er- rors have been reduced to as little as a seventh of their previous level, and cost savings due to improved patient outcomes and decreased patient visits are estimated to be between $140 billion and $240 billion over 10 years for prac tices that implement e-prescribing. However, there have been significant barriers to implementation including cost, lack of provider sup-port, patient privacy, system errors, and legal issues.

The effect of computerized provider order entry syst ems on clinical care and work processes in emergency departments: a systematic review of the quantitative literature . Ann Emerg Med 2013;61(6):644-653.e616. Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: We undertake a systematic review of the quantitative literature related to the effect of computerized provider order entry systems in the emer-gency department (ED)., METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CPOE.org for English-language studies pu blished between January 1990 and May 2011., RESULTS: We identified 1,063 articles, of whic h 22 met our inclusion criteria. Sixteen used a pre/post design; 2 were randomiz ed controlled trials. Twelve studies reported outcomes re- lated to patient flow/clinical work, 7 examined decision support systems, and 6 reported ef- fects on patient safety. There were no studies that measured decision support systems and its effect on patient flow/c linical work. Computerized provider order entry was associated with 36 an increase in time spent on computers (up to 16.2% for nurses and 11.3% for physicians), with no significant change in time spent on patient care. Computerized provider order entry with decision support systems was related to significant decreases in prescribing errors (ranging from 17 to 201 errors per 100 orders), potential adverse drug events (0.9 per 100 or- ders), and prescribing of excessive dosages (31% decrease for a targeted set of renal disease medications)., CONCLUSION: There are tangible benefits associated with computerized pro- vider order entry/decision support systems in the ED environment. Nevertheless, when con- sidered as part of a framework of technical, clinical, and organizational components of the ED, the evidence base is neither consistent nor comprehensive. Mult imethod research ap- proaches (including qualitative research) can contribute to understanding of the multiple di- mensions of ED care delivery, not as separate entities but as essential components of a highly integrated system of care.Copyright \u00a9 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians.

Current status and evidence of effects of e-pres cribing implementation in United King- dom, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Poland and United States . Health 2013;16 (7):A462-A463. Abstract: manual (\"by hand\") generation, transmission and filling of prescriptions is thought to substantially lower the risks of inaccuracy and therefore redu ce associated health care resource use and costs. The purpose of this work is to describe the current state of e-prescribing systems im- plementation in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Poland, United Kingdom (UK) and United States (USA), and to assess present evidence of its in fluence on health care. Methods: A systematic review supplemented by additional hand-search was conducted to find relevant articles. Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Sc opus were searched. Quality was assessed on the basis of PRISMA, MOOSE and STROBE checklists and West 2002 recommendations. Results: Thirtyone relevant full texts were identi fied during systematic review, and then as a result of hand-search, 5 publications were added. E-prescribing varies considerably across these countries. It is currently voluntary in Germany, Italy and United States. In United Kingdom the system is implemented except for electronic signature. In Denmark e-prescrib- ing is mandatory for primary care providers. Mo del implementation in Poland is expected to take place in 2014. Of these 36 sources, 4 arti cles assessing e-prescribing were of the highest quality, as judged using the assessment methods. Positive influence on medical visits fre- quency, quality of care, patient satisfaction, pr escription errors frequency, and prescriber- pharmacy-patient communication was described in literature; most st udies were conducted in the UK and USA. No data about effects of implementation for Ge rmany, Italy, Denmark and Poland were found. Conclusions: Implementa tion of e-prescribing is in process in the majority of described countries. Although few studies exist that definitely demonstrate posi- tive impact of e-prescribing on health care, gath ered papers do indicate positive effects. More comprehensive assessments would be valuable in showing the attributes of e-prescribing that are most valuable, and those that may be strengthened. Poon C, Sabbah D, Wallace C, Duffett M. The effect of prescriber entry on Background: Early administration of antibiotics is associated with decreased mortality. Computerized Prescriber Order Entry (CPOE) has the potential to decrease antibi- otic turn-around time (TAT). Ho wever, the effect is uncertain as CPOE may also have unin- tended consequences such as unfavourable workflow and new kinds of errors which may lengthen antibiotic TAT. Object ive: To evaluate the potential impact of pre- and post-CPOE on antibiotic TAT from when it is ordered to the time it is administered. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, International Pharma ceutical Abstracts, and the CINALH data- base. We included all pre- and post-intervent ion study designs examining antibiotic TAT. Two reviewers independently sear ched and screened for relevant studies between 1947-2012. The quality of the studies was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The pri- mary outcome was time from antibiotic order to administration of the first dose. The second- ary outcome was the time from medication order to pharmacy verification. Results: We in- cluded 5 studies out of 87 unique citations. All were pre-post inte rvention observational studies conducted in critical care or non-crit ical care wards in hospital. The combined num- ber of orders (N) in the pre-CPOE was 756 and post-CPOE was 1204. The mean antibiotic TAT was 49.86 minutes faster in favour of CPOE (95% confidence inte rval = 88.14 to 11.57; 37 p-value = 0.01). Analysis of the secondary outcome demonstrated that of these 49.86 minutes 40.11 minutes (95% confidence interval = 63.88 to 16.34; p-value = 0.0009) were attributed to the time from the order entry to pharmacist verification. Conclusion: The im- plementation of CPOE was admi nistration of antibiotics in hospitalized pa- tients. The majority of the reduction in antibiotic TAT was at the medication order to the pharmacy verification step. Radley DC, Wasserman MR, Olsho LE, Shoemaker SJ, Spranca MD, Bradshaw B. Reduc- tion in medication errors in hospitals du e to adoption of computerized provider order entry systems . Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2013;20(3):470-476. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Medication errors in hospitals are common, expensive, and sometimes harmful to patients. This study's objective was to derive a nationally representa- tive estimate of medication error reduction in hospitals attributable to electronic prescribing through computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems., MATERIALS AND METH- ODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and applied random-effects meta-analytic techniques to derive a summary estimate of the effect of CPOE on medication errors. This pooled estimate was combined with data from the 2006 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Annual Survey, the 2007 American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the latter's 2008 Electronic Health Record Adoption Database supplement to estimate the per- centage and absolute reduction in medication errors attributable to CPOE., RESULTS: Pro- cessing a prescription drug order through a CPOE system decreases the likelihood of error on that order by 48% (95% CI 41% to 55%). Given th is effect size, and the degree of CPOE adop- tion and use in hospitals in 2008, we estimate a 12.5% reduction in medication errors, or ~17.4 million medication errors averted in the USA in 1 year., DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that CPOE can substantially reduce the frequency of medication errors in inpatient acute-care settings; however, it is unclear whet her this translates into reduced harm for pa- tients., CONCLUSIONS: Despite CPOE systems' effectiveness at preventing medication er- rors, adoption and use in US hospitals remain modest. Current policies to increase CPOE adoption and use will likely prevent millions of additional medication errors each year. Fur-ther research is needed to better characterize links to patient harm.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2011;18(3):335- 340. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems have been strongly promoted as a means to improv e the quality and efficiency of healthcare., METHODS: This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence of the impact of CPOE on medical-imaging services and patient outcomes., RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclu- sion criteria, most of which (10/14) used a pre-/postintervention comparison design. Eight studies demonstrated benefits, such as decrease d test utilization, associated with decision- support systems promoting adhere nce to test ordering guidelines. Three studies evaluating medical-imaging ordering and reporting times sh owed statistically significant decreases in turnaround times., CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal the potential for CPOE to contribute to significant efficiency and e ffectiveness gains in imaging services. The diversity and scope of the research evidence can be strengthened through increased attention to the circum- stances and mechanisms that contribute to the success (or otherwise) of CPOE and its contri- bution to the enhancement of patient care delivery. Khajouei R, Jaspers MWM. The impact of CPOE medication systems' design aspects on usability, workflow and medication orders: a systematic review . Methods Inf Med 2010;49(1):3-19. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of design aspects of computerized phy- sician order entry (CPOE) systems for medication ordering on usability, physicians' workflow and on medication orders., METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE for articles published from 1986 to 2007. We also evaluated reference lists of reviews and relevant articles captured by our search strategy, and the web-based inventory of evaluation studies in medical informatics 19 82-2005. Data about design aspects were ex- tracted from the relevant articles. Identified design aspects were categorized in groups de- rived from principles for computer screen and dialogue design and user guidance from the 38 International Standard Organization, and if CPOE-specific, from the collected data., RE- SULTS: A total of 19 papers met our inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies used qualitative evalu- ation methods and the rest both qualitative an d quantitative. In total 42 CPOE design as- pects were identified and categorized in seve n groups: 1) documentation and data entry com- ponents, 2) alerting, 3) visual clues and icons, 4) drop-down lists and menus, 5) safeguards, 6) screen displays, and 7) auxiliary functions ., CONCLUSIONS: Beside the range of function- alities provided by a CPOE system, their subtle design is important to increase physicians' adoption and to reduce medication errors. This requires continuous evaluations to investi- gate whether interfaces of CPOE systems follow normal flow of actions in the ordering pro- cess and if they are cognitively easy to understand and use for physicians. This paper pro- vides general recommendations for CPOE (re)de sign based on the characteristics of CPOE design aspects found.

Int J Med Inform 2014;83(6):406-415. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inadequate lab monitoring of drugs is a potential cause of ADEs (adverse drug events) which is remediable., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effective- ness of computerized drug-lab alerts to improve medication-related outcomes., DATA SOURCES: Citations from the Computerized Clinical Decision Support System Systematic Review (CCDSSR) and MMIT (Medications Management through Health Information which had searched MEDLINE, of Systematic Reviews, International Pharmace utical Abstracts from 1974 to March 27, 2013., STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clinician-targeted com- puterized drug lab alerts conducted in any healthcare setting. Two reviewers performed full text review to determine study eligibility ., DATA ABSTRACTION: A single reviewer ab- stracted data and evaluated validity of included studies using Cochrane handbook domains., DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six studies met the incl usion criteria (25 single drug studies with 22,504 participants, 14 targeting anticoagulatio n; 11 multi-drug studies with 56,769 partici- pants). ADEs were reported as an outcome in only four trials, all targeting anticoagulants. Computerized drug-lab alerts did not reduce ADEs (OR 0.89, 95% 0.93, poglycemia (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.31-5.37) or like lihood of bleeding, but were associated with increased likelihood of prescribing changes (O R 1.73, 95% CI 1.21-2.47) or lab monitoring (OR 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.94) in accordance with the alert., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that computerized drug-lab alerts are associated with important clinical benefits, but there is evidence of improvement in selected clinical surrogate outcomes (time in therapeutic range for vitamin K antagonists) , and changes in process outcomes (lab moni- toring and prescribing decisions).Copyright \u00a9 20 14 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The evidence for the effectiveness of safety alerts in electronic patient medication record systems at the point of pharmacy order entry: a systematic review . BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 2013;13:69. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Electronic Patient Medication Record (ePMR) systems have important safety features embedded to alert users about potential clinical hazards and er- rors. To date, there is no synthesis of evidence about the effectiveness of these safety features and alerts at the point of pharmacy order entr y. This review aims to systematically explore the literature and synthesise published evidence about the effectiveness of safety features and alerts in ePMR systems at the point of ph armacy order entry, in primary and secondary care., METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBA SE, Inspec, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, CINHAL (earliest entry to March 2012) and reference lists of articles. Two reviewers examined the titles and abstracts, and used a hierarchical template to identify comparative design studies evaluating the effectiveness of safety features and alerts at the point of pharmacy order entry. The two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool., RESULTS: Three random- ised trials and two before-after studies met our criteria. Four studies involved integrated care facilities and one was hospital-based. The studies were all from the United States (US). The five studies demonstrated statistically significan t reduction in medication errors in patients with renal insufficiency, pregnant women dispensed US Food Drug and Administration 39 (FDA) risk category D (evidence of fetal risk but therapeutic benefits can outweigh the risk) or X (evidence suggests that ri sk to the fetus outweighs ther apeutic benefits) medication, first dispensing of inappropriate medications in patients aged 65 and above, co-dispensing of interacting drugs, and adverse drug events rela ted to hyperkalaemia., CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that the safety features of ePMR systems are effective in alerting us- ers about potential clinical hazards and errors during pharmacy order entry. There are how- ever, problems such as false alerts and inconsistencies in alert management. More studies are needed from other countries and pharmacy pr actice settings to asse ss the effectiveness of electronic safety features and alerts in preventing error and reducing harm to patients.

Journal of the Ameri- can Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2012;19(1):31-38. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug events (ADEs), defined as adverse patient out- comes caused by medications, are common and difficult to detect. Electronic detection of ADEs is a promising method to identify ADEs. We performed this systematic review to char- acterize established electronic detection systems and their accuracy., METHODS: We identi- fied studies evaluating electronic ADE detection from the MEDLINE and EMBASE data- bases. We included studies if they contained original data and involved detection of elec- tronic triggers using information systems. We abstracted data regardin g rule characteristics including type, accuracy, and rationale., RESULT S: Forty-eight studies met our inclusion cri- teria. Twenty-four (50%) studies reported rule accuracy but only 9 (18.8%) utilized a proper gold standard (chart review in all patients). Rule accuracy was variable and often poor (range of sensitivity: 40%-94%; specificity: 1.4%-89. 8%; positive predictive value: 0.9%-64%). 5 (10.4%) studies derived or used detection rules th at were defined by clinical need or the un- derlying ADE prevalence. Detection rules in 8 (16.7%) studies detected specific types of ADEs., CONCLUSION: Several factors led to ina ccurate ADE detection algorithms, including immature underlying information systems, no n-standard event definitions, and variable methods for detection rule validation. Few ADE detection algorithms considered clinical pri- orities. To enhance the utility of electronic detection systems, there is a need to systemati- cally address these factors.

The Journal of emergency medicine 2013;44(1):242-248. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient safety is of great importance in the pediatric emer- gency department (PED). The combination of acut ely and critically ill patients and high pa- tient volumes creates a need for systems to suppo rt physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses. Electronic patient tracking system s can potentially improve PED safety by reduc- ing overcrowding and enhancing security., OBJECTIVES: To enhance our understanding of current electronic tracking technologies, how they are implemented in a clinical setting, and resulting effect on patient care outcomes including patient safety., METHODS: Nine data- bases were searched. Two independent reviewers identified articles that contained reference to patient tracking technologies in pediatrics or emergency medicine. Quantitative studies were assessed independently for methodological strength by two reviewers using an external assessment tool., RESULTS: Of 2292 initial arti cles, 22 were deemed relevant. Seventeen were qualitative, and the remaining five quanti tative articles were assessed as being method- ologically weak. Existing patient tracking systems in the infant monitoring/ab-duction prevention; barcode identification; radiofrequency identification (RFID)- or infrared (IR)-based patient tracking. Twenty articles supported the use of tracking technology to en- hance patient safety or improve efficiency. One ar ticle failed to support the use of IR patient sensors due to study design flaws., CONCLUSIONS: Support exists for the use of barcode-, IR-, and RFID-based patient tracking systems to improve ED patient safety and efficiency. A lack of methodologically strong studies indica tes a need for further evidence-based support for the implementation of patient tracking technology in a clinical or research setting.Copy- right \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society 2013;17(2):228-235. Abstract: PURPOSE: Approximately 10% of a ll patients is in some way harmed by the health care system. Risk factors have been identified and patients with cancer are at high risk due to the seriousness of the disease, co-morbidi ty, often old age, high risk treatments such as chemo and radiotherapy. Therefore, a closer look on safety for patients undergoing chem- otherapy is needed. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate interventions for im- proved patient safety in chemotherapy care., METHOD: We undertook a review of the availa- ble evidence regarding interventions to improve patient safety in relation to chemotherapy care., RESULTS: We found 12 studies describing the following interventions; 1) Computer- ized Prescription Order Entry (CPOE), 2) Fa ilure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Lean Sigma, 3) Error reporting and surveillance systems, 4) Administration Checklist and 5) Education for nurses. Even if all five interventions showed positive effects in patient safety, the evidence level is rather weak due to design, sample size and the difficulties involved measuring patient safety issues., CONCLUSIONS: Three studies with fairly high evidence level showed that computerized chemotherapy prescriptions were significantly safer than manual prescriptions and could therefore be recommended. For the other remaining inter- ventions, more research is needed to assess the effect on improved patient safety in chemo-therapy care. There is a need for more rigorous studies with sophisticated design for generat- ing evidence in the field.Copyright \u00a9 20 12 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives: This is the first systematic review of the effectiveness of barcoding practices for reducing patient specimen and laboratory testing identification errors. Design and methods: The CDC-funded Laboratory Medici ne Best Practices Init iative systematic re- view methods for quality improvement practices were used. Results: A total of 17 observa- tional studies report ing on barcoding systems are included in the body of evidence; 10 for pa- tient specimens and 7 for point-of-care testing. All 17 studies favored barcoding, with meta- analysis mean odds ratios for barcoding system s of 4.39 (95% CI: 3. 05-6.32) and CI : 5.28-6.67). Conclusions: Barcoding is effective for reducing patient specimen and laboratory testing identification errors in diverse hospital settings and is recommended as an evidence-based \"best practice.\" The overall strength of evidence rating is high and the effect size rating is substant ial. Unpublished studies made an important con- tribution comprising almost half of the body of evidence.

Inter- ventions for reducing medication errors in children in hospital . The Cochrane da- tabase of systematic reviews 2015;3:CD006208. 41 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many hospitalised patients are affected by medication errors (MEs) that may cause discomfort, harm and even death. Children are at especially high risk of harm as the result of MEs because such e rrors are potentially more hazardous to them than to adults. Until now, interventions to reduce MEs have led to only limited improve-ments., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiv eness of interventions aimed at reducing MEs and related harm in hospitalised children., SEARCH METHODS: The Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the following sources for primary studies: The Cochrane Libr ary, including the Coch rane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Economic Evaluation Database (EED) and the Health Technology Assessments (HTA) database; MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAH L), PsycINFO, Proquest Dissertations & The- ses, Web of Science (citation indexes and conference proceedings) and the EPOC Register of Studies. Related reviews were identified by se arching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Review authors searched grey literature sources and trial regi stries. They handsearched selected journals, contacted researchers in the field and scanned reference lists of relevant reviews. They con- ducted searches in November 2013 and Novemb er 2014. They applied neither language nor date limits., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time seri es investigating interventions to improve medication safety in hospitalised children (< 18 years). Particip ants were healthcare professionals authorised to prescribe, dispense or administer medicati ons. Outcome measures included MEs, (poten- tial) patient harm, resource utilisation and unintended consequences of the interventions., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed study quality using th e EPOC data collection checklist. We evalu- ated the risk of bias of included studies and used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the quality of the body of evi- dence. We described results narratively an d presented them using GRADE tables., MAIN RESULTS: We included seven stud ies describing five different intervention s: participation of a clinical pharmacist in a clinic al team (n = 2), introduction of a computerised physician or- der entry system (n = 2), implementation of a barcode medication administration system (n = 1), use of a structured prescribing form (n = 1) and implementation of a check and control checklist in combination with feedback (n = 1) .Clinical and methodological heterogeneity be- tween studies precluded meta-analyses. Although some interventions described in this re- view show a decrease in MEs, the results are no t consistent, and none of the studies resulted in a significant reduction in patient harm. Based on the GRADE approach, the overall quality and strengfh of the evidence are low., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on ef- fective interventions to prevent MEs in a paedia tric population in hospital is limited. Com- parative studies with robust study designs are needed to investigate interventions including components that focus on specific paediatric safety issues. Acheampong F, Anto BP, Koffuor GA. Medication safety strategies in hospitals--a sys- tematic review . The International journal of risk & sa fety in medicine 2014;26(3):117-131. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medication safety is an essential component of patient safety in health care delivery. Providing strate gies to effectively prevent medication errors and adverse drug events in hospitals has gained international recognition., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to review systematically th e research literature on the various interven- tions for providing medication safety in hospitals., METHOD: Eight healthcare databases were searched for full research articles written in English. Reference li sts of included studies were also searched. Research studies involving de livery of interventions in hospitals with the aim of preventing or reducing medication e rrors and adverse drug events were examined., RESULTS: Forty-two studies were selected. Most of the studies were before and after designs without comparative control groups. Forty studies identified interventions contributing to the prevention and reduction of medication e rrors. Six broad types of interventions were identified: computerized physician order entry wi th or without clinical decision support sys- tems, automation, computer assisted, barcode te chnology, pharmacist role, training and sys- tem designs., CONCLUSION: Though studies have provided evidence for individual inter- ventions, there are concerns about the extent of their effectiveness. This has implications for policy makers and clinicians to adopt multifac eted approach in providing medication safety in their hospitals. 42 Maaskant J, Vermeulen H, Apampa B, Fern ando B, Ghaleb M, Neubert A, et al. Interven- tions for reducing medication errors in children in hospital: A systematic re- view . Arch Dis Child2014. p. A156. Abstract: Background and aims Children are co nsidered to be at high risk of experienc- ing harm due to medication erros (MEs). Hosp itals implement various interventions to re- duce MEs, but their effectiveness is unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to identify evidence-based interventions to redu ce MEs in hospitalised children. Methods We searched the following databases: CINAHL, CENTRAL, Dissertations and Theses Database, EMBASE, EPOC Group Specialised Register , MEDLINE, Nursing and Allied Health, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and DARE. Further- more, we searched the grey literature, trial regi stries and the reference lists of all included studies. We included randomised controlled tria ls, controlled before-a fter studies and inter- rupted time series. The outcome measures included MEs, (potential) patient harm, resource utilisation and unintended cons equences of the interventions. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed the studies quality. Results Se ven studies were included de- scribing five different interventions: clinical pharmacist (two order studies), barcode medica tion administration, a structured prescribing form, and a check and control checklist in combination with feedback. Most studies resulted in a reduction in MEs, but the benefits for the patients in terms of less harm were not conclu- sive. Clinical and methodological heterogene ity between the studies precluded meta-anal- yses. Conclusion The current evidence on effective interventions to prevent MEs in a paediat- ric population in hospital is limited. There is a need for comparative studies with robust study designs that investigate interventions incl uding components that focus on specific pae- diatric safety issues.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically ex amine the research literature to identify which interventions reduce medi cation errors in pediatric intensive care units., DATA SOURCES: Databases were searched from inception to April 2014., STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies we re included if they involved the conduct of an inter- vention with the intent of reducing medication errors., DATA SYNTHESIS: In all, 34 relevant articles were identified. Apart from 1 study, a ll involved single-arm, be fore-and-after designs without a comparative, concurrent control group. A total of 6 types of interventions were uti- lized: computerized physician order entry (CPOE), intravenous systems (ISs), modes of edu- cation (MEs), protocols and guidelines (PGs), pharmacist involvement (PI), and support sys- tems for clinical decision making (SSCDs). Stat istically significant reductions in medication errors were achieved in 7/8 st udies for CPOE, 2/5 studies for IS s, 9/11 studies for MEs, 1/2 studies for PGs, 2/3 studies for PI, and 3/5 st udies for SSCDs. The test for subgroup differ- ences showed that there was no statistically significant difference among the 6 subgroups of interventions, chi(2)(5) = 1.88, P = 0.87. The following risk ratio results for meta-analysis were obtained: 0.47 (95% CI CI = 0.23, 1.03)., Available evidence suggests some as- pects of CPOE with decision support, ME, and IS may help in reduci ng medication errors. Good quality, prospective, observ ational studies are needed for institutions to determine the most effective interventions.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014. Rinke Rao S, Zerhouni Y, Lobner K, et al. Interventions to reduce pediatric medication errors: a systematic review . Pediatrics 2014;134(2):338-360. Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Medication errors cause appreciable morbidity and mortality in children. The object ive was to determine the effectiveness of in- terventions to reduce pe diatric medication errors, identify gaps in the literature, and perform meta-analyses on comparable studies., METHOD S: Relevant studies we re identified from searches of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sc ience, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumu- lative Index to Nursing Allied Health Literatu re and previous systematic reviews. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed original data in an y language testing an intervention to reduce medication errors in children. Abstract and full-text article re view were conducted by 2 inde- pendent authors with sequential data extraction ., RESULTS: A total of 274 full-text articles 43 were reviewed and 63 were included. Only 1% of studies were conducted at community hos- pitals, 11% were conducted in ambulatory po pulations, 10% reported preventable adverse drug events, 10% examined administering errors, 3% examined dispensing errors, and none reported cost-effectiveness data, suggesting persis tent research gaps. Variation existed in the methods, definitions, outcomes, and rate denomi nators for all studies; and many showed an appreciable risk of bias. Although 26 studies (41%) involved computerized provider order en- try, a meta-analysis was not performed because of methodologic heterogeneity. Studies of computerized provider order en try with clinical decision su pport compared with studies without clinical decision suppo rt reported a 36% to 87% redu 82% redu ction in prescribing errors., CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric medication errors can be reduced, although our understanding of optimal interventions remains hampered. Research should focus on understudied areas, use standardized definitions and outcomes, and ev aluate cost-effectiveness. Copyright \u00a9 2014 by the Carling CLL, Kirkehei I, Dalsbo TK, Paulsen E. Risks to patient safety associated with implementation of electronic applications for medication management in am- bulatory care--a systematic review . BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 2013;13:133. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The objective was to find evidence to substantiate assertions that electronic applications for medication ma nagement in ambulatory care (electronic pre- scribing, clinical decision support (CDSS), elec tronic health record, and computer generated paper prescriptions), while intended to reduce prescribing errors, can themselves result in errors that might harm patients or increase risks to patient safety., METHODS: Because a scoping search for adverse events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielded few relevant results, we systematically searched nine da tabases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for sy stematic reviews and studies of a wide vari- ety of designs that reported on implementation of the interventions. Studies that had safety and adverse events as outcomes, monitored for them, reported anecdotally adverse events or other events that might indicate a threat to patient safety were included., RESULTS: We found no systematic reviews that examined adverse events or patient harm caused by organi- zational interventions. Of the 4056 titles and abstracts screened, 176 full-text articles were assessed for inclusion. Sixty-one studies with a ppropriate interventions, settings and partici- pants but without patient safety, adverse event outcomes or monitoring for risks were ex- cluded, along with 77 other non-eligible studie s. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 5 non-randomized controlled trials (non-R,CTs) and 15 observational studies were included. The most common electronic intervention studied was CDSS and the most frequent clinical area was cardio-vascular, including an ti-coagulants. No RCTS or non-R,CTS reported adverse event. Adverse events reported in obse rvational studies occurre d less frequently after implementation of CDSS. One RCT and one obse rvational study reported an increase in problematic prescriptions with electronic pr escribing, CONCLUSIONS: The safety implica- tions of electronic medication management in ambulatory care have not been established with results from studies included in this syst ematic review. Only a minority of studies that investigated these interventions included threats to patients' safety as outcomes or moni- tored for adverse events. It is therefore not surprising that we found little evidence to sub- stantiate fears of new risks to patient safety with their implementation. More research is needed to focus on the draw-backs and negative outcomes that implementation of these in- terventions might introduce. Clyne B, Bradley MC, Hughes C, Fahey T, Lapane KL. Electronic prescribing and other forms of technology to reduce inapprop riate medication use and polypharmacy in older people: a of current evidence . Clin Geriatr Med 2012;28(2):301-322. Abstract: This review provided an overview of the current evidence in relation to the use of e-prescribing and other forms of techno logy, such as CDSS, to reduce inappropriate prescribing in older people. The evidence indi cates that various types of e-prescribing and CDSS interventions have the potential to redu ce inappropriate prescribing and polyphar- macy in older people, but the magnitude of thei r effect varies accordin g to study design and setting. There was significant heterogeneity in th e studies reported in terms of study designs, intervention design, patient settings, and outcome measures with patient outcomes seldom reported. Widespread diffusion of these interventions has not occurred in any of the health care settings examined. Overall, health care pr oviders report being satisfied with e-prescrib- ing systems and see the systems as having a posit ive impact on the safety of their prescribing practices, yet the problem of overriding or ig noring alerts persists. The problem of large 44 numbers of inaccurate and insignificant alerts and this issue, along with the other barriers that have been identified, wa rrant further in vestigation. Manias E, Williams A, Liew D. Interventions to reduce medication errors in adult intensive care: a systematic review . Br J Clin Pharmacol 2012;74(3):411-423. Abstract: Critically ill patients need life saving treatments and are often exposed to medications requiring careful titration. The ai m of this paper was to review systematically the research literature on the efficacy of interv entions in reducing medi cation errors in inten- sive care. A search was conducted of PubMed, CINAHL EMBASE, Journals@Ovid, Interna-tional Pharmaceutical Abstract Series via O vid, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo and The Cochrane Collaboration from inception to October 2011. Research studies involving delivery of an intervention in intens ive care for adult patients with the aim of re- ducing medication errors were examined. Eight types of interventions were identified: com- puterized physician order entry (CPOE), change s in work schedules (CWS), intravenous sys- tems (IS), modes of education (ME), medicati on reconciliation (MR), pharmacist involve- ment (PI), protocols and guidelines (PG) and support systems for clinical decision making (SSCD). Sixteen out of the 24 studies showed re duced medication error rates. Four interven- tion types demonstrated reduced medication errors post-intervention: CWS, ME, MR and PG. It is not possible to promote any interventi ons as positive models for reducing medica- tion errors. Insufficient research was undertaken with any particular type of intervention, and there were concerns regarding the level of evidence and quality of research. Most studies involved single arm, before and after designs without a comparative control group. Future researchers should address gaps identified in si ngle faceted interventions and gather data on multi-faceted interventions using high quality research designs. The findings demonstrate implications for policy makers and clinicians in adopting resource intensive processes and technologies, which offer little evidence to su pport their efficacy.Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Au- thors.

The organizational and clini- cal impact of integrating bedside equipment to an information system: A sys- tematic literature review of patient data management systems (PDMS) . Int J Med Inform 2015;84(3):155-165. Abstract: Objective: The introduction of an information system integrated to bedside equipment requires significant financial and resource investment; therefore understanding the potential impact is beneficial for decision-m akers. However, no syst ematic literature re- views (SLRs) focus on this topic. This SLR aims to gather evidence on the impact of the aforementioned system, also known as a patient data management system (PDMS) on both organizational and clinical outcomes. Materi als and Methods A literature search was per- formed using the databases Medline/PubMed and CINHAL for English articles published be- tween January 2000 and December 2012. A qual ity assessment was performed on articles deemed relevant for the SLR. Results Eighteen articles were included in the SLR. Sixteen ar- ticles investigated the impact of a PDMS on the organizational outcomes, comprising de- scriptive, quantitative and qualitative studies. A PDMS was found to reduce the charting time, increase the time spent on direct patient care and reduce the occurrence of errors. Only two articles investigated the clinical impact of a PDMS. Both reported an improvement in clinical outcomes when a PDMS was integrated with a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Conclusions A PDMS has shown to offer many advantages in both the efficiency and the quality of care delivered to the patient. In addition, a PDMS integrated to a CDSS may improve clinical outcomes, although furt her studies are required for validation. Jones SS, Rudin RS, Perry T, Shekelle PG. Health information technology: an updated systematic review with a focus on meaningful use . Ann Intern Med 2014;160(1):48- 54. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Incentives offere d by the U.S. government have spurred marked increases in use of health informatio n technology (IT)., PURPOSE: To update previ- ous reviews and examine recent evidence that re lates health IT functionalities prescribed in meaningful use regulations to key aspects of health care., DATA SOURCES: English-lan- guage articles in PubMed from January 2010 to August 2013., STUDY SELECTION: 236 studies, including pre-post and time-series design s and clinical trials that related the use of 45 health IT to quality, safety, or efficiency ., DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data on functionality, study outc omes, and context., DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifty- seven percent of the 236 studies evaluated clin ical decision support and computerized pro- vider order entry, whereas other meaningful use functionalities were rarely evaluated. Fifty- six percent of studies reported uniformly posit ive results, and an additional 21% reported mixed-positive effects. Reporting of context and implementation details was poor, and 61% of studies did not report any contextual deta ils beyond basic information., LIMITATION: Po- tential for publication bias, and evaluated heal th IT systems and outcomes were heterogene- ous and incompletely described., CONCLUSION: St rong evidence supports the use of clinical decision support and computerized provider or der entry. However, in sufficient reporting of implementation and context of use makes it impossible to determine why some health IT im- plementations are successful and others are not. The most important improvement that can be made in health IT evaluations is increased reporting of the effects of implementation and context., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Office of the National Coordinator. Minshall S. A review of healthcare information system usability & safety . Stud Health Technol Inform 2013;183:151-156. Abstract: Healthcare information systems have been designed to increase the efficiency and safety of healthcare processes. Systems su ch as electronic health records and pervasive computing devices have been shown to improve the safety of healthcare. However, increasing research has indicated that the design of such systems, in particular the user interface, may be related to increased incidence of other types of error. In this review, the relationship be- tween human factors and usability will be considered in the context of designing safe and ef-fective healthcare applications, with a focus on hand-held computing devices. Medline was searched for the specific terms listed below an d restricted to the date ranges 2006-01-01 through to 2011-03-03: (error AND technology AND human factors); (error AND (CPOE OR (Computerized AND provider AND order AND entry))); (Technology AND Induced AND Er- ror). The returned list of papers was screened by examining titl es and abstracts to select can- didate papers for further review. The initial search yield was 239 papers. On reviewing the title and abstract, 186 were rejected and 51 papers remained for analysis. New technology, such as CPOE, offers improvements over tradit ional paper tools and it is shown to have a positive effect on patient safety. New technolo gy also creates the opportunity for new errors to occur and lead to the coining of the term \"technology-induced error\". The magnitude of the usability-testing needs is larger than it may seem. McKibbon KA, Lokker C, Handler SM, Dolovich LR, Holbrook AM, O'Reilly D, et al.

Journal of the American Medical Informat ics Association : JAMIA 2012;19(1):22-30. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The US Agency for He althcare Research and Quality funded an evidence report to address seven questions on multiple aspects of the effectiveness of medi- cation management information technology (MMIT) and its components (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring)., MATERIALS AND METH- ODS: Medline and 11 other databases without language or date limitations to mid-2010. Ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing integrated MMIT were selected by two independ- ent reviewers. Reviewers assessed study quality and extracted data. Senior staff checked ac- curacy., RESULTS: Most of the 87 RCTs focused on clinical decision support and computer-ized provider order entry systems, were perfor med in hospitals and clinics, included primar- ily physicians and sometimes nurses but not ot her health professional s, and studied process changes related to prescribing and monitoring medication. Processes of care improved for prescribing and monitoring mostly in hospital settings, but the few studies measuring clini- cal outcomes showed small or no improvements . Studies were performe d most frequently in the USA (n=63), Europe (n=16), and Canada (n=6)., DISCUSSION: Many studies had lim- ited description of systems, installations, inst itutions, and targets of the intervention. Prob- lems with methods and analyses were also found. Few studies addressed order communica- tion, dispensing, or administering, non-phys ician prescribers or pharmacists and their MMIT tools, or patients and caregivers. Other study methods are also needed to completely understand the effects of MMIT., CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of MMIT interventions im-proved the process of care, but few studies meas ured clinical outcomes. This large body of literature, although instructive, is not unifor mly distributed across settings, people, medica- tion phases, or outcomes. 46 Rahadhan P, Poon SK, Land L. Understanding unintended consequences for EMR: a literature review . Stud Health Technol In form 2012;178:192-198. Abstract: While Electronic Medical Records (EMR) have been hailed as an important step for advancing healthcare, a number of st udies have noted that its introduction also brings unintended consequences to healthcare organisations. This means that introducing EMR to key stakeholders such as clinicians, heal thcare administrators, as well as to the over- all healthcare organisations, may not be as st raightforward as we have hoped for. There has been some empirical work and systematic reviews specifically addressing the unintended consequences for EMR. Given the complexity of these issues, continued effort to investigate them is critical. This paper first proposes an integration and systematisation of the existing literature on the unintended consequences of EMR (including its various definitions and classifications), and then provides insights for dealing with these issues, including mitigation strategies for addressing these issues.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is considerable international interest in exploiting the potential of digital solutions to enhance the quality and safety of health care. Implementa-tions of transformative eHealth technologies ar e underway globally, often at very considera- ble cost. In order to assess the impact of eHealt h solutions on the quality and safety of health care, and to inform policy decisions on eHealt h deployments, we undertook a systematic re- view of systematic reviews assessing the effect iveness and consequences of various eHealth technologies on the quality and safety of care., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed novel search strategies, conceptual maps of heal th care quality, safety, and eHealth interven- tions, and then systematically identified, scru tinised, and synthesised the systematic review literature. Major biomedical da tabases were searched to identify systematic reviews pub- lished between 1997 and 2010. Related theoretical, methodological, and technical material was also reviewed. We identified 53 systematic reviews that focused on assessing the impact of eHealth interventions on the quality and/or safety of health care and 55 supplementary systematic reviews providing relevant supportive information. This systematic review litera- ture was found to be generally of substandard quality with regards to methodology, report- ing, and utility. We thematically categorised eHealth technologies into three main areas: (1) storing, managing, and transmission of data; (2) clinical decision support; and (3) facilitating care from a distance. We found that despite su pport from policymakers, there was relatively little empirical evidence to substantiate many of the claims made in relation to these technol- ogies. Whether the success of those relatively few solutions identified to improve quality and safety would continue if these were deployed beyond the contexts in which they were origi-nally developed, has yet to be established. Importantly, best practice guidelines in effective development and deployment strategies are la cking., CONCLUSIONS: There is a large gap between the postulated and empirically demonstrated benefits of eHealth technologies. In addition, there is a lack of robust research on the risks of implementing these technologies and their cost-effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated, despite being frequently promoted by policymakers and \"techno-enthusiasts\" as if th is was a given. In the light of the paucity of evidence in relation to improvements in patient outcomes, as well as the lack of evidence on their cost-effectiveness, it is vital that future eHealth technologies are evaluated against a comprehensive set of measures, ideally throughout all stages of the technology's life cycle. Such evaluation should be characterised by careful attention to socio-technical factors to maximise the likelihood of successful implementation and adoption.

Evidence report/technology a ssessment 2011 (201):1-951. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The ob jective of the report was to review the evidence on the impact of health information technology (IT) on all phases of the medication management process (prescribing and ordering, order communication, dispensing, administration and monitoring as well as education and reconciliation), to identify the gaps in the literature and to make recommendations for future research., DATA SOURCES: We searched peer-re- viewed electronic databases, grey literatu re, and performed hand searches. Databases searched included MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied 47 Health Literature), Cochrane Database of Sy stematic Reviews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Compendex, (which Xplore), Library and Information Sci- Abstracts, E-Prints in Library and Info rmation Science, PsycINFO, Sociological Ab- stracts, and Business Source Complete. Grey li terature searching involved Internet search- ing, reviewing relevant Web sites, and searchin g electronic databases of grey literatures. AHRQ also provided all references in their e-Prescribing, bar coding, and CPOE knowledge libraries., METHODS: Paired reviewers looked at citations to identify studies on a range of health IT used to assist in the medication management process (MMIT) during multiple lev- els of screening (titles and abst racts, full text and final revie w for assignment of questions and data abstrction). Randomized controlled tria ls and cohort, case-control, and case series studies were independently asse ssed for quality. All data were abstracted by one reviewer and examined by one of two different reviewers with content and methods expertise., RE-SULTS: 40,582 articles were retrieved. After du plicates were removed, 32,785 articles were screened at the title and abstract phase. 4,578 full text articles were assessed and 789 articles were included in the final report. Of these, 361 met only content criteria and were listed with-out further abstraction. The fina l report included data from 42 8 articles across the seven key questions. Study quality varied according to phase of medication management. Substantially more studies, and studies with stronger co mparative methods, evaluated prescribing and monitoring. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order en- try (CPOE) systems were studied more than an y other application of MMIT. Physicians were more often the subject of evaluation than other participants. Other health care professionals, patients, and families are important but not st udied as thoroughly as physicians. These non- physicians groups often value different aspect s of MMIT, have diverse needs, and use sys- tems differently. Hospitals and ambulatory clin ics were well-represente d in the literature with less emphasis placed on long-term care facilities, communities, homes, and nonhospital pharmacies. Most studies evaluated changes in process and outcomes of use, usability, and knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Most showed moderate to substantial improvement with implementation of MMIT. Economics studies and those with clinical outcomes were less fre- quently studied. Those articles that did address economics and clinical outcomes often showed equivocal findings on the effectiv eness and cost-effectiveness of MMIT systems. Qualitative studies provided evidence of strong perceptions, both positive and negative, of the effects of MMIT and unintended consequences. We found little data on the effects of forms of medications, conformity, standards, an d open source status. Much descriptive liter- ature discusses implementation issues but little strong evidence exists. Interest is strong in MMIT and more groups and institutions will im plement systems in the next decades, espe- cially with the Federal Government's push toward more health IT to support better and more cost-effective health care., CONCLUSIONS: MMIT is well-studied, although on closer exami- nation of the literature the evidence is not uniform across phases of medication manage- ment, groups of people involved, or types of MMIT. MMIT holds the promise of i proved pro- cesses; clinical and economics studies and the understanding of sustainability issues are lacking. Wulff K, Cummings GG, Marck P, Yurtseven BACKGROUND: Healthcare leaders need evidence-based information on nursing medication administration technologies to guide the design of improvements to pa-tient safety., AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the research evidence on relation- ships between the use of medication administration technologies and incidence of medica- tion administration incidents and preventable adverse drug events to inform decision-mak-ing about existing technology options., DATA SOURCES: Thirteen electronic databases and seven relevant patient safety websites were searched for the years 1980-2009., REVIEW METHODS: A mixed-method systematic literatu re review of research on medication admin- istration technologies and associated links to patient safety, operationalized as medication administration incidents and preventable adverse drug events, was conducted., RESULTS: Twelve studies (two qualitative, five pre- an d postinterventions and five correlational) met the inclusion criteria. All were assessed as medi um quality with low generalizability of study findings. Only two studies sampled more than one hospital and none of the studies was driven by an explicit theoretical framework. Th e studies included in this review are generally positive towards medication administration technologies and their potential benefits, yet the level of evidence overall is equivocal. The majo rity of studies pointed to the development of workarounds by nurses following medication administration technology implementation 48 that could compromise patient safety., CONCLUSION: More theoretically driven research is needed to determine which medication administration technologies should be implemented in what ways to most effectively reduce medi cation administration incidents and preventable adverse drug events and minimize the development of potentially unsafe workarounds. Fur-ther evidence is required to accurately assess the actual contribution of medication admin- istration technologies for improving patient sa fety.Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

Impact of health information technology interventions to improve medication laboratory monitoring for ambulatory patients: a sys- tematic review . Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2010;17(6):631-636. Abstract: Medication errors are a major sour ce of morbidity and mo rtality. Inadequate laboratory monitoring of high-risk medications after initial prescription is a medical error that contributes to preventable adverse drug events. Health information technology (HIT)-based clinical decision support may improve patient safety by improving the laboratory mon- itoring of high-risk medications, but the effectiv eness of such interventions is unclear. There- fore, the authors conducted a systematic review to identify studies that evaluate the inde- pendent effect of HIT interven tions on improving laboratory monitoring for high-risk medi- cations in the ambulatory setting using a Medline search from January 1, 1980 through Jan-uary 1, 2009 and a manual review of relevant bibliographies. All anticoagulation monitoring studies were excluded. Eight articles met the inclusion criteria, including six randomized controlled trials and two pre-post intervention studies. Six of the studies were conducted in two large, integrated healthcare delivery systems in the USA. Overall, five of the eight studies reported statistically significant, but small, improvements in laboratory monitoring; only half of the randomized controlled tr ials reported statistically significant improvements. Studies that found no improvement were more likely to have used analytic strategies that addressed clustering and confounding. Whether HIT improv es laboratory monitoring of certain high- risk medications for ambulatory patients remain s unclear, and further research is needed to clarify this important question. 49 Vedlegg 3 Prim\u00e6rstudier Beslutningsst\u00f8tte (decision support, reminders & of electronic venous thro mboprophylaxis after admissions and transfers . Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2014;21(e2):e297-303. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Clinic al decision support has the potential to improve preven- tion of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The purpose of this prospective study was to ana- lyze the effect of electronic reminders on th romboprophylaxis rates in wards to which pa- tients were admitted and transferred. The latt er was of particular interest since patient handoffs are considered to be critical safety issues., METHODS: The trial involved two study periods in the six departments of a university hospital, three of which were randomly as- signed to the intervention group displaying reminders during the second period. At 6 h after admission or transfer, the algorithm checked for prophylaxis orders within 0-30 h of the pa- tient's arrival, increasing the specificity of the displayed reminders., RESULTS: The signifi- cant impact of the reminders could be seen by prophylaxis orders placed 6-24 h after admis- sion (increasing from (223/2579) to 2.4% (39/1616) to (63/1682); p=0.034). In admission wards, the of thromboprophylaxis increased from 62.4% to 67 .7% (p<0.0001), and in transfer wards it in- creased from 80.2% to 84.3% (p=0.0022). Overa ll, the rate of prophylaxis significantly in- creased in the intervention group from 69.2% to 74.3% (p<0.0001). No significant changes were observed in the control group. Postponi ng prophylaxis checks to 6 h after admissions and transfers reduced the number of reminder s by 62% and thereby minimized the risk of alert fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The reminders improved awareness of VTE prevention in both admission and transfer wards. This approa ch may contribute to better quality of care and safer patient handoffs.Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

A computer- ized reminder system to increase the use of preventive care for hospitalized pa- tients . The New England journal of me dicine 2001;345(13):965-970. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although they are effective in outpatient settings, computer- ized reminders have not been proved to increase preventive care in inpatient settings., METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects of comput- erized reminders on the rates at which four pr eventive therapies were ordered for inpatients. During an 18-month study period, a computeriz ed system processed on-line information for all 6371 patients admitted to a general-medicine service (for a total of 10,065 hospitaliza- tions), generating preventive care reminders as appropriate. Physicians who were in the in-tervention group viewed these reminders when they were using a computerized order-entry system for inpatients., RESULTS: The reminder system identified 3416 patients (53.6 per- cent) as eligible for preventive measures that had not been ordered by the admitting physi-cian. For patients with at least one indication, computerized reminders resulted in higher ad- justed ordering rates for pneumococcal vaccination (35.8 percent of the patients in the inter- vention group vs. 0.8 percent of those in the control group, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (51.4 percent vs. 1.0 percent, P< 0.001), prophyl actic heparin (32.2 percent vs. 18.9 percent, P<0.001), and prophylactic aspirin at discharg e (36.4 percent vs. 27.6 percent, P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A majority of hospitalized patients in this study were eligible for preventive 50 measures, and computerized reminders significan tly increased the rate of delivery of such therapies.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2009;16(4):480-485. Abstract: UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE To dete rmine whether a computerized clinical decision support system providing patient-spec ific recommendations in real-time improves the quality of prescribing for long-term care residents with renal insufficiency. DESIGN Ran- domized trial within the long-stay units of a large long-term care facility. Randomization was within blocks by unit type. Alerts related to medication prescribing fo r residents with renal insufficiency were displayed to prescribers in the intervention units and hidden but tracked in control units. Measurement The proportions of final drug orders that were appropriate were compared between intervention and control units within alert categories: (1) recom-mended medication doses; (2) recommended administration frequencies; (3) recommenda- tions to avoid the drug; (4) warnings of missing information. RESULTS The rates of alerts were nearly equal in the intervention and contro l units: 2.5 per 1,000 re sident days in the in- tervention units and 2.4 in the control units. Th e proportions of dose alerts for which the fi- nal drug orders were appropriate were simila r between the intervention and control units (relative risk 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0. 83, 1.1) for the remaining alert categories sig- nificantly higher proportions of final drug orders were appropriate in th e intervention units: relative risk 2.4 for maximum frequency (1.4, 4. 4); 2.6 for drugs that should be avoided (1.4, 5.0); and 1.8 for alerts to acquire missing information (1.1, 3.4). Overall, final drug orders were appropriate significantly more often in the intervention units-relative risk 1.2 (1.0, 1.4). CONCLUSIONS Clinical decision support for physicians prescribing medications for long-term care residents with renal insufficiency can improve the quality of LR, Bell CM, et al. Effect of computer- ized provider order entry with clinical de cision support on adverse drug events in the long-term care setting . J Am Geriatr Soc 2008;56(12):2225-2233. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effi cacy of computerized provider order entry with clinical decision support for preventing adverse drug events in long-term care., DE-SIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial., SETTING: Two large long-term care facilities., PATIENTS: One thousand one hundred eighteen lo ng-term care residents of 29 resident care units., INTERVENTION: The 29 resident care un its, each with computerized provider order entry, were randomized to having a clinical de cision support system (i ntervention units) or not (control units)., MEASUREMENTS: The numb er of adverse drug events, severity of events, and whether the events were preventable., RESULTS: Within intervention units, 411 adverse drug events occurred over 3,803 reside nt-months of observation time; 152 (37.0%) were deemed preventable. Within control units, there were 340 adverse drug events over 3,257 resident-months of observation time; 126 (37.1%) were characterized as preventable. There were 10.8 adverse drug events per 100 resident-months and 4.0 preventable events per 100 resident-months on inte rvention units. There were 10.4 adverse drug events per 100 resident-months and 3.9 preventable events pe r 100 resident-months on control units. Com- paring intervention and control units, the adjusted rate rati os were 1.06 (95% confidence in- terval (CI)=0.92-1.23) for all adverse drug even ts and 1.02 (95% CI=0.81-1.30) for preventa- ble adverse drug events., CONCLUSION: Computerized provider order entry with decision support did not reduce the adverse drug event rate or preventable adverse drug event rate in the long-term care setting. Alert burden, limited scope of the alerts, and a need to more fully integrate clinical and laboratory info rmation may have affected efficacy. Murray MD, Loos B, Tu W, Eckert GJ, Zhou XH, Tierney WM. Work patterns of ambula- tory care pharmacists with access to electronic guideline-based treatment sug- gestions . American journal of health-system phar macy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 1999;56(3):225-232. Abstract: The effects of the electronic disp lay of guideline-based, patient-specific treat- ment suggestions on pharmacist work patterns we re studied. A total of 28 pharmacists at a hospital-based ambulatory care pharmacy were randomly assigned to intervention and con- trol groups. The intervention group had access to electronic treatment suggestions for heart failure, ischemic heart disease, reactive ai rways disease, and uncomplicated hypertension, 51 while the control group did not. Starting 9 and 19 months after the initial display of treat- ment suggestions, all pharmacists recorded the time they spent on a variety of activities, the purpose of each activity, and persons contacted during the activity; these observations were recorded in response to a page r-like device that randomly buzzed four times an hour. A total of 11,102 observations were recorded. Pharma cists in the intervention group spent signifi- cantly more of their time discussing informat ion, advising and informing, and solving prob- lems than pharmacists in the control group but significantly less of their time checking and filling prescriptions. Pharmacists in both groups completed a majority of their work alone, but pharmacists in the intervention group worked significantly less by themselves and signif- icantly more with other pharmacy personnel, patients, and physicians and nurses than con- trol-group pharmacists. The delivery of patien t-specific information to pharmacists at the time of dispensing had a significant posit ive impact on pharmacist work patterns.

Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 2010;16(2):209-218. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a computerized order set on the in- patient management of diabetes and hypergl ycemia., METHODS: We conducted a cluster- randomized controlled trial on the general medical service of an academic medical center staffed by residents and hospitalists. Consecutiv ely enrolled patients with diabetes mellitus or inpatient hyperglycemia were randomized on the basis of their medical team to usual care (control group) or an admission order set buil t into the hospital's computer provider order entry (CPOE) system (intervention group). All teams received a detailed subcutaneous insu- lin protocol and case-based education. The primary outcome was the mean percent of glu- cose readings per patient between 60 and 180 mg/dL., RESULTS: Between April 5 and June 22, 2006, we identified 179 eligible study subj ects. The mean percent of glucose readings per patient between 60 and 180 mg/dL was 75% in the intervention group and 71% in the usual care group (adjusted relative risk , 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.80). In comparison with usual care, the intervention group also had a lower patient-day weighted mean glucose (148 mg/dL versus 158 mg/dL, P = .04), less use of sliding-scale insulin by itself (25% versus 58%, P = .01), and no significant difference in the rate of severe hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL; 0.5% versus 0.3% of patient-days, P = .58)., CONCLUSION: The use of an order set built into a hospital's CPOE system led to im provements in glycemic control and insulin or- dering without causing a significant increase in hypoglycemia. Other institutions with CPOE should consider adopting similar order sets as part of a comprehens ive inpatient glycemic management program.

Computerized deci- sion support to reduce potentially in appropriate prescribing to older emer- gency department patients: a Soc Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the e ffectiveness of computer-assisted decision support in reducing potentially inappropriat e prescribing to older adults., DESIGN: Ran- domized, controlled trial., SETTING: An academ ic emergency department (ED) in Indianap- olis, Indiana, where computerized physician or der entry was used to write all medication prescriptions., PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three emer gency physicians were randomized to the intervention (32 physicians) or control (31 physicians) group., INTERVENTION: Decision support that advised against use of nine po tentially inappropriate medications and recom- mended safer substitute therapies., MEAS UREMENTS: The primary outcome was the pro- portion of ED visits by seniors that resulted in one or more prescriptions for an inappropri- ate medication. The main secondary outcomes were the proportions of medications pre- scribed that were inappropriat e and intervention physicians' reasons for rejecting the deci- sion support., RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 74, two-thirds were female, and just over half were African American. Decision support was provided 114 times to interven- tion physicians, who accepted 49 (43%) of the recommendations. Intervention physicians prescribed one or more inappropriate medication s during 2.6% of ED visits by seniors, com- pared with 3.9% of visits managed by control physicians (P=.02; odds ratio=0.55, 95% confi- dence interval=0.34-0.89). The proportion of all prescribed medications that were inappro- priate significantly decreased from 5.4% to 3. 4%. The most common re ason for rejecting de- cision support was that the patient had no prior problems with the medication., CONCLU- 52 SION: Computerized physician order entry with decision support significantly reduced pre- scribing of potentially inappropriate medications for seniors. This approach might be used in other efforts to improve ED care., TRIAL REGI STRATION: Clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT00297869. Terrell KM, Perkins AJ, Hui SL, Callahan CM, Dexter PR, Miller DK. Computerized deci- sion support for medication dosing in renal Med Emergency physicians prescribe several discharge med- ications that require dosage adjustment for pa tients with renal disease. The hypothesis for this research was that decision support in a computerized physician order entry system would reduce the rate of excessive medication dosing for patients with renal impairment., METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled trial in an academic emergency department (ED), in which computerized physician order entr y was used to write all prescriptions for pa- tients being discharged from the ED. The sample included 42 physicians who were random-ized to the intervention (21 physicians) or co ntrol (21 physicians) group. The intervention was decision support that provided dosing recommendations for targeted medications for patients aged 18 years and older when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance level was below the threshold for dosage adjustment. Th e primary outcome was the proportion of tar- geted medications that were excessively dosed., RESULTS: For 2,783 (46%) of the 6,015 pa-tient visits, the decision support had sufficient information to estimate the patient's creati- nine clearance level. The average age of thes e patients was 46 years, 1,768 (64%) were women, and 1,523 (55%) were black. Decision su pport was provided 73 times to physicians in the intervention group, who excessively dosed 31 (43%) prescriptions. In comparison, con- trol physicians excessively dosed a significantly larger proportion of medications: 34 of 46, 74% (effect to 49%; P=.001)., CONCLUSION: Emer-gency physicians often prescribed excessive dose s of medications that require dosage adjust- ment for renal impairment. Computerized phys ician order entry with decision support sig- nificantly reduced excessive dosing of target ed medications.Copyright \u00a9 2010 American Col- lege of Emergency Physicians.

International journal for quality in health care: journal of the International So ciety for Quality in Health Care / ISQua 2013;25(6):656-663. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of electronic standardized chemother- apy templates on incidence and types of prescribing errors., DESIGN: A quasi-experimental interrupted time series with segmented regression., SETTING : A 700-bed multidisciplinary tertiary care hospital with an ambulatory cancer center., PARTICIPANTS: A multidiscipli- nary team including oncology physicians, nurses, pharmacists and information technolo-gists., INTERVENTION(S): Standardized, regime n-specific, chemotherapy prescribing forms were developed and implemented over a 32-month period., MAIN OUTCOME MEAS- URE(S): Trend of monthly prevented prescrib ing errors per 1000 ch emotherapy doses dur- ing the pre-implementation phase (30 months), immediate change in the error rate from pre-implementation to implementation and trend of errors during the implementation phase. Errors were analyzed according to thei r types: errors in comm unication or transcrip- tion, errors in dosing calculation and errors in regimen frequency or treatment duration. Rel- ative risk (RR) of errors in the post-implementation phase (28 months) compared with the pre-implementation phase was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI)., RESULTS: Baseline monthly error rate was stable with 16.7 prevented errors per 1000 chemotherapy doses. A 30% reduction in prescribing errors wa s observed with initiating the intervention. With implementation, a negative change in the slope of prescribing errors was observed (co- efficient = -0.338; 95% CI: -0.612 to -0.064). The estimated RR of transcription errors was 0.74; 95% CI (0.59-0.92). The estimated RR of dosing calculation errors was 0.06; 95% CI (0.03-0.10). The estimated RR of chemotherapy frequency/duration CI (0.42-0.62)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementing st chemotherapy-prescribing tem- plates significantly reduced all types of prescribing errors and improved chemotherapy safety. 53 Haynes K, Linkin DR, Fishman NO, Bilker WB, Strom BL, Pifer EA, et al. Effectiveness of an information technology intervention to improve prophylactic antibacterial use in the postoperative period . Journal of Medical Informatics Associa- tion : JAMIA 2011;18(2):164-168. Abstract: BACKGROUND: A 2005 report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control Surgical Infection Prevention program indi- cated that only 41% of prophylactic antibacteria ls were correctly stopped within 24 h of the end of surgery. Electronic order sets have sh own promise as a means of integrating guideline information with electronic order entry systems and facilitating safer, more effective care., OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the effectiveness of a computer-based antibacterial order set on increasing the proportion of patients who have antibacterial wound prophylaxis dis- continued in the appropriate time frame., DE SIGN: The authors conducted a quasi-experi- mental interrupted time-series analysis over an 8-month study period with the implementa- tion of a computer-based order system designed to prevent excessive duration of surgical prophylaxis antibacterials., MEASUREMENT: Th e primary outcome was the proportion of surgeries with antibacterials discontinued in the appropriate time frame. Additionally, we evaluated the percent of surgeries after implementation of the electronic intervention with chart documentation of infection among surgerie s where the prescriber indicated the reason for antibacterial therapy was treatment., RESU LTS: The computer-based order intervention significantly improved the proportion of surger ies with timely discontinuation of antibacteri- als from 38.8% to 55.7% (p < 0.001) in the inte rvention hospital, while the control hospital remained at 56-57% (p = 0.006 for the differe nce between treated and control hospitals). In surgeries after intervention implementation where a prescriber indicated the reason for anti-bacterial therapy was treatment, the prevalen ce of chart documented infection was only 14%., CONCLUSIONS: A computer-based electronic order set intervention increased timely discontinuation of postoperative antibacterials.

Canadian Journal of Diab etes 2013;37:S13-S14. Abstract: The impact of computerized p hysician order entry (CPOE)-integrated order sets on inpatient diabetes care is unclear. Studies have been fraught with short follow-up times or samples limited in size and scope. In instances when large-scale randomized con- trolled trials are not feasible, interrupted time series (ITS) has been advocated as an alterna-tive that can provide robust estimates of intervention effects while taking into account secu- lar trends. We conducted an ITS to evaluate the longitudinal impact on glycemic control and insulin ordering 6 months before and after implementation of a CPOE-integrated insulin or- der set favouring the basal-bolus-supplement (B BS) approach and use of insulin sensitivity factors. This order set was made available to all the medical and surgical non-intensive care units at a tertiary centre with 550 beds. From June 2011 to June 2012, 46 795 capillary blood glucose (CBG) measurements were obtained. Ther e was no impact of CPOE insulin order sets on proportion of CBGs in There was no difference in overall uptake of BBS orders, which remained low (15.5% vs. 18.9%). Our findings demon- strated a lack of effectiveness of the CPOE in sulin order sets, which may be due to knowledge gaps in the appropriate use of BBS approach, the need for a systematic order set implemen- tation strategy, possible impedance of CPOE on user performance and the generation of new errors unique to computerized systems. Futur e research areas include conducting usability heuristic evaluations and developing platfo rms for continuous quality improvement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Adherence to e vidence-based (AMI) remains unsatisf actory., OBJECTIVE: Quantifying association between using an electronic AMI order set (A MI-OS) and hospital processes and outcomes., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTI NG: Twenty-one community hospitals., PA- TIENTS: A total of 5879 AMI patients were hospitalized between September 28, 2008 and December 31, 2010., MEASUREMENTS: We ascert ained whether patients were treated using 54 the AMI-OS or individual orders (a la carte) . Dependent process variables were use of evi- dence-based care; outcome variab les were mortality an d rehospitalization., RESULTS: Use of individual and combined therapies improved outcomes (eg, 50% lower odds of 30-day mor- tality for patients with >3 therapies). The 3531 patients treated using the AMI-OS were more likely to receive evidence-based therapies (eg, 50% received 5 different therapies vs 36% a la carte). These patients had lower 30-day mortality (5.7% vs 8.5%) than the 2348 treated using a la carte orders. Although AMI-OS patients' pr edicted mortality risk was lower (3.2%) than that of a la carte patients (4.8%), the associ ation of improved processes and outcomes with the use of the AMI-OS persisted after risk adju stment. For example, af ter inverse probability weighting, the relative risk for inpatient mort ality in dence interval: 0.52-0.86). Inclusion of use of recommended therapies in risk adjustment eliminated the benefit of the AMI-OS, highlighting its mediating effect on adherence to evi-dence-based treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Use of an electronic order set is associated with in- creased adherence to evidence-based care and better AMI outcomes.Copyright \u00a9 2014 Soci- ety of Hospital Medicine.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effe of an automated prior authoriza- tion (PA) system (SmartPA) in reducing use of and expenditures for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX- 2) inhibitors., STUDY DESIGN: Before and afte r with control group., METHODS: After im- plementation of SmartPA in Missouri, changes in use of and expenditures for COX-2 inhibi- tors, COX-2 substitutes (traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and other products for pain), and ga strointestinal (GI) protective agents were compared between the Medicaid program of Missouri and that of a state with no PA program for COX-2 inhibi-tors. Subjects were continuously enrolled for the 24-month study period and had a claim for a COX-2 inhibitor in the 12-month baseline pe riod. Analyses included comparison of means and linear regression. Regression s controlled for age, sex, risk for GI complications, severity of illness, and the interaction between state and risk., RESULTS: Changes in expenditures for COX-2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, other pain drugs , and GI-protective drugs were $256 higher, $56 lower, $21 higher, and $198 higher, respectively, in the control state among low-risk pa- tients. Changes in expenditures were $102 high er, $12 lower, $21 lower, and $185 higher, re- spectively, in the control state among high-ris k patients. Results were similar for drug utili- zation., CONCLUSION: Implementation of SmartPA resulted in reduced use of and expendi- tures for COX-2 inhibitors and reduced net expe nditures for all pain and GI-protective medi- cations. These effects were greatest for pa tients at low risk for GI complications. Cox ZL, Nelsen CL, Waitman LR, McCoy JA, Peterson JF. Effects of clinical decision support on initial dosing and monitoring of tobramycin and amikacin . American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : o fficial journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacist s 2011;68(7):624-632. Abstract: PURPOSE: The impact of clinical decision support (CDS) on initial doses and intervals and pharmacokinetic outcomes of amikacin and tobramycin therapy was evalu- ated., METHODS: A complex CDS advisor to provide guidance on initial dosing and moni- toring of aminoglycoside orders, using both tr aditional-dosing and extended-interval-dosing strategies, was integrated into a computerized prescriber-order-entry (CPOE) system and compared with a control group whose aminoglycoside orders were closely monitored by pharmacists. The primary outcome measured was an initial dose within 10% of a dose calcu- lated to be adherent to published dose guidel ines. Secondary outcomes included a guideline- adherent interval, trough and peak concentrations in goal range, and rate of nephrotoxicity., RESULTS: Of 216 patients studied, 97 were pr escribed amikacin and 119 were prescribed to- bramycin. The number of orders with initial doses consistent with reference standards in- creased from 40% in the preadvisor group to 80% in the postadvisor group (p < 0.001). Se- lection of the correct initial interval based on renal function increased from 63% to 87% (p < 0.001). The changes in the initial dosing and inte rval resulted in an increase of trough con- centrations at goal (59% in the preadvisor gr oup versus 89% in the postadvisor group, p = 0.0004). There was no significant difference in pe ak concentrations in the goal range or rate of nephrotoxicity., CONCLUSION: An advisor for aminoglycoside dosing and monitoring in- tegrated into a CPOE system significantly impr oved selection of initial doses and intervals and resulted in an improvement in the rate of trough serum drug concentrations at goal com- pared with standard provider dosing. 55 Fleming NS, Ogola G, Ballard DJ. Implementing a standardized order set for com- munity-acquired pneumonia: impact on mortality and cost . Joint Commission journal on quality and patient safety / Joint Commission Resources 2009;35(8):414-421. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Order sets have shown some success in improving compli- ance with clinical guidelines, as well as pati ent and financial outcomes. Baylor Health Care System (BHCS) deployed a standardized ad ult pneumonia order set throughout its eight acute care hospitals in 2006., METHODS: All non-comfort care adult patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia who met The Joint Commission definition of pneumonia and were discharged from an acute care BHCS hospital for a 30-month period (March 1, 2006-August 31, 2008) were includ ed. Mortality, core measures compliance, and direct cost were compared for patients who did and did not receive the order set., RESULTS: Some 4,454 patients met study inclusion criteria. Si gnificant variation in use between hospitals, however, persisted. Unadjusted analysis showed significant reductions in inhospital mortal- ity, 30-day mortality, and direct cost and a si gnificant increase in core measures compliance. Following risk adjustment, the difference in core measures compliance was retained (relative risk [95% confidence interval (C.I.)] 1.08 [1.0 3, 1.12]). Inhospital mortality and 30-day mor- tality reductions approached [0.51,1.02] and 0.79 [0.62, 1.00], respectively). Mean (sta ndard error) benefits of order set use in in- hospital mortality and costs were estimated at 1.67 (0.62)% and $383 (207). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio point estimate was -$22,882 per life saved, with an upper 95% confi- dence limit of$1,278 per life saved., DISCUSSI ON: Widespread adoption of the order set was achieved, with use consistently at or above 75% across all BHCS acute care hospitals since February 2007. The reductions in mortality obse rved with order set use, in combination with the favorable estimate of cost-effectiveness, make standardized evidence -based order sets an attractive improvement methodology for improving quality of pneumonia care.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Attainment of every performance measure or perfect care (PC) is used as a tool for measuring hospital qu ality of care. We sought to describe the effect of achieving PC on subsequent outcomes in pa tients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to determine whether computerized physician order entry enabled with decision support (CPOE-DS) would enhance the likelihood of achieving PC and improvements in clin- ical outcomes., METHODS: Clinical inpatient data, performance measures and subsequent mortality was collected in 1,321 consecutive AC S patients admitted between January 1, 2009, to October 15, 2011, using either a standardized order set that followed consensus guidelines or orders generated via CPOE-DS., RESULTS: CPOE-DS generated orders were utilized in 642 (49%) patients while the remaining 679 (51%) of patients were admitted using standard- ized order sets. At baseline, CPOE-DS patients were younger (-3%, P = .006), had lower rest- ing heart rates (-3%, P = .012), higher TIMI risk scores (+19%, P < .001), were less likely to have hypertension (85% vs. 90%, P = .014), an d more likely to have ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (17% vs 10%; P = .001) than patients admitted with standard orders. Patients admitted using CPOE-DS were 5.7 times more likely to achieve PC than those who were admitted with standard or ders (P < .001). Independent pr edictors of survival included PC (HR, 0.45; P < .001), age >67 years (HR, 2. 34; P < .001), and abnormal presenting heart rate (HR, 1.71; P = .046)., CONCLUSIONS: Achi evement of PC is a valid measure of quality of care in the hospitalized ACS patient and is associated with improved survival.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) with decision support on the frequency of antithrombotic medication errors in pa- tients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to measure what effect it would have on in-hospital bleeding., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 80 patients with CKD who were admitted with ACS between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, using eith er a standardized order set or CPOE with decision support to assess the frequency of medication errors and in-hospital bleeding., RESULTS: Of the 80 56 patients, 47 were admitted with standard orders vs 33 with CPOE. In-hospital bleeding oc- curred in 13 patients: 10 in the standard orde rs group vs 3 in the CPOE group (P=.12). In- hospital bleeding occurred in 5 (63%) of 8 pa tients receiving a contraindicated antithrom- botic medication compared with 8 (11%) of 72 patients receiving appropriate medications (P=.002); the corresponding length of stay was 12.0 days compared wi th 6.8 days (P=.10). Contraindicated medications were given to no patients in the CPOE group vs 8 patients (17%) in the standard orders group (P=.01) ., CONCLUSION: Medication errors occur fre- quently in patients with CKD admitted with AC S and result in a high risk of in-hospital bleeding. Use of CPOE with deci sion support is feasible in the ACS setting and may lead to improved patient safety. Peterson JF, Kuperman GJ, Shek C, Patel M, Avorn J, Bates Guided prescription of psychotropic medications inpatients . Arch Intern Med excessive dosing of psychotropic medica- tions in the elderly is common and can lead to a variety of adverse drug events including falls, oversedation, and cognitive impairment. Me thods: We developed a database of psycho- tropic medication dosing and selection guidelines for elderly inpatients. We displayed these recommendations to physicians through a computer ized order entry system at a tertiary care academic hospital. The system was activated for 2 of 4 six-week study periods in an off-on- off-on pattern. Main outcome measures were agreement with the recommended daily dose for the initial drug order, incidence of dosing at least 10-fold greater than the recommended daily dose, prescription of nonrecommended drugs , inpatient falls, alte red mental status as measured by a brief nursing assessment, and hospit al length of stay. Results: A total of 7456 initial orders for psychotropic medications were prescribed for 3718 hospitalized elderly pa- tients with a mean+/-SD age of 74.7+/-6.7 year s. The intervention increased the prescription of the recommended daily dose (29% vs 19%; P<.001), reduced the incidence of 10-fold dos- ing (2.8% vs 5.0%; P<.001), and reduced the pr drugs (10.8% vs 7.6% of total orders; P<.001). Patients in the intervention cohort had a lower in-hospital fall rate (0.28 vs 0.64 falls per 100 patient-days; P=.001). No effect on hospital length of stay or days of altered mental status was found. Conclusion: A geriatric decision support system for psychotropic medications increased the pres cription of recommended doses, reduced the prescription of nonrecommended drugs, and was associated with fewer inpatient falls.

Physi- cians' response to guided geriatric dosing: initial results Inform 2007;129(Pt 2):1037-1040. dosing within a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system is an effective method of individualizing therapy for patients. Physicians' responses to guided dosing decision support have not been extensiv ely studied. As part of a randomized trial evaluating efficacy of dosing advice on reducing falls in the elderly, CPOE prompts to physi- cians for 88 drugs included tailored messages and guided dose lists with recommended ini- tial doses and frequencies. The study captured all prescribing activity electronically. The pri- mary outcome was the ratio between prescribed dose and recommended dose. Over 9 months, 778 providers entered 9111 study-relate d medication orders on 2981 patients. Physi- cians using guided orders chose recommended doses more often than controls(28.6% vs. 24.1%, p<0.001). Selected dose s were significantly lower in the intervention group (median ratio of actual to recommended 2.5, interquartile range [1.0,4.0]) than the control group (median 3.0 interquartile range [1.5,5.0], p<0.001). While physicians selected the recom-mended dose less than a third of the time, guided geriatric dosing modestly improved com- pliance with guidelines. Wrona S, Chisolm DJ, Powers M, Miler V. Improving processes of care in patient-con- trolled analgesia: the impact of computer ized order sets and acute pain service patient management . Paediatr Anaesth 2007;17(11):1083-1089. Abstract: BACKGROUND: In an effort to combat opioid indu ced side effects within the first 24 h of patient-controlled analgesia (P CA) induction, it has been recommended that care be provided by an Acute Pain Treatmen t Service (APS) and that computerized PCA or- der sets with patient monitoring requirements be implemented. To date, there are few pub- lished studies on the role of computerized order sets or APS in improving the quality and 57 safety of pediatric PCA use. This retrospective analysis sought to determine if the implemen- tation of computerized order sets would increase appropriate monitoring and problem recog- nition., METHODS: Analysis included 536 patients prescribed PCA in one of three ways: an anesthesia order set with APS support (n = 285) , a general PCA order set (n = 95), or no or- der set (n = 156). We analyzed the use of order sets by unit; the incidence of appropriate monitoring (> or =12 recordings within 24 h) of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and se- dation level and the recognition of low respiration rate and low oxygen saturation between the types of PCA order., RESULTS: We found a significant difference in type of PCA order used by unit. Appropriate documentation of re spiratory rate and oxyg en saturation occurred significantly more often if the order set with APS was used. Low respiration rate was also rec- ognized significantly more frequently (P < or = 05) in the APS orde r set group., CONCLU- SIONS: These findings show that use of a computerized PCA order set with monitoring re-quirements and an APS can increase monitoring and documentation of important vital signs and increase identification of potential negative events.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether systematically developed clinical decision supports provide usability benefit or decrease d cognitive workload with their use., METH- ODS: Seven surgeons at a pediatric hospital at di fferent levels of training (3 residents, 3 fel- lows, and 1 attending) were randomized to use either a historical control (ad hoc developed order set) or a systematically developed orde r set for postoperative management of appendi- citis in children. After a washout period, they we re crossed over to the other order set. Partic- ipants were videorecorded and completed postsu rveys, including the System Usability Scale and the National Aeronautic and Space Admini stration-Task Load Index., RESULTS: Partici- pants unanimously preferred using systematically developed order sets. These order sets re- sulted in higher usability scores (75 +/- 10 vs 60 +/- 19; P < .05) and lower cognitive work- load scores (37.7 +/- 15 vs 52.2 +/- 12; P < .05), with comparable amounts of time spent, mouse clicks, and free text entry. Orders generated were more likely to conform to estab- lished clinical guidelines., CONCLUSIONS: Syst ematically designed order sets provide a re- duction in cognitive workload and order variation in the context of improved system usabil-ity and improved guideline adherence. The systematically designed order set did not improve time spent, reduce mouse clicks , or reduce free text entry. Dainty KN, Adhikari NKJ, Kiss A, Quan S, Zwarenstein M. Electronic prescribing in an ambulatory care setting: a randomized trial . J AND OBJECTIV ES: Medication-prescri bing errors with adverse drug events impose substantial harms on patients and health systems. Medication errors resulting in preventable adverse drug events most commonly occur at the ordering stage. Electronic prescribing may prevent such errors but its impact has not been rigorously evaluated., METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial in ac- ademic hospital ambulatory clinics to evaluate the effects of a commercially available elec- tronic prescribing software system on total pr escription error ratio. Secondary outcomes in- cluded the number of callbacks for clarificat ion from community pharmacies to physicians' clinics., RESULTS: Twenty-six physicians used the electronic prescribing system, writing 1980 prescriptions during 44 intervention week s when the electronic prescribing system was available (7.6% of these were electronic, the remainder handwritten) and 973 prescriptions during 22 control weeks while the system was switched off (1.4% electronic, prescribed in the previous intervention week, but issued with delay). The total prescription error rate was 118/1980 (6.0%) in intervention weeks and 57/973 (5.9%) in control weeks (P = 0.91). Dur- ing the intervention period more callbacks requesting clarification were made to clinic ad- ministrators (n = 83, 1.89 per week) than duri ng control weeks (n = 32, 1.45 per week; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Implementation of the electronic prescribing system had no impact on total prescription error, and increased the ca llback rate. In spite of intensive user support, few prescriptions in intervention weeks were made using the electronic system. Given the 58 costs, training requirements, workflow redesi gns and regulatory hurdles, additional evalua- tions of outpatient prescribing on clinically important outcomes are Aldag software-assisted hospital discharge: cluster randomized potentially improves communi- cation and clinical outcomes., OBJECTIVE: To measure patient and physician perceptions after discharge with computerized physician order entry (CPOE) software., DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial., SETTING: Tertiary care, teaching hospital in central Illinois., PATIENTS: A total of 631 inpatients discharged to home with high risk for readmission., IN-TERVENTION: A total of 70 internal medicine hospital physicians randomly assigned (allo- cation concealed) to discharge software vs . usual care, handwritten discharge., MEASURE- MENTS: Discharge perceptions from patients, outpatient primary care physicians, and hos- pital physicians., RESULTS: One week after discharge, 92.4% (583/631) of patients an- swered interviews. For 78.6% (496/631) of patients, their outpatient physicians returned questionnaires 19 days (median) postdischarge. Generalized estimating equations gave inter- vention variable coefficients with 95% confiden ce intervals (CIs). When comparing patients assigned to discharge software vs. usual care, patient mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores for discharge preparedness were higher (17.7 [4.1 ] vs. 17.2 [4.0]; coefficient = 0.147; 95% CI = 0.005-0.289; P = 0.042), patient scores for satisfaction with medication information were unchanged (12.3 [4.8] vs. 12.1 [4.6]; coefficien t = -0.212; 95% CI = -0.937-0.513; P = 0.567), and their outpatient physicians scored higher qu ality discharge (17.2 [3.8] vs. 16.5 [3.9]; co- efficient = 0.133; 95% CI = 0.015-0.251; P = 0.02 7). Hospital physicians found mean effort to use discharge software was more difficult than the usual care (6.5 [1.9] vs. 7.9 [2.1]; P = 0.011)., CONCLUSIONS: Discharge software with CPOE caused small improvements in dis- charge perceptions by patients and their outp atient physicians. These small improvements might balance the difficulty perceived by hospital physicians who used discharge software. Graumlich JF, Novotny NL, Stephen Nace G, S, et al. Patient readmissions, emergency visits , and adverse events after software- assisted discharge from hospit Hosp BACKGROUND: One of the causes of postdischarge adverse events is poor discharge communication between hospital-based physicians, patients, and outpatient physi- cians. The value of hospital discharge software to improve communication and clinically rele- vant outcomes is unknown., OBJECTIVE: To me asure effects of a discharge software applica- tion of computerized physician order entry (CPOE)., DESIGN: Cluster randomized con-trolled trial., SETTING: Tertiary care, teaching hospital in central Illinois., PATIENTS: A to- tal of 631 inpatients discharged to home with high risk for readmission., INTERVENTION: Seventy internal medicine hospital physicians were randomly assigned (allocation concealed) to discharge software versus usual care, ha ndwritten discharge., MEASUREMENTS: Blinded assessment of patient readmission, emergency department visit, and postdischarge adverse event., RESULTS: A total of intervention variable coefficients with 95% confidence inter- val (CI). When comparing patients assigned to discharge software versus usual care, there was no difference in hospital readmission within 6 months (37.0% versus 37.8%; coefficient CI, -0.074 to 0.065]; P = 0.894), emergency within months versus 40.6%; -0.052 [95% CI, -0.115 to 0.011]; = CPOE did not affect readmissions, emer- gency department visits, or adverse events after discharge. Future studies should assess other endpoints such as patient perceptions or physician perceptions to see if discharge soft- ware has value.Copyright 2009 Society of Hospital Medicine.

Journal of the American Medical In- formatics Association : JAMIA 2011;18(3):276-281. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Application of user -centred design principles to Computer- ized provider order entry (CPOE) systems may improve task efficiency, usability or safety, 59 but there is limited evaluative research of its impact on CPOE systems., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the task efficiency, usability, and safe ty of three order set formats: our hospital's planned CPOE order sets (CPOE Test), computer order sets based on user-centred design principles (User Centred Design), and existing pre-printed paper order sets (Paper)., PAR- TICIPANTS: 27 staff physicians, residents and medical students., SETTING: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, an academic hospit al in Toronto, Canada. Methods Participants completed four simulated order set tasks with th ree order set formats (two CPOE Test tasks, one User Centred Design, and one Paper). Orde r of presentation of order set formats and tasks was randomized. Users received individual training for the CPOE Test format only., MAIN MEASURES: Completion time (efficiency), requests for assistance (usability), and er- rors in the submitted orders (safety)., RESULT S: 27 study participants completed 108 order sets. Mean task times were: User Centred Desi gn format 273 s, Paper format 293 s (p=0.73 compared to UCD format), and CPOE Test fo rmat 637 s (p<0.0001 compared to UCD for- mat). Users requested assistance in 31% of th e CPOE Test format tasks, whereas no assis- tance was needed for the other formats (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in number of errors between formats., CONCLUSI ONS: The User Centred Design format was more efficient and usable than the CPOE Test format even though training was provided for the latter. We conclude that application of us er-centred design principles can enhance task efficiency and usability, increasing the likelihood of successful implementation.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 1999;6(4):313-321. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medica tion errors are common, and while most such errors have little potential for harm they cause substa ntial extra work in hospitals. A small propor- tion do have the potential to cause injury, and some cause preventable adverse drug events., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of comput erized physician order entry (POE) with deci- sion support in reducing the number of medica tion errors., DESIGN: Prospective time series analysis, with four periods., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to three medical units were studied for seven to ten-week periods in four different years. The baseline period was before implementation of POE, an d the remaining three we re after. Sophistica- tion of POE increased with each successive period., INTERVENTION: Physician order entry with decision support features such as dr ug allergy and drug-drug interaction warnings., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Medication errors, excluding missed dose errors., RESULTS: During the study, the non-missed-dose medicati on error rate fell 81 percent, from 142 per 1,000 patient-days in the baseline period to 26.6 per 1,000 patien t-days in the final period (P < 0.0001). Non-intercepted serious medication e rrors (those with the potential to cause in- jury) fell 86 percent from baseline to period 3, the final period (P = 0.0003). Large differ- ences were seen for all main types of medicati on errors: dose errors, frequency errors, route errors, substitution errors, and allergies. For ex ample, in the baseline period there were ten allergy errors, but only two in the following three periods combined (P < 0.0001)., CONCLU- SIONS: Computerized POE substantially decrea sed the rate of non-missed-dose medication errors. A major reduction in errors was achieved with the initial version of the system, and further reductions were fo und with addition of decision support features.

Implementing a visual indicator for overdue doses was not associated with significant decreases in the rates of missed antibiotic or non-antibi- otic doses., CONCLUSIONS: Electronic prescrib ing systems can facilitate data collection re- lating to missed medication doses., INTERV ENTIONS: providing hospital staff with infor- mation about overdue doses at a ward level can help promote reductions in overdue doses rates.

Duplicate orders: an unintended of com- puterized provider/physician order ent (CPOE) OBJECTIVE: Computerized pro vider/physician order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS) is designed to improve patient safety. However, a number of unintended consequences which include duplicate ordering have been reported. The objec- tive of this time-series study was to characte rize duplicate orders an d devise strategies to minimize them., METHODS: Time series design with systematic weekly sampling for 84 weeks. Each week we queried the CPOE database, downloaded all active orders onto a spreadsheet, and highlighted duplicate orders. We noted the following details for each dupli- cate order: time, order details (e.g. drug, dose , route and frequency), ordering prescriber, in- cluding position and role, and whether the orders originated from a single order or from an order set (and the name of the order set). This analysis led to a number of interventions, in- cluding changes in: order sets, workflow, iber training, pharmacy procedures, and du- plicate alerts., RESULTS: Duplicates were more likely to originate from different prescribers than from same prescribers; and from order se ts than from single orders. After interven- tions, there was an 84.8% decrease in the dupl ication rate from weeks 1 to 84 and a 94.6% decrease from the highest (1) to the lowest week (75). Currently, we have negligible duplicate orders., CONCLUSIONS: Duplicate orders can be a significant unintended consequence of CPOE. By analyzing these orders, we were able to devise and implement generalizable strate- gies that significantly reduced them. The inci dence of duplicate orders before CPOE imple- mentation is unknown, and our data originate fr om a weekly snapshot of active orders, which serves as a sample of total active orders. Thus, it should be noted that this methodology likely under-reports duplicate orders. Maat and calculat ing system on hypo- and hyperglyce- mias and on prescribing time efficiency in neonatal intensive care patients . nutrition 2013;37(1):85-91. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prescribing glucose requires complex calculations because glucose is present in parenteral and enteral nutrition and drug vehicles, making it error prone and contributing to the burden of pres cribing errors., OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the impact of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system with clin ical decision support (CDS) for glucose control in neonatal intensive care patients (NICU) focusing on hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes and prescribing time efficiency., METHODS: An interrupted time-series design to examine the effect of CPOE on hypo- and hyperglycemias and a crossover simulation study to examine the influence of CPOE on prescribing time efficiency. NICU pa- tients at risk for glucose imbalance hospitalized at the University Medical Center Utrecht during 2001-2007 were selected. The risks of hypo- and hyperglycemias were expressed as incidences per 100 patient days in consecutiv e 3-month intervals during 3 years before and after CPOE implementation. To assess prescribing time efficiency, time needed to calculate glucose intake with and without CPOE was measured., RESULTS: No significant difference was found between pre- and post-CPOE mean incidences of hypo- and hyperglycemias per 100 hospital days of neonates at risk in ev ery [3.7-6.3] post-CPOE, P = .75). CPOE led to a significant time reduction of 16% (1.3 [0.3-2.3] minutes) for simple and 60% (8.6 [5.1-12.1] minutes) for complex calculations., CONCLUSIONS: CPOE including a special CDS tool preserved accu- racy for calculation and control of glucose intake and increased prescribing time efficiency. 61 Pawar DS. The impact of computerized physic ian order entry system (CPOE) on occurrence of medication errors in a psychiatric hospital . Drug Inf J 2009;43 (4):523. Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the impact of computerized physician order entry sys- tem (CPOE) on occurrence of medication errors. Method: Inpatient data of an academic psy- chiatric hospital during January 2003-Decembe r 2008 was collected. Medication error rate per 100 prescriptions per month was primary ou tcome. Interrupted time-series regression analysis was used to study the impact of CPOE system on occurrence of medication errors. Results: The average prevalence of medication errors during the study period was 4.4%. Most of the medication errors were inappropriate dosing errors (32.69% in 2008 and 29.56% in 2007). After the implementation of CPOE (February 2004) the medication error rate dropped by 9.72% (P value = .0033).

Journal of the American Medical Informatics As sociation : JAMIA 2009;16(6):816-825. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of a Computerized Physician Or- der Entry system with basic Clinical Decisi on Support (CPOE/CDSS) on the incidence of medication errors (MEs) and preventable adverse drug events (pADEs)., DESIGN: Inter- rupted time-series design., MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measurements com-prised the percentage of medication orders with one or more MEs and the percentage of pa- tients with one or more pADEs., RESULTS: Pre-implementation, the mean percentage of medication orders containing at least one ME was 55%, whereas this became 17% post-im- plementation. The introduction of CPOE/CDSS has led to a significant immediate absolute reduction of 40.3% (95% CI: -45.13%; -35.48%) in medication orders with one or more er- rors. Pre-implementation, the mean percentage of admitted patients experiencing at least one pADE was 15.5%, as opposed to 7.3% post-implementation. However, this decrease could not be attributed to the introduction of CPOE/CDSS: taking into consideration the in- terrupted time-series design, the immediate change was not significant (-0.42%, 95% CI: - 15.52%; 14.68%) because of the observed underlying negative trend during pe- riod This has shown that CPOE/CDSS reduces the incidence of medicati on errors. However, a direct effect on ac- tual patient harm (pADEs) was not demonstrated. Vermeulen KM, JE, Zaal Mol PGM, Lenderink AW, Haaijer-Ruskamp FM, et al. Cost-effectiveness of an electron ic medication ordering system (CPOE/CDSS) in hospitalized patients . Int J Med Inform 2014;83(8):572-580. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Prescribing medica tion is an important aspect of almost all in-hospital treatment regimes. Besides thei r obviously beneficial effects, medicines can also cause adverse drug events (ADE), which in crease morbidity, mort ality and health care costs. Partially, these ADEs arise from medication errors, e.g. at the prescribing stage. ADEs caused by medication errors are preventable ADEs. Until now, medication ordering was pri- marily a paper-based process and consequently, it was error prone. Computerized Physician Order Entry, combined with basic Clinical De cision Support System (CPOE/CDSS) is consid- ered to enhance patient safety. Limited information is available on the balance between the health gains and the costs that need to be invest ed in order to achieve these positive effects. Aim of this study was to study the balance be tween the effects and costs of CPOE/CDSS com- pared to the traditional paper-based medicati on ordering., METHODS: The economic evalu- ation was performed alongside a clinical study (interrupted time series design) on the effec- tiveness of CPOE/CDSS, including a cost mini mization and a cost-effectiveness analysis. Data collection took place between 2005 and 2 008. Analyses were performed from a hospital perspective. The study was perf ormed in a general teaching ho spital and a University Medi- cal Centre on general internal medicine, gastroenterology and geriatric wards. Computerized Physician Order Entry, combined with basic Cl inical Decision Support System (CPOE/CDSS) was compared to a traditional paper based system. All costs of both medication ordering sys-tems are based on resources used and time inve sted. Prices were expressed in Euros (price level 2009). Effectiveness outcomes were medication errors and preventable adverse drug events., RESULTS: During the paper-based pres cribing period 592 patients were included, and during the CPOE/CDSS period 603. To tal costs of the paper-based system and 62 CPOE/CDSS amounted to 12.37 and 14.91 per patient/day respectively. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for medication errors was 3.54 and for preventable adverse drug events 322.70, indicating the extra amount () that has to be invested in order to prevent one medication error or one pADE., CONCLUSIONS: CPOE with basic CDSS contributes to a decreased risk of preventable harm. Overall, the extra costs of CPOE/CDSS needed to pre- vent one ME or one pADE seem to be acceptab le.Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pediatrics 2008;121(3):e421-427. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although initial research suggests that computerized physician order entry reduces pediatric me dication errors, no comprehens ive error surveillance studies have evaluated the effect of computerized physician order entry on children. Our objective was to evaluate comprehensively the effect of computerized physician order entry on the rate of inpatient pediatric medication errors., ME THODS: Using interrupted time-series regres- sion analysis, we reviewed all charts, orders , and incident reports for 40 admissions per month to the NICU, PICU, and inpatient pediat ric wards for 7 months before and 9 months after implementation of commercial computeriz ed physician order entry in a general hospi- tal. Nurse data extractors, who were unaware of study objectives, used an established error surveillance method to detect possible errors. Two physicians who were unaware of when the possible error occurred rated each possible erro r., RESULTS: In 627 pediatric admissions, with 12,672 medication orders written over 32 34 patient-days, 156 medication errors were detected, including 70 nonint ercepted serious medication errors (22/1000 patient-days). Twenty-three errors resulted in patient injury (7/1000 patient-days). In time-series analysis, there was a 7% decrease in level of the rates of nonintercepted serious medication errors. There was no change in the rate of injuries as a result of error after computerized physician order entry implementation., CONCLUSIONS: Th e rate of nonintercepted serious medica- tion errors in this pediatric population was reduced by 7% after the introduction of a com- mercial computerized physician order entry syst em, much less than previously reported for adults, and there was no change in the rate of injuries as a result of error. Several human- machine interface problems, particularly surroun ding selection and dosing of pediatric medi- cations, were identified. Additional refinements could lead to greater e ffects on error rates. Observasjonsstudier Abramson EL, Barron Y, Quaresimo J, Kaushal R. Electronic prescribing within an electronic health record reduces ambulatory prescribing errors . Joint Commis- sion journal on quality and patient safety / Joint Commission Resources 2011;37(10):470- 478. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Health policy forc es are promoting the adoption of interop- erable electronic health records (EHRs) with electronic prescribing (e-prescribing). Despite the promise of EHRs with e-prescribing to improv e medication safety in ambulatory care set- tings--where most prescribing occurs and where errors are common--few studies have demonstrated its effectiveness. A study was conducted to assess th e effect of an e-prescribing system with clinical decision support, including checks for drug allergies and drug-drug in- teractions, that was integrated within an EHR on rates of ambulatory prescribing errors., METHODS: In a prospective study using a nonran domized, pre-post design with concurrent controls, 6 providers who used a commercial e-prescribing system were compared with 15 providers who remained paper-based from Sept ember 2005 through July 2008. Prescribing errors were identified by a standardized prescription and chart review., RESULTS: Some 2,432 paper prescriptions at baseline and 2,079 prescriptions at one year were analyzed. Er- ror rates for e-prescribing adopters decreased 1.5-fold--from 26.0 errors per (95% confidence interval [CI] , 17.4-38.9) to 16.0 errors per 100 prescrip- tions at one year (95% CI, 12.7-20.2; p = .09). Error rates remained unchanged for non- adopters (37.3 per 100 prescriptions at baseline , 95% CI, 27.6-50.2, versus 38.4 per 100 pre- scriptions at one year, 95% CI 27.4-53.9; p = .5 4). Error rates for e-prescribing adopters were significantly lower than for nonadopters at one year (p < .001). Illegibility errors were high at baseline and eliminated by e-prescribing., CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary findings from this small group of providers suggest that e- prescribing systems may decrease ambulatory prescribing errors, which are occurring at hi gh rates among community-based providers. 63 Beeler PE, Kucher N, Blaser J. Sustained impact of electronic computerised physician order entry (CPOE) increase adequate thromboprophylaxis orders among hospitalised medical patients. It remains unclear whether eAlert s maintain their efficacy over time, after withdrawal of con- tinuing medical education (CME) on eAlerts an d on thromboprophylaxis indications from the study staff. We analysed 5,317 hospital case s from the University Hospital Zurich during 2006-2009: 1,854 cases from a medical ward with eAlerts (interventiongroup) and 3,463 cases from a surgical ward without eAlerts (con trolgroup). In the intervention group, an eAl- ert with hospital-specific venous thromboemb olism (VTE) prevention guidelines was issued in the electronic patient chart 6 hours after ad mission if no pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis had been ordered. Data we re analysed for three phases: pre-implemen- tation (phase 1), eAlert implementation with CME (phase 2), and post-implementation with- out CME (phase3). The rates of thromboprophylax is in the intervention group were 43.4% in phase 1 and 66.7% in phase 2 (p<0.001), and in creased further to 73.6% in phase3 (p=0.011). Early thromboprophylaxis orders within 12 hour s after admission were more often placed in phase 2 and 3 as compared to phase 1 (67.1% vs. 52.1%, p<0.001). In the surgical control group, the thromboprophylaxis rates in th e three phases were 88.6%, 90.7%, 90.6% (p=0.16). Advanced eAlerts may provide sustaine d efficacy over time, with stable rates of thromboprophylaxis orders among hospitalised medical patients.

Impact of com- puterized physician order entry on medica tion prescription errors in the inten- sive care cross-sectional trial . Crit Care 2006;10(1):R21. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Medication errors in the intensive care unit (ICU) are fre- quent and lead to attributable patient morbidity and mortality, increased length of ICU stay and substantial extra costs. We investigated if the introduction of a computerized ICU system (Centricity Critical Care Clinisoft, GE Health care) reduced the incidence and severity of med- ication prescription errors (MPEs)., METHODS: A prospective trial was conducted in a pa- per-based unit (PB-U) versus a computerized un it (C-U) in a 22-bed ICU of a tertiary univer- sity hospital. Every medication order and medication prescription error was validated by a clinical pharmacist. The registration of differe nt classes of MPE was done according to the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Pr evention guidelines. An independent panel evaluated the severity of MPEs. We identified three groups: minor MPEs (no potential to cause harm); intercepted MPEs (potential to cause harm but inter- cepted on time); and serious MPEs (non-intercepted potential adverse drug events (ADE) or ADEs, being MPEs with potential to cause, or actually causing, patient harm)., RESULTS: The C-U and the PB-U each contained 80 patien t-days, and a total of 2,510 medication pre- scriptions were evaluated. The clinical phar macist identified 375 MPEs. The incidence of MPEs was significantly lower in the C-U compared with the PB-U (44/1286 (3.4%) versus 331/1224 (27.0%); < 0.001). sign ificantly less minor MPEs in the C-U than in the PB-U (9 versus 225; P < 0.001). Intercepte d MPEs were also lower in the C-U (12 versus 46; P < 0.001), as well as the non-intercepted potential ADEs (21 versus 48; P < 0.001). There was also a reduction of ADEs (2 in the C- U versus 12 in the PB-U; P < 0.01). No fatal errors occurred. The most frequent drug cla sses involved were cardiovascular medication and antibiotics in both groups. Patients with renal failure experienced less dosing errors in the C-U versus the PB-U (12 versus 35 serious MPEs; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The ICU computerization, including the medication order entry, resulted in a significant decrease in the occurrence and severity of me dication errors in the ICU.

Research in social & administrat ive pharmacy : RSAP 2014;10(5):756- 767. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies ha ve demonstrated that computerized phy- sician order entry (CPOE) of prescriptions re duces both turnaround time (TAT) and medica- tion errors. However, these stud ies have been performed primar ily in large academic centers with a relatively small number of medication orders. As such, many studies investigating the impact of CPOE on the level of pharmacist inte rvention have yielded conflicting results., OB- JECTIVE: The objective of this study was to ex amine the effects of CPOE on medication or- der TAT and the frequency of medication orders requiring pharmacist intervention in a com- munity-based medical center., METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a community-based medical center. A total of 24 ,767 prescriptions written for 940 patients over a six-month period were st ratified into CPOE or non-CP OE (handwritten) cohorts. TAT between cohorts were tested usin g analysis of variance and Tukey's Honestly Significant Dif- ference test. The number of orders requiring pharmacist intervention was compared between cohorts and tested using chi-squa re test or Fisher's exact test . Medication orders requiring pharmacist intervention were stratified by patient characteristics, therapeutic class, and types of medication error., RESULTS: Medication orders not using CPOE were approxi-mately 8 times more likely to require pharmacist intervention (2.26% versus 0.29%; P < 0.001), with the majority of pharmacist interventions performed to prevent medication er- rors. The overall mean TAT for medication or ders was significantly shorter in the CPOE group in comparison with the non-CPOE group (22.2 +/- 86.5 min versus 81 +/- 256.7 P < 0.001). CPOE orders nearly eliminated me dication errors with wrong dosage forms and formulary issues., CONCLUSIONS: Medication orders entered via CPOE are associated with a significant reduction in medication TAT and le ss likely to require pharmacist intervention. Use of CPOE may improve quality of patient care and efficiency of health care delivery.Copy- right \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Farmacia Hospitalaria 2005;29(4):228-235. Abstract: Objective: Electronic a basic measure for the pre- vention and reduction of medications errors. The goal of this survey was to assess the inci- dence of errors occurring with electronic ve rsus standard prescription. Method: A prospec- tive, sequential, open-label study to assess errors with electronic prescribing as compared to traditional manual prescribing in two public ho spitals in Balearic Islands. Errors regarding medication, diet and/or nursing orders were assesses along four process stages: medical pre- scription, pharmacy transcription/validation, nursing transcription, and dispensation. Re- sults: With manual prescription 1,576 errors/1 8,539 therapy orders (8.50%) were identified, whereas with electronic prescription 827 e rrors/18,885 therapy orders (4.38%) were de- tected, which represents a relative risk reduct ion by 48% and an absolute risk reduction by 4.12% (p < 0.0001). Pharmacy transcription/vali dation errors decreased (1.73 vs. 0.13%, p < 0.0001), as did nursing transcription errors (2.54 us. 0.81%, p < 0.0001) and dispensation errors (2.13 vs. 0.96%, p < 0.0001); however, the number of prescription errors (2.10 vs. 2.40%, p = 0.0401). Conclusions: Electr onic prescription is a powerful tool, and one that in this work was shown to decrease medicati on-, diet-, and nursing care-related errors in a highly significant way; however, it should be developed and maintained in order to achieve safety and effectiveness as requ ired by drug usage.

Krankenhauspharmazie 2012;33(11):476-479. Abstract: It mputerized physician order entry (CPOE) sig- nificantly improves medication safety. However, recently conflicting results have been re- ported in the literature [1, 4, 5, 6]. Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the implementation of CPOE on the individual steps of the medication process. For this pur- 65 pose incomplete prescriptions and the number of deviations from the physician's prescrip- tion and specifications of the manufacturer were identified on two wards (ward A = hand- written prescription, ward B = computerized pr escription). For this study only oral drugs were considered. Twelve criteria to judge the medication process have been included. On ward A a total of 1,155 and on ward B a total of 1,855 medications were checked. During the investigation we found 647 (56%) deviations on ward A and 720 (38,8%) on ward B. Differ- ences regarding the identity of administered product and the physician's prescription were 10,4% on ward A versus 43,8% on ward B. Ou r study demonstrates that implementation of CPOE does generally decrease the number of medication errors caused by inaccurate pre- scription.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate the impact of computerised chemotherapy prescription on the reduction of medication errors. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of errors present in electronic versus manual prescription., MA- TERIAL AND METHODS: The data gathered from computerised chemotherapy prescription sheets were submitted to a prospective analysis as cases of the intervention groups. The con- trol group was comprised of the handwritten chemotherapy prescription sheets. Chemother- apy prescriptions for consecutive oncology patients were analysed by 2 independent examin-ers, who investigated errors of omission, commi ssion, interpretation of dates, abbreviations and illegible handwriting. The pr oportion of treatment prescriptions containing one or more errors and the median of errors were calculated in order in both groups., RESULTS: At least one error was detected in 100% of the manual prescriptions and in 13% of computerised pre- scriptions (p < 0.001). The median of errors per computerised prescription was 0 (range: 0- 1), whereas in manual prescriptions the median was 5 (range: 1-12) (p < 0.001). Errors of omission were predominant in manual prescripti ons. Errors of commission were limited to 1 case of unjustified cytostatic agent infra-dosa ge in a computerised prescription. This error was present in 3 cases in handwr itten prescriptions and, in addi tion, 1 case of premedication drug substitution was detected. Errors of interp retation of the date, use of abbreviations and illegible handwriting were frequent among manu al prescriptions and were absent from com- puterised prescriptions., CONCLUSIONS: Electr onic chemotherapy prescription is a power- ful tool. In this study it has been shown to de crease chemotherapy-related medication errors and ensure that safe chemothe rapy practices were followed. King WJ, Paice N, Rangrej GJ, Swartz R. The effect of computerized physi- cian order entry on medication errors an d adverse drug events in pediatric in- patients . Pediatrics 2003;112(3 Pt 1):506-509. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Computerized physic ian order entry (CPOE) has the potential to reduce patient injury resulting from medicati on errors. We assessed the impact of a CPOE system on medication errors and adverse drug events (ADEs) in pediatric inpatients., DE- SIGN: A retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Tertiary care pediatric hospital., PARTICI- PANTS: Pediatric inpatients on 3 medical and 2 surgical wards., INTERVENTION: CPOE system implemented on 2 medical wards and compared with 1 medical and 2 surgical wards that continued to use hand written orders., OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of medication er- ror and ADEs before and after CPOE implementation., RESULTS: In 6 years, a total of 804 medication errors were identified with 18 ADEs, resulting in patient injury among 36 103 discharges and 179 183 patient days. The overa ll medication error rate (MER) was 4.49 per 1000 patient days. Before the introduction of CPOE, the MERs of the intervention versus control wards were indi stinguishable (ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76, 1.13). After the introduction of CPOE, the MER was 40% lower on the intervention than on the control wards (ratio = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.74). On average, 490 patient days are re-quired to see the benefit of one less medication error using CPOE. We did not demonstrate a similar effect of CPOE for ADEs (ratio of ra te ratios = 1.30; 95% CI 0.47, 3.52)., CONCLU- SIONS: The introduction of a commercially avai lable physician computer order entry system was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of medication errors but not ADEs in an inpatient pediatric population. 66 Lopez Sanchez P, Heredia Benito M, Jerez Fernan dez E, Seisdedos Elcuaz R, Ruiz Martin De La Torre R, Conde Garcia MC, et al. Dispensing error rate in a tertiary hospital . Euro- pean Journal of Hospital 20 12;19 (2):122-123. Abstract: Background: The ward drug trolley process is error-prone so therefore phar- macists should take measure to recognise and prevent them. Purpose: To evaluate the rates and types of dispensing errors (DE) during the drug trolley process. Materials and methods: Prospective observational study. Data were collected for 44 working days in 2009 and 2010. The hospital had 350 beds with seven medical and four surgical wards. 84.3% of beds use a unit-dose dispensing system (UDDS) plus itten computerised prescription orde r entry (UDDS-CPOE). Each day pharmacists randomly selected one or two trolleys and chec ked them. Dispensing errors were classified as: Type 1: wrong patient, Type 2: omission of drug, Type 3: drug not prescribed, Type 4: Wrong dose, route or dosage form and Type 5: Quantity error. The authors calculated the dispensing error rate (DER) by dividing DE by the opportunities for error (OE: total units dispensed+doses prepared in the drug trolleys). Results: The observations were conducted on 56 drug trolleys (1928 beds): 36 medical an d 20 surgical, 14 428 total of doses prepared and dispensed (OE). 137 DEs were detected: 1.46 % (2) type 1, 40.15% (55) type 2, 32.17% (44) type 3, 13.14% (18) type 4 and 13.14% (18) type 5. Th e most frequent errors are type 2 and type 3, related to the prescription changes after the drug trolley process. The DE rate was 0.95% (137 of 14,428). The DE rate in UDDS -WT was 0.91% (117 of 12868) and in UDDS- CPOE it was 1.28% (20 of 1560). Conclusions Th e short period of our study and the great dif- ference in the methodology used in other studies hinder the comparison with their results. Although there are almost no differences between our DE rate in the two modalities of dis-pensing, it was not possible to compare them as the OE varied substantially. Despite the fact that the DE rate was low, recognising the incidence and types of medication errors allows us to analyse the causes to help achieve maximum patient safety. Mattsson TO, Holm B, Michelsen H, Knudsen JL, Abstract: Background: The incidence of no n-intercepted prescription errors and the risk factors involved, including the impact of computerised order entry (CPOE) systems on such errors, are unknown. Our objective was to determine the incidence, type, severity, and related risk factors of non-inte rcepted prescription dose errors . Patients and methods: A pro- spective, comparative cohort study in two clin ical oncology units. One institution used a CPOE system with no connection to the electronic patient record system, while the other used paper-based prescription forms. All standa rd prescriptions were included and reviewed. Doses were recalculated accordin g to the guidelines of each institution, using the patient data as documented in the patient record, the paper-based prescription form, or the CPOE sys-tem. A non-intercepted prescription dose error was defined as >10% difference between the administered and the recalculated dose. Results: Data were collected from 1 November 2012 to 15 January 2013. A total of 5767 prescriptions were evaluated, 2677 from the institution using CPOE and 3090 from the institution wi th paper-based prescription. Crude analysis showed an overall risk of a prescription dose error of 1.73 per 100 prescriptions. CPOE re- sulted in 1.60 and paper-based prescription form s in 1.84 errors per 100 prescriptions, i.e. odds ratio (OR) = 0.87 [95% co nfidence interval (CI) 0.59- 1. 29, P = 0.49]. Fifteen different types of errors and four potential risk factors were identified. None of the dose errors re- sulted in the death of the patient. Conclusion(s ): Non-intercepted prescribing dose errors oc- curred in <2% of the prescriptions. The parallel CPOE system did not significantly reduce the overall risk of dose errors, and although it re duced the risk of calculation errors, it intro- duced other errors. Strategies to prevent future prescription e rrors could usefully focus on integrated computerised systems that can aid do se calculations and reduce transcription er- rors between databases. Mattsson TO, Holm B, Michelsen Brixen Herrstedt J. Prevalence of prescribing errors resulting in administ ration of incorrect dosages of plastic treatment . prevalence of non-intercepted prescribing errors and the impact of computerized order entry systems (CPOE) in preventing such errors are not known. Our objective was to evaluate both prevalence and severity of non-intercepted pre- scription dose errors as well as the impact of a CPOE system on these in a setting of adult 67 cancer patients. Methods: A prospective observat ional case control study in two clinical on- cology units. One institution used a parallel CPOE system with no connection to the elec- tronic patient chart data, while the other used paper based prescription forms. All standard prescriptions from both institutions were incl uded and reviewed. Doses were recalculated ac- cording to the guidelines of each of the institutions using the patient data as documented in the chart, on the paper based form or in the CP OE system at the time of prescription. A non- intercepted prescription dose error was defi ned as > 10% difference between the adminis- tered and the recalculated dose. Main outcome measures were prevalence and severity of prescription errors using validated harm catego ries. Results: Data were collected from No- vember 1, 2012 til January 31, 2013. A total of 5,767 physician prescriptions were evaluated. 2,677 from the institution using CPOE and 3090 from the institution with paper based pre- scription forms. Crude analysis showed an overall risk of a prescription dose error of 1.73 per 100 prescriptions. CPOE resulted in 1.60 and pa per based prescription forms in 1.84 errors per 100 prescriptions. OR = 0.87 (95%CI 0.59 -1.29, P=0.49). Furthermore, no significant difference between institutions in severity of errors was observed. Conclusions: Non-inter- cepted prescribing dose errors are relatively common in clinical oncology units. Non inte- grated CPOE systems without decision support do not seem to significantly reduce the risk of prescription errors or affect severity of errors. Based on the results of this study strategies to prevent future prescription errors are highly warranted. Oliven A, Michalake I, Zalman D, Dorman E, Yeshurun D, Odeh M. Prevention of pre- scription errors by computerized, on-l ine surveillance of drug order entry . Int J Med Inform 2005;74(5):377-386. Abstract: Aims: The present study was undert aken to quantify the impact of computer- ized drug order entry system (CDOE) connected to the patients' database, on the incidence and type of prescription errors (PEs) in the me dical service, and to delineate the causes for remaining errors. Methods: Drug orders were re viewed daily by a physician-reviewer, in a department of internal medicine that used for more than 3 years a CDOE (CDOEdept), and in a similar department in wh ich drug orders were handwritten (HWdept). PEs were divided into those not related to the individual patient (type 1 PEs), and PEs resulting from drug-la- boratory, drug-disease, and drug-allergy intera ctions (type 2 PEs). Results: Ten thousand and two hospitalization days were evaluated. The incidence of type 1 PEs was 5.21 and 1.36 per 100 hospitalization days in the HWdept an d CDOEdept, respectively (p < 0.0001). Type 2 PEs were more common, 7.20 and 3.02 per 100 hospitalization days in the HWdept and CDOEdept, respectively (p < 0.0001), and abou t 75% of them were due to few drug-labora- tory interactions. Most of the remaining errors in the CDOEdept were due to inadequate ad- justment of drugs and doses to renal function, or failure to perform adequate changes when new laboratory results became available. Conclusions: We conclude that linking the CDOE with few, specific, laboratory results has a larg e impact on the prevention of PEs. Combining the CDOE with a drug-laboratory alert system is expected to further reduce the incidence of PEs. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

PLoS One 2014;9(8). Abstract: The knowledge of me dication errors is an esse ntial prerequisite for better healthcare delivery. The present study investigat ed prescribing errors in prescriptions from outpatient departments (OPDs) and emergency wa rds of two public sector hospitals in La- hore, Pakistan. A manual prescription system was followed in Hospital A. Hospital B was running a semi-computerised prescription syst em in the OPD and a fully computerised pre- scription system in the emergency ward. A total of 510 prescriptions from both departments of these two hospitals were evaluated for patient characteristics, demographics and medica- tion errors. The data was analysed using a chi square test for comparison of errors between both the hospitals. The medical departments in OPDs of both hospitals were the highest pre- scribers at 45%-60%. The age group receiving the most treatment in emergency wards of both the hospitals was 21-30 years (21%-24%). A trend of omitting patient addresses and di- agnoses was observed in almost all prescription s from both of the hospitals. Nevertheless, patient information such as name, age, gender and legibility of the prescriber's signature were found in almost 100% of th e electronic-prescriptions. In addition, no prescribing error was found pertaining to drug concentrations, quantity and rate of administration in e-pre- scriptions. The total prescribing errors in the OPD and emergency ward of Hospital A were found to be 44% and 60%, respectively. In hospital B, the OPD had 39% medication errors 68 and the emergency department had 73.5% errors; this unexpected difference between the emergency ward and OPD of hospital B was main ly due to the inclusion of 69.4% omissions of route of administration in the prescription s. The incidence of prescription overdose was approximately 7%-19% in the manual system an d approximately 8% in semi and fully elec- tronic system. The omission of information and incomplete information are contributors of prescribing errors in both manual and elec tronic prescriptions. \u00a9 2014 Riaz et al.

Int J Emerg Med 2013;6(1):20. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems are designed to increase safety and improve quality of care; however, their impact on efficiency in the ED has not yet been validated. This study examined the impact of CPOE on process times for medication delivery, laboratory utilization and diagnostic imaging in the early, late and control phases of a regional ED-CPOE implementation., METHODS:, SETTING: Three tertiary care hospitals serving a population in excess of 1 million inhabitants that initiated the same CPOE system during the same 3-week time window. Patients were stratified into three groupings: Control, Early CPOE and Late CPOE (n = 200 patients per group/hospital site). Eligible patients consisted of a strati fied (40% CTAS 2 and 60% CTAS 3) random sam- ple of all patients seen 30 days preceding CPOE implementation (Control), 30 days immedi-ately after CPOE implementation (Early CPOE ) and 5-6 months after CPOE implementation (Late CPOE). Primary outcomes were time to (TT) from physician assignment (MD-sign) up to MD-order completion. An ANOVA and t-test were employed for statistical analysis., RE- SULTS: In comparison with control, TT 1st MD -Ordered Medication decreased in both the Early and Late CPOE groups (102.6 min control, 62.8 Early and 65.7 late, p < 0.001). TT 1st MD-ordered laboratory results increased in bo th the Early and Late CPOE groups compared to Control (76.4, 85.3 and 73.8 min, respectively, p < 0.001). TT 1st X-Ray also significantly increased in both the Early and Late CPOE grou ps (80.4, 84.8 min, respectively, compared to < 0.001). Given that CT and ultras ound imaging inherently takes increased time, these imaging studies were not included, and on ly X-ray was examined. There was no statis- tical difference found between TT discharge and consult request., CONCLUSIONS: Regional implementation of CPOE afforded important effi ciencies in time to me dication delivery for high acuity ED patients. Increased times obse rved for laboratory and radiology results may reflect system issues outside of the emergency department and as a result of potential con-founding may not be a refl ection of CPOE impact.

Abstract: This study assesses the impact of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) implementation in pediatric hospitals on reported adverse drug events. Using a nested matched case-control design; we linked CPOE implementation information from the health information management systems society anal ytics database with reported adverse drug event (ADE) from the national association of children's hospitals and related institutions case mix comparative data program. Differences were examined using univariate and multi- variate conditional logistic regression analyses . Patients from CPOE hospitals were more fre- quently seen in larger hospital s have more co-morbidities than those from non-CPOE hospi- tals. When matched by admitting diagnosis, age, gender and race, ADE cases were associated with more reported co-morbidi ties, and were reported less fr equently in hospitals with CPOE. Patients from hospitals without CPOE were 42% more likely to experience reportable ADE after adjusting for the presence of co-mor bidities. In conclusion, we found significant beneficial associations between reportable AD E and CPOE adoption in a representative sam- ple of pediatric hospitals.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2013;20(2):305-310. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate system s for estimating and preventing wrong-pa- tient electronic orders in computerized p hysician order entry systems with a two-phase 69 study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In phase 1, from May to August 2010, the effective- ness of a 'retract-and-reorder' measurement tool was assessed that identified orders placed on a patient, promptly retracted, and then reor dered by the same provider on a different pa- tient as a marker for wrong-patient electronic or ders. This tool was then used to estimate the frequency of wrong-patient electronic orders in four hospitals in 2009. In phase 2, from De- cember 2010 to June 2011, a th ree-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted to eval- uate the efficacy of two distinct interventions aimed at preventing these errors by reverifying patient identification: an 'ID-verify alert', and an 'ID-reentry The re- tract-and-reorder measurement tool effectively id entified 170 of 223 events as wrong-patient electronic orders, resulting in a positive predic tive value of 76.2% (95% CI 70.6% to 81.9%). this tool it was estimated that 5246 electr onic orders were placed on wrong patients in 2009. In phase 2, 901 776 ordering sessions among 4028 providers were examined. Com- pared with control, the ID-verify alert reduce d the odds of a retract-and-reorder event (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98), but the ID-reentry function reduced the odds by a larger magni- tude (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Wrong-patient electronic orders occur frequently with comput erized provider order entry systems, and elec- tronic interventions can reduce th e risk of these errors occurring.

Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a computerized Drug Renal Alert Pharmacy (DRAP) program could decrease the rate of medication errors in drug selection or dosing for 15 target drugs in patients with renal insufficiency., DESIGN: Randomized, con- trolled, population-based effectiveness trial., SETTING: A large integrated health care deliv-ery system., PATIENTS: A total of 32,917 health plan members who were at least 18 years old, had an estimated creatinine clearance of 50 ml/minute or lower, and were not receiving dialysis between December 1, 2003, and Februa ry 28, 2005, were randomly assigned to ei- ther the intervention group (16,577 patients) or usual care (control) group (16,340 patients). Of the 32,917 patients, 6125 patients (3025 in the intervention group and 3100 in the usual care group) were prescribed at least one target drug and were included in the analysis., IN- TERVENTION: A computerized tool--the DRAP pr ogram--was used to alert pharmacists at the time of dispensing to possible errors in target drug selection and dosing for patients with renal insufficiency. The 15 target drugs were previously identified based on frequency of use in our health care system and risk of serious adverse events., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of medication errors, defined as target drugs that should be avoided or were dosed in appropriately, in the intervention and usual care groups. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adop tion, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used to evaluate the intervention's potential for translation and generalizabil- ity. Among the 6125 patients who received a target drug, no significant differences were noted in age, sex, creatinine clearance, comorbid conditions, and number of target drugs be-tween groups at baseline. Over the 15-month in tervention period, the proportion of medica- tion errors was significantly lower in the inte rvention group than the usual care group (33% vs 49%, p<0.001). After the study period, when the intervention was expanded to both groups, a 20% reduction in errors was sustained in the combined groups over the subsequent 7 months., CONCLUSION: The DRAP program was successful in reducing medication errors for patients with renal insufficiency in an ambulatory setting and was demonstrated to have sustainability after study completion. Duke JD, Li X, Dexter P. Adherence to drug-drug interaction alerts in high-risk pa- tients: a trial of context-enhanced alerting . Journal of the American Medical JA MIA 2013;20(3):494-498. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerting is an important form of clinical decision support, yet physicians often fail to attend to critical DDI warnings due to alert fatigue. We previously described a model for highlighting patients at high risk of a DDI by enhancing alerts with relevant laboratory data. We sought to evaluate the effect of this model on alert adherence in high-risk patients., METHODS: A 6-month randomized con-trolled trial involving 1029 outpatient physic ians was performed. The target interactions were all DDIs known to cause hyperkalemia. Alerts in the intervention group were enhanced with the patient's most recent potassium and creatinine levels. The control group received unmodified alerts. High -risk patients were those with baseline potassium >5.0 mEq/l 70 and/or creatinine >1.5 mg/dl (132 mumol/l)., RESULTS: We found no significant difference in alert adherence in high-risk patients between the intervention group (15.3%) and the con- trol group (16.8%) (p=0.71). Adherence in normal risk patients was significantly lower in the intervention group (14.6%) than in the contro l group (18.6%) (p<0.01). In neither group did physicians increase adherence in patients at high risk., CONCLUSIONS: Physicians adhere poorly to hyperkalemia-associated DDI alerts even in patients with risk factors for a clinically significant interaction, and the display of releva nt laboratory data in these alerts did not im- prove adherence levels in the outpatient setting. Further research is necessary to determine optimal strategies for conveying patient-specific DDI risk. Palen TE, Raebel M, Lyons E, Magid DM. Evaluation of laboratory monitoring alerts within a computerized physician order entry system for medication orders . The American journal of managed care 2006;12(7):389-395. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Errors involvin g medication use are common. Computer- ized physician order entry (CPOE) can improve prescribing practices. Few studies have ex- amined the effect of CPOE in combination with decision support tool s on prescribing prac- tices in the outpatient setting. Less is known about prescribers' adherence to laboratory mon- itoring recommendations., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if reminders presented during CPOE for medications would increase physicians' compliance with guidelines for laboratory monitor- ing at initiation of therapy., STUDY DESIGN: Randomized prospective intervention study., METHODS: Two hundred seven primary care physicians in a group-model managed care or- ganization were randomized to receive or no t receive drug laboratory monitoring alerts within the CPOE system. Adherence to laborato ry monitoring recommend ations for patients prescribed selected medications was compared between physician groups., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the control and intervention group physicians in the overall rate of compliance with ordering th e recommended laboratory monitoring for pa- tients prescribed study medications. Laboratory monitoring was performed as recommended 56.6% of the time in the intervention group compared with 57.1% of the time in the control group (P = .31). In cases in which a statistica lly significant difference was demonstrated, im- proved compliance favored the intervention grou p CONCLUSIONS: As CPOE becomes more prevalent, additional research is needed to determine effective decision support tools. These findings then should be communicated to the developers and users of computerized medical record systems. Raebel MA, Charles J, Dugan J, Carroll NM, Korner EJ, Brand DW, et al. Randomized trial to improve prescribing safe ty in ambulatory elderly patients . J Am Geriatr Soc 2007;55(7):977-985. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine whethe r a computerized tool that alerted phar- macists when patients aged 65 and older were newly prescribed potentially inappropriate medications was effective in decreasing the pr oportion of patients dispensed these medica- tions., DESIGN: Prospective, randomized SETTING: U.S. health maintenance organi- zation., PARTICIPANTS: All 59,680 health pl an members aged 65 and older were random- ized to intervention (n=29,840) or usual care (n=29,840). Phar macists received alerts on all patients randomized to intervention who were newly prescribed a targeted medication., IN- TERVENTION: Prescription and age information were linked to alert pharmacists when a patient aged 65 and older was newly prescribed one of 11 medications that are potentially in- appropriate in older people., MEASUREMENTS: Physicians and pharmacists collaborated to develop the targeted medication list, indications for medication use for which an interven-tion should occur, intervention guidelines and scripts, and to implement the intervention., RESULTS: Over the 1-year study, 543 (1.8%) intervention group patients aged 65 and older were newly dispensed prescriptions for target ed medications, compared with 644 (2.2%) usual care group patients (P=.002). For medication use indications in which an intervention should occur, dispensings of amitriptyline (P<.001) and diazepam (P=.02) were reduced., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a computerized pharmacy alert system plus collaboration between health care professionals in decreasing potentially inappropriate medication dispensings in elderly patients. Coupling data available from infor- mation systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can improve prescribing safety in patients aged 65 and older. 71 Redwood S, Ngwenya NB, Hodson J, Ferner RE, Coleman JJ. Effects of a computerized feedback intervention on safety performa nce by junior doctors: results from a randomized mixed method study . BMC Med Inform Decis Mak 2013;13:63. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The behaviour of doctors and their responses to warnings can inform the effective design of Clinical De cision Support Systems. We used data from a University hospital electronic prescribing and la boratory reporting system with hierarchical warnings and alerts to explore junior doctors' behaviour. The objective of this trial was to es- tablish whether a Junior Doctor Dashboard pro viding feedback on prescription warning in- formation and laboratory alerting acceptance ra tes was effective in changing junior doctors' behaviour., METHODS: A mixed methods approach was employed which included a parallel group randomised controlled trial, and individu al and focus group interviews. Junior doctors below the specialty trainee level 3 grade were recruited and randomised to two groups. Every doctor (N=42) in the intervention group was e- mailed a link to a personal dashboard every week for 4 months. Nineteen participated in interviews. The 44 control doctors did not re- ceive any automated feedback. The outcome measures were the difference in responses to prescribing warnings (of two severities) and la boratory alerting (of two severities) between the months before and the months during the intervention, analysed as the difference in per- formance between the intervention and the control groups., RESULTS: No significant differ- ences were observed in the rates of generating prescription warnings, or in the acceptance of laboratory alarms. However, responses to labo ratory alerts differed between the pre-inter- vention and intervention periods. For the doctors of Foundation Year 1 grade, this improve- ment was significantly (p=0.002) greater in the group with access to the dashboard (53.6% ignored pre-intervention compared to 29.2% post intervention) than in the control group (47.9% ignored pre-intervention compared to 47 .0% post intervention). Qualitative interview data indicated that while junior doctors were positive about the electronic prescribing func- tions, they were discriminating in the way they responded to other alerts and warnings given that from their perspective these were not alwa ys immediately clinically relevant or within the scope of their responsibility., CONCLUSIONS: We have only been able to provide weak evidence that a clinical dashboard providing indi vidualized feedback data has the potential to improve safety behaviour and only in one of several domains. The construction of metrics used in clinical dashboards must take accoun t of actual work processes., TRIAL REGISTRA- TION ISRCTN: ISRCTN72253051. Controlled trial Garcia DA, Highfill J, Finnerty K, Varoz E, McConkey S, Hutchinson K, et al. A prospec- tive, controlled trial of a pharmacy-d riven alert system to increase thrombo- prophylaxis rates in . Blood Abstract: Although venous thromboembolis m is an important cause of morbidity and mortality within the hospital, a significant prop ortion of at-risk inpatients do not receive measures known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a pharmacy-driven alert system would, compared to usual care, be associated wi th a higher rate of adequate venous thrombo- embolism prevention measures among at-risk inpatients on a general internal medicine ser- vice. The study was a prospective, controlled tria l set at a university-based teaching hospital. The participants were adults who were admitted (Monday through Friday) to the general in- ternal medicine inpatient service from 19 June to 21 September 2006. Their treatment in-cluded a pharmacist assessment of venous thromboembolism risk and a pharmacist-driven alert to the treating physician. The Proportion of at-risk patients receiving adequate throm- boprophylaxis within 36 h of admission was reco rded. Overall, 140 patients were at sufficient risk for venous thromboembolis m to be included. In the usual care group, prophylactic measures were ordered for 49 (61%) of the 80 pa tients at moderate to high risk. In the phar- macist-alert group, 44 (73%) of the 60 modera high venous thromboembolism-risk pa- tients received adequate thromboprophylaxis (P = 0.15). Although we did not observe a sta- tistically significant difference between the grou ps, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that alert systems can increa se the proportion of hospitalized patients who receive adequate measures to prevent venous thromboembolism.

Arch Intern Med 2006;166(5):498-504. 72 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many managed care organizations use feedback based on electronically maintained claims data to alert physicians to potential treatment problems, in- cluding patient medication nonadherence. However, the efficacy of such interventions for improving adherence among patients treated for depression is unknown., METHODS: We examined an antidepressant compliance program consisting of faxed alerts to physicians be- ginning May 2003 using interrupted time series analysis to evaluate its impact on rates of antidepressant adherence between May 2002 and May 2004 among members of the man- aged care plan of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, wh ich is a health plan op erating in 3 states in New England, with corporate headquarters in Wellesley, Mass. The program alerted pre- scribing physicians to patients with gaps of mo re than 10 days in refilling antidepressant pre- scriptions during the first 180 days of treatment. Our outcome measures were rates of non- adherence among patients with refill gaps of mo re than 10 days (\"delayed refill\") and propor- tion of days without treatment within the firs t 180 days of treatment., RESULTS: A total of 13 128 patients (> or = 18 years of age) wh o were starting treatment with antidepressants met the study criteria. Rates of nonadherence among patients with delayed refills remained constant (P = .22) over the 2-year study pe riod, averaging 75% (95% confidence interval, 72.7%-77.3%). Rates of antidepressant nonadher ence significantly increased over time (P = .04), with an average of 40% (95% confidence interval, 38.4%-41.6%) of days without dis- pensed antidepressants available during treatment episodes., CONCLUSIONS: Using real- time pharmacy information to alert physicians regarding patient adherence was not success-ful in increasing antidepressant adherence rates among members of the managed care plan. Effectiveness of electronically triggered, patien t-specific, faxed feedback should be carefully evaluated before widespread implementation, be cause faxes are insufficient as a stand-alone policy tool. Humphries TL, Carroll N, Chester EA, Magid D, Rocho B. Evaluation of an electronic critical drug interaction program coupled with active pharmacist intervention . The Annals of pharmacotherapy 2007;41(12):1979-1985. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Failure to detect si gnificant drug interactions may result in adverse outcomes. While proper screening and management of drug interactions can prevent the majority of adverse events, studies indicate that current practice is suboptimal. In the last quarter of 2001, physicians and pharmacists in Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a group model health maintenance organization, developed an electronic critical drug interaction alert pro- gram (CDIX). Electronic screening was coupled with active intervention to prevent dispens-ing of critically interacting drug combinations ., OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of CDIX on the co-dispensing of critically interact ing drug combinations., METHODS: A physician and team of outpatient pharmacists and clinical pharmacy staff developed a condensed list of critical drug interactions (8 drug combinations) to be included in the evaluation of CDIX. Monthly electronic outpatient pharmacy data were collected 20 months before and 37 months after CDIX implementation, with no lag period following implementation. Univari- ate analyses were completed to compare baseline subject characteristics of the pre- and post- CDIX groups using chi2 and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. Interrupted time series analysis was used to estimate changes in the rates of crit ical drug interactions., RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-seven instances of co-dis pensing were observed in 348 subjects during the pre-CDIX period and 256 instances of co-dispensing were observed in 248 subjects during the post- CDIX period. Following CDIX implementation, th e overall rate of co-dispensing dropped ab- ruptly from 21.3 to 14.7 per 10,000 prescription s, representing a relative decrease in co-dis- pensing of 31% from the month before CDIX im plementation (p = 0.01 25). Significant reduc- tions in co-dispensing were noted for 7 of the 8 drug class combinations., CONCLUSIONS: Employing an intervention system that limits electronic alerts regarding drug interactions to those deemed critical but that also requires pharmacist intervention and collaboration with the prescriber decreases the number of critical drug interactions dispensed.

AMIA Symposium proceedings / AMIA Symposium AMIA Symposium 2011;2011:1207-1216. Abstract: Medication errors are not unusua l in acute care settings. This prospective time series analysis/study evaluates the use of Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)/alerts in helping providers not to make errors, when putting in orders in a CPOE sys- tem. We reviewed electronic health records for all the inpatients coming to 5 community hos- pitals for a 6 months duration (July 2010 - December 2010). Respon ses to 9 synchronous alerts (CDSS tools) were studied, that were prompted on computer screens when providers 73 were putting in medication or ders in EMR. These alerts guided the providers regarding any drug duplications, interactions, contraindication s of the prescribed medicine with patient's clinical condition etc. The CDSS system in pl ace changed the physician behavior & patient therapy 41.75% of the times when medication orders were placed. These alerts substantially decreased the medication error rate/adverse drug events (ADE's) in the patients receiving care at these 5 hospitals. Simpao AF, Ahumada LM, Desai BR, et al. Optimiza- tion of drug-drug interaction alert rules in a pediatric hospital's electronic health record system using a visual analytics dashboard . Journal of the American Medical Informatics Associatio n : JAMIA 2015;22(2):361-369. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To develop and evalua te an electronic da shboard of hospital- wide electronic health record medication aler ts for an alert fatigue reduction quality im- provement project., METHODS: We used visual an alytics software to develop the dashboard. We collaborated with the hospital-wide Clin ical Decision Support committee to perform three interventions successively deactivating cl inically irrelevant drug-drug interaction (DDI) alert rules. We analyzed the impact of the interventions on care providers' and pharmacists' alert and override rates using an interrupted time series framework with piecewise regres- sion., RESULTS: We evaluated 2 391 880 medica tion alerts between January 31, 2011 and January 26, 2014. For pharmacists, the median alert rate prior to the first DDI deactivation was 58.74 alerts/100 following the three interventions (p<0.001). For providers, baseline median alert rate prior to the first round of DDI deactivation was 19.73 alerts/100 orders llowing the three interventions (p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis, we observed a decrease in pharmacists' override rates for DDI alerts that were not modified in the system from a median of 93.06 overrides/100 The medication seri- ous safety event rate decreased during the st udy period, and there were no serious safety events reported in association with the deactivated alert rules., CONCLUSIONS: An alert dashboard facilitated safe rapid-cycle reductions in alert burden that were temporally associ- ated with lower pharmacist override rates in a subgroup of DDIs not directly affected by the interventions; meanwhile, the pharmacists' frequency of selecting the 'cancel' option in- creased. We hypothesize that reducing the alert burden enabled pharmacists to devote more attention to clinically relevant alerts.Copyright \u00a9 The Author 2014.

Impact of the drug- drug interaction database SFINX on prev alence of potentially serious drug-drug interactions in . Eur J 2013;69(3):565-571. Abstract: PURPOSE: To integration of the drug-drug in- teraction database SFINX into primary health care records on the prevalence of potentially serious drug-drug interactions., METHODS: The study was a controlled before-and-after study on the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions before and after the implementa- tion of SFINX at 15 primary healthcare centre s compared with 5 centres not receiving the in- tervention. Data on dispensed prescriptions from health care centres were retrieved from the Swedish prescribed drug register and analysed for September-December 2006 (pre-interven- tion) and September-December 2007 (post-interv ention). All drugs dispensed during each 4 month period were regarded as potentially interacting., RESULTS: Use of SFINX was associ- ated with a 17% decrease, to 1.81 x 10(-3) from 2.15 x 10(-3) interactions per prescribed drug- drug pair, in the prevalence of potentially serious drug-drug interactions (p = 0.042), whereas no significant effect was observed in the control group. The change in prevalence of potentially serious drug-drug interactions did no t differ significantly between the two study groups. The majority of drug-drug interactions id entified were related to chelate formation., CONCLUSION: Prescriptions resulting in pote ntially serious drug-drug interactions were significantly reduced after integration of the dr ug-drug interaction database SFINX into elec- tronic health records in primary care. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the effec- tiveness of drug-drug interaction warning systems. 74 Cote GA, Rice JP, Bulsiewicz W, Norvell JP, Christensen K, Bobb A, et al. Use of physician education and computer alert to improv e targeted use of gastroprotection among NSAID users . American (GI) hemo rrhage accounts 200- 400,000 admissions in the United States annually . Around 50% of patients with bleeding ul- cer have used aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Misoprostol and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce NSAID-related upper GI tract complications in high-risk patients, but their targeted use may be suboptimal., AIM: To determine the im- pact of physician education, a computer alert, or both on the targeted use of GI prophylaxis in high-risk patients discharged from hospital., METHODS: To target high-risk patients, we studied cardiology telemetry and coronary care unit (CCU) services. Every 4th wk, 8 different residents managed these patients. Over a 32-wk period, residents were assigned to one of the four 8-wk groups sequentially: Group I: control; Group II: physician education, consisting of a 10-min tutorial on risk factors for NSAID- related GI complication s; Group III: computer alert; and Group IV: combination of tutorial an d computer alert. We reviewed all patients ad- mitted to these cardiology services during the study period. Exclusion criteria included dis- charge on no ulcerogenic medications, incomp lete discharge data, and inpatient death. Pa- tients readmitted during the study period we re not re-counted. Medical records were re- viewed for discharge medications, past medica l history, demographics, admission and dis- charge diagnoses, hospital days, and the Char lson comorbidity index. Other indications for acid suppression were docume nted. A chi(2) test was used to determine independence among all four groups., RESULTS: We enrolled 721 patients, of whom 120 (16.7%) were ex- cluded. The remaining 601 were divided by phys ician intervention group and risk for NSAID- related GI complications. In total, 270 of 601 (45%) patients were discharged home on ap- propriate gastroprotection. The overall use of gastroprotection increased from 43 to 61% with the combination of an electronic alert and physician education (P < 0.001); among PPI-naive patients, the rate increased from 26% to 55% (P < 0.0001). When stratified by known risk factors for GI complications of NSAIDs, the odds of receiving a gastroprotective pre- scription among PPI-naive patients was 1.6 with education alone, 1.8 with electronic alert alone, and 2.9 with the combination (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: The combination of a computer alert and brief physician education led to an increase in the use of gastroprotection among NSAID users at the time of discharge from hospital. This effect was most evident among high-risk, PPI-naive patients. Combining physician education and a computer alert appears to have an additive effect.

Jour- nal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2006;13(4):385-390. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Computerized physicia n order entry with clinical decision sup- port has been shown to improve medication safety in adult inpatients, but few data are avail- able regarding its usefulness in the long-term care setting. The objective of this study was to examine opportunities for improving medication sa fety in that clinical setting by determin- ing the proportion of medication orders that would generate a warning message to the pre- scriber via a computerized clinical decision su pport system and assessing the extent to which these alerts would affect prescribers' action s., DESIGN: The study was set within a random- ized controlled trial of computerized clinical decision support conducted in the long-stay units of a large, academically-affiliated long-t erm care facility. In March 2002, a computer- based clinical decision support system (CDSS) was added to an existing computerized physi- cian order entry (CPOE) pe order- ing drugs for residents on three resident-care unit s of the facility were presented with alerts; these alerts were not displayed to prescriber s in the four control units., MEASUREMENTS: We assessed the frequency of drug orders associat ed with various categories of alerts across all participating units of the facility. To assess the impact of actually receiving an alert on prescriber behavior during drug ordering, we ca lculated separately fo r the intervention and control units the proportion of the alerts, within each category, that were followed by an ap- propriate action and estimated the relative risk of an appropriate action in the intervention units compared to the control units., RESULTS: During the 12 months of the study, there were 445 residents on the part icipating units of the facility, contributing 3,726 resident- months of observation time. During this peri od, 47,997 medication orders were entered through the CPOE system-approximately 9 medica tion orders per reside nt per month. 9,414 75 alerts were triggered (2.5 alerts per resident -month). The alert categories most often trig- gered were related to risks of central nervou s system side-effects such as over-sedation (20%). Alerts for risk of drug-associated constipation (13%) or renal insufficiency/electrolyte imbalance (12%) were also common. Twelve percent of the alerts were related to orders for warfarin. Overall, prescribers who received alerts were only slightly more likely to take an ap- propriate action (relative risk 1.11, 95% confiden ce interval 1.00, 1.22). Alerts related to or- ders for warfarin or central nervous system side effects were most like ly to engender an ap- propriate action, such as ordering a recommend ed laboratory test or canceling an ordered drug., CONCLUSION: Long-term care facilities must implement new system-level ap- proaches with the potential to improve medication safety for their residents. The number of medication orders that triggered a warning messa ge in this study suggests that CPOE with a clinical decision support system may represen t one such tool. However, the relatively low rate of response to these alerts suggests that further refinements to such systems are re- quired, and that their impact on medication erro rs and adverse drug events must be carefully assessed. Malone DC, Saverno KR. Evaluation of a wireless handheld medication manage- ment device in the prevention of drug -drug interactions in a Medicaid popula- tion . Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP 2012;18(1):33-45. Abstract: BACKGROUND: With the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, widespread adoption of certain health infor- mation technologies, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic prescribing (e- prescribing), is imminent. Drug-drug interactio n (DDI) screening and medication history in- formation are commonly incorporated into heal th information exchange systems to improve medical decision making, safety, and quality of care, but the value of these features is un- clear., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of providing access to an early generation elec-tronic medication management program with medication history accessible to prescribers via a wireless handheld personal digital assistan t (PDA) device on the incidence of potential DDIs (i.e., DDIs that may or may not cause patient harm)., METHODS: This study employed a retrospective pre-intervention/post-interventi on study design with a comparison group to evaluate the effectiveness of a wireless handheld medication management program in pre-venting serious potential DDIs. Licensed prescr ibers in a state Medicaid program who wrote prescriptions during the period from August 2003 through June 2006 were included in this study. The intervention (PDA) group consisted of clinicians who requested and were granted access to the wireless handheld device containi ng prescription drug history between August 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005. Initially the devi ce contained 100-day patient-specific medica- tion history, but other functionalities were added during the study period including the abil- ity to check for drug-drug interactions and e-pr escribing. The comparison group consisted of prescribers who sent a request to obtain, but did not receive, the wireless handheld device during the same time period. Baseline prescrib ing patterns of 25 previously identified clini- cally important potential DDIs were assessed over two 12-month periods, one period prior to (baseline) and one period after (follow-up) an index date (date of device deployment for PDA group; date of request for comparison grou p). A random-effects negative binomial model was used to analyze the primary outcome, the number of potential DDIs per prescriber per 12-month time period. A secondary outcome of interest, the likelihood that a prescriber would prescribe at least 1 potentially interacting medication pair during the baseline and fol- low-up periods, was analyzed using a random-effects logistic model., RESULTS: A total of 1,615 prescribers constituted the PDA group, and 600 prescribers made up the comparison group. Prescribers in the 2 groups were signific antly different in their specialty practice areas (P less than 0.001), number of pharmacy claims at baseline (P less than 0.001), and the like- lihood of prescribing at least 1 potential DDI combination during the 1-year baseline period (P=0.003). However, the prescriber groups were similar in their average age (P=0.241) and geographic location (P=0.181). The most widely prescribed potential DDIs included those in- volving warfarin mones. The median number of patient medication history updates requested per PDA group prescriber during follow-up was 24 (range 0 to 1,073). At baseline, 1,104 (68.4%) of the PDA group and 449 (74.8%) of the comparison group had no potential DDIs. During the next year, 1,131 (70.0%) and 462 (77.0%) of the PD A group and comparison group, respectively, had no DDIs. The incidence rate ratio was 1.01 (95% CI=0.87-1.17) for the PDA group rela- tive to the comparison group for change in numb er of potential DDIs. In the logistic regres- sion model, the odds of prescribing at least 1 potential DDI did not significantly differ by 76 group (odds ratio=1.26, 95% CI=0.96-1.66). Thes e results indicate that there was no signifi- cant difference between the intervention and comparison group with regard to the change in the rate of potential DDIs between the baseline and follow-up periods., CONCLUSION: A stand-alone medication management program in a wireless Piontek F, Kohli R, Conlon P, Ellis JJ, Jablonski J, Kini N. Effects of an adverse-drug- event alert system on cost and quali ty outcomes in community hospitals . Am J Health Syst Pharm 2010;67(8):613-620. Abstract: Purpose. The effects of an adverse-drugevent (ADE) alert system on cost and quality outcomes in community hospitals were evaluated. Methods. This retrospective obser- vational study evaluated the effects of an ADE alert system in seven hospitals in the Trinity Health network. Outcomes for all inpatients admitted to these hospitals after and one year before the deployment of an ADE alert system were evaluated. Inpatients in two network hospitals that lacked any computerized ADE al ert system constituted the external control group. Administrative data were gathered for patients from these facilities for the same time frames as for the preimplementation and po stimplementation groups. Primary outcomes evaluated included pharmacy department costs, variable drug costs, an d mortality rates. Sec- ondary outcomes included total hospitalization co sts, length of hospital stay (LOS), rate of readmission, and case-mix index. Mean diffe rences in primary and secondary outcome measures across all four groups were examined using analysis of variance. Results. Signifi- cant decreases in mean pharmacy department costs per patient were observed from preim- plementation to postimplementation (p < 0.001), while pharmacy department costs in- creased significantly in the external control group (p = 0.029). Drug costs decreased signifi- cantly from baseline (p < 0.001) in the post implementation group. Drug costs increased sig- nificantly in the external control group (p = 0.029). Severity-adjusted mortality rates and LOS decreased significantly in the postimplemen tation group.

Effect of alerts for drug dosage adjustment in inpatients with renal insufficiency . Journal of the Associ JAMIA 2009;16(2):203-210. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Medication errors co nstitute a major problem in all hospitals. Between 20% and 46% of prescriptions requirin g dosage adjustments based on renal func- tion are inappropriate. This study aimed to determine whether implementing alerts at the time of ordering medication integrated into the computerized physician order entry de- creases the proportion of ina ppropriate prescriptions based on the renal function of inpa- tients., DESIGN: Six alternating 2-month contro l and intervention pe riods were conducted between August 2006 and August 2007 in two me dical departments of a teaching hospital in France. A total of 603 patients and 38 physicians were included. During the intervention pe- riods, alerts were triggered if a patient with renal impairment was prescribed one of the 24 targeted drugs that required adjustment according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)., MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome me asure was the proportion of inappropri- ate first prescriptions, according to recommendation., RESULTS: A total of 1,122 alerts were triggered. The rate of inappropriate first pres criptions did not differ significantly between in- tervention and control periods (19.9% vs. 21.3%; p=0.63). The effect of intervention differed significantly between residents and senior physicians (p=0.03). Residents tended to make fewer errors in interven tion versus control periods (Odds ra tio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15), whereas senior physicians tended to make more inappropriate prescriptions in intervention periods (o dds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence inte rval 0.91 to 3.89)., CONCLUSION: Alert activation was not followed by a significan t decrease in inappropriate prescriptions in our study. Thus, it is still necessary to evalua te the impact of these systems if newly imple- mented in other settings thanks to studies also designed to watch for possible unanticipated effects of decision supports and their underlying causes. 77 Automated dispensing systems & Barcode RCT Merry AF, Webster CS, Hannam J, Mitchell SJ, Henderson R, Reid P, et al. Multimodal system designed to reduce errors in re cording and administration of drugs in anaesthesia: Prospective randomised clinical . BMJ (Online) 2011;343(7826). new patented multimodal system (SAF- ERSleep) designed to reduce e rrors in the recording and admi nistration of drugs in anaes- thesia. Design: Prospective randomised label clinical trial. Setting: Five designated op- erating theatres in a major tertiary referral hospital. Participants: Eighty nine consenting anaesthetists managing 1075 cases in which th ere were 10 764 drug administrations. Inter- vention: Use of the new system (which includes customised drug trays and purpose designed drug trolley drawers to promote a well organi sed anaesthetic workspace and legible colour coded drug labels; a barcode reader linked to a computer, speakers, and touch screen to provide au-tomatic auditory and visual verification of se lected drugs immediately before each admin- istration; automatic compilation of an anaest hetic record; an on-screen and audible warning if an antibiotic has not been administered with in 15 minutes of the start of anaesthesia; and certain procedural rules-notably, scanning the label before each drug administration) versus conventional practice in drug administration with a manually compiled anaesthetic record. Main outcome measures: Primary: composite of errors in the recordin g and administration of intravenous drugs detected by direct observat ion and by detailed reconciliation of the con- tents of used drug vials against recorded administ rations; and lapses in responding to an in- termittent visual stimulus (vigilance latency task). Secondary: outcomes in patients; analyses of anaesthetists' tasks and assessments of worklo ad; evaluation of the legibility of anaesthetic records; evaluation of compliance with the procedural rules of the new system; and question-naire based ratings of the respective systems by participants. Results: The overall mean rate of drug errors per 100 administra tions was 9.1 (95% confidence interval 6.9 to 11.4) with the new system (one in 11 administrations) and 11.6 (9.3 to 13.9) with conventional methods (one in nine administrations) (P=0.045 for difference). Most were recording errors, and, though fewer drug administration errors occurre d with the new system, the comparison with conventional methods did not reach significance. Rates of errors in dr ug administration were lower when anaesthetists consis tently applied two key principl es of the new system (scan- ning the drug barcode before administering ea ch drug and keeping the voice prompt active) than when they did not: mean 6.0 (3.1 to 8.8) errors per 100 administrations v 9.7 (8.4 to 11.1) respectively (P=0.004). Lapses in the vigil ance latency task occurred in 12% (58/471) of cases with the new system and 9% (40/473) wi th conventional methods (P=0.052). The rec- ords generated by the new system were more legible, and anaesthetists preferred the new system, particularly in relation to long, comp lex, and emergency cases. There were no differ- ences between new and conventional systems in respect of outcomes in patients or anaesthe- tists' workload. Conclusions The new system was associated with a reduction in errors in the recording and administration of drugs in anaesthesia, attributab le mainly to a reduction in recording errors. Automatic compilation of the anaesthetic record increased legibility but also increased lapses in a vigilance latency task and decreased time spent watching monitors.

Automated drug dispensing system reduces medication errors in an intensive care setting . Crit Care Med 2010;38(12):2275-2281. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the impact of an automated dispensing system on the incidence of medication errors re lated to picking, preparation, and administra- tion of drugs in a medical intensive care unit. We also evaluated the clinical significance of such errors and user satisfaction., DESIGN: Pr eintervention and postintervention study in- volving a control and an intervention medical intensive care unit., SETTING: Two medical intensive care units in the same department of a 2,000-bed university hospital., PATIENTS: Adult medical intensive care patients., INTERVENTIONS: After a 2-month observation pe- riod, we implemented an automated dispensing system in one of the units (study unit) cho- sen randomly, with the other unit being the control., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RE- SULTS: The overall error rate was expressed as a percentage of total o pportunities for error. 78 The severity of errors was classified accordin g to National Coordinating Council for Medica- tion Error Reporting and Prevention categories by an expert committee. User satisfaction was assessed through self-administered questionna ires completed by nurses. A total of 1,476 medications for 115 patients we re observed. After automated dispensing system implementa- tion, we observed a reduced percentage of tota l opportunities for error in the study compared to the control unit (13.5% and 18.6%, respecti vely; p<.05); however, no significant difference was observed before automated dispensing sy stem implementation (20.4% and 19.3%, re- spectively; not significant). Before-and-after co mparisons in the study unit also showed a sig- nificantly reduced percentage of total opportunities for error (20.4% and 13.5%; p<.01). An analysis of detailed opportunit ies for error showed a significant impact of the automated dis- pensing system in reducing preparation errors (p<.05). Most errors caused no harm (Na- tional Coordinating Council for Medication E rror Reporting and Preven tion category C). The automated dispensing system did not reduce errors causing harm. Finally, the mean for working conditions improved from 1.0+/-0.8 to 2.5+/-0.8 on the four-point Likert scale., CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an automated dispensing system reduced overall medication errors related to picking, preparation, and administration of drugs in the inten- sive care unit. Furthermore, most nurses fa vored the new drug dispensation organization. Cochran GL, Haynatzki G. Comparison of medication safety effectiveness among nine critical access hospitals . American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : of- ficial journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2013;70(24):2218-2224. Abstract: PURPOSE: The rates of medication errors across three different medication dispensing and administration systems frequent ly used in critical access hospitals (CAHs) were analyzed., METHODS: Nine CAHs agreed to participate in this prospective study and were assigned to one of three groups based on similarities in their medication-use processes: (1) less than 10 hours per week of onsite ph armacy support and no bedside barcode system, (2) onsite pharmacy support for 40 hours per week and no bedside barcode system, and (3) onsite pharmacy support for 40 or more hour s per week with a bedside barcode system. Er- rors were characterized by severity, phase of or igination, type, and cause. Characteristics of the medication being administered and a number of best practices were collected for each medication pass. Logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of errors., RESULTS: A total of 3103 medication passes we re observed. More medication errors origi- nated in hospitals that had onsite pharmacy su pport for less than 10 hours per week and no bedside barcode system than in other types of hospitals. A bedside barcode system had the greatest impact on lowering the odds of an e rror reaching the patient. Wrong dose and omis- sion were common error types. Human factor s and communication were the two most fre- quently identified causes of error for all three systems., CONCLUSION: Medication error rates were lower in CAHs with 40 or more ho urs per week of onsite pharmacy support with or without a bedside barcode system compared with hospitals with less than 10 hours per week of pharmacy support and no bedside barcode system.

The time spen t on nursing activities was me asured using a prevalidated time-motion observation instrument and categori zed based on workflow factors such as di- rect patient care, indirect patient care, admi nistration, and miscellaneous or other. A de- scriptive analysis was conducted with the amount of time spent on each of the nursing activi- ties. A multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to assess the difference between the two approaches for the amount of time spent on various categorized nursing activities. Co- variates included in the analysis were patient characteristics, medication administration characteristics, and number of nurses involv ed in medication administration., RESULTS: A total of 101 PBMAs and 151 BCMAs were reviewed. The mean duration of total medication administration time was higher in the BCMA phase compared with the PBMA phase, as was the mean time spent on direct patient care activity. However, nurses spent less time on ad- 79 ministration activity during BCMA. Statistical analysis revealed that the medication admin- istration approach (BCMA versus PBMA) had a sign ificant effect on time spent on direct pa- tient care and medication administration activities., CONCLUSION: The implementation of BCMA led to a reduction in the time spent by nurses on medication administration activities and increased the time spent on direct patient care activities.

Br J Anaesth 2010 ;105(3):289-296. Abstract: BACKGROUND: To help prevent dr ug errors, it is recommended that drugs should be confirmed/checked with a second pe rson before administra tion. We aimed to as- sess the feasibility of introducing second-perso n or electronic bar-code confirmation of drugs, administered during anaesthesia, in the National Health Service (NHS) settings in the UK., METHODS: Seven NHS sites took part in a pilot study over a 3 month period. Five used a second-person and two used bar-code electron ic confirmation of drugs given during anaes- thesia. A total of 36 consultant anaesthetist s and three trainees, 15 operating department practitioners (ODPs), and seven anaesthetic nurs es participated. A group of anaesthetists, ODPs, and practitioners (n=11) from diffe rent NHS sites independ ently observed both methodologies. In addition, each site was visit ed and observed by one of the study investiga- tors. At the end of the study period, four focus groups (two with participants from pilot sites and two with observers) were held. The discu ssions were taped, transcribed, and qualita- tively analysed. Data were triangulated using ob server's notes and investigator's reflective di- aries, and processed using line-by-line coding. The codes were then synthesized into themes., RESULTS: Both methods were perceived to cont ribute to the prevention of drug errors. For the two-person confirmation to be carried out correctly, there should be no distraction or time pressure. The main limitation to the feasibility was that the continuous presence of the second person was not always possible. The proce ss also met with resistance from the staff at some pilot sites. Electronic co nfirmation was always feasible, as it did not require the pres- ence of a second person. It was found to be intuitive to the anaesthetist's current working practice. However, there were some practical issues related to introduction of new technol- ogy and an initial learning curve., CONCLUSION S: The introduction of two-person confir- mation to the NHS would have a significant impact on the existing working practices. Issues related to resources and a cultural change will ne ed to be addressed. Electronic confirmation was more feasible, but the technological aspects of its integration into the operating theatre environment, and learning, will require further attention.

Risk of adverse drug events in neonates treated with opioids and the effect of a bar- code-assisted medication administration system . American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the Am erican Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2011;68(1):57-62. Abstract: PURPOSE: The risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) in neonates treated with opioids and the effect of a bar-code-assisted me dication administration (BCMA) system were studied., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was conducted. A BCMA system was operative for 50% of the study period. Structured medical record audits were conducted to identify medication errors and preventa- ble ADEs. Stratified frequency distribution and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used., RESULTS: Of 618 patients, 78 (12.6%) received postoperative care, 280 (45.3%) re- quired assisted ventilation, and 72 (11.7%) were treated with opioids during their hospitaliza- tion. A total of 32 first preventable ADEs occurred. Univariate analyses demonstrated that postoperative status, assisted ve ntilation, and opioid administration were each significantly associated with ADEs. However, stratified frequency distribution analyses indicated that opi- oid administration during hospitalization was associated with preventable ADEs, controlling for postoperative status (p = 0.0019) or assist ed ventilation (p = 0.0007). The odds ratio for any preventable ADE occurrence in a patient treated with an opioid was 4.74 compared with an infant not treated with an opioid. Patients who were treated with an opioid in the absence of a BCMA system had a 10% probability of an ADE after hospitalization for six days., CON- CLUSION: Infants in a NICU who were treated wi th opioids were at greater risk of a prevent- able ADE than other patients, adjusted for tw o medical conditions, assisted ventilation and postoperative status. A BCMA system reduced th e risk of harm from an opioid medication error. 80 Seibert HH, Maddox RR, Flynn EA, Williams CK. Effect of barcode technology with electronic medication administration re cord on medication accuracy rates . American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJ HP : official journal of the American Soci- ety of Health-System Pharmacists 2014;71(3):209-218. Abstract: PURPOSE: The effect of barcode- assisted medication administration (BCMA) with electronic medication administration record (eMAR) technology on the occurrence of medication administration errors was evaluated., METHODS: A pretest-posttest nonequiva-lent comparison group was used to investigate the effect of BCMA-eMAR on the medication administration accuracy rates at two community-based hospitals. Patient care units included three matched pairs in the two hospitals-two medical-surgical, two inte nsive unit, an emergency department, and both an inpatient oncology unit and an outpatie nt oncology service at one of the hospitals. Medication administration accuracy rates were observed and recorded before (phase 1) and approximately 6 and 12 months after (phases 2 and 3, respectively) the implementation of BCMA-eMAR., RESULTS: The overall accuracy rate at hospital 1 increased significantly from phase 1 (89%) to phase 3 (90%) (p = 0.0015); if wrong-time errors are excluded, the accuracy rate improved from 92% in phase 1 to 96% in phase 3 (p = 0.000008). The overall accuracy rate did not change significantly from phase 1 to phase 3 at hospital 2; when wrong-time er- rors were excluded from consideration, the accuracy rate improved from 93% in phase 1 to 96% in phase 3 (p = 0.015)., CONCLUSION: Implementation of BCMA-eMAR in two hospi-tals was associated with significant increases in total medication accuracy rates in most study units and did not introduce new types of error into the medication administration process. Accuracy rates further improved when wrong-ti me errors were excluded from analysis. The frequency of errors preventable by BCMA-eMAR decreased significantly in both hospitals af- ter implementation of that technology. BCMA-e MAR and direct observation were more effec- tive than voluntary reporting programs at inte rcepting and recording errors and preventing them from reaching patients.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Associa- tion : JAMIA 2013;20(6):1150-1158. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To quantify and comp are the time doctors and nurses spent on direct patient care, medication-related tasks, and interactions before and after electronic medication management system (eMMS) introduction., METHODS: Controlled pre-post, time and motion study of 129 doctors and nurses for 633.2 h on four wards in a 400-bed hos- pital in Sydney, Australia. We measured change s in proportions of time on tasks and interac- tions by period, intervention/control group, and profession., RESULTS: eMMS was associ- ated with no significant change in proportions of time spent on direct care or medication-re- lated tasks relative to control wards. In the post-period control ward, doctors spent 19.7% (2 h/10 h shift) of their time on direct care and 7.4% (44.4 min/10 h shift) on medication tasks, compared to intervention ward doctors (25.7% (2.6 h/shift; p=0.08) and 8.5% (51 min/shift; p=0.40), respectively). ward nurses in the post-period spent 22.1% (1.9 h/8.5 h shift) of their time on direct care and 23.7% on medication tasks compared to intervention ward nurses (26.1% (2.2 h/shift; p=0.23) and 22.6% (1 .9 h/shift; p=0.28), respectively). We found intervention ward doctors spen t less time alone (p=0.0003) an d more time with other doc- tors (p=0.003) and patients (p=0.009). Nurses on the intervention wards spent less time with doctors following eMMS introduction (p=0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: eMMS introduc- tion did not result in redistribution of time away from direct care or towards medication tasks. Work patterns observed on these intervention wards were associated with previously reported significant reductions in prescribin g error rates relative to the control wards.

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA 2012;19(5):728-734. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the e ffects of a personal health record (PHR)- linked medications module on medication accuracy and safety., DESIGN: From September 81 2005 to March 2007, we conducted an on-treat ment sub-study within a cluster-randomized trial involving 11 primary care practices that used the same PHR. Intervention practices re- ceived access to a medications module prompting patients to review their documented medi- cations and identify discrepancies, generating 'eJournals' that enabled rapid updating of medication lists during subsequent clinical visits., MEASUREMENTS: A sample of 267 pa- tients who submitted medications eJournals was contacted by phone 3 weeks after an eligible visit and compared with a matched sample of 274 patients in control practices that received a different PHR-linked intervention. Two blinde d physician adjudicators determined unex- plained discrepancies between documented and patient-reported medi cation regimens. The primary outcome was proportion of medications per patient with unexpl ained discrepancies., RESULTS: Among 121,046 patients in eligible pr actices, 3979 participated in the main trial and 541 participated in the sub-study. The prop ortion of medications per patient with unex- plained discrepancies was 42% in the interventi on arm and 51% in the control arm (adjusted OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94, p=0.01). The nu mber of unexplained di screpancies per patient with potential for severe harm was 0.03 in the intervention arm and 0.08 in the control arm (adjusted RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.92, p=0. 04)., between documented and patient-reported medica tion regimens and reduction in potentially harmful medication discrepancies can be improved with a PHR medication review tool linked to the provider's medical record., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00251875).

Effect of an electronic medication reconciliation appl ication and process redesign on poten- tial adverse drug Med 2009;169(8):771-780. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medicati on reconciliation at transitions in care is a national patient safety goal, but its effects on importan t patient outcomes require further evaluation. We sought to measure the impact of an information technology-based medication reconcilia- tion intervention on medication discrepancie s with potential for harm (potential adverse drug events [PADEs])., METHODS: We performed a controlled trial, randomized by medical team, on general medical inpatient units at 2 ac ademic hospitals from May to June 2006. We enrolled 322 patients admitted to 14 medical teams, for whom a medication history could be obtained before discharge. Th e intervention was a computeriz ed medication reconciliation tool and process redesign involving physicians , nurses, and pharmacists. The main outcome was unintentional discrepancies between prea dmission medications and admission or dis- charge medications that had potential for ha rm (PADEs)., RESULTS: Among 160 control pa- tients, there were 230 PADEs (1.44 per patient), while among 162 intervention patients there were 170 PADEs (1.05 per patient) (adjusted re lative risk [ARR], 0.72; 95% confidence inter- val [CI], 0.52-0.99). A significant benefit was found at hospital 1 (ARR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38- 0.97) but not at hospital 2 (ARR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0. 57-1.32) (P = .32 for te st of effect modifica- tion). Hospitals differed in the extent of integrat ion of the medication reconciliation tool into computerized provider order entry applicatio ns at discharge., CONCLUSIONS: A computer- ized medication reconciliation tool and process redesign were associated with a decrease in unintentional medication discrepancies with potential for patient harm. Software integration issues are likely important for successful implementation of computerized medication recon- ciliation tools.

Can J Hosp Pharm 2011;64 (1):85. Abstract: Rationale: Internal hospital transfer is a vulnerable moment where patients are at high risk of medication discrepancies th at can result in clinically significant harm, medication errors and adverse drug events. Methods: All patients transferred between 10 in- patient units at two tertiary care hospitals were prospectively assessed to identify discrepan- cies. Interfaces included transfers between: (1) units that both used Paper-based medication ordering systems; (2) units that both used CPOE-based systems; and (3) Paper-based and CPOE-based units ('Hybrid' transfer). The primar y endpoint was the number of patients with at least one unintentional medication discrepanc y during internal hosp ital transfer. Discrep- ancies were identified through assessment an d comparison of a best possible medication transfer list with the actual transfer orders. Se condary objectives were to characterize and as- sess the potential clinical impact and severity of unintentional discrepancies, determine the 82 time required for transfer reconciliation and to investigate the influence of CPOE on the fre- quency of discrepancies. Results: Overall, 190 patients were screened and 129 patients were included. Eighty patients (62.0%) had at least one unintentional medication discrepancy at the time of transfer and the most common di screpancy was medication omission (55.6%). Forty-seven patients (36.4%) had at least one unintentional discrepancy with the potential to cause discomfort and/or clinical deterioration. The risk of discrepancies was present regard- less of the medication-ordering system (Paper, CPOE or Hybrid). Conclusion: Clinically sig- nificant medication discrepancies occur commonl y during internal hospital transfer. A struc- tured, collaborative and clearly defined medication reconciliation process is needed to allow clinicians to effectively prevent internal transfer discrepancies and patient harm. Lukket legemiddelsl\u00f8yfe (closed loop for anaestesia) RCT Biswas anesthesia Paediatr Anaesth2013. p. 1145-1152. Abstract: Objective The objective of this st udy was to compare the feasibility of closed- loop anesthesia delivery with manual control of propofol in pediatric patients during cardiac surgery. Methods Forty ASA II-III children, unde rgoing elective cardiac surgery under cardi- opulmonary bypass (CPB) in a tertiary care hosp ital, to receive propofol ei- ther through a closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CL group) or through traditional manual control (manual group) to achieve a target BIS of 50. Patients were induced and sub- sequently maintained with a propofol infusion. The propofol usage and the efficacy of closed- loop system in controlling BIS within +10 of the target were compared with that of manual control. Results The maintenance of BIS within +10 of target and intraoperative hemody- namic stability were similar between the two gr oups. However, induction dose of propofol was less in the CL group (2.06 + 0.79 mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) than the manual group (2.95 + 1.03 mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) (P = 0.006) with le ss overshoot of BIS during induction in the closed-loop group (P = 0.007). Total propofol us ed in the off-CPB period was less in the CL group (6.29 + 0.037). Phenylep hrine use in the pre-CPB period was more in the manual group (16.92 + 10.92 mugkg <sup>-1</sup> vs 5.79 + 5.98 mugkg<sup>- 1</sup>) (P = 0.014). Manual group required a median of 18 (range 8-29) dose adjustments per hour, while the CL group required none. Co nclusion This study demonstrated the feasi- bility of closed-loop controlled anesth esia in children, challenging proce- dures such as cardiac surgery. Closed-loop syst em needs further and larger evaluation to es- tablish its safety and efficacy. 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Hemmerling TM, Arbeid E, Wehbe M, Cyr S, Taddei R, C. Evaluation of a novel closed-loop total intravenous anaesthesi a drug delivery system: Br J Anaesth 2013;110(6):1031-1039. Abstract: BACKGROUND: We have developed an automatic anaesthesia system for closed-loop administration of anaesthesia drugs . The control variables used were bispectral index (BIS) and Analgoscore for hypnosis and antinociception, respectively., METHODS: One hundred and eighty-six patients were ra ndomly enrolled in two groups. Propofol, rem- ifentanil, and rocuronium were administered using closed-loop feedback control (closed- loop, n = 93) or manually (control group, n = 93). The clinical performance of hypnosis con-trol was determined by calculating the offset fr om a BIS of 45: 'excellent', 'good', 'poor', and 'inadequate' control was defined as values within 10%, from 11% to 20%, from 21% to 30%, or >30% offset from the target. The clin ical performance of analgesia was defined as the offset from Analgoscore values. Data presented as mean (standard deviation) (95% confi- dence interval)., RESULTS: Excellent or good control of hypnosis was achieved significantly longer in the closed-loop group [47.0 (9.8%) (4 5.0/49.0), and inadequate cont rol of hypnosis was significantly shorter in the closed-loop group [10.8 (5.0%) (9.8/11.8) and 7.7 in the closed-loop group (P=0.0456)., CON- CLUSIONS: The closed-loop system was better at maintaining BIS and Analgoscore than manual administration.
