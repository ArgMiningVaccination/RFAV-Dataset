Morse, Pharm.D., FCCP, BCPS, is a tenured, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Director of the UB Center for Integrated Global Biomedical Sciences. He is also the Co-Director of the SUNY Global Health Institute. Dr. Morse has been actively involved in drug development research since the introduction of antiretrovirals for HIV in 1986, with more recent emphasis on HCV infection and drug development. He has National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases support for the UB AIDS Clinical Trials Group, Pharmacology Specialty Laboratory and a contract for the HIV Clinical Pharmacology Quality Assurance Program. These programs integrate with the NIH Fogarty International Center AIDS International Training and Research Program, which Dr. Morse directs with the University of Zimbabwe and is home to the Center of Excellence in Clinical Pharmacology. Dr. Morse also directs the UB HIV Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory, which has gained an international reputation for its work in bioanalysis, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenomics. In addition, Dr. Morse is director of the Empire State Patient Safety Assurance Network, a federally certified patient safety organization and a network for health information technology innovation. Dr. Morse is the director of the UB Translational Pharmacology Research Core. He is also associate director for the Clinical Trials Methods and Technologies Pillar for the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Dr. Morse is co-founder of the Buffalo Jamaica Innovation Enterprise, a partnership between UB the University of the West Indies and the Jamaica Ministry of Health. This project has established the Jamaica Center for Infectious Diseases Research. Dr. Morse has more than 25 years of NIH, industry and philanthropic research support with extensive experience in grant applications and mentoring. Dr. Morse received the 2012 Volwiler Research Achievement Award from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.
