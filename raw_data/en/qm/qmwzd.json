As the name suggests, this therapy has to do with aroma (scent or fragrance). The source of aroma may be from flowers, plants, incense sticks and pastes. Flowers such as rose and jasmine and herbs, like basil, emit special scents, which help to relieve mental and physical stress. Placing fragrant flowers in vases in the drawing, as well as bedrooms, will do the trick. Flowers and herbs need to be changed every day. Burning incense sticks of mild, natural fragrance creates a healthy mood. Same is true of the sandalwood incense sticks and sandalwood paste. Bathing in the water mixed with the extract of fragrant flowers and plants help immensely in relieving the stress. Along with this therapy one can consume ginger paste mixed with honey or essence of basil leaves and cinnamon mixed with honey to hasten the healing process. The idea is to heal inside and outside.
