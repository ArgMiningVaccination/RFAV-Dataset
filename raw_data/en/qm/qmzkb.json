Opinions differ based on experiences and facts, but if you had to decide between \"Ayurveda vs Allopathy\", which treatment do you think is better for you? Let's break down what the treatments offer and see if we conclude. Ayurveda has existed since ancient times, the treatment relies solely on natural methods to heal a body and mind. Ayurvedic treatment uses herbs and natural remedies for treating physical ailments. The name Ayurveda is the combination of two words Ayu (life) & Veda (science) which means the science of life. Ayurveda aims towards healing the body by healing the soul. Almost all illnesses can be treated through the accurate practice of Ayurveda, that's why even today, Ayurveda is so famous globally. Allopathic medicine or Western medicine has emerged suddenly because of its accuracy in finding out the cause of the illness through tests, evidence, and symptoms. Sources say that the life expectancy of humans has increased by up to 10 years average after introducing Allopathic medicines. However, there a lot of health complications that can't be healed through allopathic treatment yet. Scientists all around the world work continuously to deal with unbeatable health conditions. How Ayurveda Helps You Live a Longer Life? Ayurveda is a form of science where you mix different natural herbs and find a treatment for a health condition that can't be treated otherwise. Ayurveda doesn't rely on blood tests and physical tests, but only on symptoms, a person has been facing. Ayurveda is known to figure out the root causes of the problem, as Ayurvedic doctors also have the full knowledge of the functioning of the body! Unlike most of the allopathic treatments, Ayurveda doesn't heal the symptoms of the health condition, but it aims to heal it completely, so that the problem may not come back again. Ayurveda is great for those who have a heavy allergic reaction to chemical-based medicine, or for those whose kidneys can't handle too much medication. One known side effect of allopathic is kidney damage. Harsh medication can cause kidney damage and sometimes failure. Ayurvedic treatment's biggest strength is that it poses no side effects to the user whatsoever. You can consume Ayurvedic medicine for as long as it is necessary, but you won't face any side effects to the medication. Ayurvedic treatments also require you to maintain your diet and exercise daily so that you don't develop the same troubles ever again! How Allopathic Treatment Helps in Healing? When it comes to accurate tests and results, nothing is better than Allopathy. All the treatments in Allopathy rely on tests and symptoms. There are few things that only Allopathy can help with. If there is an emergency like a cardiac arrest or external bleeding, Allopathy can help in treating them as quickly as possible. All the health conditions that can be healed through surgery is a part of Allopathy. However, with most Allopathic treatments, the chance of a health condition of developing again is very high. Allopathy doesn't give out the promise of proper treatment, if someone doesn't take necessary precautions then the chances of getting ill are always high.
