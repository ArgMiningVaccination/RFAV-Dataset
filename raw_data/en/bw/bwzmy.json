Design/methodology/approach Eighty male albino rats were divided into normal and depressed rats. Normal rats (40 rats) were divided into four equal groups: control, venlafaxine drug, anise oil and geranium oil groups. Depressed rats (40 rats) were divided into four equal groups: depressed rats, depressed rats + venlafaxine drug, depressed rats + anise oil and depressed rats + geranium oil groups. Body weight, food consumption and water intake were detected. Animal behavior, cerebral cortex and hippocampus neurotransmitters, serum bile acid and vitamin D and liver histology were also investigated in this study. Findings Body weight (117 \u00b1 7.6 g), food consumption (5.6 \u00b1 1.4 g/day) and water intake (8.7 \u00b1 1.2 ml/day) were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in depression compared to body weight (153 \u00b1 7.6 g), food consumption (12.7 \u00b1 1.6 g/day) and water intake (15.3 \u00b1 1.6 ml/day) in control. Animal behavioral tests, e.g. sucrose preference (48.8 \u00b1 1.5) test, distance traveled (70.0 \u00b1 16.3), center square entries (0.20 \u00b1 0.10), center square duration (52.18 \u00b1 11.9), tail suspension (54.70 \u00b1 2.9 s) test and forced swimming (134.4 \u00b1 5.5 s) test were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in depression compared to sucrose preference (89.2 \u00b1 1.7) test, distance traveled (226 \u00b1 90.1), center square entries (1.4 \u00b1 1.8), center square duration (3.6 \u00b1 2.0), tail suspension (19.3 \u00b1 2.1 s) test and forced swimming (83.7 \u00b1 3.6 s) test in control. Cerebral cortex and hippocampus areas neurotransmitters such as serotonin (7.4 \u00b1 1.7 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.54 pg/g tissue), dopamine (6.3 \u00b1 1.5 and 0.86 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5mole/L) and vitamin D (1.3 \u00b1 0.37 ng/ml) were significantly decreased (p?0.001) in depression compared to cerebral cortex and hippocampus areas neurotransmitters such as serotonin (16.8 \u00b1 and 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 pg/g \u00b1 0.49 pg/g tissue) norepinephrine (18.2 2.3 D (2.7 \u00b1 0.58 ng/ml) in control. Depression induced injury to hepatic tissues. Oral supplementation with anise oil and geranium oil ameliorated body weight, serum bile acid and vitamin D and liver histology in depressed rats. Originality/value Depression treatment persists for a long time, so the search for a new herbal treatment is of concern due to available sources, cheap and no side effects of herbal plants. Anise oil and geranium oil improved body weight, food consumption, water intake, animal behavioral tests, cerebral cortex and hippocampus areas neurotransmitters, serum bile acid and vitamin D and liver histology in depression.
