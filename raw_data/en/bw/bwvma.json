I have always believed that all that I need, all that any of us need, was placed here on this earth by our Creator. This book has been written for those of you who want to take back your own health and happiness. The material contained within will give you a guide to follow so you can begin the process of reclaiming your mental/emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being. Health is a mind, body, and spirit function. One without the others does not make a whole. I am no seasoned author, and my greatest experience in delivering this message thus far has been across my kitchen counter to family and friends. I hope to be able to deliver the same enthusiasm with my written word as I have been able to do when simply speaking about all the aspects of life that I find fascinating and natural. I am sharing what I feel is a liberating message, because we all possess a healer within. Remember the adage, Physician, heal thyself. I remember the famous quote by President Kennedy: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country, and I think about the human body and what doctors continually ask of their patients. So my quote is, Ask not what your doctor can do for you, but what you can do for your doctor. In this phrase, doctor is referring to all healers. They may be medical doctors, psychologists, spiritual advisors, or any healer in-between. This is a double-edged message. Most of us, who have suffered with illness or disease at one time or another and have heard our healers advise us to eat better, get more exercise, and reduce stress in our lives. The book is titled Discovering the Healer Within because the only person who can bring healing to your physical, emotional, or spiritual body is you! Illness and disease come from within, and that is where healing must also come from. We will explore how the body is adversely affected by the negative thoughts we think and the negative words we speak, as well as the poor eating habits and addictive behaviors we follow. The body is also adversely affected by the lack of faith. We must believe in our self healing abilities. We need to understand how we can assist our healers and our healer within to achieve a healthy, happy, and successful life. Health is by choice, not by chance, and it is a beautiful part of life that we are all supposed to enjoy, right up to the time that our spirit passes back into the realm of our Creator. Acknowledgments Thanks to my loving husband, who has allowed me to travel and learn for so many years and has supported and encouraged me through the process of writing this book. I want to recognize my wonderful parents, who introduced me to the spiritual aspects of life and always encouraged me to follow my dreams and discover my passion. Thanks to my sister and many supportive friends who encouraged me to follow my intuitions and write this book. I wish to recognize Mrs. Mary Bradley, my elementary reading teacher, in fact, my special education reading teacher, who always told me, Karen, one day you will write your own book! She was patient and loving and one of those people you stay in contact with as long as they remain in your physical life. I am grateful to all the teachers and authors who have imparted their knowledge and written their books, so that I might learn. Thank you to all who have allowed me to use bits or portions of their knowledge within my book, so that I could better inform the readers of important facts. I also wish to recognize a very talented lady and friend of mine, Lucy Rickman, who helped with the editing of this material. I don't think she had any idea what she was agreeing to, as this was my first attempt at writing a book. However, I knew of her experience in writing grants and her years of dedicated service to our community. Lucy taught English in the Hayden schools and also sat on numerous boards, where she was instrumental in the planning and development of a beautiful new library as well as an assisted living center in our town. My respect and appreciation for her is enormous. I want to show my admiration and respect for a childhood friend who earned a BS in Food Science and Nutrition after high school. However, Cheryl later discovered she did not have the necessary credentials which would allow her to receive referrals from medical doctors and she wanted to help patients suffering from chronic illness through proper diet. She knew that she needed additional education as a dietitian, but she also knew that she did not agree with the current guidelines of the food pyramid. She is now in the last half of her Education to become a Naturopathic Medical Doctor. My hat is off to you Cheryl Temple Hamilton. I know that you will be successful and have a positive impact on your patients. Introduction After years of studying the mind, body, and spirit, I find that I want to share my knowledge with others. I hope that this message will allow the reader to understand the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit in total health, as well as the awesome wisdom and inner intelligence or self-healing abilities of the human body. I want to share the simplicity of a healthy, happy, loving, and successful life, as I have come to understand it. You see, I am just like so many of you. I was a country girl who was raised on a rural ranch, went through school, married, and raised a family. However, after raising our children, I discovered the desire to understand the workings and meaning of the mind, body, and spirit. For over twenty-five years, I studied many avenues of spirituality. I discovered the functions of the mind and the power of positive thinking. Finally I decided to explore physical health through natural healing. I received a master's of science in holistic health through the American Institute of Holistic Theology, and then I was fortunate to discover the Fit For Life Sciences Institute, where I earned an associate's degree in natural hygiene (health) and nutrition. I want it to be clear that I am not a doctor nor a psychologist nor a teacher of any religion; I only consider myself an intuit, one who follows their inner voice or inner guidance. I divide this book into three parts. Part One discusses the three aspects of the mind: the subconscious mind, the conscious mind, and the superconscious mind. In Part One, I hope to help the readers see the simple workings of thoughts and the emotions that we attach to our thoughts. Part Two sheds light on the wonderful self-healing aspects of the human body and the purpose of combining a proper diet, fresh air, sunshine, and pure water, as well as rest and sleep, and finally mental, emotional, and spiritual poise. Part Three covers my experiences and knowledge of the soul and the role that the soul plays in this physical experience that we are all presently living. The choices we make determine the life which we live. Self-empowerment for me means living a life of happiness, health, love, and success in all departments of my life. I want the readers to understand that we are the navigator of our own journey through life, because we sculpt our life through the thoughts we think, the words we speak, and the emotions we allow ourselves to hold. Part I - The Mind Chapter One The Subconscious Mind There is more to the mind than meets the eye. There are actually three aspects of the mind: the subconscious mind, the conscious mind, and the super conscious mind or God-mind. How many times have you found that most everything in life comes in threes? I discovered my personal power, through the proper use of my subconscious mind, more than twenty-five years ago, and I was able to transform my life. I learned that whatever I could feel deeply or clearly imagine would be impressed upon my subconscious mind, and I could experience it in my life. By choosing my thoughts, beliefs, and opinions wisely, I could experience those things I talked about, believed in, and loved. I learned of Dr. Joseph Murphy's 1963 book The Power of the Subconscious Mind one day in a seminar presented at the bank where I worked, in my hometown of Hayden, Colorado. The bank president was Mr. Joseph B. Boyd. I always addressed him as Mr. Boyd, as I had a great deal of respect for him. Mr. Boyd taught finance, both through example, and as an actual teacher of college-level classes. He played an important role in my future business opportunities, as well as the future of my husband's business. Wonderful things started happening for me after I attended the seminar at the bank. I was a new employee, and I didn't realize it at the time, but Mr. Boyd rarely, if ever, interrupted our workday with things like seminars, unless of course the topic was required by the FDIC. However, this seminar was for the ladies who worked at the bank, and the subjects covered included makeup, wardrobe, and positive attitude. The timing of this seminar was divine indeed because things in my life were kind of rough. I was trying to adjust to working full-time while raising two children, and my husband was working two jobs. We were making ends meet, but not in the fashion to which we had previously been accustomed. My husband Tim and I had recently made the decision to make a major change in our lives. Tim had operated a feedlot\u2014a cattle-feeding operation\u2014for the past eight years. Tim was always an independent thinker, and he had been raised around cattle and machinery his whole life. He felt that he wanted to begin a business of his own, where he could benefit from his knowledge and willingness to work hard. We had never fully settled into the community where the feedlot was located, and we wanted to raise our children in a smaller school district. Moving back to the area where we had both grown up in northwestern Colorado, the small town of Hayden met all our needs, but with it came many changes. At first, we moved our single-wide mobile home into a park, where we were not only required to pay rent, but where we had very close neighbors. Both Tim and I had been raised on rural ranches, where the closest neighbors were several miles away, and this was also what our children were accustomed to at the feedlot. With all of these changes to our living environment, as well as the increased expenses, we were experiencing considerable emotional challenges. So this seminar and my introduction to positive attitude and the power of thought were heaven-sent. I don't believe I ever told my boss just how much this seminar helped me, but it literally changed my life. All too often, we never know if the recipient of our good thoughts and gestures has benefited in any way. But I want to tell you a story about the lady who taught the positive-attitude portion of that seminar. Some years after I left the bank, I was attending an Angel Workshop in Grand Junction, Colorado. At the end of the day, the instructor\u2014whom I thought I had just met for the first time\u2014asked us to share an experience that had had a positive impact on our lives. When it was my turn, I spoke of how I had learned of the book The Power of the Subconscious Mind. I went on to say that although I had never read this type of material or even heard of it before, the seminar leader had impressed me so deeply that I felt the need to immediately purchase Dr. Murphy's book. I told everyone how I changed my life because of the wonderful advice in this book. When I looked at the instructor, I noticed that she had tears in her eyes. She said, Oh, honey, I was that instructor, but I never knew if I had a positive impact on anyone. She thanked me for my story, and I discovered that I had already met this wonderful woman, who actually grew up only twenty miles from my hometown. Her name is JoAnn Mathers Thompson, and I think of her often when I wonder if anything I am doing is having a positive impact on others. Let's discuss the subconscious mind first. The function of the subconscious mind is similar to the fresh spring water that melts from beneath the snowdrifts in the Rocky Mountains. That water, like the subconscious mind, will flow in the path of least resistance. The water can be controlled if we will make ditches and give it direction. Likewise we control the flow of our life through the subconscious mind with our thoughts, words, and emotions. We control the subconscious mind by giving it direction with our conscious mind or our conscious thoughts by setting intentions, making plans, and setting goals. It is the mind that makes the body rich. \u2014Shakespeare By consciously setting your intentions you use your thoughts constructively, you actually create a steering wheel by which to control your own destiny. However, you are the only one who can do this; no one else can do it for you. You create your own universe as you go along. \u2014Winston Churchill, The subconscious mind is also our friend, because it takes care of us around the clock. It attends to the proper functions and rhythms of our beating heart, digestion, circulation, and breathing, all independent of our conscious thoughts. We all want to be the best that we can be and have a happy, healthy, loving, and successful life. So let's draw up our itinerary or flight plan and set the course to obtain those things we desire. The first thing that everyone needs to understand is that each of us is a mass of vibrating energy, and we control that energy with our thoughts. Most of us simply have never known how to use these life-creating powers that we all possess. However, the messages have been in books dating back to the 1800s, and as you will recognize, these messages are also in the Bible. Each of us has the awesome power to make our life what we want it to be. Different thoughts, words, and actions are how we create different energies, which is how we set our desires and dreams into motion. These different emotions determine the frequency at which our energy vibrates. Likewise, the emotions that we are willing to hold will determine the frequencies that we attract. The Universal Law of Attraction or the Third Law of Physics is the scientific explanation of this power to attract that which we think about, talk about, and hold the emotions of. Once we understand this law of attraction, we can empower ourselves to attract that life where we are happy, healthy, loving, and successful. We are a vibrating mass of energy, and love is the frequency that represents everything positive and good. Likewise, fear is the energy frequency that takes everything good and makes it something less, depending on the degree of negativity. Most of us are unable to see this energy frequency, but its power is indisputable. For those who are able to see this energy, it looks like a halo or a field of energy surrounding all things. The evidence of the energy of love is present in everything in the world; for without love, there is nothing. Love is the glue that binds us and all things together. Because the frequency of love is not visible to most of us, I want you to visualize love. I want you to think of the wave of energy or heat that you can see radiating up off of a hot roadway. These heat waves shimmer and shine as they rise from the ground. That is how "}
