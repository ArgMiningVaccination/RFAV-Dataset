It is an essentially interdisciplinary field because Christian religious experience is the living of the human relationship with God in a community which is increasingly inclusive. Consequently, adequate preparation in the field must be broad, inclusive, yet focused. The Doctoral Area in Christian Spiritual ity has four components designed to prepare students in the field of Christian Spirituality in general and with an area of specialization within the field. I. General Considerations : A. Components: 1. Prerequisites: An advanced degree in theology (i.e., a degree beyond the B.A. or its equivalent and focused in theology, i.e., one of the ordinary disciplines of Christian theology, e.g., Bible, Historical/Systematic theology or Christian ethics); two rese arch languages other than the student's mother tongue. A diagnostic interview will be conducted with each entering student to ascertain: \u2014 to what extent the theological preparation is adequate; \u2014 a consultation with biblical faculty as to the biblical background (content, methods, hermeneutics) with specific recommendations for course work ;` \u2014 the state of the student's language preparation; \u2014 areas of particular interest within the field of Christi an spirituality; \u2014 nature of the practicum required for the program. \u2014 The committee will make appropriate recommendations for the student's future course of study. 2. Comprehensive examinations: Two general comprehensives and three special comprehensives as described below in Section C. 3. Practicum: A practical and supervised engagement providing leadership in the spirituality of individuals or groups (e.g., leadership in a retreat program) to be accomplished during the general comprehensives phase of t he program. 4. Dissertation: Completed by an oral examination on the dissertation. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 3 3 B. Ordinary Time Line for the Ph.D. in Christian Spirituality: 1. Ordinarily students will take the General Comprehensive Exams within four semesters of entering the program. 2. Ordinarily the Comprehensive in the Biblical Foundations of Christian Spirituality will be completed by the fourth semester . 3. Ordinarily the Comprehensive in the His tory of Christian Spirituality will be given in February. 4. Students' needs may sometimes require that the order of exams be reversed or that both Comprehensive Exams be given in each semester of an academic year. 5. Students are expected to complete th e Special Comprehensives within one year from the approval of the Special Comprehensives Proposal. 6. The dissertation is begun as soon as the oral exam on the written comprehensives is successfully completed and will ordinarily be finished by the end of the seventh year from matriculation. II. Elaboration of Particulars of the Requirements: A. Languages: 1. It is required that students have research competence in two languages other than their mother tongue. One of these languages must be German, French, or Spanish. The second must be a modern or ancient language appropriate to the student's research project. 2. It is recommended that both languages be completed before entering the program. However, at least one must be certified before the end of the first year and the second before the student presents the Special Comprehensives Proposal. B. Theology: 1. Students are expected to have, at the time of entrance into the Program, broad general competence in the field of Christian theology (e.g., hi storical theology, systematic theology, biblical studies, Christian ethics) certified by an acceptable advanced degree in theology or religious studies (e.g., M.A., M.Div., B.D., etc.). 2. However, some students may be required (in light of the diagnostic interview) to do some additional work in theology if there are serious lacunae in that preparation. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 4 4 3. All students, prior to completing the comprehensive examinations, are expected to take at least two graduate courses in theology relevant to the student's area of particular interest in the field of Christian Spirituality. These courses should be selected in consultation with the adviser in consideration of the diagnostic interview. C. Research Readiness requirement : Students should c arefully follow the GTU Doctoral Student handbook on preparing Research Readiness papers. The Christian Spirituality Area has adopted the following procedure: 1. Student brings the first completed Research Readiness paper (with professor comments and the completed form) to his/her advisor for a consultation on its strengths and weaknesses; this paper will ordinarily be written during the Area Seminar. 2. In ligh t of this conversation, the student prepares a second Research Readiness paper, and presents the completed paper, professor comments and completed form to the advisor. This paper will ordinarily be written in the second semester of the student's first year in the program. 3. The advisor makes a recommendation to the Area Faculty, who then accept these two papers as evidence of research readiness or, if necessary, request the preparation of a third paper with specific notations about what must be demonstrated for satisfactory completion of this requirement D. Comprehensive Examinations: 1. General Comprehensives: a) Biblical Foundations of Christian Spirituality requirement includes, in additi on to the recommendations from the diagnostic interview, recent critical hermeneutics exposure , successful completion of one NT course taken at the 4000 level and of the course SPOT 4444. b) History of Christian Spirituality: These examinations will treat of the following periods in the History of Christian Spirituality: i. Ancient Christian Spirituality ii. Medieval Christian Spirituality iii. Renaissance/Reformation Christian Spirituality iv. Modern Christian Spirituality. These examinations will follow the particular protocol approved by the Christian Spirituality Area for the general comprehensive examinations. 2. Special Comprehensives: a) Following the successful completion of the General Comprehensives, the student forms a committee composed of a chair (ordinarily from the Core Doctoral Faculty and the Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 5 5 Area Faculty), one professor from UCB (or, for a special reason, from an equivalent outside institution), and a third and/or fourth professor (ordinarily from the Core Doctoral Faculty of the GTU and from a GTU member school other than that of the Chair, and usually one with competence in the theological disciplines). Ordinarily, the committee would include two members of the Area Faculty. b) The student formulates a Special Comprehensives proposal which must be approved by the Area faculty. They may use any of the forms of comprehensive exams approved by the GTU. The program allows the student to fulfill one of the Special Comprehensives by successfully completing two related upper level courses wit h appropriate research papers, which, with professor's substantive evaluations become part of the Oral Examinations. Further, one of the Special Comprehensives will ordinarily be a timed written examination. c) Special Comprehensives require: i. an examin ation in the interdisciplinary field of Christian Spirituality. This requirement is fulfilled ordinarily by an appropriate research paper specifically in the field of Christian Spirituality, and should demonstrate serious engagement with the theological di mensions of the selected topic; ii. a field relevant to Christian Spirituality within one of the following areas: the human and/or social sciences; the natural sciences; literature and/or the arts; iii. a spirituality other than Christian which may be that of one of the great world religions, a native religion, or a contemporary non -religious spirituality. The Oral Examination will: i. be a maximum of three hours in length; ii. be administered by the comm ittee which guided the student's Special Comprehensive Examinations; iii. cover all the material of the Special Comprehensive Examinations. E. Practicum: 1. Students engage, during the time of General Comprehensives, in a practicum, i.e., some specified, supervised experience of practical leadership in the lived religious experience of Christians. The project is formulated by the student in consultation with the supervisor of the practicum. Both the practicum and supervisor are approved by the Area facult y. At the conclusion of the practicum the supervisor submits a brief written report on the student's learning within the experience and the student submits a report on her or his learning. The proposal and concluding reports are kept by the adviser in the student's file. 2. A student who has been actively engaged, immediately prior to entering the program, in practical experience specifically in the area of Christian Spirituality may petition for retroactive acceptance of that experience as the fulfillment of the practicum requirement. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 6 6 The faculty of the area will evaluate the petition and inform the student of their decision as quickly as possible. F. Dissertation: 1. After successfully completing the oral examination on the written Special Comprehensive Exams, the student will form a dissertation committee composed of a Chair (ordinarily from the Core Doctoral Faculty and the Area Faculty), one professor from UCB (or equivalent institution), and a third and/or fourth professor (ordinarily from the Core D octoral Faculty of the GTU and from a GTU member school other than that of the Chair). Exceptions can be made to this protocol as long as GTU regulations are met. The student is urged to compose the committee best qualified to aid in the pursuit of the dissertation project. 2. The student will formulate with the committee's assistance and approval a dissertation proposal, and submit it for approval to the Area faculty and then to the Doctoral Council according to the protocols and regulations of the GTU. 3. The completed dissertation is defended orally during a three -hour examination conducted by the dissertation committee. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 7 7 Christian Spirituality General Comprehensive Examination: BIBLICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR SPIRITUALITY The general comprehe nsive in Bible asks the student to demonstrate: a doctoral level familiarity with the Bible, demonstrated from transcripts as part of the admissions process and verified in the diagnostic interview and/or by additional GTU course work; this familiarity includes biblical content, ability to use current critical methodological and exegetical tools, and capacity to em ploy current hermeneutical theory related to the study of Christian Spirituality, demonstrated from transcripts or taken at GTU upon consultation with and recommendation diagnostic interview committee; The diagnostic interview team will include Christian Spirituality biblical faculty who will discuss with the student what course work has been undertaken and what needs supplement. The outcome of that interview will be a plan of study for the first two -to four semesters of the student's program, mutually a greed to, among student, advisor, and biblical studies faculty. doctoral level competence with biblical texts and issues in Christian Spirituality by successful completion of a NT 4000 level seminar, requiring a 18 -25 page paper which makes use of methodo logy and interpretation; the student will complete such a course with the grade of B and provide the graded paper to the biblical faculty on the diagnostic committee; the NT course will not be satisfied with an Special Reading Course. doctoral level compe tence with biblical texts and issues in Christian Spirituality successful completion of the area course SPOT 4444, requiring an 18 -25 page paper which makes use of methodology and interpretation with the grade of B+; The instructor of SPOT 4444, in collaboration with the biblical faculty from the diagnostic committee, certifies to the academic secretary that the general comprehensive requirement in Bible is fulfilled. The general comprehensive in Bible will normally be completed by the end of the fo urth semester.

Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 10 10 General Comprehensive Examination in History of Christian Spirituality PURPOSE: The Comprehensive Exam in the History of Christian Spirituality is based on a division of this history into four major periods: Ancient Christianity, Medieval Christianity, Renaissance/ Reformation Christianity, and Modern Christianity. This General Comprehensive Exam has two aims: 1) to assure familiarity with the broad history of Christian Spirituality; 2) to establish greater in -depth knowledge of two of the four periods of the history of Christian Spirituality which are more relevant to the students particular focus of interest. FOR M OF EXAMINATION: The General Examination will be a closed book, two -day written exam, i.e., four hours on each of two consecutive days. Each four hour examination period will consist of two parts. Part I - Area of Specialization The student will be as ked questions on one of the historical periods which they have chosen for special focus and for which they have prepared all the required readings: Time: Three Hours Part II - Area of Generalization The student will be asked questions on one of the histo rical periods for which their preparation has been more limited. Time: One Hour PREPARATION IN HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALITY Bibliography The bibliography designed for the exam is divided into four major sections, corresponding to the four major periods. Each of these four sections includes two subsections: a) primary readings (or original sources) for the period; b) secondary readings (or studies, monographs, etc., about the period and its figures). All of the primary readings are in English. Some secondary readings are in modern languages other than English. No student is expected to read the entire bibliography; rather, students are to make choices according to the following guidelines. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 11 11 Guidelines 1) Among the four major histor ical periods, students are to select two in which to specialize. 2) Students are required to do all of the primary readings in their two periods of specialization with the understanding that in a number of cases options are given. 3) Students are expecte d to read any two of the primary readings in their two periods of non - specialization. 4) Students are expected to read the required secondary readings for all four historical periods. These readings come first in each list; they are starred and in bold f ace. 5) The remainder of the list of secondary readings is recommended but not required with one exception. Students are required to read one book or major article in one of their foreign languages. The foreign language reading may either be chosen from this list, or chosen separately from this list but with the assistance of the students advisor. 6) Students should make choices according to interest and with the advice of their academic advisors. Example: A student specializing in the spirituality of Ancient and Medieval Christianity would read: a) all of the primary readings in Ancient and Medieval Christianity. b) two primary readings in Renaissance/Reformation Christianity and two primary readings in Modern Christianity. c) all of the required secondary readings in all four periods; d) other chosen recommended readings, and one secondary reading in one of her or his foreign languages.

Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 24 24 EXTENDED EXPLANATIONS SPECIAL COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS PURPOSE The Special Comprehensive Exams have two aims: 1) to give the students specific areas of teaching/research competence; 2) to establish \"dissertation readiness\" in terms of research and writing skills. FORM OF EXAMINATIONS I. The form of the exam in \"The Field of Christian Spirituality\" is a research paper approximately 30 -40 pages in length. II. One, but not both, of the other two Special Comprehensive exams may be fulfilled by taking two courses in the field and writing a doctoral level paper for each of those courses. These graded papers are submi tted as part of the comprehensives dossier and will be subject matter for the Oral Exam. III. With the exception of the exam in \"The Field of Christian Spirituality,\" the Special Comprehensive Exams may take any of the forms permitted by the GTU (e.g., pap er, open book exam, closed book timed exam, teaching a course, etc.) IV. Ordinarily one of the Special Comprehensive Examinations will be a timed, closed - book exam. PREPARATION FOR SPECIAL COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS Before preparation for the special comprehensives is begun, the general comprehensive exams must be satisfactorily completed and the languages certified. Committee Unlike the general comprehensive exams which are completed under the direction and supervision of the academic adviser , special comprehensive exams are completed under the direction and supervision of a specially formed committee. The committee must have at least three and may have as many as four members. The composition of the committee is as follows: 1) The chair of the committee is one of the members of the core faculty in Christian Spirituality. 2) One of the committee members must be from an external institution which is normally UCB and must be approved by the GTU Dean if the external institution is not UCB. 3) The committee should have at least two professors (including the Chair) who are conversant with and competent in Christian Spirituality, ideally members of the core faculty. 4) The committee should include someone competent in the area of Christian theology (which may well be the Chair or another core faculty person). Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 25 25 The composition of the committee is approved by the Christian Spirituality Area faculty. The student then works with the committee to formulate a proposal for meeting the requirements of the Special Comprehensive Exams. This proposal, when it has been unanimously accepted by the members of the committee, must be presented at an Area Meeting and approved by the faculty in Christian Spirituality. Topics and bibliographies are chosen in the three areas listed below on the basis of student interests and the guidelines provided for each area. Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 26 26 AREAS OF THE SPECIAL COMPREHENSIVE EXAMS I. THE FIELD OF CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALITY PURPOSE This exam allows the student to focus on his or her particular research interests as well as demonstrating readiness to proceed to dissertation in the field of Christian Spirituality. Therefore, the student must demonstrate the following: 1. appropriate definition of a problem or topic in the field of Christian Spirituality; 2. ability to build a bibliography in the field relative to the particular topic, issue, etc.; 3. ability to integrate, with methodological integrity, Scripture, histor y of Spirituality, and theology as well as other appropriate disciplines in handling the topic; 4. knowledge of basic research tools in the field; 5. ability to carry out and organize the results of research, to write effectively, to correctly use critical appar atus (notes, bibliography, etc.). FORM OF EXAMINATION This exam is to be a research paper approximately 30 -40 pages in length. TOPIC 1. the topic is to be specifically in the field of Christian Spirituality. 2. The topic is to be significant in scope and depth. 3. The topic should, insofar as possible, be related to the student's area of dissertation research but not a piece of that work. For example: If the general research interest is prayer, the topic for the Special Comp might be: \"Discursive Prayer in the Teaching of Post -16th Century Europe Manuals of Spirituality\" or \"The Role of the Imagination in Teresa of Avila's Teaching on Prayer in The Interior Castle \" or \"New Understandings of Prayer in Post Vatical II American Catholicism\" or \"The Ro le of Personal Prayer in the Post -Conversion Spirituality of Pentecostals,\" or \"The Spirituality Revealed in Luther's Writings on the Lord's Prayer.\" II. A FIELD RELATED TO SPIRITUALITY A. The student will select a field of study outside the field of Christian Spirituality. The field will ordinarily be within one of the following clusters: 1. the human and social sciences 2. the natural sciences 3. literature and the arts Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 27 27 B. The student will select a sub-discipline within this field. For example: 1. Developmental psychology, cultural anthropology, or sociology; 2. Cosmology, medicine, or biology; 3. Architecture, poetry, or music. C. The student may choose to fulfill this exam by taking two courses in the sub -discipline and writing a doctoral level paper at the conclusion of each. The paper should demonstrate that the student has achieved significant learning in the field which is relevant to the student's interests in the field of spirituality D. Alternatively, the student may choose to fulfill this r equirement by preparing an examination, according to any of the accepted formulae of the GTU, following these guidelines: The student selects an exam topic within the sub -discipline . This is a specified topic of investigation and not a narrowly focused qu estion. For example: 1. Transformation rituals among the Navajo 2. Freud's concept of religion 3. Genetic engineering as a moral dilemma 4. \"Big Bang\" theory of cosmological origins 5. The use of journal writing in the personal development of May Sarton and Thomas Merton 6. Romanesque and Baroque cathedrals as carriers of cultural and religious meaning. Thus a student would formulate the exam topic for this comprehensive by moving from CLUSTER to FIELD to SUB -DISCIPLINE to TOPIC. For Example: CLUSTER: Social Sci ences to FIELD: Geography to SUB -DISCIPLINE: Human Geography to TOPIC \"Geography of Utah and the Development of Mormonism\" III. A SPIRITUALITY NOT WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION PURPOSE In this Special Comprehensive Exam, the student will acqui re a broad yet relatively deep acquaintance with a spirituality that is not within the Christian tradition. The purpose of this learning is not \"comparative,\" i.e., to compare this spirituality to Christian spirituality or to find equivalences between ele ments of the two spiritualities, but to achieve a dialogical understanding of how another spirituality exists, functions, and transforms its practitioners. It is in understanding the \"other\" as other that we often understand ourselves more deeply. This r elative competence in another spirituality should also Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 28 28 enable the student to participate in the increasingly cross -cultural conversation in the field of spirituality. DIALOGUE PARTNERS Ordinarily, the dialogue partner will be chosen from one of the following three clusters: 1. Native Spiritualities (e.g., American Indian, African tribal, Eskimo, Australian aboriginal, Maori, Polynesian, etc.). 2. World Religions Spiritualities (e.g., Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Taoist, Buddhist, etc.). 3. Contemporary non -religiou s spiritualities (e.g., feminist, male, ecological, New Age, Twelve -Step, etc.). GUIDELINES FOR SELECTION 1. The spirituality studied should be significant, i.e., something which might form an area of teaching specialization or future research. 2. There mus t be resources at the GTU and/or UCB for a responsible study. 3. It is the spirituality (not theology, sociology, etc.) of the religion or movement which is to be studied. 4. METHOD 1. The student may choose to fulfill this requirement by taking two courses in the religious tradition selected and writing doctoral level papers for the courses in which the student researches and discusses the spirituality. (See above under \"A Field Related to Spirituality\"). 2. Alternatively, the student may c hoose to meet this requirement by any of the means approved by the GTU. In that case, after selecting the specific spirituality to be studied, the student will select a topic or issue, the study of which will be sufficiently inclusive to permit the studen t to acquire some real understanding of \"the other.\" For example: 1. Meditation in Zen Buddhism 2. The Understanding and Role of the Black Messiah in African American Religion 3. The Struggle around Violence/Non -Violence in the Ecological Movement 4. Spirit and Nature in Feminist Spirituality Christian Spirituality Protocol September 2011 Page 29 29 PRACTICUM IN THE PROGRAM OF CHRISTIAN SPIRITUALITY The Practicum is designed to provide students with practical leadership in the lived spiritual experience of Christians during the time of their studies. I t will normally be completed before special comprehensives. Students engage, during the time of General Comprehensives, in a practicum, i.e., some specified, supervised experience of practical involvement in the lived religious experience of Christians. T he project is formulated by the student in consultation with the supervisor of the practicum. Both the practicum and supervisor are approved by the Area faculty. At the conclusion of the practicum the supervisor submits a brief written report on the studen t's learning within the experience and the student submits a report on her or his learning. The proposal and concluding reports are kept by the adviser in the student's file. A student who has been actively engaged, immediately prior to entering the progr am, in practical experience specifically in the area of Christian Spirituality may petition for retroactive acceptance of that experience as the fulfillment of the practicum requirement. The faculty of the area will evaluate the petition and inform the stu dent of their decision as quickly as possible. ` "}
