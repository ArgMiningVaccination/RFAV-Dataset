Have you guys ever felt like you were just so tired and [fatigued](https://drnicolebonner.com/conditions/fatigue/), even just halfway through your day that you needed a cup of coffee just to get you through the rest of the day, or maybe even a nap? Not Taking Care of Our Bodies Has Negative Consequences Well, if so, I want you to know that I've been there. Man, there was a time in my life when I was too busy to take care of my body, and I nearly drove my body right into the ground. In fact, my thyroid levels were so off the charts. The doctor who ran my blood work and said he didn't even know how I was able to get out of bed. And for those of you who knows anything about thyroid, you would know that a TSH over 100 is extremely dangerous. Well, that's where I was. Can any of you relate to being too busy to take care of your to take care of your body? Yeah, I hear it all the time. The thing is, is that we live in a world today that is extremely busy. And if we don't take the time, out of our busy days, and our busy routines, and take just a little bit of time out of our tasks, to take care of our body, your body is going to do it for you just like mine did. They live Trust me, I live through the experience. Why Do We Feel Tired? So what causes our body to feel tired and [fatigued](https://drnicolebonner.com/conditions/fatigue/)? Well, there are many things that can make us feel tired. It can be anything from a dysfunctional thyroid, like I was experiencing autoimmune dysfunction, Epstein Barr Virus, unmanaged emotional [stress](https://drnicolebonner.com/conditions/stress/), a weakened physical structure, burned out adrenal glands, lack of sleep, and so much more. Right. So how do we know exactly what is the underlying cause of the [fatigue](https://drnicolebonner.com/conditions/fatigue/) that we're having? Then? More importantly, how do we fix it? Well, in our office, we're a holistic wellness office that primarily focuses on spinal correction and advanced chiropractic care. Now, what does that mean, you're probably thinking shoot, man, I thought [chiropractors](https://drnicolebonner.com/) were just doctors that took care of spinal problems, or doctors that treated neck or back pain. And the reality is, is that in fact, chiropractors and chiropractic does not treat any of that. But like, whoa, never heard that before. Let me explain. Your whole body runs on from energy, and your whole body runs by the direction of your brain. Other words, your brain controls every thing about you, it controls the health and the function of all of your cells, all of your tissues in your body, and all the organs in your body. And your brain talks to your body through your spinal cord, now your spinal cord runs right down through the center of your spine. And then these branches come off of the cord, these are nerve roots, and they exit the spine and they go over, or they go through your entire body, just like electrical wire in a building. In fact, your nervous system is your electrical system for your entire body. Our Nervous System is the Master Control Everything that goes on inside of your body, including the production of energy is controlled by your brain and by your nervous system. So when we have different stress in our life, but that stress causes because it causes our spine to shift and get stuck out of alignment. That's a condition of the spine that we call subluxation. I'm not sure if you've ever heard that word before. But a subluxation is a misalignment of one or more of the spinal bones that causes stress to the nervous system. And when your nervous system is under stress, it cannot perform properly. And it that's the communication between your brain and the rest of your body. Now when the brain can't talk to the body, energy suffers on so many different levels because then the body becomes weak. It doesn't function as well. The cells don't produce as much energy. The chemistry in your body could be off for analysis. And the body isn't as strong to resist things like viruses and bacteria. So that healing hands we don't treat these diseases. But what we do do is we find out if people have stress to their nervous system that's depleting their body of energy.
