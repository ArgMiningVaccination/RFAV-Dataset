COVID-19 vaccine safety |Can I get COVID-19 after I have received the vaccine?| | | COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death, but vaccines do not remove all risk of acquiring a COVID-19 infection. Natural immunity from a COVID-19 illness may not last long and there is a risk of new infection with the variants that are circulating in the community. |Can I both the COVID-19 vaccine and another vaccine at the same time?| | | Individuals aged six months and older can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as, or at any time before or after other routine vaccines, with informed consent. |How do the vaccines protect against COVID-19?| | | Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body's natural defences to build protection.

There is no minimum age for giving consent under the Health Care Consent Act, 1996 of Ontario. If the individual is capable to provide informed consent, parental consent is not needed. Informed consent means that you understand what the vaccine involves, why it is recommended, and the risks and benefits of getting or not getting it. If an individual is unable to provide informed consent to receive the vaccine (for example, for medical reasons), they will need consent from someone who can make a decision on their behalf, such as a parent or legal guardian. If an individual is under 12 years of age, they must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. As a parent or guardian, discuss immunization with your child. Your child needs to know about: The vaccine administrator needs to know your child's: |My child received Moderna for the first dose and is now 5 years old.
