It's also used to balance yin-yang energies, as it's considered a physical bridge to the spiritual. Tourmaline comes in a variety of colors, the most common being black. It also comes in pink to red, blues, yellows, browns, greens, oranges, and then a combination of two or more of these colors. This is referred to as the rainbow tourmaline. The energies within the crystals differ depending on the colors.
