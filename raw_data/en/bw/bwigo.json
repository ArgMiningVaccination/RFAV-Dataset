LOUIS METRO AREA TRANSFORMATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The East St. Louis Metro Area is the most distressed community in the State of Illinois as measured by the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (a measure of 15 census elements that demonstrate a communit y's economic and social vulnerability) . The mostly African -American r esidents of this community contend with health disparities in virtually every measure, including Infant Mortality, Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer Screenings, Mental Illness, Substance Use Disorder and Asthma. Residents also face considera ble barriers to access, demonstrated by a large backlog of unmet specialist referrals , and excess ER usage. The service area for this community includes East St. Louis, Cahokia Heights , Washington Park, Sauget, Brooklyn, Venice , Madison , Granite City, and Alton . Touchette Regional Hospital (TRH), a safety -net hospital serving this community since 1958, has developed the East St. Louis Health Transformation Partnership in order to affect large scale realignment of the health delivery system as well as improv ements in the life circumstances of those living in the East St. Louis Metro Area. This collaborative partnership brings together: TRH (the only safety -net hospital in the community), SIHF Healthcare (the largest provider of pri mary care services in the area), Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, SLUCare Physician Group, Memorial Medical Group, and Washington University (to provide enhan ced Specialist care), ConferMed (to provide peer -to-peer consultation with primary care physicians ), Centene (to provide training for Community Health Workers ), Healthier Together (a collective impact organ ization with over 70 service organizations dedicated to working together to improve community health), Comprehensive Behavioral Health Center (the provider of outpatient Substance Use Disorder and Mental Health Serv ice in downtown East St. Louis), the St. Clair County Sherriff's Office and EMS services (to develop a new diversion center to treat minor offenders impacted by behavioral health), Southwestern Illin ois Community College (to develop a new workforce d evelopment and training campus), the St. Clair County Housing Authority (to partnership on new community housing) , Zade, LLC , and the Metropolitan Housing Develop ment Corporation (to develop and own the co mmunity and supportive housing in partnership with SIHF) . Extensive community needs will require capital investment for a new Health Care Campus for ambulatory and hospita l complex es, renovation funds for the development of an Urgent Care C enter in midtown East St. Louis, a new Workforce D evelopment an d Training Center in Venice, the repurpos ing of the former TRH Hospital facility for a Diversion C enter , Supportive Housing and Services, and an extensive community housing project to improve living conditions of individuals in the community. Critical investment with the deployment of a new team of Community Health Workers in conjunction with a new Community Health Hub will link community residents with extensive health and social needs to a wide var iety of collaborating service providers. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 7 Equity in access and the elimination of disparities drive t he overall goals of this collaboration . This is necessary to improve health outcomes in the health conditions that impact our community . The specific goals of this collaboration are based on measurable health outcomes data as follow: PROJECT GOALS Category Current ly in the Community Target Goal Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 12.9 10.0 Uncontrolled Diabetes Rate (lower is better) 37% 30% Controlled Hypertension Rate (higher is better) 56% 65% Breast Cancer Screening Rate 51% 60% Cervical Cancer Screening Rate 61% 70% Percent of Mental Illness hospitalizations with a follow -up visit within 7 days 15% 35% Percent of Substance Use Disorder hospitalizations with a follow -up visit within 7 days 29% 50% Unmet Specialty Referrals 50% (currently 35,561) 10% Excess ER usage 35% of visits (9,370 of 27,832) 20% of visits Rate of ER visits for Asthma in the community per 10,000 155 75 Percent Live Births with Prenatal Care started in first trimester 49% 80% The necessity for a community transformation in our distressed communities is clear. Unmet health needs, social barriers, lack of connectivity between organizations, years o f disinvestment, limited jobs, and inequi ties in workforce opportunities require significant transformation in resources and collaborati on to deve lop key elements over the next five years to create the necessary reinvestment that can truly alter the system s supporting ongoing sustainability for our distressed region . Taken together, these activities will commence the necessary transform ations over the next five years that will advance the health and well -being of residents of the East St. Louis Metro Area well into the future. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 8 MAJOR PROJECTS THAT SHAPE THIS TRANSFORMATION Activity Description Purpose New Health Care Campus near major highways and transportation hubs Development of a new Health Care Campus with an ambulatory care center for expanded access to specialty care , general acute care hospital including emergency medicine, expanded behavioral health unit, acute medical unit along with diagnostic and social services to address social determinants . TRH is a 60 year old facility, located in a neighborhood with poor access and facility challenges as an acute hospital. A modern health care campus more central and accessible to specialty and social services will improve Health Equity . Development of an Urgent Care Center in midtown East St. Louis This Urgent Care Center will feature Walk -In acute care services integrated with p rimary care, ancillary diagnostic s for radiology , lab, pharmacy , and care management . Opening this center in E ast St. Louis will address the acute care needs of this community and improve linkage to primary care services. Brin ging this increasingly common service delivery site into the community will improve Health Equity . Development of a Community Health Hub to improve resource s The Community Health Hub will improve the integration, efficiency, and coordination of care across provider types and levels of care while also providing increased access to supportive life services in order to help improve the SDOH. Development of the H ealth Hub will improve access to care and help improve health literacy and healthcare outcomes driven by the current lack of Health Equity . Deployment of Community Health Workers Local Community Health Workers will work closely with partners and families to connect to social and medical services to remove barriers to health. Deploying Community Health Workers throughout the community will ensure individuals have resources to connect them to a wide assortment of health and supportive services. These service s will address both Health Equity and the Social Determinants of Health . New Workforce Development and Job Training Center in Venice The Workforce Development Center will include a combined new campus in Venice, Illinois to be supported by Southwestern Il linois Community College, SIU -e, SIHF Healthcare, and local business leaders to increase job training and educational opportunities with an emphasis on trades. A Workforce Development project will improve the educational, training and job options of the co mmunity. This is a direct response to negative Social Determinants of Health and Economic Equity . Repurposing of current TRH facility to provide a Diversion program, supportive housing and transitional housing The repurposing of the former hospital will i nclude: 1) a diversion program in partnership with the St. Clair County Sheriff, 2) the implementation of a crisis living room center that provides an alternative delivery model for those with an acute mental health situation versus emergency room utilizat ion; 3) supportive housing that creates a continuum of care for those being discharged from the diversion program, the hospital 's inpatient behavioral health unit, and others , and 4) the transition of additional hospital space to provide workforce develop ment, life skill s training, behavior health counseling, high school equivalency programming, and guidance towards steps in acquiring permanent external housing. This partnership will start to address the over incarceration that affects this community and a ddress the negative Social Determinants of Health that affect those caught in the legal system and the families often left behind. Public Housing Replacement Project Our housing transformation initiative will focus on affordable and safe neighborhoods tha t seek to lower associated health problems with chronic diseases, injuries, childhood development, violence control, psoriasis, asthma, respiratory conditions, and mental distress. Housing is a key element of the built environment that can affect health outcomes. Housing improvements w ill directly impact the Social Determinants of Health. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 9 COMMUNITY INPUT The service area for this project is the East St. Louis Metro Area that inhabits both St. Clair and Madison Counties located just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Mo. The focus of much of our transformations will be in the hardest impacted communities of East St. Louis, Cahokia Heights (inclusive of Centr eville, Cahokia, and Alorton), Washington Park, Venice, Brooklyn, Fairmont City, Alton, Granite City, and Madison, Illinois. Voters in Cahokia, Alorton and Centreville recently approved a proposal to merge their towns to create a new city called \"Cahokia H eights, \" This merger took effect on April 7, 2021. The focus communities share the highest proportion and concentration of African - American residents that have been impacted the most by very low incomes and social conditions. In 2019, Centreville (now part of the new Cahokia Heights) was ranked the poorest town in Illinois in a 24/7 Wall St. analysis examining small communities with high poverty rates and financial hardships. Community input has been gathered for our transformation through several means. Ov er the last year our respective team has participated in weekly calls lead by the United Church Groups in bo th St. Clair and Madison Counties . These weekly calls have leaders from churches, agencies, government, and others seeking a platform for transform ation and interventions. The focus since April 2020 has been the disparities and needs for services in our hardest hit communities from COVID -19. The St. Clair group has been adamant th at if East St. Louis cannot support a new hospital then an Urgent Care Center must be started. This group's sense of health needs in the community allowed us to hear voices directly from the community in order to learn how to best address their health and social needs. Dr. Robert Farmer, the Co -Chair of Healthi er Together , has played a key role in the development of this proposal through extensive in -person meetings. Healthier Together is a 100% volunteer driven organization governed by an independent Council of Partners whose members include leaders in the healthcare, business, faith, education and local government sectors. Healthier Together supports the efforts of community work groups targeting Chronic Disease Prevention, Community Safety, Education, Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health, and Substance Use Disorder. Healthier Together brings over 70 organizations, currently dedicated to working together to improve community health and overall quality of life to this project. Healthier Together seeks to transform St. Clair County and the Metro East area into the top 25% of healthiest counties in Illinois by 2025, by creating opportunities so all residents can experience a safer, healthier quality of life. A listing of all of the organizations participating in the Healthier Together Collaborative is included a s an attachment to this application. In preparatio n for our transformation we also engaged HMA Consultants to conduct one -on-one interviews with our elected officials, local leaders, church leaders, community agencies, Sheriff, Mental Health Board, Memori al Hospital, and the Board of Directors for TRH and SIHF. The existing services, needs of the communities, care gaps, and considerations for our transformation plans were presented to 28 individuals during this input process. Throughout the above processe s, TRH leadership has been holding meetings with local, state, county, and federal elected officials on the components of our transformation. Officials consulted for this project Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 10 include: Mayor Jackson of Centreville, Lamar Gentry of Alorton, Towns hip Supervisor Curtis McCall , and future Mayor of Cahokia Heights, Representative Latoya Jackson, Senator Chris Belt, Congressman Bost U.S. Representative for Illinois's 12th congressional district, Sen. Duckworth, Sen. Durbin, and Mayor Robert Eastern of East St. Louis. These elected officials provided invaluable feedback on needs, locations, and services. Their involvement has been i ntegral to the development of transformation activities . In fact some of our previous efforts have resulted in continued participatio n in our efforts to improve the health of our community. Our most recent engagement with some of the same officials led to ex tensive feedback on COVID testing and vaccine clinics. This plan with state, local and federal officials was last reviewed on March 29, 2021. The plan to repurpose TRH was developed through a collaborative effort with the St. Clair County Sherriff's office, St. Clair County Government, EMS systems, and local behavioral health providers. Input on housing plans have been collec ted from meetings held with the SCCHA, and the residents of the current complexes that will be impacted by the changes. Upcoming partnership with the Illinois Housing Development Authority will extend the input from our residents, business owners, elected officials and others as we will be commencing a Community Revitalization Planning effort with their consultation starting in August 2021. Community stakeholders including Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville (SIUe), Southwestern Illinois College (S WIC), Madison County Community Development, and SIHF Healthcare have worked together on an extensive project plan for the workforce development and training facility, including soliciting input from local elected officials in these communities. SIHF Health care also provided extensive community input through data reports detailing local demographics and health outcomes and through extensive meetings with staff directly responsible for patient care as well as senior leadership. As a Federally Qualified Health Center, SIHF is governed by an active community -based Board of Directors with a majority of the board members being current SIHF patients and 8 of the current 14 board members are African -American and one is Latina. This enables SIHF to provide continual input from patients throughout the community in order to guide program activities and adjust to patient needs as they evolve. Data sources for community information include the Transformation Data & Community Needs Report: East St. Louis Metro Area, publis hed by the University of Illinois Chicago, US census data, health data from the CDC, data from local health departments, and internal data collected from TRH and SIHF medical records systems. SIHF's Electronic Health record system already includes an indiv idual health record for nearly 120,000 residents of this community based on a three year analysis of unique patients in these zip codes. Every three years , Touchette Regional Hospital hosts a Community Partners Roundtable to obtain input for a Community Ne ed Assessment and surveys stakeholders in the community to determine health priorities. This process includes an open meeting (advertised in local newspapers) to solicit community Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 11 input for anyone who would like to be included but who was missed in the ini tial planning process. The community agencies participating in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment process included: Hoyleton Youth and Family Services/ Puentes de Esperanza - Initially a provider of residential services, Hoyleton's proactive appro ach has enabled their expansion into several service lines including: child welfare services, behavioral health, and preventive care services focused on teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and more. These services are also offered for Spanish -speaking clients through the Puentes de Esperanza program. St. Clair County Mental Health Board - Working to improve the development and delivery of mental health services for persons in St. Clair County. SIHF Healthcare Healthy Start Initiative - Providing comprehensiv e case management and support to mothers, their children, and their families before, during, and after pregnancy. Windsor Health Center - One of SIHF Healthcare's 30+ health centers providing healthcare services to the greater Southern Illinois area. Serv ices offered include family health, women's health, behavioral health, and primary care. Catholic Urban Programs - One of the best -known providers of food, rent subsidies, clothing, and financial support for individuals that fall between the cracks of ser vice providers. Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House - Providing early childhood development and comprehensive youth services in addition to individual and family support services, all which help move individuals and families out of poverty. TRH has als o recently launched a community dialogue and workgroup program, supported by Healing Illinois, hosting community -wide discussions through ZOOM to discuss Racial Inequity and Racial Healing with various leaders in the community. TRH has hosted 6 monthly dis cussion groups attended by over 20 local faith and community leaders, led by Cora Hughes, Chaplain and Community Services Manager with TRH. This program has finished its first six months of operations and participants have already contacted Cora to request the program continue. SIHF has also recently initiated a dialogue with Daryl Rice, pastor of Greater Love Family Church in an effort to provide health outreach and COVID - 19 vaccinations through local church councils. Beyond all of the community input soli cited in the development of this project, TRH will continue to seek and respond to community inputs as an active process throughout the operational phase of the Transformation. Outreach efforts will continually seek input from Black and Hispanic local and national community organizations, local homeless shelters, public housing providers and residents, mayors, Boards of Alderman, local health departments, elected officials and other local and regional healthcare and social service entities. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 12 DATA The design of this Transformation was based on a data -driven analysis of communi ty need in conjunction with extensive community input. Specific data points used in this design included: Infant Mortality Rates, Diabetes Rates, Hypertension Rates, Asthma Rates, Cancer Screening Rates, rates of follow -up care to hospitalizations for Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorder, the number of unmet Specialty referrals from SIHF Healthcare, the number of non -emergency ER visits, and entry into Prenatal Care. These measures were selected as they mirror several independent needs analysis provided by local stakeholders, Healthier Together reports, and TRH's own Community Needs Assessment. These Needs Assessments along with feedback from patients and staff at TRH and SI HF also align with the University of Illinois Chicago report, \"Transformation Data & Community Needs Report: East St. Louis Metro Area.\" In each of these assessments, services for Mental Health and Substance Abuse as well as \"ambulatory care sensitive cond itions\" or Chronic Disease care for heart disease, diabetes and asthma were all identified as community concerns. Improved access and coordination of care for these chronic health conditions can reduce hospitalizations through early intervention that can p revent complications and progression to more severe disease. The same can be said for mental health and Substance Use Disorder services. This process of examining needs in the community led to the following data elements identified as the Goals of the East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership . These measures align with the Department's Quality Strategy and many of the same data points are measured. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 13 PROJECT GOALS Item Measure Description Current Goal Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 The number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. 12.9 10.0 Uncontrolled Diabetes Rate *lower is better Patients 18 - 75 years of age with diabetes with A1c value is > 9.0% or not tested 37% 30% Controlled Hypertension Rate *higher is better Patients 18 - 85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension/most recent blood pressure was adequately controlled (< 140/90 mmHg) 56% 65% Breast Cancer Screening Rate Women 50 - 74 years of age with a mammogram within the past 24 months 51% 60% Cervical Cancer Screening Rate Women ages 21 - 64 who were screened for cervical cancer 61% 70% Percent of Mental Illness hospitalizations with a follow -up visit within 7 days Patients with mental health issues receiving outpatient care within 7 days following a hospitalization/ER visit 15% 35% Percent of Substance Use Disorder hospitalizations with a follow -up visit within 7 days Patients with substance use disorder issues receiving outpatient care within 7 days following a hospitalization/ER visit 29% 50% Unmet Specialty Referrals Number of referrals to specialty care that were not able to be completed within 90 days 50% (currently 35,561) 10% Excess ER usage Hospital vis its over a 2 -year period with acuity levels 4 or 5 (less urgent) 35% of visits (9,370 of 27,832) 20% of visits Rate of ER visits for Asthma in the community per 10,000 The number of ER visits for Asthma in the community per 10,000 155 75 Timeliness of Prenatal Care Percent Live Births with Prenatal Care started in first trimester 49% 80% These goals will guide our collective efforts with our partners through ongoing monitoring throughout the program and the Transformation actions that will seek to meet these preliminary goals within five years. HEALTH EQUITY AND OUTCOMES A severe lack of Health Equity in the East St. Louis Metro Area has led to a series of poor health outcomes. This lack of health resources and services has been driven by white flight and medical services following this population. With the loss of the region's major employers and over two thirds of the residents in East St. Louis fleeing for the suburbs, the community began to fall in to state and federal debt as crime and corrup tion began to rise. This resulted in the loss of significant medical services Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 14 culminating in the closure of two of the community's hospitals (Christian Welfare in the 1980's and Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital in 2016) leaving East St. Louis, one of the mos t dangerous cities in America, without an Emergency Room. Concurrently, neighboring health systems have limited access or have denied access completely to those on Medicaid and those without h ealth insurance . Services like specialist care and acute emergen cy care are very limited in the community. The East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership directly seeks to improve health equity in these distressed communities with improved health conditions and outcomes through enhanced patient support and a revised de livery services. Chronic under -investment across social and health care in the community has created an environment that leads to multiple health risks and social challenges. Local organizations struggle to address the full breadth of hea lth related needs due to the overwhelming social issues impacting our community. Service providers in our community struggle to maintain wages, job resources, and comparable benefits that other larger providers and those in more affluent areas enjoy. Recru itment and retention of clinicians and staff in our distressed area and organization is complicated by the fact our funding is based upon 76% uninsured and Medicaid patients. This very condition results in a lack of equity when compared to other communitie s employment offerings. Specific equity issues directly affecting the healthcare delivery system in the community include: Inadequate health care campus/hospital with an aging facility that lacks modern operational capabilities. The current campus and infr astructure of Touchette Regional Hospital is over 60 years old, well beyond the useful life of a community regional hospital; Lack of specialist services due to challenges in recruitment for patient payment categories and the denials from other providers; Lack of an acute care/urgent care facility in the East St. Louis community to address immediate acute needs for the many community residents who seek use of emergency rooms for their non - emergency care; Lack of care management services in order to overc ome a lack of health literacy and health education in the community; and Lack of connection to the health related resources available in the community All of these listed inequities have been demonstrated to affect communities of color much more than majo rity white communities. Coupled with a lack of safe housing, parks are often in disrepair and dangerous, poor air quality, rampant crime, low capacity for revenue for city governments, and abundant brown fields plague our communities and make it difficult to bring forth resources to improve health equity. The current trend in the area has been to see resources funneled away from these communities. One hospital in neighboring Belleville underwent a relocation that moved them further away from the Metro East St. Louis Area and another Belleville Hospital opened a new more modern facility on the east side of their community further from East St. Louis. Both facilities are conveniently located near more Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 15 economically viable populations, leaving the East St. Louis Metro Area with facilities decades behind those of their neighbors with health results to match. A brief look at hea lth disparity conditions negatively affecting the community can be seen below in comparison with state and n ational figures, clearly showing extensive disparitie s in health outcomes: Disparity East St Louis Illinois Unites States Infant mortality rate per 1,000 births 12.9 6.5 5.7 Diabetes (adults 18+) 17.6% 14.4% health rankings) 37% 30% 30% Achieving a community with greater health equity requires a comprehensive reimagining of the health and healthcare services provided in both cultural approaches and delivery methods. Housing, care management, outreach, more convenient access, cultural sensitivity, workforce improvement, educational support, and community engagement are all necessary steps that a collective partnership for transformation must pursue. T he specific activities in this Transformation that relate directly to Health Equity include: A new convenient and comprehensive Health Campus that addresses our community needs in the East St. Louis Metro Area The new Health Campus will feature an ambulato ry care center that embeds partnerships with multi - specialty groups to address regional unmet needs for M edicaid and uninsured patients through face -to- face visits, telemedicine, peer -to-peer consultations, expanded dental access, and outpatient surgery. The Health Campus will provide an expanded solution to the unmet need for inpatient behavioral health services for adult s, adolescents, and geriatrics through a new behavioral health services model supported by medical detox servi ces. An outpatient area adj acent to the ED for a \"living r oom\" Crisis Stabilization Unit will provide a welcoming and culturally competent way to ensure those who come to the ED with Behavioral Health issues do not face social stigma while seeking care and are more comfortable to sh are their concerns and amenable to further treatment. Community rooms and food resources will be developed through partnerships with local food and nutrition outreach efforts like the current collaborative program to deliver fresh, healthy food in the comm unity in partnership with the Sweet Potato Patch food service. The new health care campus will also serve as the primary community location for improved specialty care service through collaboration with SIU School of Medicine, Washington University, Memor ial Medic al Group, ConferMed and others to develop multi -specialty programming to address regional unmet needs for Medicaid and uninsured patients through face -to-face visits, telemedicine, and peer -to- peer consultat ions. Peer -to-peer consultation programm ing, support ed by ConferMed will allow SIHF's primary care physicians to consult with a multitude of specialists in order to support providing care for those whose conditions are easily controlled through their primary care physician , lessening the need for Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 16 additional visits with external specialists. Consultations above the comfort of the primary care provider can be referred directly to a specialist for a face -to-face or telehealth encounter. This program will be supported in all SIHF primary care sites i n the service area. Our ability to provide hospital -based specialty care, either independently or via partnerships, will allow us to realize substantial savings by avoiding the astronomical cost of sustaining imperative service lines through locums service s. Locum costs currently create a tremendous strain to our limited r esources which would be better deployed to satisfy basic patient needs. Specialty partnership s will work through the necessary collaborative structure to allow for assessment and diagnost ics to be provided in the immediate community and for higher -level diagnostics and procedures to be performed by specialists at Memoria l Hospital. It is our intention to proceed in this manner to help provide for greater continuum of care without actions t hat would duplicate necessary resources and cost. Furthermore, our partnership has a collective desire to create a sustainable and effective service line for women's health care and services to ensure prenatal, postpartum, and other key related women's hea lth needs are addressed in a similar manner. This respective partnership will look at how we can deliver effective quality care at the most cost -efficie nt manner that shall advance the health outcome s of the women and subsequently their newborns. This partne rship will require greater access to subspecialty prenatal services, a more effective utilization of shared medical data between the clinicians, linkages to community health workers and care coordination, and wraparound services to address any social deter minants of health. Establishing these service s will require the implementation of an appropriate EHR system. The installation of a Meditech system to link all partnering organizations will r esolve inadequacies in current EHR int eroperability and functional ity and r educe d eficiencies caused by multiple i ndependent systems that lack integration with ea ch other and external entities. Inadequate referral and scheduling tools in the current systems create barriers to access for patients in our region. Antiquate d system functionality stands as a barrier to efficient care and decision support for providers. A m odern , integrated full -service system is attractive to specialist and sub -specialist providers, improving our ability to recruit specialists , thus reducing the current care access crisis. Development of an Urgent Care Center in midtown East St. Louis Urgent Care Centers are fast becoming a fundamental part of the healthcare landscape for acute care needs. Presently, there are no urgent care centers in the Eas t St. Louis Metro area that the population could easily access. A new Urgent Care Center could greatly benefit accessibility for residents by providing a greater range of services than traditi onal physician offices. Our integrated Urgent Care Model will be developed through existing space with extensive renovation to meet the needs of patients . Primary care services will be imbedded in the Center to provide increased accessibility while also providing more affordable care versus having residents continue us ing emergency rooms. This Urgent Care Center will feature: Comprehensive Primary Care with no waits for those needing immediate attention or unable to access care during normal business hours; Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 17 Ancillary Services to support and enhance the provisi on of Urge nt Care, including Diagnostic Radiology, and Lab Services (Lab Draw Station, General POC and limited onsite testing); Pharmacy Services; and Enhanced Care Management through the deployment of Community Health Workers within the facility. This Urgent Care Center imp roves access to acute services and features walk -in primary care services as a direct response to community input. Members of the community have repeatedly stated they want a walk -in urgent care center. This is unsurprising as a 2017 report by th e Commonwealth Fund , Listening to Low -Income Patients: Obstacles to the Care We Need, When We Need It , noted that \"Along with the cost of care, the patients we spoke to reported that taking time off work, juggling child care, handling family matters, and f inding transportation are problems for them in a traditional appointment only model.\" This new structure will keep working , low-income people, who often do not get paid sick leave, from losing precious income when they take time off to go to the doctor . Additionally, an Urgent Care Center alleviates excess hospital visits. By locating this center in the midtown area of East St. Louis, the location will be convenient to many individuals and easier to access in a more modern facility. According to the SSM Hea lth network, any community with 25,000 or more people without an urgent care center is an area with sufficient need to support one. Estimates of urgent care services are calculated at 560 visits per 1,000 persons per year would anticipate approx.14,560 encounters per year for the City of East St. Louis alone. Connecting People to Health through Community Health Workers & Health Hub Currently, even when services are available in the community, they are not always easy to access for everyone. When you combin e the labyrinthine features of many health systems today that baffle those with greater resources, this can present insurmountable barriers to those who lack health literacy. Community Health Workers will serve as a liaison, link, and intermediary between health and social services and the community to improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery that includes all transition of care needs. Integration of CHW into the local health delivery system will build individual and community capacit y by increasing health knowledge and self -sufficiency through a variety of activities that include outreach, community education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy. Thus , we will create a new workforce of Community Health Workers to serve a s a conduit to our partners to bring services to those most vulnerable. TRH will be partnering with Centene to providing initial and ongoing training for the Community Health Workers . These CHW s will be organized into teams targeting specific health outcomes to enable workers to fully immerse themselves in the most effective ways to support those suffering from specific diseases. CHWs will actively participate in local health -related functions for community engagement and maintain a working knowledge of services available in the area and how they are best accessed. The Community Health Workers serving this community will work clos ely with staff from the new Community Health Hub, the center of this Transformation project's health education, outreach and Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 18 social serv ices support space. Community Health Workers will also be embedded into the operations across our partnerships to assist in integration with care teams at these agencies and into the community where they can provide health education and outreach. CHWs will work to remove the social barriers to care faced by many low -income African -American patients, affect behavioral changes, and prevent unnecessary Emergency Depar tment and hospitals visits. CHW s will also assist in our healthy food initiatives in the commu nity. QUALITY METRICS The HFS Quality Strategy framework prioritizes equity a cross all program goals for transformation efforts. The framework includes 5 pillars of improvement: Maternal and Child Health, Adult Behavioral Health, Child Behavioral Health, Equity, and Improving Community Placement. The Department identified 12 goals that fall within 3 categories: Better Care, Healthy People/Healthy Communities, and Affordable Care as particularly relevant to the health of distressed communities . Each of thes e goals is addressed through our Transformation as described below: Better Care 1. Improve population health . The Community Health Worker deployme nt will drive improvement s in health outcomes through increased Care Coordination with greater patient engageme nt that supports linkages to services and guidance for patient activities beyond direct health services. 2. Improve access to care . The partnerships and service locations in this Transformation will improve access to previously unmet care needs for specialt y services and transform access with expanded hours and walk -in services for primary and urgent care needs. Additionally, the new Health Care Campus will bring improved ambulatory, inpatient and social services to our underserved community to provide more accessible and cost effective services. 3. Increase effectiveness of care coordination . The Community Health Worker program will increase coordination of care with patients being individually tracked and supported throughout the continuum of care. The Community Health W orkers deployment in coordination with community partners will become a collaborative effort to guide individuals to more effective utilization of services. Healthy People/Healthy Communities 4. Improve participation in preventive care and screenings . Community Health Workers will improve patient engagement, new outpatient access, remote monitoring, and direct outreach. This will adva nce our screening outcomes for breast and c ervical cancer that will be tracked and monito red with sp ecific goals for performance improvement . 5. Promote integration of behavioral and physical healthcare . Our outpatient partner , SIHF , has been integrating behavioral health into primary care locations fo r the last 12 years with 30 individual site locations now integrated. Advancing this integration of behavioral health services Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 19 with local partners in law enforcement, corrections, and judicial is a gap we will address through a new diversion program on the former Touchette Campus. This transformation will provide a new entry source for individuals to receive care for both mental and physical health. Partnerships with Comprehensive Behavioral Health Center, SIHF, Life Links, and local hospital partners will guide patients into necessary behavioral heal th and substance use disorder services within our collaborative. These services will be tracked through a shared data approach among participating partners. 6. Create consumer -centric healthcare delivery system . Each unique transformation action is a direct r esponse to consumer needs and demand for improved health status. Housing, specialty care, supportive housing, judicial reform, urgent access, food services, transportation, and community health workers are services that make our community and residents the center of health. 7. Identify and prioritize to reduce health disparities . Specific data measures will be linked and tracked to align with community -based needs assessments. T hese priorities shall guide program implementation, growth and success. 8. Implement e vidence -based interventions to reduce disparities . The affordable and supportive housing, community health worker program, improved access to specialists, and workforce development all have evidence based research linked to improved health outcomes. The collaborative is dedicated to providing evidence based care and implementing best practices throughout service delivery. 9. Invest in the development and use of health equity performance measures . All measures shall be tracked in terms of patient demographics a nd health status to allow for an equity -based analysis of program impact on outcome results. 10. Incentivize the reeducation of health disparities and achievement of health equity . The entire Transformation is based around ensuring patients can receive the soc ial and health care services that are needed through entities working together to improve health outcomes. This includes the sharing of program funds and resources to increase the ability of program partners to deliver needed services. Affordable Care 11. Transition to value and outcome based payment . As part of the program's sustainability plan, TRH and SIHF will continue efforts with our MCO partners to migrate to value -based payments as a shared program to advance patient outcomes. This target for the Colla borative shall advance the purpose of health care providers, social service agencies, and community leaders to promote healthier outcomes of our community as the basis to determine effectiveness within this community through APM models. 12. Deploy technology i nitiatives and provide incentives to increase adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and streamline and enhance performance reporting, eligibility and enrollment procedures, pharmacy management, and data integration . Presently all medical and behavio ral providers utilize EHR for tracking patient progress. The collaboration will seek ways to share Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 20 this data effectively to ensure a cohesive system of care where patient records are available to multiple providers as necessary for the provision of quality care without duplication of services. Data collected for our transformation matches several identified \"pillars\" of the Department's Quality Strategy. Our actions fit into the Department's desire to collect and monitor this data on a continual basis for measures that include the following: Pillar Specific Measure Adult Behavioral Health 7-Day Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness Child Behavioral Health 7-Day Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness Equity Equity Equity Breast Cancer Screening Rates Cervical Cancer Screening Rates Controlled Hypertension Rate Improving Community Placement Adults' Access to Preventive/Ambulatory Health Services (AAP) Maternal and Child Health Time of Entry to Prenatal Care As shown in the chart above, all five of the department's \"pillars\" are measured to ensure continuous improvement in community health. Each data point evaluated will be measured every three years and new baselines and goals will be set. Each of these pilla rs is central to the provision of health services in the community. CARE INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION Care Integration and Coordination is a significant foc us of this Transformation's development of a Community Health Hub . Within the community there are h ealthcare service providers, community resource providers, housing agencies, food banks, etc. However, there is no successful process to ensure that available r esources get to individuals who need them. This Transformation will establish a Community Health Hub to provide linkage between partners and resources that exist to the individual s who need them. This operation would establish a fully integrated, collaborative network of providers throu ghout the East St. Louis Metro Area to help coordinate access to services. Leadership and staff from the Community Health Hub will develop relationships with service providers throughout the area, contract with social service organizations and establish ca re plans to meet specific service needs. When a Community Health Worker identifies the needs of an individual, they will then engage the Community Health Hub to coordinate services and engage partner organizations. A team of Community Health Workers will be hired to launch the program with this first cohort of workers embedded in SIHF, TRH, and targeted community partners as a means to integrate care teams for better access to needed services. Additionally, these staff members will perform outreach in the community by attending local health fairs and community gatherings in order to identify those who could benefit from their services. Par ticipating community partners are expected to grow as the program develops the model of integration with key partne rs over the initial year of the project. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 21 Community Health Hub models are financially accountable and based on confirmed risk mitigation. The Community Health Hub model is built on the Social Determinants o f Health/Systems Theory and Social Support Theory. The model relies on understanding the pathways that address steps to help overcome issues that prevent individuals from accessing health care, housing, food, employment, education, and other critical support directly impacts health outcomes. The Hub model recognizes that modifiable risk factors within medical care, social services, and behavioral health are interlinking and interdependent in their impact and a more holistic approach to addressing risk is needed to improve outcomes (U.S. Department of Healt h and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2019). For example, a n expectant mother who is homeless , depressed, and lacks prenatal care may have significantly better outcomes , including reduced stress, if all three of these cr itical risks are identified and addressed compared to approaches that may only address one or two of these factors. CHWs establish the community engagement necessary to build trusting relationships with community members served. High risk individuals benef it from the evidence based approach to identifying and addressing their risks in a holistic community and person centered approach. The member s of Healthier Together bring a wealth of social support services that will be integrated with existing health car e providers through this new Hub. Healthier Together 's significant hea lth and supportive resources are already engaged in support ing a community -based movement to transform the East St. Louis Metro Area into the top 25% of healthiest counties in Illinois b y 2025. This partnership will create opportunities so all residents can experience a safer, healthier quality of life. Currently, pathways will be focused on six specific areas: Chronic Disease Prevention, Community Safety, Education, Maternal and Child He alth, Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder. Each of these areas requires advanced int erventions to address overall community transformation and so they each align with the overall goals of this project. Further, the vast number of organizations brought together in an effort to unite and bring about change encompasses a broad range of services from healthcare to education to job support, financial support for the economically vulnerable, legal services for low - income individuals, and many more. In additi on to direct service providers, significant representation from local business leaders have all pledged their support to the Healthier Together mission to create a healthier metro east region and to create opportunities for all citizens of the metro east a rea to achieve their best possible health. A full list of Healthie r Together members is included as an Attachment to this application. ACCESS TO CARE Over 50% of primary care referrals from SIH F Healthcare providers for specialty consults are unmet due to the current lack of providers, denials due to p ayor source, and providers no longer accepting Medicaid MCO's. These conditions lead to a severe lack of access to care in our community that directly impacts all health measures and outcomes. Our very own clinicians express their concern for our patients' acute needs in distressed communities and for the legal threat to their license due to the risk for law suits. The Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 22 delayed appointments, procedures used, repeated resch eduling, and termination of coverage conflicts with the very prin ciple of value based care. C hallenges in acquiring referrals create greater strains on our clinicians and staff that diligently pursue the right path of care for our patients. Access, equity , and value are issues that our Tra nsformation plans to overcome in order to ensure that members of the East S. Louis Metro Area receive the level of services they need and deserve. The long standing environment in the East St. Louis Metro Area for those o n Medicaid and uninsured is one of grave concern in the trust and respect of the health care providers. This lack of trust furthe r interferes with the population 's commitment to their health and belief in health care being there f or everyone. Currently, th ere are limited specialty services offered in the immediate service area for Medicaid and uninsured patients , including a small number of specialty services offered through Touchette Regional Hospital. TRH offering s are limited due to physical space limita tions and a lack of interest from regional specialists to care for this population due to payment levels, MCO challenges, and medical malpractice concerns. TRH has been partially successful in providing specialty care for Pulmonology, ENT, Orthopedics, Car diology, and Nephrology. Other specialty services are extremely difficult or not available for access to our community for reasons previously stated. Currently, TRH has identified nearly 36,000 unmet referrals throughout this community due to a lack of spe cialty care in the community with the largest categories of unmet need being in Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics, Urology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology, Otolaryngology, and situation, TRH and SIHF have planned partne rships with Me morial Medical Group, ConferMed, Centene, Washington University, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, and SLUCare to provide specialty care in the community in a more accessible ambulatory care center through our transformation pl an. The new Ambulatory Care Center would embed partnerships with multi -specialty groups to address regional unmet needs for Medicaid and uninsured patient s through face-to-face visits, telemedicine, peer -to-peer consultations, expanded dental access, and o utpatient surgery. The integration of these services within TRH and SIHF will have truly dramatic changes to access and health status and outcomes for our community by removing physical and financial barriers for individuals on Medicaid and those that are uninsured. For those who qualify for Medicaid or health insurance subsidies through the federal health exchange, SIHF will assign patients to one of their current Healthcare Navigators specializing in health insurance signup and how to operate the healthc are marketplace website. This team has signed up 21,737 individuals for Medicaid or Health Insurances since it was established through the Affordable Care Act in 2010 with implementation of the Federal Exchange Healthcare in 2013. Specialty care w ill be fu rther enhanced through collaboration with ConferMed to provide peer -to-peer e - consults for SIHF providers in the service area. While many patients require a visit to a specialist for a formal diagnosis or for more advanced conditions that are beyond the co mfort level of primary care physicians, many conditions are able to be maintained through regular primary care visits with the additional peer support provided through e -consults. Throu gh the e -consultation program, s pecialist physicians are able to consul t directly with primary care physicians to provide guidance and details of Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 23 treating specific conditions to increase the comfort of primary care providers providing this care and lessening the difficulty for patients navigating the health system and trying to schedule regular appointments with multiple providers. According to an article published in the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare vol. 21, \"E -consults are feasible in a variety of settings, flexible in their application, and facilitate timely special ty advice.\" The establishment of a n Urgent Care Center in midtown East St. Louis will feature walk -in access for primary care and acute services, something local residents time and again have stated is their preferred method of service delivery. The diffic ulties low -income individuals have scheduling services in advance and getting time off during regular business hours has long been a barrier to care for this community. Establishing a walk in center with expanded service hours will allow patients to access services when they are able, rather than hoping patients can navigate barriers on their own and make and complete all medical appointments they need. In addition to the Urgent Care Center, the deployment of Community Health Workers will directly address a ccess to care barriers to preventive and primary care. Community Health Workers will serve as a liaison, link, and intermediary between health and social services and the community to improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. CHWs wi ll link patients to transportation services supported by the TRH transportation department that already offers over 10,000 rides per year to local residents seeking medical care, helping to address transportation barriers to care. They will also link patie nts to a host of supportive services to remove barriers to care through partnership with Healthier Together. Linking services in this manner takes the often long and difficult process of identifying and contacting multiple service providers out of the patient's hands and into the hands of a qualified individual with a wide breadth of knowledge of what services are available and how to access these services. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH It is estimated that up to 50% of an individual's health outcomes are the result not of the quality of the direct medical care they receive but by their living conditions, often referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The CDC indicates that the SDOH can be allocated into five general categories: Economic Stability, Education Access and Quality, Healthcare Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. For the people of East St. Louis, negative social situations strongly affect each of these categories. Economic Stability In the East St. Louis Metro Area, economic stability is hard to find. Centreville, where TRH currently sits, has been named the poorest town in America with a median household income of $17,441. Recent sales of single -family homes throughout the Metro East St. Louis Area have been limited, though none have exceeded $50,000. Sale prices ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 are much more common and vacant or abandoned homes are visible throughout the community. This area is located on a Mississippi Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 24 River floodplain known as American Bottoms that experiences chronic flooding and raw sewage disposal problems due to the area's inadequate system of drainage ditches, levees and emergency pumps. Education Access and Quality Educational outcomes in the targeted area are far below both state and national averages. There are more individuals in t he area who have not completed high s chool (18%) than have completed a college degree (12%). Truancy rates in the area are beyond 40% in some districts. Healthcare Access and Quality Healthcare access in the community has limitations due to a lack of some services, delivery methods that are often a poor fit for the specific needs of this patient population, and actions that deny access due to payor sources. Specialty care i n particular is difficult and almost impossible to access in the community, especially for patients on Medicaid or who are uninsured. There is currently a backup of nearly 36,000 unmet specialty care referrals in the local community. There is also no integ rated Urgent Care center that can create alternative acute access in the g reater East St. Louis area , result ing in frequent and over utilization of emergency rooms. Neighborhood and Built Environment According to a s tudy published in the Environmental Health News by Crystal Gammon, \"Housing in the city ranges from, at best, small homes that often house multiple families to crowded, low -income apartment complexes. Some people live in burned -out buildings and tents. There are few grocery stores, so reside nts buy most of their food at convenience marts. A quart of milk costs around $6 and a bottle of children's Tylenol is $15 at one such store, according to nurses at a local clinic run by Community Nursing Services of Southern Illinois University -Edwardsvil le. Raw sewage backs up into homes, businesses and schools whenever the volume overwhelms the city's decaying 150 -year-old pipes. Garbage collection, which halted completely from 1987 to 1992, now is only available to households that pay out -of-pocket for the service. Most trash is burned in back yards, adding to the polluted air, or dumped in vacant lots.\" These poor housing conditions combined with awful road conditions, sewer lines that regularly back up, packs of stray dogs roaming the streets, and high crime rates making the living environment a severe detriment to the health and wellbeing of residents Social and Community Context People's relationships and interactions with family, friends, co -workers, and community members can have a major impact on t heir health and well -being. Overall community safety negatively affects relationships between individuals in the community. Those who interact with the legal system are often removed from family situations, leaving children and families without important s ocial connections. As Senator Belt stated in a press conference in 2020, our families are exposed to \"persistent traumatic stress\". Using recent FBI data and crime reports, East St. Louis was ranked as the most dangerous city in the United States of Americ a. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 25 The following chart details current data points demonstrating the area's negative SDOH that continue to affect health outcomes: Social Determinant of Health Characteristic Finding Geographic Area Data Source Economic Stability Population classified as low- income or living in poverty 33.9% in poverty 60.7% low -income East St. Louis and surrounding communities (62201 - 62207, 62060, 62090) ACS 2019 Economic Stability Food insecurity 12.2% of total population experienced food insecurity 67% of total population eligible for SNAP benefits (<165% poverty) St. Clair County, Illinois Feeding America Education Access and Quality Level of educational attainment Did not complete High School - 18% Completed a college degree - 12% East St. Louis and surrounding communities (62201 - 62207, 62060, 62090) ACS 2019 Healthcare Access and Quality Percentage of population who experienced access issues due to financial problems 15.19% Delayed/did not seek treatment due to cost 18.89% Adults with no usual sourc e of medical care 7% uninsured East St. Louis and surrounding communities (62201 - 62207, 62060, 62090) UDS Mapper Neighborhood and Built Environment Percentage of population that pays more than 30% of monthly income for housing costs 41.2% East St. Louis and surrounding communities (62201 - 62207, 62060, 62090) ACS 2019 Social and Community Context Percentage of 8th and 10th grade students who: Feel safe at school Do not have an adult they feel they can talk to/confide in 39% 23% St. Clair County, Illinois Illinois Youth Survey 2020 Transformation partners will continually monitor all of these data elements throughout the life of the Transformation. Many of these goals are long term issues that developed over a number of decades to reach critical levels. New baselines will be attained and monitored as the project progresses and community improvement becomes apparent. Specific inequities that are directly addressed by projects within this proposal include: Lack of jobs and training opportunities, including geographically accessible, affordable education and job training; Extreme disparities in the number of individuals who are involved in the criminal justice system, including high rates of incarceration for those with behavioral health problems; Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 26 Lack of supportive housing for those with health issues and transitional housing for those transitioning from homelessness or incarcerations trying to re -enter the community; Lack of connection to supportive social services in the community and overall lack of coordination in these services; Lack of safe and affordable homes that provide opportunities for fitness and safe social engagements; and Lack of services accessible to those who are best served in a language other than English. Within the service area , this represents approx. 4% of the population and the vast majority of these individuals speak Spanish. These issues are addressed through the following projects: New Workforce Development Center The Leadership Council of Madison County in partnership with Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville (SIUe), Southwestern Illinois College (SWIC), Madison County Community Development, and SIHF Healthcare will initiate a community revitalization plan featuring a Workforce Development Center to increase job t raining and educational opportunities. The program will be primarily focused on Workforce Development for trades, but will also feature extensive health and supportive services for students and their families. This includes a comprehensive health care faci lity located within the campus where students and their families can receive primary care services directly and access to specialty through direct care and telemedicine. This health facility will address disparities of health that extend direct services by incorporating advanced care coordination and management that improves health and reduce the negative impacts of social determinants. Additional activities enhancing the community will involve extensive business and housing development supported through pr ivate ownership. Private ownership will build a full services grocery store consisting of high quality discount groceries, emphasizing cut -in-store meat, fresh produce, assortment of high -quality food and household needs as well as 65 affordable homes with two/three bedrooms and garage. Infrastructure upgrades to sewer and streets will be needed to support construction. In order to support the revitalization development along Broadway where proposed development is planned, repairs are necessary to the adjac ent roads and sewer to provide access to the new development and parking, providing safer infrastructure for proposed housing in the neighborhood to the south of the development. Venice will serve as the anchor of this project. It was selected because of i ts location in an Enterprise Zone, Opportunity Zone, and within a TIF district that serves as the main thoroughfare leading into Madison, Brooklyn, Granite City and downtown St Louis, Missouri. It is less than one minute from Route 3, and six minutes from downtown St Louis with approximately 15,000 motorists traveling this route daily. This comprehensive stimulus is aimed at scaling services and benefits to the 6,400 citizens of Venice, Brooklyn and Madison. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 27 Repurposing of Current TRH Facility The current campus of TRH will be repurposed to address individuals impacted by serious mental illness, homelessness, and substance abuse that may result in behaviors that traditionally directed interventions to be addressed through law enforcement. The repurposing o f the former hospital will include: 1) a partnership with the St. Clair County Sheriff and local police departments for a diversion program to care for individuals with homelessness, mental health illness, and substance abuse that avoids direct incarcerati on of these individuals for minor offenses; 2) the implementation of a \"living room\" Crisis Stabilization Unit that provides an alternative delivery model for those with an acute mental health situation versus emergency room utilization; 3) the transition of former hospital space into supportive housing that creates a continuum of care for those being discharged from the diversion program, the hospitals inpatient behavioral health unit, and others that can be redirected prior to a mental health or legal eve nt occurring; and 4) the transition of additional hospital space to provide workforce development, life skill s training, behavior health counseling, high school equivalency programming, and guidance towards steps in acquiring permanent external housing. This collective effort shall assist in reversing the use of correctional facilities for holding those with mental illness in prisons and lower crime through an improved continuum of care to ensure these individuals receive the care they need to turn their l ives around. The Department of Justice most recently reported that 51 percent of people in prison and 71 percent of people in jail have or have had a mental health problem (Bronson and Berzofsky 2017). Moreover, 58 percent of people serving state prison sentences and 63 percent of people serving jail sentences met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse (Bronson et al. 2017). This correlates with the St. Clair County Jail that estimates housing 680 inmates results in 482 with mental illness and 428 impact ed by substance abuse . Spanish Language Service Outreach Language barriers are a serious impediment to Health Equity. If you cannot communicate with the health system, access services can be difficult and often impossible. This Transformation project will emphasize the importance of hiring and utilizing Spanish -speaking staff and will translate all program materials into Spanish. SIHF al ready operates a fully Spanish -speaking health center in Fairmont City, the home of the largest Spanish -speaking populatio n in the area, and both TRH and SIHF have bilingual staff at multiple site locations. This project will work to ensure these services are expanded and that it becomes a priority in the local care system to search for and hire bilingual staff. A new conveni ent and comprehensive Health Campus that addresses our community needs in the East St. Louis Metro Area Not only will the opening of a new Health Campus improve Health Equity and Access, but the Campus will feature additional programming to address the Soc ial Determinants of Health. The Crisis Stabilization Unit will link directly to the Diversion Program, a jointly operated program to ensure individuals receive mental health care instead of a jail cell as appropriate. This program seeks to prevent the nega tive outcomes for families when individuals are incarcerated. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 28 Community rooms and food resources will be developed through partnerships with local food and nutrition outreach efforts. Touchette Regional Hospital will partner with Sweet Potato Patch to add ress racial disparities in maternal child health and chronic disease by reducing food insecurity and increasing healthy eating. Community health workers and Sweet Potato Patch staff will provide meal kits and prepared meals to low income pregnant women and individuals with chronic disease who are food insecure and need nutritional support. Sweet Potato Patch is a Chicago -based food business whose mission is to increase healthy food access and provide farm -to-table healthy meals to residents in food deserts. TRH and SIHF both already partner with Sweet Potato Patch to provide healthy meals to African American pregnant women in St. Clair and Madison Counties through f unding from Centene Corporation. This program currently serves a pproximately 50 pregnant women each month.

From the race riots in 1917 to the systematic disinvestment as many industrial facilities in the area split off from the East St. Louis region in the 50s to white flight in the 60s, East St. Louis has suffered from a series of racially motivated incidents of disinvestment and neglect, creating a racially inequitable situation where neighboring majority white communities thrive as East St. Louis continues to suffer. The City of East St. Louis is made up of 94.2% African -American re sidents with only 1.9% of the community white. Thus, the disparities that plague East St. Louis cannot be separated from the disparities that affect African - Americans in the area. The University of Illinois Chicago report provided by HFS identified the Ea st St. Louis Metro Area as the area with the highest score on the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) of the 5 distressed areas in the State they studied. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 census variables to measure community need. The East St . Louis Metro Area has an SVI score of 93.6. It should come as no surprise that a community of over 90% African -Americans has attained this dubious distinction. Every activity within this Transformation project will directly impact racial equity by leadin g a large scale re -investment in the community, locating significant resources and services within the East St. Louis Metro Area, ensuring the cultural competency of all services, and hiring staff directly from the targeted communities in order to raise th e economic hopes of our community. Details on how each component will address racial equity follows: New Health Care Campus Many surrounding majority white communities have multiple state -of-the-art hospital facilities available, all targeting more affluent neighborhoods with two of these new facilities opening in the last 5 years. Meanwhile, African -American residents of the East St. Louis Metro Area continue to visit a 60 year old, regional community safety -net hospital. Construction of a new facil ity to allow the African - American population in this community access to the same level of care as in surrounding communities would improve racial equity significantly by bringing the same quality health care to our community. This project will ensure that once operational the health campus will focus specifically on hiring staff from the local community in order to ensure the cultural competence of day -to-day activities. This will not only improve the cultural competence of services, but will also provide additional jobs and economic growth in our community. Urgent Care Center Urgent Care Centers have emerged as a major part of the healthcare landscape in many communities, allowing more convenient access to services and ensuring the availability of acute ca re services. While many urgent care clinics are located in urban settings, they tend to sit in more well -off areas and gentrified neighborhoods. As such, patients of lower socioeconomic status (many of whom are underrepresented minorities) may have signifi cantly more difficulty accessing urgent care centers than more wealthy residents. \"Additionally, many urgent care clinics have insurance and/or upfront payment Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 39 requirements that must be met before patients can be seen by a provider. Many would -be patients of lower socioeconomic status do not meet these requirements and are therefore unable to receive care.\" (The Challenge of Inequity in Urgent Care Medicine: A Call to Action, from the Journal of Urgent Care Medicine by Lindsey E. Fish, MD .) Additionally, pa tients who preferentially seek care in urban urgent care settings tend to be at relatively high risk for having unmet preventive medical needs. Underrepresented minority patients experience greater difficulties in accessing primary care for a multitude of reasons, which increases the need for care in sites such as Emergency departments of Urgent Care units. For this reason, the Urgent Care Center for East St. Louis will include an integrated walk -in primary care clinic and access to Community Health Workers to address health issues beyond acute needs that bring patients to the Urgent Care Center. This is a service delivery method specifically sought by our community leaders. Workforce Development and Training Center The economic devastation in the East St. L ouis Metro Area is obvious and a significant investment is needed for education and job training to start to uplift local residents. African -Americans in Illinois face significant disparities in employment. The most recent unemployment rates available from the Bureau of Labor Statistic by race (2020Q3) showed that the unemployment rate for African -Americans in Illinois is 15.7% as opposed to 9.2% for whites. This education and job train ing center will ensure access for the African -American community and those who struggle to attend by featuring a host of supportive services on -site to remove barriers to participation faced by many in our communities. The program will be primarily focused on Workforce Development, but wi ll also feature extensive health and supportive services for students and their families, including a comprehensive health care facility located within the campus where students, their families, and community members can receive primary care services direc tly and access to specialty through direct care and telemedicine. This health facility will address disparities of health by directly extending services through care coordination and management with Community Health Workers that improve connectivity with n eeded health and social support services that can reduce the negative impacts of social determinants. Diversion Center and Supportive Housing African -Americans make up 49% of the jailed population in Illinois while comprising only 15% of the overall popula tion. The need for a behavioral health diversion center was specifically designed to address racial inequities in the legal system where African -Americans, especially African -American males, are more likely to be arrested than whites for similar offenses. In a 2018 \"Report to the United Nations on Racial Disparities in the U.S. Criminal Justice System, The Sentencing Project found that \"African -American adults are 5.9 times as likely to be incarcerated than whites.\" Further, as of 2001, one of every three b lack boys born in that year could expect to go to prison in his lifetime.\" According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the most recent data available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that more than one quarter of people in jail met the threshold for serious psychological distress and nearly half had been told by a mental health professional that they have a mental illness. What's troubling is that even though people of color are more likely to be involved in the Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 40 criminal justice system, there is evidence that they are less likely to be identified as having a mental health problem. Also, they are less likely to receive access to treatment once incarcerated. A Diversion Center to keep those with Mental Illness out of prison and into appropriate treatment is a critical transformation requirement. Accord ing to an AMA Journal article, a 2010 review of diversion programs found that those who were diverted from formal court processing \"had lower rates of recidivism (return to the justice system) than youth who were formally processed. The same study also found that diverting youth to treatment further reduced offending (including offenses that do not reach the justice system).\" This new Diversion structure will be a vital partnership with the local health systems, law enforcement, and judicial systems to lessen incarceration for those impacted by mental health and substance abuse. Community Housing Project As is the case in many areas with higher proportions of African -American residents, h ousing stock in the community remains poor and many individuals live in housing that is substandard in every respect. This project seeks to undue the decades of warehousing low -income African -Americans in large housing complexes that inevitably succumb to neglect over time and become eye sores with significant deficiencies in basic safety. The partnership between SIHF and the St. Clair County Housing Authority to improve public housing by decentralizing and constructing a series of new homes to relocate up to 1,100 families will directly seek to refocus public housing from warehousing of people to constructing safe and inviting family homes. Steps to engage the Illinois Housing Development Authority has already commenced with technical assistance to design r egional Community Revitalization Plans scheduled to get underway August 2021 with key stakeholders. SIHF has previously completed multiple collaborative housing developments, including senior housing facilities in both Centreville and in Chicago. The most recent housing development spearheaded by SIHF is the Cottages at Cathedral Square, a newly constructed complex that provides affordable rental housing with supportive services for seniors in the Belleville, Illinois area. The development consists of 32 a ffordable apartments, half of which are one - bedroom garden -style and the remaining are two -bedroom units. This development has been so successful there is a current waiting list of over 100 individuals for this housing. Amenities at most current properties in the community are limited, and do not accurately reflect the demands for the current market, particularly for targeted housing. Key amenities for the new housing under development include many amenities people in other communities take for granted as well as additional supportive services tailored to improve the health and well -being of residents. These amnesties include the following: Utilitie s (at minimum, water, sewer, and trash services) will be included with rent; Appliances, kitchens will be outf itted with an electric oven/range and refrigerator; Community Room and Outdoor Common Areas, a common area for residents to congregate with ample seating and tables will be provided; a Fitness Room will be provided; Media/Computer Room will be provided; On -Site Laundry will be provided along with linkages to community park improvements, when available. Community Health Workers will maintain a presence in the newly built complexes to ensure healthcare access, health screening, vaccinations and other regular care needs for the residents as necessary. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 41 Community Health Hub A regional Community Health Hub will be designed with partners across the transformation area to address racial equity problems and connect residents to services available directly in the com munity. This new Health HUB will create connections for residents seeking health and social services taken for granted in many communities, but in this service area would be a big step toward providing increased racial equity. This Health HUB seeks to full y integrate a collaborative network of providers throughout St. Clair County to provide the 'Clinical -Community Linkage\" needed to improve health outcomes. The Community Health Hub will be focused on the coordination and linkages to health and community resources through Community Health Workers to provide assistance and care coordination services in a hub and spoke model. In this model, the CHW's will assess client needs, source community linkages, coordinating clinical care and ultimately ensure the need ed service was actualized for the client. The Community Health Hub partnership will encourage further collaboration with providers to improve the overall health of the county. Community Health Workers According to the NIH Community Engagement Alliance, C ommunity Health Workers (CHWs) are ideally positioned to identify issues and barriers to health care access that diverse racial and ethnic groups face. They are critical frontline public health workers who are trusted members of the community served. A CHW serves as a liaison between health and social services and the community to facilitate access to services and to improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. Hiring Community Health workers from the communities can address racial equit y by improving health access for African -American s. We also uplift our community by providing direct employment opportunities in these positions. These additional jobs can provide economic advancement for families that previously struggled to acquire employment. MINORITY PARTICIPATION TRH, the lead agency for this application, is majority controlled and managed by minorities through five African -American members on the nine -person Board of Directors. TRH Hospital is a legally controlled entity by SIHF Healthcare that is also governed by a minority controlled community board who also are a majority of SIHF patients. This enables SIHF to provide continual input from patients throughout the community in order to guide program activities and adjust to pati ent needs as they evolve. Additional minority participation is gathered through the many service agencies that are collaborating on the various transformation initiatives. Many of these organizations, including many members of Healthier Together, are owne d and operated by minorities or provide services to minority members of this community. These and other local providers and business leaders will play key roles in this Transformation and will link services with Community Health Workers to ensure access to their services in the community. These organizations include: Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 42 Owned/Operated by Minorities: Comprehensive Behavioral Health Center - A local community health center that will be a critical partner in our diversion and supportive housing programming withi n the transformation. CBHC is overseen by a majority controlled African -American board of directors. No Father Left Behind - This is a new minority owned enti ty focused on assisting African - American fathers transition from corrections back into family and social life. Mr. Shaquille Armstrong is the founder of this new Corporation. SIHF leadership is assisting to mentor him through the legal paperwork for his 501c3, bylaws, and policies. This organization will be embedded into our diversion program and partn ership with the St. Clair County Sheriff. We plan to provide a mentoring and developing road to assist him in st abilizing and moving forth his corporation as a key participant in our collaborative using community health workers and therapists. Make Health Happen - A community partnership working to promote healthy eating while increasing access to healthy food options in East St. Louis. Racial Harmony - a not -for-profit 501(C) (3) community organization dedicated to making a difference through mediation, te aching, training, and cooperative learning. The House of Prayer Christian Academy (HOPCA) Family & Community Center (FaCCs) - An incubator of family support; community services; business development; career enhancements; and job creation. This partnership will be supportive of our community health workers and job training. The Mount Calvary Church - a registered member of the internationally recognized Church of God In Christ, Inc. - A Lutheran Church that serves Washington Park and surrounding communities will help support with community outreach to committee health workers. Sav-A-Lot IRE - one of the few black grocery store owners in the country; health/ fresh food; education; cooking classes. They will be partnering with the project to support food acces s and nutrition classes. The Sweet Potato Patch - Owned by Stacey Minor, the sweet potato patch has been working with SIHF to provide Healthy Meals, Fresh Fruits and Vegetables, Cooking Classes to African - American pregnant women. We plan to extend this se rvice to help us assist with individuals with diabetes and hypertension. The Grind Fitness and Performance - Over 10 years of experience training student and adults. They specialize in toning, weight loss, nutrition, muscle mass, speed, agility, condition ing, and academics. The Grind w ill become a referral source to assist our participants/patients to have access to a health and fitness center. Zade, LLC . is a local construction and housing developer that would be embedded into our community and supportive housing programming as a developer and owner. Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (MHDC) is a primary partner in our housing development and is operated by Richard Gonzales. Clayborne and Associates will be utilized for necessary legal services related to our tax credits, contracting, housing options, and other relevant legal activities. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 43 Serve primarily minority participants in the East St. Louis Metro Area: Puentes de Esperanza (Bridges of Hope) is a trusted resource for Southern Illin ois' Spanish - speaking residents living in Madison and St. Clair Counties. They provide services that address the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of the local Hispanic community. This organization will be embedded into our community health and worker programming. In addition to extensive participation for racial minority businesses, female owned businesses are also extensively involved in this Transformation, including: Hesed Comprehensive Psychological and Assessment Services provides neuropsychological assessment services for learning difficulties, attention problems, memory concerns, autism spectrum disorders, and dementia/Alzheimer's disease, and w ill be embedded insi de of our community health hub and as a referral source. Barbo Design is an independent marketing and communications firm that will be used for local community promotions relates to the new transformation and services. The Blue Wall Institute offers consu lting, needs assessment services, and training to law enforcement. We have approached this organization about being a participant with our diversion program and supportive housing efforts. Fister, Inc. is a Graphic design agency that will be partnered with to assist in new designs to support the new campus. Moonlight Computing LLC offers website design, development and hosting services in addition to providing technology solutions for small businesses. Partnership efforts will include participation and voca tional training at the new supportive housing locations. Construction activities will focus on utilizing contractors from the Illinois Business Enterprise Program listing of certified minority owned businesses. Unfortunately, in the entirety of St. Clair and Madison counties, there are only 16 BEP certified minority owned businesses with many focused on the same lines of business. Contractors for all capital projects will focus efforts on procuring BEP certified minority businesses when possible and focus on firms that employ minorities extensively where it is not possible to directly contract with an MBE. JOBS Most of the transformational area in the East St. Louis Metro region presents a picture of a community with few jobs or resources and a population struggling to survive. Reflective of the African -American segment of the overall population, over 33% of East St. Louis lives in poverty and 76% of the population meets the federal standard for low -income (200% of poverty and below). Of those under 18, 45% of children in East St. Louis live in poverty and 84% of families led by single mothers live in poverty. The unemployment rate currently sits at 10% and the median household income is only Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 44 $19,520. Educational attainment is low with only 12% of the popul ation having a college degree, fewer than the 17% who have not finished high school. (US Census ACS 2019) Unemployment in St. Clair County as a whole is 7.6% in line with 7.8% throughout Illinois but higher than the national rate of 6.3%. In East St. Louis itself, this rate is dramatically higher at 11.9%. Thus, creating jobs and opportunity is a focus of this Transformation. Within this region, Touchette Regional Hospital and SIHF Healthcare represents two of the largest employers in St. Clair County and a re the top two employers in Centreville. In fact, Centreville is currently home to the census tract with one of the highest job growths in the County according to the Opportunity Atlas ( https://opportunityatlas .org/). Jobs in the 1716350250 Census Tract have grown at a rate of 24% over the most recently measured 5 year period. This job growth has been largely due to continual expansion of services at TRH and the SIHF Healthcare Centreville Health center that sits nex t door. TRH currently employs 457 individuals, including 288 African -Americans making up over 63% of the TRH workforce. SIHF employs 556 individuals with 185 African -American employees. This represents 33% of staff. However, SIHF's overall service area inc ludes many rural areas where most residents are white. The proportion of African -American employees correlates with the 33% percent of patients they serve that are African -American. SIHF also employees 11 Hispanic workers, most of whom are bilingual with m any working at the Fairmont City Health Center where all services are offered in Spanish for a community with the largest Spanish -speaking population in the area. The focus on employment of local staff will be a pillar of the contractual intent for all col laborating partners. Comprehensive Behavioral Health Center has already committed through this proposal to add on an additional 11 staff here in the local community. Furthermore, the work to deploy community health workers across the region will allow us a pillar of job growth from the community to be used to ultimately employ 50 new Community Health Workers by the end of year 5 that can help us elevate the economic and social health of our residents. Each of the transformational areas bring forth substantial opportunities for regional job growth. The housing developments alone in our local community should bring hundreds of new well -paying positions that if coordinated to the local training programs could assist in helping those that have lived in poverty to migrate to a sustainable career in the trades. Couple the housing with our diversion program and supportive training and develop ment will also be an asset to help facilitate those individuals impacted by social determinants with prior life experiences to place individuals on a pathway for job opportunities here in the local community. This opportunity coupled with supportive housin g is a blended initiative that will allow individuals to structure their finances and lifestyle with the intent of transitioning into the community through a sustainable supportive system. Our workforce development and job training facility to be developed in neighboring Venice is part of our strategy of community revitalization aiming to spur economic growth and jobs in the area. With the focus on trades, this training facility shall become a critical employment feeder into the housing transformation and other local employers that presently struggle to find competent and reliable employees in the trades. Each of our transformational efforts for housing, increased healthcare services, the new health care campus, the community health hub, and the community health workers are all Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 45 critical cornerstones to advancing employment opportunities and addressing social determinants of care. Secondarily, an array of partnerships will also see new commerci al developments such as the grocery, barbershop and beauty salons that are now embedded into the plan for the new Venice redevelopment. This job development is coupled with the new construction activity that will create new construction, healthcare, commer cial, and social service jobs throughout the region. 1. Southwestern Illinois College (SWIC) implementation of the Venice Regional Workforce Training Facility will be a critical pipeline for training and preparing minorities and other citizens to enter the w orkforce resulting in needed skilled workforce to bolster the regional economy. 2. TRH and SIHF Healthcare will have the capacity to build a more comprehensive health care workforce in this local region as a result of our transformation initiatives. The comm unity health care workers, medical assistants, nursing, and other necessary medical support staff continue to grow beyond the present levels that we have demonstrated over the last five years. 3. Private ownership will build 65 affordable homes with two/thr ee bedrooms and garage. 4. A projected result of this transformation is the recent focus for the improvement in the local infrastructure upgrade to the sewer, water, and streets. The capacity to link our transformation in coordination with the respective comm unities for upgrades to the infrastructure shall also produce opportunities for job growth. This complete project will consist of both public and private engagement, including a grocery store and other retail, recreation center, affordable homes, compreh ensive health care, and regional trades workforce training. It is estimated that this revitalization initiative will yield approximately $40 million in new construction; 250 construction jobs; 70 full time jobs and 50 part -time jobs. Additional job creati on will be triggered by the New Health Campus construction project where it is anticipated the 2 year construction period would create 360 dire ct full time jobs over 2 years. Jobs directly created to provide services and complete activities proposed through this Transformation include: For the Community Health Worker Deployment: 1 program manager 50 Community Health Workers 2 CHW/Trainers 2 dieticians New Hospital Campus and Specialty Services: Construction jobs will be created as shown abov e Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 46 Specialty services will also require approx. 17.0 FTE specialists to cover all planned activities. These positions will likely be contracted positions or filled through partnership agreements rather than directly staff. For the Urgent Care Center: 3 Prov iders 3 RNs 5 MAs 3 PRCs 3 Technicians Public Housing Development, Diversion & Supportive Housing within TRH and the Workforce Development project will utilize staff from multiple program partners lead by a new 1.0 FTE Director of Business Development to lead these project activities Venice Workforce Development will also include the following staff for continued operations: 1 Provider 1 counselor 1 CHW 3 support staff In total, this project will create 430 full -time construction jobs for at least 2 years along with another 50 part time construction jobs. Continued staffing will require the hiring of an additional 79 FTE permanent staff. SUSTAINABILITY The decades of underinvestment into our community and others is the very reason this transformation progr amming is being pursued by the department, elected officials, and our collective partnerships. The transformation investment is a great start to helping change the pathway of our distressed communities and residents who have suffered from this lack of inve stment. The practicality of having complete success where no further investment is required in such a short timeframe for a community is unwise. We collectively understand that is a significant first step for the Department and our collective partnership to achieve significant progress in changing the health equity and outcomes this region deserves. We request that our long term sustainability be part of the ongoing discussions with the department so we can formulate a mutual solution that is sustainable f or the desired outcomes and that is being sought through this transformation. Our transformation efforts and our partners will also seek local and regional opportunities for investment and funding to supplement those initiatives that are successful to improvin g health outcomes and equity. We would also propose that the department create a structure where each of the transformational projects can collectively share and discuss next steps of sustainability as a means to foster ideas for success. Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 47 Specialist Care The proposed transformation effort to address the unmet specialty care needs will seek to collaborate with the Department of Health and Family Services to create alternative payment opportunities that will sustain the services directly and with our respecti ve partners. The considerations for these partnerships and sustainability will need to address recruitment, retention, and method of service delivery. Options for consideration under this transformation shall take in consideration the partnership with our academic institutions, managed care partners, and private partners are possibly different type of payment platforms for sustainability. It is our belief the only viable sustainable solution is one that can be mutually concurred with by the department. Thus , during the course of our programming, we anticipate providing the department options for consideration for our sustainability of the unmet need that ultimately will allow us to achieve access and equity in our region. It is hoped that HFS will work with us and local providers to ensure payments for specialist care at the level required to create ongoing sustainability. Community Health Workers CHWs' proven effectiveness within alternative payment structures and association with the proposed integrated hea lth homes may have the opportunity to create long -term sustainability to support inclusion of CHWs in the health care system for the long -term. Part of our proposal for sustainability continue s to work with HFS on these alternative payment methods and struc tures that could not only be sustainable but have targeted focus for community based needs and outcomes where community health workers can be of great asset in the improvement of health outcomes in the reduction in overall healthcare expenses. One example of a coordinated effort between HFS and our transformation should materialize from our community health hub and supportive housing which may have alternative funding sources to assist our sustainability. The State of Illinois has also in the past considere d the funding of more intensive care management through the deployment of case management services paid for through enhanced State funding. We would anticipate this consideration to be part of our conversations with the department. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE The Transformation project governance will be structured for each individual transformation activity. The variation of the transformation components do not equate to having a simple governance structure. Instead we are proposing to partner with Healthier To gether as the regional advisory body that can help facilitate connections, community communications, data sharing, and goal setting which can assist us in achieving higher healthcare ranking for our transformation area. This input would allow us to help gu ide the content in common factors to include in data sharing agreements and reports. All payment of transformation funds will be tracked centrally and reports will be required of participating entities in order to ensure funds continue to be spent as app ropriate for the purposes of this Transformation. TRH and SIHF have extensive fiscal departments that have managed external relationships and reporting from the host of healthcare and social service entities. This collective Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 48 experience will assist in the s tructure needed to ensure specific oversight to these funds and these projects.

Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 50 REQUIRED RACIAL EQUITY IMPA CT ASSESSMENT GUIDE 1. IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS Which racial/ethnic groups may be most affected by and concerned with the issues related to this proposal/policy? The communities at the center of the TRH healthcare transformation project have a predominantly African American population. There is also a small but notable Hispanic population in the area with many limited - English speaking residents. 2. ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS Have stakeholders from different racial/ethnic groups especially those most adversely affected \u2014been informed, meaningfully involved and authentically represented in the development of this proposal? Who's missing and how can they be engaged? From the outset , stakeholders from the affected racial and ethnic groups have played an essential role in the development of the proposal with input gathered through several means , including weekly calls lead by the United Church Groups in both St. Clair and Madison County. These weekly calls have leaders from churches, agencies, government, and others seeking a platform for transformation and interventions. Additionally Transformation leadership has met extensively with local, county, state, and federal ele cted officials who represent the districts affected by this proposal. Social service agencies in the community regularly participate in TRH's Community Needs Assessment conducted every three years (most recently conducted in 2019). Healthier Together, a 1 00% volunteer -driven group of over 70 local organizations currently dedicated to working together to improve community health and overall quality of life , contributed significantly to this project via extensive in -person meetings. 3. IDENTIFYING AND DOCUME NTING RACIAL INEQUITIES Which racial/ethnic groups are currently most advantaged and most disadvantaged by the issues this proposal seeks to address? How are they affected differently? What quantitative and qualitative evidence of inequality exists? What e vidence is missing or needed? Currently the East St. Louis Metro Area and its largely African -American residents are the most disadvantaged by the current available healthcare in their communities. A severe lack of Health Equity in the region has led to a series of poor health outcomes for the residents . Chronic under investment across social and health care in the community has created an environment that leads to multiple health risks and social challenges. Local organizations struggle to address the ful l breadth of health related needs due to the overwhelming social issues impacting our community. 4. EXAMINING THE CAUSES What factors may be producing and perpetuating racial inequities associated with this issue? How did the inequities arise? Are they ex panding or narrowing? Does the proposal address root causes? If not, how could it? Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 51 This lack of health resources and services has been driven by white flight and medical services following this population. This has resulted in the loss of significant medic al services culminating in the closure of two of the community's hospitals (Christian Welfare in the 1980's and Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital in 2016) leaving East St. Louis, one of the most dangerous cities in America, without an Emergency Room. Specifi c equity issues directly affecting the healthcare delivery system in the community include: inadequate health care campus/hospital with an aging facility that lacks modern operational capabilities; lack of specialist services; lack of an acute care/urgent care facility in the East St. Louis community; lack of care management services in order to overcome a lack of health literacy and health education; and a lack of connection to the health -related resources available in the community. These factors continue to this day and without a significant Transformation in this community, these inequalities will only grow. This proposal addresses these inequities by implementing projects that will transform the delivery of healthcare in the East St. Louis Metro Region by addressing not only the specific health equity issues discussed but by also working as a larger collaboration to improve the Social Determinants of Health for the region by addressing workforce development, safe and affordable housing, and food insecuri ty. 5. CLARIFYING THE PURPOSE What does the proposal seek to accomplish? Will it reduce disparities or discrimination? The proposal seeks to transform the healthcare delivery system in order to reduce health disparities in the predominantly African America n population in the East St. Louis Metro Region. The collaboration will accomplish this goal through several capital and programmatic projects which not only focus on health disparities but also inequities in the Social Determinants of Health. 6. CONSID ERING ADVERSE IMPACTS What adverse impacts or unintended consequences could result from this policy? Which racial/ethnic groups could be negatively affected? How could adverse impacts be prevented or minimized? Unexpected adverse impacts or unintended consequences may result from any proposal that seeks to make a large, transformational impact on racial inequities that have deepened over time. The team behind this proposal has prioritized continuous assessment on the progress of overall implementation and specific data points and benchmarks throughout. The quality review team will work with proposal partners and community stakeholders to address any possible adverse impacts or unintended consequences that may arise. 7. ADVANCING EQUITABLE IMPACTS What p ositive impacts on equity and inclusion, if any, could result from this proposal? Which racial/ethnic groups could benefit? Are there further ways to maximize equitable opportunities and impacts? In addition to reducing the healthcare inequities addressed by the proposal, additional racial inequities that are directly a ffected by projects within this proposal include: lack of jobs and training opportunities, including geographically accessible, affordable education and job training; disparities in the numbe r of individuals who are involved in the criminal justice system, including high rates of incarceration for those with behavioral health problems; lack of supportive housing for those with health issues and transitional housing for those transitioning from homelessness or incarcerations trying to re -enter the community; lack of connection to supportive social Touchette Regional Hospital - East St. Louis Metro Area Health Transformation Partnership 52 services in the community and overall lack of coordination in these services; lack of safe and affordable homes that provide opportunities for fitness and safe social engagements; and lack of services accessible to those who are best served in a language other than English. 8. EXAMINING ALTERNATIVES OR IMPROVEMENTS Are there better ways to reduce racial disparities and advance racial equity? What provi sions could be changed or added to ensure positive impacts on racial equity and inclusion? The proposal incorporates the most effective methods of reducing racial disparities and advancing racial equity as determined through extensive communication with co mmunity stakeholders and project partners. As continuous quality assessment is an essential part of the project implementation in addition to ongoing community input, any alternative suggestions that arise that may better advance racial equity will be giv en due consideration. 9. ENSURING VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY Is the proposal realistic, adequately funded, with mechanisms to ensure successful implementation and enforcement? Are there provisions to ensure ongoing data collection, public reporting, stak eholder participation and public accountability? The proposal is data -driven and focused with specific mechanisms for assessing project implementation on an ongoing basis. Specific data points used in this design included: Infant Mortality Rates, Diabetes Rates, Hypertension Rates, Asthma Rates, Cancer Screening Rates, rates of follow -up care to hospitalizations for Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorder, the number of unmet Specialty referrals from SIHF Healthcare, the number of non -emergency ER visits, and entry into Prenatal Care. Regular assessment of these data points will be shared with all proposal partners. 10. IDENTIFYING SUCCESS INDICATORS What are the success indicators and progress benchmarks? How will impacts be documented and evaluated? How will the level, diversity and quality of ongoing stakeholder engagement be assessed? The proposal identifies 11 specific health measures as benchmarks for overall success in reducing health disparities, each of which includes a specific target or outcome to indicate goal achievement. These goals will guide our collective efforts with our partners through ongoing monitoring throughout the program and the Transformation actions that will seek to meet these preliminary goals within five years.
