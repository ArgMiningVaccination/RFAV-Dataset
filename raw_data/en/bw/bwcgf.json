This is a very unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of Faith and Science. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff who have chosen to be part of this experience we call Loma Linda. They have chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We emphasize what we call Mission-Focused Learning. This means that what we offer centers on more than producing knowledgeable professionals, because we believe that who you are is even more important than what you know. To assist in this lifelong process, we are encouraging the enculturation of our seven core values, known by the acronym JCHIEFS. These values are Justice, Compassion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and find ways to strengthen these virtues in everything you do. You also will find an incredible mixture of cultural diversity on our campus. Revel in our similarities and differences, and use each interaction to help you understand the issues that separate us. W ith understanding comes acceptance. And with acceptance come peace and fellowship. Use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures from whom you can learn and gain greater understanding. We will all be better as we tear down those barriers that often separate us. All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, activ e in the lives and experiences of each of us. Through our weekly University at Worship, the prayers of faculty in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me in getting to know Him better. P lace your future in His hands. Have confidence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowship and grow in His love. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 43,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P.H. President Loma Linda University2 UNIVERSITY CATALOGPrograms, Degrees, and Certificates The degree and certificate curricula at Loma Linda University are under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improvement without prior notice, as the need occurs. The University also offers nondegree and short courses throughout the United States and globally to meet the continuing education and extension program needs of alumni, health professionals, and lay persons in the church and in the community. Most degree courses are approved for continuing education credit. School-specific certificates are awarded upon completion of organized programs of study at the postsecondary level. Students register for courses through the Office of University Records, but the certificate is issued by the school, which maintains records of the certificate and its aw arding. Financial aid is not available to students registered in school-specific programs. See school programs in each school for a listing of school-specific certificates available. The Faculty of Graduate Studies oversees Ph.D. and research master's degrees, as well as combined degrees programs.

The University's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmativ e action officer. Employment- related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employ ees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. Affirmative Action 9Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; as well as with local and state requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential.10 UNIVERSITY CATALOGNondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races; and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of Sec. 12926 (d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article 1, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as interpreted by the Sev enth-day Adventist Church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in 11The Academic Calendar Academic dates for Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) and the Schools of : AH Allied Health

We are drawn by love to share the good news of God expressed through the life and gospel of Jesus Christ and to hasten His return. A Seventh-day Adventist health sciences institution22 UNIVERSITY CATALOGUniversity Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious v alues, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural and spiritual dimensions of a person's life, unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.\" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. Winslow, Ph.D., SCOPE , Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted definition of wholeness in the Loma Linda University Wholeness Inventory. University Philosophy 23Core Values The University affirms these values as central to its view of education: COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are w ell-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believ ers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL \u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance.24 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudent Learning Outcomes Loma Linda University's student learning outcomes are in the process of being implemented throughout all degree programs within the University. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Learning is working with programs to guide the assessment of these outcomes. All degree programs hav e articulated their learning outcomes, which will also reflect the Univ ersity's value of educational effectiveness. Outcome 1 Students understand and apply the University philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. Outcome 2 Students understand the importance of integrating the University's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. Outcome 3 Students demonstrate critical thinking. Outcome 4 Students develop a commitment to discovery and lifelong learning. Outcome 5 Students demonstrate effective communication skills in English. Outcome 6 Students demonstrate effective use of technology appropriate to the discipline. Outcome 7 Students understand the importance of embracing and serving a div erse world. Outcome 8 Students demonstrate the importance of collaborating with others within and across disciplines.Student Learning Outcomes 25University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally, the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest officer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace deriv es from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conduciv e to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight v ertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful ov al that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University\u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the Christian cross\u2014a universal symbol\u2014acknowledges the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer. The lighted torch\u2014part of our logo since 1959\u2014suggests the illuminating pow er of knowledge and the central role of the Holy Spirit in teaching and healing. It also references the institution's call to serv e as a light to the world. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine\u2014and part of our logo since the 1920s\u2014represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the branch of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the laurel branch, presented to honor personal achievement. Shown together, the oak and laurel branches form a wreath\u2014suggesting that the life-saving and life-enhancing work of the health sciences brings with it an obligation to act honorably, courageously, and selflessly. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this institution\u2014\"To Make Man Whole.\"26 UNIVERSITY CATALOGUniversity Foundations HISTORY Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905, the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care\u2014a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other univ ersity. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility\u2014a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health sciences university\u2014part of a complex which includes Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (May 2012) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,583 full-time teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers (1,392\u2014largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 2,975. As of Autumn Quarter 2012, 1,369 students from 117 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 4,652.University Foundations 27A CENTURY OF SERVICE Today the original 1905 property is part of an expanding health sciences campus that includes: six medical facilities, licensed for approximately 1076 beds\u2014 Loma Linda University Medical Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 1993; University Medical Center East Campus Hospital (LLUECH), 2003; licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993\u2014formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; Loma Linda University Heart & Surgical Hospital (LLUHSH), 2009, with 28 beds; an acute psychiatric care facility, licensed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014the Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC); Loma Linda University Medical Center-Murrieta, licensed in 2011 for 106 beds; nine Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) institutes, two LLUAHSC-related research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda University (on campus, distance education, and online degree programs through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.28 UNIVERSITY CATALOG1905 School of Nursing 1909 The institution was named College of Medical Evangelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics* 1937 School of Medical Technology* 1941 School of Physical Therapy* 1945 Radiologic Technology Program* 1948 School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1953 School of Dentistry 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies, 2005) 1958 Dental Hygiene Program 1959 Occupational Therapy Program* 1963 Medical Records Administration Program* 1966 Schools/Programs (see * above) consolidated as the School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda University campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate universities 1991 Loma Linda University designated a health sciences university 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center (corporately linked together through Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center\u2014LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and Technology 2007 School of Religion 2012 School of Science and Technology closed 2012 School of Behavioral HealthUniversity Foundations 29A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"To make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST HERITAGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. Students come from many different faiths, and respect and sensitivity for all people\u2014regardless of their culture or ethnicity\u2014are view ed as a part of true Christianity. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from those of this academic community. The various perspectives of spiritually committed students are considered to be enriching to this campus and its educational environment. OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of the Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours, University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship.30 UNIVERSITY CATALOGA second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-and-fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the Univ ersity.A Unique University 31Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. UNIVERSITY AT WORSHIP SERVICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as University at Worship attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. These programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the Univ ersity's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on w ays to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninv asive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the Univ ersity and of themselves as members of its community.32 UNIVERSITY CATALOGLearning Environment Loma Linda University is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to mankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda University interweaves its vision, mission, and core values with its student learning outcomes. The University's mission of wholeness gives focus to the learning environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual) and giv es meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health-care institution, critical and analytical thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development. Loma Linda University pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the local and global communities its commitment to upholding integrity, valuing diversity, engaging with the community in service-learning scholarship, and honoring the process of ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The University and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly defined student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The University is engaged in systematic academic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment between student learning outcomes and planned academic activities. Program review follows carefully developed schedules as outlined in school-specific assessment matrices. Loma Linda University is committed to using assessment data to guide academic and fiscal master planning for the University. The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riv erside, and LosLearning Environment 33Angeles areas; as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. UNIVERSITY STUDENT MISSION-FOCUSED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) is a Loma Linda Univ ersity program housed in the Global Health Institute. SIMS exemplifies the University's legacy and ongoing commitment to global service. It provides inspiring and life-changing international service opportunities for students while providing much-needed assistance to global communities in need. In addition to coordinating monthly group trips to Mexico and several yearly group trips to other sites\u2014such as Asia, South America, and Africa\u2014SIMS also assists individual students with mission electiv es, international rotations, and service- learning placements at almost forty partner mission hospitals and clinics spread around the world. The mission of SIMS is to provide Loma Linda University students with high-quality service-learning opportunities that empower them to become caring, competent, and socially responsible health professionals who value service as a lifelong commitment.

SAC Health System (SACHS) A 42,000-square-foot clinic located just three miles from campus at the former Norton Air Force Base serves as the hub for activities of the SAC Health System (SACHS). The SAC Health System provides low-cost health care to persons who have limited or no access to medical care in the traditional system. Satellite clinics serve populations at several locations. The clinics are staffed by a wide variety of health- care professionals and provide an ideal setting for interdisciplinary training in today's changing health- care climate. Student involvement includes developing nutrition and health education programs; creating questionnaires for data collection; writing proposals for funding; and actual hands-on experience at the clinic, i.e., obtaining patient histories, assessing psychosocial problems, analyzing laboratory specimens, and providing nutrition and health education counseling. For additional information, call 909/382-7100; or visit the SACHS Web site at <llu.edu/central/sachs>. Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) The mission of Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) is to develop and strengthen reciprocal and sustainable relationships/partnerships between Loma Linda University students, faculty, and staff, and the local community. The vision of CAPS is to put into practice Christ's mission of lov e and compassion through meaningful community engagement. The CAPS office is committed to raising awareness about existing local community engagement activities being conducted through our schools and to connect students/faculty to these opportunities. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES Major library resources Specialized libraries are located in various medical and school departments and in other entities on campus. Additionally, the following three major library resources on campus support the Univ ersity's academic programs:34 UNIVERSITY CATALOG the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, the Rehabilitation Library (East Campus), and the Veterans Administration Library Services. The central library The historical roots of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, the central library of Loma Linda University, go back to 1907 when a small library collection was started in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953, the growing collection was moved to its own building on the Loma Linda campus. In 1981, construction of a new library was funded by a Del E. Webb Foundation grant that increased the total floor space of the library to 87,670 square feet. This structure currently houses the main library; while the old structure is now shared between the Department of Archives and Special Collections and the bound retrospective journals. As of June 2012, the Library had a total collection of 390,188 books and bound journals; 216, 262 print and electronic books; and 6,980 currently receiv ed print and electronic journal titles. For more detailed statistical information, consult the Library's W eb site at <llu.edu/library>. Library mission The mission of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of the University's instructional, research, and service programs. To this end, the Library provides a full range of information support services\u2014including, but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserv e, and access to the Internet. The Library also provides online databases, digital books, and journal collections; end-user class- integrated, library instruction programs; and services that support distance education and Univ ersity outreach programs.Learning Environment 35Access to resources The Del E. Webb Memorial Library's catalog provides access to all campus library collections. In addition to the collections of the Del E. Webb Memorial, there are nursing skills laboratory, bioethics, East Campus, nutrition, occupational therapy, and Geoscience Research Center collections. The catalog also provides access to the combined collections of some thirty-nine libraries through Link Plus, a book- request service and union catalog of more than 8 million records. The Library's W eb site, <llu.edu/ library>, provides access to all electronic journals, books, and databases. The Library participates in national and regional networks\u2014such as the National Network of the Libraries of Medicine, founded by the National Library of Medicine. This structure is divided into eight regional sections, one of which is the Pacific Southwest Region. The Library belongs to this region and is the designated medical resource library for San Bernardino and Riv erside counties. Local library cooperatives include the Inland Empire Academic Library Cooperative (IEALC); and San Bernardino, Inyo, Riverside Counties United Library Services (SIRCULS). Membership in these cooperatives gives Loma Linda University students, faculty, and staff access to the collections of these libraries, archives, and special collections. Archives and special collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository of information on the history of Loma Linda University, the health sciences, and major collections on Adventism. It includes print materials; rare recordings; sev eral thousand photographs; and archival materials, including papers of various denominational and University officials, as well as the congressional papers of the Honorable Jerry and Shirley Pettis. Searchable digitized indexes for various document files are also available via the department's Web page: <llu.edu/library/speccolls>. For additional information about school- or program-specific libraries/computer and research centers/ learning resources, see the desired schools and programs in Section III of this CA TALOG.

Students at Loma Linda University are expected to uphold the Christian ethical and moral standards of this Seventh-day Adventist Church-related institution while on and off campus. The University's emphasis on health and the health professions, as well as the practices of the supporting church, preclude admission of applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic bev erages, or narcotics. The rights of the individual are recognized and respected; however, any conduct that is contrary to the principles governing a healthful and moral lifestyle is not acceptable for a Loma Linda University student. The prospective student has the freedom to accept or reject these principles and practices prior to applying. Once application is made to this University, the applicant has chosen to abide by these principles and practices. In selecting students for entrance to programs in the schools, the admissions committees look for evidence of personal integrity, academic achievement, healthful lifestyle, self-discipline, and self- direction. An applicant accepted to a school must possess capabilities to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time at the levels of competence required. While preference is given to Seventh-day Adventist Church members, anyone interested in studying at Loma Linda University and willing to live by the institution's standards is encouraged to apply. Many programs require an interview with the faculty. Acceptance of an applicant into any curriculum is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS Where to apply It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin this process w ell in advance of the date of anticipated or desired entrance. Degree and program information, requirements, and application can be found online at <llu.edu>. Procedure All procedures are listed on the LLU Web site. Application review process All completed applications are reviewed by the appropriate admissions committee, which makes the final decision regarding acceptance. Applicant's records The application and all supporting records and documents become the property of the Univ ersity. TRANSCRIPTS Incoming The University accepts only official transcripts sent directly to Loma Linda University from the college, university, or high school issuing it. Transcripts submitted by the student are not considered official.38 UNIVERSITY CATALOGApplicants not applying through an external application service must provide official transcripts of all postsecondary education prior to offers of admission. However, international applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admission requirements for the chosen program before an offer of acceptance can be issued, whether or not the program uses an external application service. Official final transcripts documenting completion of all course work must be submitted to the University immediately upon completion. Applicants to undergraduate programs of the University are required to furnish evidence (transcripts, GED, CHSPE, or equivalent) of completion of high school in order to be granted admission. The final transcript must include the date of graduation. Applicants who hold an associate's degree from a regionally accredited college/university upon admission do not need to furnish a high school transcript, unless required to validate specific course work. Applicants expecting an associate's degree to be awarded before matriculation at Loma Linda University must provide documentation (e.g., letter mailed from registrar to the University) showing expected degree completion. Otherwise, evidence of completion of high school will be required for acceptance. Final transcripts showing the awarding of a bachelor's degree are required for applicants to programs that require a bachelor's degree. If the degree is not yet posted on the transcript the applicant must submit documentation (e.g., letter mailed from registrar to the Univ ersity) verifying completion of bachelor's degree prior to matriculation. Subsequent enrollment is contingent upon the previous submission of all official final transcripts. Applicants who have attended international schools are required to submit official transcripts (mark sheets) in the original language, which convey the grades and credits earned in each subject; and an English translation of their transcripts, if not already in English. Official education transcripts (or mark sheets), degrees earned from international institutions, or professional credentials must be sent to an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda University. The specified center reports the evaluation results directly to the Office of University Admissions. Transcripts and evaluation results received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution. Outgoing The University provides Loma Linda University transcripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon written request of the student or graduate. The University reserves the right to withhold all information concerning the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of accounts or other charges, including student loans. No transcripts will be issued until all of the student's financial obligations to the Univ ersity as defined in this CATALOG have been met. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT A student who has not enrolled for any classes, or paid the continuous registration fee for courses still in progress from a previous term, will be inactivated at the beginning of the second quarter of nonenrollment, unless s/he is on an approved leave of absence (maximum of four academic quarters, including Summer Quarter). (Example: A student who enrolled for Autumn Quarter but who does not enroll for Winter Quarter will be inactivated at the close of registration [two weeks into the quarter] for the subsequent Spring Quarter). Inactivated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree program are required to reapply with sufficient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements.Admission Policies and Information 39The reapplication process also requires the submission of official transcripts from all colleges/ universities attended since the student last attended this University. Official transcripts from colleges/ universities the student attended while enrolled at this University must also be submitted if they were not submitted prior to inactivation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. All graduates are expected to hav e documented current knowledge in their field of study as of the date of graduation (date on diploma). APPLICATION DEFERRAL Applicants are accepted for a specified entering term. If the applicant does not enter the program at the time stated for admission, the application will become inactive unless the school receives a written request to defer the application. Not all programs permit an applicant to defer an application; how ever, for those programs for which this is permitted, an application may not be deferred for more than one year. After one year, a new application must be submitted. Accepted applicants who wish to reactivate their acceptance at a later date must apply to the school for reactiv ation. Previous acceptance does not guarantee acceptance at a later time. Individuals must meet admission and graduation requirements that are in effect for the school year during which they first register. RE-ENTRANCE See Continuous Enrollment policy in this section of the CATALOG. PRE-ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS Some programs require official pre-entrance examination results. Specific instructions are av ailable online. TRANSFER CREDIT Applicants must file with the Office of University Admissions complete records of all studies taken on the college/university level. Transfer credit is defined as credit completed at another U.S.A. college or university accredited by a regional association, credit earned at an institution accredited by the Seventh- day Adventist educational system, or credit earned at an international institution recognized by its government. The University reserves the right to require an applicant to satisfactorily complete written and/or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Remedial, high school- level courses, and courses identified by the transfer institution's catalog as not applicable toward a baccalaureate degree are not accepted for transfer into an undergraduate program.

See <llu.edu/central/apply/intltrans.page> for a list of the approved companies. Finances and employment United States immigration regulations and Loma Linda University require that international students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the Univ ersity during theAdmission Policies and Information 43program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his/ her program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce. The student should contact his/her financial aid advisor regarding availability and application information. International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or fewer per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if a student's program allows summer quarters off). For questions, please call International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Visas F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F- visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning students are subject to study load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: 1. has been accepted into a program and all official transcripts (mark sheets) have been received by the University, 2. has paid the advance deposit, and 3. has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding F-1 student visas and the regulations governing this visa. J-visa exchange program Loma Linda University has an exchange visitor program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over an exchange visitor since the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allow ed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can either be degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the Exchange Visitor Program.44 UNIVERSITY CATALOGOther visas International students may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this Univ ersity. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approv al is needed from an international student advisor in International Student and Scholar Services. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who hav e either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international advisor at each school as soon as the acceptance letter is receiv ed. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of every academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approv al is needed from an international student advisor in International Student and Scholar Services. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off).

In addition, these schools offer a v ariety of general education courses that are open to students across all schools. The Division of General Studies also provides oversight for courses that may be selected to enrich a student's academic experience but that do not fulfill Loma Linda University general education requirements. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY OF GENERAL EDUCATION As a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. With its rich spiritual heritage, the University places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University consists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and diversity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultiv ating their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian principles and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical thinking skills into personal and professional experience.46 UNIVERSITY CATALOG4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health sciences professions. 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as w ell as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of Univ ersity life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless others. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CRITERIA FOR GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES The course assists the health sciences student in cultivating abilities in one or more of the preceding ten aspects described in the Loma Linda University philosophy of general education for baccalaureate degrees.

Courses that fulfill this requirement are: RELT 406 Adventist Beliefs and Life, RELT 423 Loma Linda Perspectives, RELT 436 Adventist Heritage and Health, and RELT 437 Current Issues in Adventism. Students whose required units in religion from a Seventh-day Adventist institution have been prorated (reduced) are encouraged to make up the additional units in Domain 1 (28 quarter units) with further religion courses and/or additional units in humanities from Loma Linda Univ ersity. The study of humanities must include a minimum of 12 units.

The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies, and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. FROM UNIVERSITY TO STUDENT Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda Univ ersity constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as a professional institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CA TALOG and in each school's section of theStudent Handbook . Grievances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published grievance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grievance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recommends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospective students who have questions concerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. Student Life 53WHOLE PERSON HEALTH The University regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bonds and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole person health\u2014balanced development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglecting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interdependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda University may congregate and participate in the multifaceted programs offered that involve the holistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the student to further dev elop rich, personal spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and desert, the Univ ersity provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide v ariety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A variety of University-, school-, and group-sponsored events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable association with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. Mental health The University promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, body building, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to interest each student in some recreational and health-building activity that may be carried over to enhance future life.54 UNIVERSITY CATALOGRECREATION/WELLNESS: THE DRAYSON CENTER The Drayson Center serves as the focal point for recreation and wellness at Loma Linda University.

It is not an insurance program. The plan includes coverage for hospital care, surgery, emergency care, prescription drugs, and more. Generally, to be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of the plan, expenses must be incurred while cov erage is in effect. Expenses incurred before plan coverage becomes effective or after plan coverage has terminated will not be covered. This plan will only provide medical coverage on an excess basis. This means that all medical expenses must first be submitted to any other available source of health care coverage. There is no vision or dental coverage available. Please see the Loma Linda University Web site for Student Health Services for a complete explanation of the Student Health Plan (<llu.edu/central/studenthealth>). Enrollment The enrollment form must be returned to Risk Management as specified in order to gain access to the services provided. Preferred provider plan The health plan has been developed as a PPO (preferred provider) plan. Benefits for services utilized outside the preferred provider structure will be reduced. Plan year The plan benefit year is a fiscal year and runs from July 1 through June 30. Pre-existing condition exclusion If a student or patient has not maintained continuous \"creditable coverage\" under another health plan during the twelve months prior to the student's date of enrollment, or prior to the coverage effective date, the following pre-existing condition exclusion will apply: This plan will not cov er any medical condition, illness, or injury for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment w as recommended or received by the student or patient during the six months prior to the student's date of enrollment or during the six months prior to the effective date of health plan coverage. Treatment includes receiving services and supplies, consultations, diagnostic tests, or prescribed medications. This exclusion will apply for tw elve months from the coverage effective date, or date of enrollment if the individual was enrolled at the time of enrollment to the University, unless such an individual remains treatment free during the six-month term beginning with the date of enrollment or effective date of coverage. If the individual remains treatment free during this six-month term, the pre-existing condition exclusion will apply only during this six-month period. This exclusion will not apply to pregnancy-related medical expenses or to medical treatment for a newborn or adopted child. (A student who was covered by another health plan prior to enrollment at this University should read the following section entitled \"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\") A student who has a pre-existing condition should check with any prior insurer to obtain complete information regarding his/her rights to COBRA coverage during this pre-existing condition exclusion period. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) If a student has been covered under a medical plan during the past twelve months, all or part of the pre-existing condition exclusion may be waived when s/he comes under the University plan. In order for a determination to be made regarding the student's coverage, the former insurance company or employer56 UNIVERSITY CATALOGmust provide to Risk Management a certificate verifying the previous coverage. If the student has any pre-existing medical conditions, it is imperative that this certificate be returned to Risk Management along with the health plan enrollment form.

GOVERNING PRACTICES At Loma Linda University, nonacademic policies have been established that help foster a fulfilling University experience. Students are expected to uphold these policies, which govern nonacademic student life on and off campus. Information in this section of the CA TALOG, as well as in Section III and in the Student Handbook pertains to requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed of the general and specific requirements of his/her school and program. Identification number and card All accepted students will be assigned a unique University identification number. This seven-digit number will be used on all correspondence and noted on all payments to the Univ ersity. A University identification card using this identification number and a bar code will be issued to each student after s/he completes initial registration and financial clearance. The identification card allows access to various student services, including the libraries, Student Health, recreation facilities (i.e., the Drayson Center), parking, etc. Also, the bar code on the card allows currently enrolled and financially cleared students to charge against their accounts at the Campus Bookstore and campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales available through the Student Services office. In subsequent quarters, the card's bar code is automatically reactiv ated at each registration upon financial clearance. For further information regarding these identification cards, please contact Student Services. Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students. Any single student who prefers to live on campus may do so. Students are expected to live on campus unless they are: married, twenty-one years of age or older,60 UNIVERSITY CATALOG in a graduate program, or living with their parents. Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet one of the foregoing requirements may petition the vice president for student services for a possible exception. This should be done w ell in advance of registration to allow the student adequate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing Web site at <llu.edu/central/housing>. The student must keep the University informed of his or her current address and telephone number and other contact numbers. Marriage A student who marries or changes marital status during the academic year must provide the school with advance written notification of the change in status in order to keep school records correct and up to date. Students should make every effort to schedule their wedding ceremonies during academic recesses. Name change Currently enrolled students may change their names on University records when they provide evidence (e.g., certified copy of a marriage certificate) that the name change is official. In addition to filing a Request for Change of Name on University Records form with the Office of University Records, the student must present a current ID card or other form of picture ID with his or her name as it appears on University records, along with official documentation of the name change. Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma. Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive articles of dress specified by the department or school and are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specified in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on the required professional dress is provided in Section III of this CA TALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health care institution, the profession, the school, and the Univ ersity. Specific guidelines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CA TALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal property The school assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, fire, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transportation arrangements and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car.Student Life 61The University enforces traffic rules and regulations as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Drivers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled \"Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations\" are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Security. Returning students must go to the Department of Security annually in September to renew registration. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health care professionals maintain the highest level of confidentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see \"Introduction to HIPAA\" at <home.mc.llumc.edu/Departments/LLUHS-Departments/HIPAA- Information/HIPAA-Help/Introduction-to-HIPAA/Index.html>. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda Univ ersity is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus environment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational or illegal mind- altering substances. Possession or use of these substances may be cause for dismissal. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment\u2014as well as information regarding prevention, detection, assessment, treatment, relapse prevention, confidentiality, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the Univ ersity. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, or careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, students should contact the office of the dean in their respectiv e schools. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding sexual harassment and sexual standards can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that div ert time, attention, and strength from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the office of the dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions.62 UNIVERSITY CATALOGEmployment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or fewer per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of general education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments. \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program.Student Life 63CONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University. Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and their attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment or other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request the Office of the Provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic griev ance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Center, etc., may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answ er to the student within fourteen days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may\u2014 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council, and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint.64 UNIVERSITY CATALOGCOPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specific conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than priv ate study, scholarship, or research.\" If a user makes a request for or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use,\" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. COMMUNICATION DEVICES All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" during class, laboratory, clinic, or chapel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or laboratory unless specifically a part of that activity and approv ed by the faculty member in charge.Student Life 65Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this section (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school and program. REGISTRATION Registration dates are published on the Web at <llu.edu/ssweb/registration.html>. The Web should be checked for specific dates of registration, since these dates vary during some quarters due to holiday schedules. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. After consultation with their academic advisor, students register online. Registration procedure includes entering classes online and clearing finance. Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted form from the Web in order to retain written documentation that they have requested financial clearance. Upon completion of registration, the student must obtain an ID card at the University Office of Student Affairs (first quarter registration only). A late registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to five days after the quarter begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $50 will be charged, unless the course is offered as an intensive that requires registration before the end of the first day of class. Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A change in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of University Records. Students receive written verification each time a change of program is officially approved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documentation of their registration. A student may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment.66 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSTUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of the course work they are taking (e.g., a student with a previous baccalaureate degree pursuing another baccalaureate degree would be classified as a sophomore while taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the lev el of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]). COURSE NUMBERS Courses as: nondegree-applicable credit lower division 301-499 upper division graduate 601-699 graduate: seminar, research, thesis, or dissertation 701-899 professional or clinical 901-999 extension with credit; continuing education units, if preceded by letter prefix ending with \"CE\" (e.g., ASCE 916); without academic credit; or undergraduate certificate clinical affiliation/practicum courses 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approves it, and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission; and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents a minimum of ten class hours in lecture or thirty hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, Univ ersity at Worship) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and/or unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent.Academic Policies and Information 67Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the office of the dean. COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-lev el achievement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having received their initial degree compliance report. A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examinations in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a w aiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approv al, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE WAIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. W aiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency. A w aiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade w as received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section.68 UNIVERSITY CATALOGPermission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in addition to the regular registration. Univ ersity policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. EXTENSION STUDY To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Linda Univ ersity, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Nursing or the School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy, or the School of Public Health. D+ 1.3 D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted, except as indicated above. F 0.0 Failure\u2014given when course work was attempted, but when minimum performance was not met. FA/UA 0.0 Failure to attend (U/A for S/U graded courses)\u2014given when a student discontinues attendance without withdrawing. Last date attended is to be noted on instructor grade report.Academic Policies and Information 69S none Satisfactory performance\u2014counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work, as determined by the school in which the student is enrolled. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of Univ ersity Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit hour course. CR none Credit for credit by examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for credit by examination. Does not count for any purpose. W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice president for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, a W notation will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available online at <llu.edu/central/ssweb/ registration.page>\u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor. The70 UNIVERSITY CATALOGinstructor reports the I notation on the grade report form, as w ell as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records along with the grade report form. The I notation is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five-quarter time limit, a grade of U will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the five- week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not met. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS For the purposes of financial aid eligibility, federal regulations gov erning Title IV HEA program funds require the University to establish a standard of satisfactory academic progress (SAP), and to monitor students' progress toward completion of a degree or certificate. Information relevant to the University's SAP standard is provided below. Students' academic progress is evaluated at least once annually. For students in programs that are less than one academic year in length, academic progress is evaluated at the end of each enrollment period. Failure to meet the University's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) standard requirements may result in financial aid suspension. Financial aid will be reinstated only after eligibility is re-established. The satisfactory academic progress requirements below apply to all Univ ersity students and are consistently applied, whether or not a student is receiving financial aid. Evaluation measures Satisfactory academic progress is evaluated based on three measures: qualitative, quantitative, and maximum time frame. Qualitative. The qualitative measure specifies the grade point average (G.P.A.) that must be achieved at each evaluation. If the G.P.A. is not an appropriate qualitative measure, a comparable assessment measured against a norm will be used. Calculation of the G.P.A. does not include incompletes (I), withdrawals (W), or transfer courses; however, courses repeated for additional credit (such as seminars and research) will be included. Courses repeated for a better grade will include only the most recent grade in the G.P.A. calculation. Quantitative. The quantitative measure specifies the pace at which a student should progress through his/her educational program in order to successfully complete a sufficient number of units at a rate that ensures program completion within the maximum time frame. The pace at which a student is progressingAcademic Policies and Information 71is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of units the student has successfully completed by the cumulative number of units the student has attempted. Units (credit hours) transferred from another institution that are accepted toward the student's educational program will be counted as both attempted and completed units. Maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for an undergraduate program measured in units cannot exceed a period longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program. The maximum time for completion of a master's degree is five years; the maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years. Calculation of the time frame begins with the term in which the first LLU course applicable toward a degree or certificate is taken. Program requirements Undergraduate programs. Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of at least 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Maximum time for completion of an undergraduate program is a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the academic program, as measured in credit hours or in clock hours required and expressed in calendar time. Graduate programs. Graduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of at least 3.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. For programs with a limited or no research component, the number of units per term needed to complete the program on time will be determined by dividing the total number of units required for completion by the length of the program\u2014expressed in academic quarters (e.g., five years for a master's degree equals twenty academic quarters, etc.). Research-intensive programs will provide information regarding the number of units that must be completed by the midpoint and three-quarters point of the program. Maximum time for completion of a master's degree is five years; maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years\u2014except in the case of block programs. Professional practice doctorates. All professional practice doctoral degrees (D.P.T., Pharm.D., D.D.S., M.D.) are block programs requiring students to enroll full time. See specific programs below for SAP policy information. Doctor of Physical Therapy (entry-level D.P.T.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0\u2014with no grade less than C (2.0) in any required course\u2014and must demonstrate satisfactory clinical performance. In addition, they must receive a grade of B or better in AHCJ 510 Human Gross Anatomy (taken during the first quarter of the program). Students must maintain a cumulativ e completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in three years; however, if a leave of absence becomes necessary, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is seven years. Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). The G.P.A. required for graduation is 2.30. Students must maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. In addition, students must hold a valid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license. Six years is the maximum time allowed to degree completion, which is also the maximum time intern pharmacist licensure is granted by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in four y ears; however, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is six years. Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). In order to progress to the next academic year, students must not receive a U (Unsatisfactory) grade in any course. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or72 UNIVERSITY CATALOGexceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Although students are expected to complete the program in four years, they are allowed to complete the first two years (basic sciences) within three years before progressing to the clinical years (third and fourth years of the program). The two clinical years must be completed within three years. Loss of eligibility for financial aid On the basis of the SAP evaluation, Title IV HEA program funds may be suspended for any of the following reasons: Student fails to achieve the required G.P.A. Student is not successfully completing his/her education program at the required pace. Student is unable to complete the program within the allotted time frame. The student is suspended from federal financial aid eligibility only and may not receiv e additional financial aid funds. However, s/he may continue enrollment at this University either without any financial assistance or, if eligible, with the assistance of priv ate loans. The Financial Aid Office can supply the student with additional information regarding these loans. Suspension letter A student who fails to meet the University's satisfactory academic progress standard will be informed in writing by the Financial Aid Office that financial aid has been suspended until such time as the student is again in compliance with SAP guidelines. The letter will include instructions regarding the appeal process. Appeal process Students may appeal loss of eligibility for financial aid. Instructions for submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal are available on the Web for students wishing to have their aid reinstated. The appeal must be filed by the deadline specified in the letter of suspension, ev en if the student believes an error has been made in his/her case. The completed appeal must be submitted to the director of financial aid, who will present it to the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The Financial Aid Office will notify the student in writing within five business days following the decision by the appeals committee. The student is required to submit his/her appeal in writing. The appeal must include the following information: A full explanation of the circumstances that led to his/her inability to meet the minimum progress requirements. Supporting documentation verifying the circumstances. A personalized academic plan. With the assistance of his/her academic advisor, the student is expected to explore options available to eliminate the deficiencies; as well as to develop a realistic term-by-term listing of specific courses to be taken towards graduation; and noncourse requirements to be completed (e.g., advancement to candidacy, qualifying examinations, dissertation defense, etc.). This plan is designed to ensure that the student will be able to meet the satisfactory academic progress standard by a specified point in time. The academic plan is signed by the academic advisor, department chair, and school academic dean.Academic Policies and Information 73If the appeal is approved, the student will be expected to adhere to the units and courses specified in the academic plan portion of the appeal. The academic plan will be closely monitored by the Financial Aid Office staff. Failure to follow the courses and units outlined may constitute the basis for future denial of financial aid. The progress of students on an academic plan will be reviewed at the end of one payment period, and then according to the academic plan; but not less frequently than the rest of the institution's population. Financial aid eligibility reinstatement A student who has failed to make satisfactory progress but who has appealed financial aid suspension and has had eligibility for aid reinstated is placed on financial aid probation. Clear financial aid eligibility will be regained when s/he is again in compliance with the satisfactory academic progress standard. ACADEMIC STANDING The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the University: regular standing or academic probation. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC RECORDS Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are av ailable to the student online at <llu.edu/central/ssweb>. The Office of University Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release \"directory information\" concerning students. The University has classified the following as student directory information that may be released: name, address (permanent and local), picture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number\u2014unless the student specifically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will be released only by the academic dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled. Requests for directory information receiv ed by other offices of the University will be transferred to the appropriate school office. VETERANS BENEFITS Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, Loma Linda University is approved for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the V eterans Administration (VA) and may be done via the Web. The Office of University Records serves as the certifying official for Loma Linda University. Students should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification. Students receiving veteran's benefits who fail for three consecutive quarters to maintain the cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) required for graduation will have their benefits interrupted, and the VA office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satisfactory grades for all required courses for the y ear in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certified until his/her probationary status (usually one y ear) has been removed. For more information, open links to the VA Web site (\"Students\" or \"Prospective Students\") on the University Web page at <llu.edu>.74 UNIVERSITY CATALOGGRADE CHANGE Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Change of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. REPEATING A COURSE Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE A leave of absence is defined as being away from school for the remainder of the quarter, to a maximum of one year, without the intent to return. The appropriate program withdrawal form must be obtained from the University Web site and approved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the office of the dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage and continuous registration during the leave period. WITHDRAWAL To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdraw al from the program by filing a Program Withdrawal form from the University Web site. The Change of Program form or the Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form should be completed as soon as possible after the student determines that s/he cannot complete the quarter. These forms must be filed no later than fourteen days prior to the end of the quarter. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program W ithdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Section III of this CATALOG. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence or continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. After one quarter, if the student has not re-enrolled, s/he will be inactivated.Academic Policies and Information 75FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF CURRENTLY REGISTERED STUDENTS The following steps apply to processing an application for a student who is currently registered at Loma Linda University: 1. The student submits application (online or paper) to a new program that is not part of a joint/ combined degree arrangement. 2. The Office of University Records prominently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3. The flagged University transcript is forwarded to the new program for evaluation. 4. The new program contacts a designated person in the home school/program to obtain relevant information about the student without revealing that an application is under consideration. 5. If the new program decides to accept the student, the acceptance letter instructs the student to take one of the following actions\u2014 Send a letter/deposit accepting the offer of admission and process a Total Withdrawal form or a Leave of Absence form for the program s/he is leaving, or decline the offer of admission. 6. The home program has an opportunity to speak with the student when s/he attempts to get an advisor's signature on the Total Withdrawal form. 7. The Office of University Records updates the student's program in Banner upon processing of the Total Withdrawal form for the old program and the student's acceptance into the new program. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. CATALOG IN EFFECT FOR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Subject to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who failed to register without leave of absence (consult office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled regarding number of quarters) may be required to re-enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. GRADUATION The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CA TALOG and consult carefully with their advisor to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the requirements listed in the University CATALOG at the time of admission; however, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an Undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is available online at <llu.edu/ssweb/documents/intgrad.pdf>.76 UNIVERSITY CATALOGCOMMENCEMENT EXERCISES The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the commencement exercises and receive the diploma in person. Permission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled to the provost and can be granted only by the provost. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements, the University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. DIPLOMA When the profession is named in the degree title, or when the degree is indicated by the school name, no other designation is included on the official diploma issued to the graduate. When the profession or major is not named in the degree title, the profession or specialization is also indicated on the official diploma.Academic Policies and Information 77Financial Policies and Information The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Accounts with other schools or with this University must be settled before enrollment will be allowed or services offered. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic year. Tuition and fees may vary from amounts shown. Please refer to the Student Account Disclosure statement for additional student account financial information (< llu.edu/ assets/central/ssweb/studentfinance/documents/disclosure.pdf>).

Other school-specific fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. Other fees Late registration fee $50 Late payment fee $50 Returned check fee $25 Lost withdrawal check reissue fee $15 Returned direct deposit fee $1578 UNIVERSITY CATALOGGENERAL PRACTICES Tuition payments/refunds Students who have not paid the balance due for registration, or who have not been awarded financial aid sufficient to cover the balance prior to registration will be charged a $50 late payment fee. Tuition and fees are due and payable in full to complete registration each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or program, or from a block program up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses will not receiv e a refund (please refer to the refund percentages and dates attached to individual courses. Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and payable in full upon presentation or notification of statement availability. A student unable to meet this requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student finance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a finance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per year). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respective school administrator and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take final examinations. Students may also request that monthly statements be sent to a parent or sponsor. Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained\u2014 each term in order to complete registration; before obtaining access to University services; before marching for graduation; before receiving a certificate or diploma; before requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board. All University registration holds must be cleared before financial clearance can be granted. To obtain financial clearance from the Student Loan Collections Office, students with campus-based student loans must be current on all scheduled loan account payments and must hav e fully completed a loan exit interview, after ceasing to be enrolled for at least half time at this Univ ersity. If the student's loan accounts are not current, or an exit interview has not been fully completed, a hold will be placed by the Student Loan Collection Office on transcript, diploma, or degree v erification; and P1E requests and other services may be denied. Please note that all student loans are reported to a credit bureau organization on a monthly basis. If a student fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note, the Student Loan Collection Office will accelerate the loan(s), place the student loan(s) in collection with an outside agency, and demand immediate payment of the entire unpaid balance\u2014including principal, interest due, late fees, other fees, collection costs, attorney costs, and legal costs.Financial Policies and Information 79Account charges Students who are currently enrolled on campus in a degree or certificate program are allow ed to charge items and services to their accounts.

Jackson, J.D., M.S.W. Dean, School of Allied Health Professions86 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSchool Foundations The School of Allied Health Professions was established in 1966 (under the name School of Health Related Professions, 1966-1971) to consolidate the administration of individual curricula initiated earlier in the University: medical technology, 1937; physical therapy, 1941; medical radiography, 1941; occupational therapy, 1959; health information management (formerly medical record administration), 1963. Curricula added since the school was established are nuclear medicine technology, 1970; radiation therapy technology, 1970; cardiopulmonary sciences (formerly respiratory therapy), 1971; nutrition and dietetics, medical sonography, coding specialist, 1987; physical therapist assistant, 1989; emergency medical care, 1993; physician 2000; cardiac technology, 2009. The curriculum in speech-language pathology and audiology, renamed communication sciences and disorders in 2009, was initiated in 1965 under the auspices of the College of Arts and Sciences of La Sierra University (formerly Loma Linda University, La Sierra campus). The program was transferred to the School of Allied Health Professions in 1987. Particulars governing programs currently offered are detailed in this section of the CATALOG following information that pertains to students schoolwide.School Foundations 87Mission and Goals OUR MISSION The School of Allied Health Professions is dedicated to fulfilling the mission of Loma Linda Univ ersity through academic and clinical training of allied health professionals. The school prepares competent health professionals in a Christian environment that emphasizes the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to make man whole.\" To meet local, national, and international allied health care needs, the school seeks to serv e: 1. Students choosing to become health-care professionals. 2. Individuals in need of medical care or health promotion programs. 3. Faculty and staff committed to working with students in a Christian educational setting. OUR GOALS The goals of the School of Allied Health Professions are to: 1. Provide an environment in which the student may develop responsibility for integrity, ethical relationships, and empathic attitudes that contribute to the welfare and well-being of patients. 2. Help the student accept responsibility for integrity, ethical relationships, and empathic attitudes that can contribute to the welfare and well-being of patients. 3. Help the student develop a background of information and attitudes conducive to interprofessional understanding and cooperation. 4. Encourage the student to cultivate habits of self-education that will foster lifelong growth. 5. Engender and nurture in the student the desire to serve humankind\u2014and, in particular, to serve as needed in the medical centers sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, both in this country and elsewhere. The eight student learning outcomes adopted by Loma Linda University and the School of Allied Health Professions are: 1. Students understand and apply the University philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. 2. Students understand the importance of integrating the University's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. 3. Students demonstrate critical thinking. 4. Students develop a commitment to discovery and lifelong learning. 5. Students demonstrate effective communication skills in English. 6. Students demonstrate effective use of technology appropriate to the discipline. 7. Students understand the importance of embracing and serving a diverse world. 8. Students demonstrate the importance of collaborating with others within and across disciplines.88 UNIVERSITY CATALOGEvaluation of Mission and Student Learning Outcomes\u2014Wholeness Portfolio Portfolio is a tool by which students develop and personally achieve student learning outcomes established by Loma Linda University. The school conducts an evaluation program that includes courses and standardized measures related to wholeness. The evaluation courses\u2014Wholeness Portfolio I, II, as well as Graduate Wholeness Portfolio\u2014are intended to be a means of integrating the wholeness concept into the lives of the students and of assessing the outcome of their educational process. The portfolio faculty and staff assist students in understanding and modeling the mission of Loma Linda Univ ersity and the School of Allied Health Professions. Each portfolio course is in progress for three-to-four quarters, during which time the student is developing a portfolio based on Loma Linda University's eight student learning outcomes. The final portfolio provides the student with an organized, goal-driven documentation of growth and achieved competence of abilities in a personal and professional realm of skills. Associate in Science degree program students complete the one-year wholeness portfolio; all other undergraduate students complete Wholeness Portfolio I and II over a two-year period. Each graduate student completes a graduate portfolio.Evaluation of Mission and Student Learning Outcomes\u2014Wholeness Portfolio 89General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III giv es the general setting for the programs of each school and the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND INFORMATION The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance of the applicant into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. An interview with faculty is required by most programs. Loma Linda Univ ersity was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethical and moral standards as a basis for their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health professions and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not expect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualified persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any Univ ersity- administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give preference in student admissions to qualified Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admission is not limited exclusively to Seventh-day Adventist applicants. APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Correspondence about admission to all programs and requests for application information should be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. Apply early One class is admitted annually to most of the professional programs. Most programs begin with the Autumn Quarter. Exceptions are noted in the respective programs of this CATALOG.90 UNIVERSITY CATALOGLate applications are considered as long as space is available. Notifications generally are sent between January 1 and May 15, depending on the completeness of information provided and the date of application. Applicants should inquire at the Office of Admissions and Records if notice of action is not received by April 15 for occupational therapy and physical therapy, and by May 15 for other programs. Application review process All completed applications are first reviewed by the department chair and faculty. A recommendation on each application is then submitted to the school's Admissions Committee, which makes the final decision regarding acceptance. Procedure The procedure for application and acceptance is given below. All correspondence and documents are to be sent to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. 1. File the complete application form (including recommendations, if received), accompanied by the $60 application fee. 2. Request that transcripts of all college course work be sent to the school. High school transcripts are required of all applicants in order to verify graduation and completion of high school mathematics. 3. Upon receipt of the notice of acceptance, return the required deposit and the card provided to confirm acceptance. 4. Provide health records or certificates, as required. Online application Applications are available online at <llu.edu/central/apply>. Applicant's records The application and all records submitted in support of the application become the property of the University. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Subject/Diploma requirements High school and college subject requirements for each program are outlined in the respectiv e programs. Students are required to furnish evidence of completion (official transcript) of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs in any of the schools of the Univ ersity. A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. Grade requirement Eligibility for consideration by the Admissions Committee is based on a G.P.A. of at least 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for all course work (science and nonscience subjects computed separately) presented in fulfillment of entrance requirements for all programs in the school. A G.P.A. considerably higher than the minimum is expected because of the nature of the studies in many professional programs and the competition for the limited number of openings. In general, G.P.A.s between 2.5 and 3.0 are considered minimal, depending on the program. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses.General Regulations 91Transcripts Transcripts (the documents by which institutions officially convey the grades and credits earned in specific subjects and the stage of completion of curriculum requirements) are accepted only when sent directly to the University by the issuing institution. Transcripts received by Loma Linda University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution upon request of the student. Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school or program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes his or her standing in a degree or certificate program.92 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudent Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircut, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical so that the student can perform assigned duties without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes, and dreadlocks are not acceptable. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse student population. Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Male students are not allowed to wear ear ornaments. If worn by women, ear ornaments are limited to simple studs and should not drop below the bottom of the earlobes. Such ornaments are limited to one per ear. Rings or ornaments in other anatomical sites are not acceptable. Fingernails should be maintained in a professional manner, closely trimmed, and should not interfere with patient safety and comfort during treatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of a subdued color.Student Life 93Academic Policies and Information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this Univ ersity. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. GRADUATION CEREMONIES Graduation events include formal ceremonies identified as conferring of degrees, awarding of diplomas, and recognition of candidates for degrees. Other related graduation ev ents include the baccalaureate and vespers services. The conferring of degrees ceremony(ies) occurs at the close of the Spring Quarter and includes an academic procession, the formal conferring of degrees by the president, and the presentation of diplomas by the dean of the school. Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certificates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these important and colorful events. To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specified by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who: Have only clinical experience requirements to complete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year; Can complete remaining degree requirements by the end of the Summer Quarter; or Are in a block program. The still in-progress course work may not exceed 8 units for graduate students or 12 units for undergraduate students. A student who completes the requirements for a degree or certificate (other than clinical experience) at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which the requirements for a degree are completed. Superior academic performance and achievement in scholarship and leadership are recognized in the printed graduation program for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their final term have acquired a cumulative grade point average for all college work (includes course work taken at other colleges/universities, except for remedial courses), as follows: 3.5 Graduation cum laude 3.8 Graduation magna cum laude 3.9 Graduation summa cum laude Although the official commencement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade point average as of the end of the quarter preceding their final term, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indicate graduation with honors if the student's final quarter record has increased the grade point average sufficiently to qualify for honors at that time.94 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSCHOLASTIC STANDING Repeating a course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan, the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 2. Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged, whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must reregister and pay the applicable fee. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the grade point average. A course may be repeated only once. Promotion and probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade point av erage: 2.0 Associate and baccalaureate degree programs 3.0 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program A student whose grade point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the school for final action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning assistance plan within the first two weeks of the following quarter and to meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic advisor. The learning assistance plan should: identify the problem, identify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and advisor signatures and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade point av erage the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade point average after two quarters will have disqualified him-/herself from the program.Academic Policies and Information 95Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following time frames: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years96 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAllied Health Studies The Department of Allied Health Studies provides a variety of administrative and support services to the school's academic departments, including: development, marketing, admissions, computer support and training, portfolio, and financial services.

Zappia A student who has an interest in science, an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist.Clinical Laboratory Science\u2014AH 123Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test results, and discusses them with the medical staff. OPPORTUNITIES Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other healthcare occupations through the year 2018, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current vacancy rates of 14 percent.

Sharp Paige Shaughnessy Jennifer St. Clair ADMINISTRATION DIANA RICHIE, Program Assistant and Undergraduate Advisor MONA SMITH, Administrative Secretary The Communication Sciences and Disorders Program prepares students for careers in the profession of speech-language pathology or audiology. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) ev aluate and treat children and adults who have communication, swallowing, and/or cognitive communication disorders. Difficulties in the areas of speech, language, fluency, swallowing, and voice are associated with a variety of disorders, including developmental delay, hearing impairment, cleft palate, cerebral palsy, stroke, and head injury. Audiologists are involved in prevention, identification, assessment, and rehabilitation of hearing disorders. Students who choose these professions should hav e an interest in working with people. OPPORTUNITIES The entry level for speech-language pathology is the master's degree. The entry level for audiology is the doctoral degree. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathologists and audiologists are found in speech and hearing clinics, public schools, hospitals, universities, health departments, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, rehabilitation centers, industry, research institutes, and priv ate practice. These environments allow for considerable flexibility. There is ample opportunity for employment as a speech-language pathologist. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathology assistants (SLP As) include working under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist. Although SLPAs work primarily in schools, there are also employment opportunities in hospitals and private clinics. Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science degree may work towards meeting eligibility requirements for registration in the state of California as a speech-language pathology assistant.134 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSTUDENT PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION Students are eligible for membership in the National Student Speech-Language-Hearing Association (NSSLHA).

Before the final scores are recorded, all comprehensiv e examinations are reviewed and discussed by the faculty, as a group. Students who have demonstrated satisfactory performance in course work and clinical placements at the end of the first year of graduate study are given approval to take the comprehensive examination in the second year. Praxis examination The Praxis (administered by a national testing service) is a multiple choice examination designed to evaluate students' broad-based knowledge across the disorders and is required for ASHA certification, for the California license, and for the California school credential. It is a nationally standardized and publicly administered test. A passing score of 600 must be achiev ed, and the test may be taken multiple times. Information about the Praxis may be obtained by going to < ets.org/praxis>. Students in the Master of Science degree curriculum in communication sciences and disorders are required to take the Praxis at the end of their first year. The department provides a preparation workshop, which all students are required to attend. Remediation Second-year graduate students and former students who have not passed the Praxis may join the preparation workshop at no charge. Alumni and graduate students who do not achiev e a passing score on the Praxis may take any course and/or seminar offered by the department free of charge in order to refresh knowledge or remediate areas of concern. Graduate students who demonstrate unsatisfactory performance in the clinical courses CMSD 567, 586, 588, 596, or 597 will be required to repeat the clinical experience and to register for CMSD 589 and/or 599, respectively.142 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudent progress review Each student's progress in the graduate curriculum is reviewed quarterly and upon completion of the foundational course work.

ROATH, Chair, Department of Clinical Laboratory Science MARGARET A. TAVARES, Program Director DARRYL G. HEUSTIS, Medical Director PAMELA J. WAT, Medical Codirector FACULTY Darryl G. Heustis Claro Y. Masangcay Marlene M. Ota Desiree L. Palafox Margaret A. Tavares Pamela J. Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discov ering its existence by alternate methods. OPPORTUNITIES Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. THE PROGRAM The Cytotechnology Program, based on the completion of two years of study at an accredited college or university, leads either to a certificate or to a certificate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program of study begins with the Autumn Quarter. A certificate is awarded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree upon completion of an additional two quarters of study. With the certificate in cytotechnology and the baccalaureate degree, the student is eligible to take a national examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. Registered cytotechnologists entering the program to receive the Bachelor of Science degree are considered to have completed, on the basis of registry, the equivalent course work listed in the first four quarters of the program. A total of 64 quarter units is applied toward the graduation requirements, provided the course work in pathology is equivalent to that offered in the certificate curriculum at this University. Where credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this University; or by completing a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper division course work in developmental biology or comparative animal physiology at an accredited college or university.Cytotechnology\u2014AH 149CLINICAL AFFILIATIONS Multiple clinical affiliations enrich the student's clinical training by providing exposure to different specimen types in the clinical environment.

The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal defense, reimbursement, risk management, accreditation, planning, and decision making. Health information management has assumed increased importance with the adv ent of prospective payment, health- care privacy legislation, corporate compliance, and the electronic health record. A career170 UNIVERSITY CATALOGin health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are suited for participation other than physical involvement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator ) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information in accordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrative studies, functions relative to health information, and patient-care evaluation. The health information administrator in a health-care facility will provide management leadership in planning and organizing the department, motiv ating and evaluating employees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employees or other personnel in the facility. In addition, strategic planning involvement for health information systems is an important function. OPPORTUNITIES While many health information administrators are employed in various areas of acute care facilities, others work in alternative delivery health-care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, software development companies, industrial establishments, government agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, accounting firms, or as consultants to skilled nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on evaluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost control, and other factors combine to require comprehensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment.

There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal w ell-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serv e professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The dietitian in administration is accountable for the food service system. In a health-care institution, s/he is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Opportunities may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improv e the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills.

Pendleton Heather A. Roese Arezou Salamat Ernest R. Schwab Diana Su-Erickson Heather J. Thomas Donna G. Thorpe Christine M. Wietlisbach Grenith J. Zimmerman The occupational therapist works with persons who find it difficult to cope with psychological or physiological dysfunction. The primary concern of the therapist is to stimulate changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist ev aluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent living skills regardless of disability or handicap.206 UNIVERSITY CATALOGEssential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients develop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retired persons. OPPORTUNITIES Occupational therapists practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand rehabilitation, work evaluation, and adult day care facilities). Occupational therapy professionals have a wide choice of positions (using varied therapeutic skills with individuals of varying age and disability) and opportunities for advancement.

Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary arrest; conditions brought on by shock; postoperativ e surgical complications; and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health-care team in medical centers, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involv ed in research and development of new and innovative care and equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possessing an awareness of cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patient education, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratory care professionals apply critical thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patient assessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high technology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilled respiratory care practitioners. PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION, LICENSURE, AND CREDENTIALING Respiratory Care Program accreditation is provided by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). Standards and guidelines published by CoARC must be met, relevant to general and respiratory care education and to ongoing program assessment and improv ement.

Dean, School of Behavioral Health296 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSchool Foundations The School of Behavioral Health\u2014includes the Departments of Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology; and the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies. The school offers master's and doctoral degree programs, as well as a number of postbaccalaureate and postdegree certificates. These programs equip graduates with the leading edge know ledge and practice experiences necessary for careers in behavioral health practice, research, or administration. PHILOSOPHY The School of Behavioral Health is grounded by a deep commitment to the Univ ersity's mission to further the teaching and healing ministries of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is viewed as a lifelong journey of faith and learning underpinned by a bio-psycho-social-spiritual perspective, which assumes that wholeness is achieved when all subsystems affecting human needs are understood and in balance. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, and human relationships that enable individuals to experience resiliency and live meaningful lives. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity and to God. In the School of Behavioral Health, these purposes are achieved through academic programs\u2014including research, clinical practice, and global learning experiences that engage faculty and students in the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and quest for wholeness. Because these pursuits are served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their fields of study and participate with the faculty in the process by which know ledge is created and applied. The end result is firm adherence to the global traditions of Loma Linda Univ ersity through scholarly and practice pursuits that aim to strengthen the effectiv eness of behavioral health practice and research to improve the quality of life of individuals and communities around the world. GOALS The School of Behavioral Health attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly and professional careers in the behavioral health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Fostering the integration of science and practice in the service of humankind. LEARNING OUTCOMES AND ASSESSMENT Supporting these goals, the School of Behavioral Health has adopted the Loma Linda Univ ersity student learning outcomes: Students understand and apply the University's philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives Students understand the importance of integrating the University's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives Students demonstrate critical thinkingSchool Foundations 297 Students demonstrate effective communication skills in English Students demonstrate effective use of technology appropriate to the discipline Students understand the importance of embracing and serving a diverse world Students demonstrate the importance of collaborating with others within and across disciplines Students develop a commitment to discovery and lifelong learning. The School of Behavioral Health supports the realization of the Univ ersity's learning outcomes through the curricula of its degree programs by providing students with content and activ e learning experiences that reflect the current practice and professional knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes needed for competent practice in behavioral health, including, but not limited to: Professional and personal self-care Ethical and professional standards of conduct and behavior Legal and statutory mandates affecting practice Clinical knowledge shared and specific to disciplines Therapeutic and reflective use of self Analytical methods supporting scholarship and the integration of science and practice in the development of new knowledge and improved services Professional communication and presentation skills Strengths perspectives supporting wellness, recovery, and antistigma Integration of spirituality and cultural competency Integration of behavioral health into primary health care Global context of behavioral health practice Collegial and collaborative team practice Commitment to continuous professional development, service, and lifelong learning The assessment of the University's student learning outcomes is integrated into the specific program and department criteria and methods used to address professional accreditation assessment requirements. Where possible, these data are used to support the dev elopment of school-wide metrics. MISSION Operationalizing this philosophy, the mission of the School of Behavioral Health is to provide graduate-level education that prepares competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals who possess the knowledge, values, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole person care in behavioral health practice, research, and servant leadership.298 UNIVERSITY CATALOGApplication and Admissions APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Application procedure 1.

New students are required to pass a background check before they register for classes. GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Admission requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Behavioral Health's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point av erage of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, someApplication and Admissions 299students with an overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior y ears are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with application for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than fiv e years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Web site at <ets.org/gre>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study.

Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Behavioral Health may request transfer to a different program or a more advanced degree level by contacting the School of Behavioral Health Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. English-language competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensiv e American Language Institute prior to entering their program, because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Behavioral Health Admissions Office. If the aw ard of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that hav e been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Behavioral Health and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits.300 UNIVERSITY CATALOGConcurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Behavioral Health program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs discussed in the next paragraph. Combined degrees Students may not be admitted to a School of Behavioral Health program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The School of Behavioral Health offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an advisor who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B (3.0) grade point av erage, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). MASTER OF ARTS/MASTER OF SCIENCE/MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, ev aluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. However, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but these must be remov ed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this Univ ersity. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serv e as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Behavioral Health to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited.Application and Admissions 301Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (nev er less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their advisors to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as well as degree completion options and timelines. Minimum required grade point average The required minimum grade point average is B (3.0) on all work for the master's degree. This average must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade on all work accepted for transfer and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. In some cases, programs have specified higher or additional requirements. Students should consult with their particular program of study. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in program guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The student receiv es a copy of the committee's recommendation. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter.302 UNIVERSITY CATALOGCandidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A ) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Behavioral Health for candidacy for the master 's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually adv anced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Behavioral Health. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (courses numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensiv e preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Behavioral Health or to a program in the School of Behavioral Health and to a professional school in the University is required. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG. THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school office in final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the Univ ersity Library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies.Application and Admissions 303DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Advisor and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Behavioral Health requires advisors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually at the beginning of the graduate experience at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serv es as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Behavioral Health. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullified eight years from the date of course completion. To assure currency in the content, nullified courses may be revalidated\u2014upon successful petition\u2014through reading, conference, written reports, or examination. Residence The School of Behavioral Health requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program.304 UNIVERSITY CATALOGDuring residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per w eek is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue for limited periods at special facilities studies not av ailable at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Behavioral Health. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the field or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Minimum required grade point average Students must maintain a grade point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the doctorate. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B av erage on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this Univ ersity, computed separately. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CA TALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final y ear of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until they have: Demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; Completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation.Application and Admissions 305Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done during the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done during the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prev ent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A ) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's advisor and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered betw een 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines.306 UNIVERSITY CATALOGCOMBINED DEGREES PROGRAMS A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Behavioral Health and a professional school in the Univ ersity. The combined degrees programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, the student must hav e a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Behavioral Health; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more y ears (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Behavioral Health requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Behavioral Health or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. The following combined degrees programs are offered in conjunction with the School of Behavioral Health. (See Combined Degrees Programs at the end of Section III.) Marital and Family Therapy with Clinical Ministry (M.S./M.A.) Social Policy and Social Research with Biomedical and Clinical Ethics (Ph.D./M.A.) Social Work with Criminal Justice (M.S.W./M.S.) Social Work with Gerontology (M.S.W./M.S.) Social Work with Social Policy and Social Research (M.S.W./Ph.D.)Application and Admissions 307Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Behavioral Health prepares the school-specific Policies and Procedures Manual , which is provided to all School of Behavioral Health students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this manual.308 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAcademic Information CONDITIONS OF REGISTRATION, RESIDENCE, ATTENDANCE Academic residence A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree, which is nev er less than one academic quarter. A year of residence is defined as three quarters of academic work. A student is in full-time residence if registered for at least 8 units. A maximum of 12 units may be taken without special petition to the dean of the School of Behavioral Health, unless the student is enrolled in an approved block-registration program or the program requirements specify otherwise. TRANSFER CREDITS Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this Univ ersity that earns less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that hav e been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. A candidate who holds a master's degree or presents its equivalent by transcript may receive credit up to 20 percent of the total units for the degree, subject to the consent of the dean and the department chair involv ed. In such instances, the transfer student is not relieved of residence requirements at this University. Students should also review the requirements of in their program of study as some professional degree programs require grades higher than a B (3.0) for transfer courses, and may restrict the courses and/or experiences that may be transferred from other academic institutions. If permitted for transfer, credit for practicum experiences is allow ed only where university credit has been received for equivalent experiences. Credit for life and/or work experiences cannot be used to meet the requirements in any degree or certificate program in the School of Behavioral Health. ADVANCED STANDING Advanced standing is a designation used in specific professional degree programs to address possible content redundancy between levels of degrees available within those professions. Evaluation of eligibility for advanced standing is program specific when specific conditions are met. Students should review the availability of advanced standing in their program. Academic variances are used to document the availability of advanced standing. ACADEMIC, PROFESSIONAL, AND CLINICAL PROBATION Continued enrollment in a professional degree program or certificate is contingent upon a student's continued satisfactory academic, professional, and clinical performance. Any student whose performance in any of these three areas falls below the requirements of their program, the school, or university will be placed on one or more of these types of probation. Academic probation Degree students whose overall grade point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation who fail to earn a 3.0 for the next quarter or who fail to hav e an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 after two quarters may be dismissed from school. Students enrolled in postbaccalaureate certificate programs should review the G.P.A. requirements of these programs, which may differ from G.P.A. requirements for degree programs.Academic Information 309Professional performance probation All students enrolled in professional programs are required to adhere to the professional and ethical standards set forth by their disciplines, the school, and university. Any student whose performance is evaluated to fall below these requirements will be placed on professional performance probation. The continued enrollment for the next quarter of a student on professional probation is subject to the recommendation of the department and approval by the school's Academic Standards Committee. Any student whose professional performance falls below these minimum requirements for two quarters (consecutive or dispersed) will be dismissed from the school. Students obtain copies of the ethical and professional performance standards set forth by their disciplines through their academic programs. The professional performance requirements for the School of Behavioral Health are included in the school's \"Policies and Procedures Manual,\" which is provided to each student. The Univ ersity's conduct and behavior expectations are provided in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . Clinical probation The successful completion of a clinical (or administrative) practicum is an essential requirement of professional degree programs. A student who receives an Unsatisfactory (U) in any segment or quarter of a practicum requirement is automatically placed on clinical probation. The continued enrollment for the next quarter, term, or rotation segment of a student on probation or clinical probation is subject to the recommendation of the department and approval by the school's Academic Standards Committee. A student who receives a U grade for a second segment or quarter (consecutive or dispersed) of practicum will be dismissed from the school. Students obtain copies of the clinical and professional performance requirements for their degree through their academic programs. The clinical and professional performance requirements for the School of Behavioral Health are included in the school's \"Policies and Procedures Manual,\" which is provided to each student.

DEPARTMENT The Child Life Specialist Program is housed in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences\u2014along with the Counseling Program, the Family Studies Program, and the doctoral program in Marital and Family Therapy. MISSION STATEMENT Loma Linda University's mission of whole person health care guides the faculty in working collaboratively with the purpose of transforming lives through education, research, clinical training, and community service. Students are invited to join with faculty and staff in supporting the Univ ersity's values of compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity, and humility. These attributes are depicted by the Good Samaritan statue centrally located on the campus, which contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. Amid the rich cultural heritage of this academic community, degrees offered in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences are the foundation upon which to develop new and more nurturing ways of being with others. ACCREDITATION Loma Linda University's academic programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).314 UNIVERSITY CATALOGTHE CHILD LIFE PROFESSION Child life specialists are experts in the field of child development. They promote effective coping through play, preparation, education, and self-expression activities. Child life specialists provide emotional support for families and encourage optimum development of children facing a broad range of challenging experiences, particularly those related to health care and hospitalization. Understanding that a child's well-being depends on the support of the family, child life specialists provide information, support, and guidance to parents, siblings, and other family members. They also play a vital role in educating caregivers, administrators, and the general public about the needs of children under stress (Child Life Council <childlife.org>). THE PROGRAM Certification for the child life profession Through the Child Life Council, the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential w as developed to increase the proficiency of child life professionals by identifying a body of know ledge, uniform and improved standards of practice, and ethical conduct while enhancing the status and credibility of the profession. The requirements for certification are based on academic and internship experience and successful completion of an examination process (Child Life Council < childlife.org>). Learning outcomes Upon graduation, students will: Demonstrate the ability to represent and communicate child life practice and psychosocial issues of infants, children, youth, and families. Be knowledgeable of child development and family systems theory. Demonstrate the ability to work collaboratively in diverse settings. Be eligible to obtain the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential administered by the Child Life Council. Be knowledgeable of legal and ethical standards of the profession. Professional experience Students will participate in supervised clinical training at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital and various hospitals located in the United States. A 100-hour practicum and 500-hour internship are required to complete the master's degree or certificate.

CHERYL SIMPSON, Program Director FACULTY Winetta Baker Ian P. Chand Brian Distelberg Curtis Fox Douglas Huenergardt Carmen Knudson-Martin Michelle Minyard-Widmann Mary Moline Cheryl Simpson Randall Walker Jackie Williams-Reade DEPARTMENT OF COUNSELING AND FAMILY SCIENCES The Master of Science degree in counseling is housed in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences and is designed in accordance with the department's vision of transforming relationships. In both the clinical counseling specialization and the school counseling specialization, faculty are committed to the mission of facilitating wholeness by promoting health, healing, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, professional training, community service, and global outreach. The call to service In the heart of campus, the University's commitment to service is memorialized in the Good Samaritan sculpture that contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. As counseling needs are more openly recognized and accepted across cultures, students and faculty are called to serv e together in local and global communities. Loma Linda University's relationships around the world continue to create unique opportunities for students to join in this global partnership through practicum experiences and internships. COUNSELING\u2014M.S. The Master of Science degree in counseling is a dual-track program requiring 90 quarter credits of academic course work and a minimum of 9 units of field experience. Beyond the core courses, students are required to choose the licensed professional clinical counseling (LPCC) or the school counseling (PPS) specialization to complete their M.S. degree. Students may choose to specialize in clinical and school counseling and can complete these specializations within their 90-unit degree program. If only one specialization is chosen, students must complete advisor-approved electives to bring their degree total to 90 academic credits. In addition to the academic requirements, graduates must complete field experience as outlined in the curriculum for their chosen specialization.Counseling\u2014BH 321Clinical Counseling (LPCC) Specialization Licensed professional clinical counseling (LPCC) is established as one of the clinical mental health professions throughout the United States that qualifies psychotherapists to work in public and priv ate facilities and to set up an independent practice. The Board of Behavioral Science that regulates master 's- level licensure for mental health professions in California posts the legal definition of the profession as it appears below. Professional clinical counseling means the application of counseling interventions and psychotherapeutic techniques to identify and remediate cognitive, mental, and emotional issues\u2014 including personal growth, adjustment to disability, crisis intervention, and psychosocial and environmental problems. Professional clinical counseling includes conducting assessment for the purpose of establishing counseling goals and objectives to empower individuals to deal adequately with life situations, reduce stress, experience growth, change behavior, and make well-informed rational decisions (California Business and Professions Code Section 4999.20). Complete information regarding scope of license for LPCC is located on the Board of Behavioral Sciences Web site <bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lpc/lpc_scope_practice.pdf>. California standards for LPCC are consistent with national standards for clinical counseling licensure, making it easier for LPCCs to be granted reciprocity when they mov e throughout the country. Equivalent licensure in other states may be titled licensed professional counselor (LPC), licensed clinical mental health counselor (LCMHC), or similar titles. School Counseling (PPS) Specialization School counselors serve as leaders of counseling programs within the educational system that address academic, career, and personal/social needs of students. They serv e as counselors and advocates for students, collaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Combining the school counselor certification with clinical counselor licensure is an excellent professional path that enhances counseling competence and professional opportunities. Additional information about the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling is found at the California Commission on T eacher Credentialing Internet address <ctc.ca.gov>.

Loma Linda University's mission, \"To make man whole,\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice, within a behavioral health framework, can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The criminal justice program is comprised of two distinct but ov erlapping areas that deal with different issues: forensic mental health and clinical criminology. This multidisciplinary approach takes into consideration the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities; and provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system in a behavioral health context.. CRIMINAL JUSTICE\u2014M.S. Mission The mission of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically and analytically about the problems of crime and social control in contemporary society, to work with the legal system as it relates to mental health issues, and to work within a forensic mental health framework. Program objectives Students will demonstrate: The ability to integrate and utilize knowledge of social science and criminological theory in the application to problems of criminal justice and/or behavioral health settings. An understanding of the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency. An understanding of the structure of the American criminal justice system. An understanding of the ethical principles that guide the concepts of justice and fairness within professional criminal justice/forensic mental health practice. The ability to use empirically based research to analyze and critically evaluate practice and criminal justice policy in order to effect system change. An understanding of major mental illness and treatment interventions within a forensic mental health framework. An understanding of the differences between retributive and restorative justice approaches in addressing the effects of crime. General overview The 48-quarter unit program begins with 24 units of core course work required for all students. Course work during the first year of study is divided into three professional areas of study, which include:Criminal Justice\u2014BH 327criminal justice, religion, ethics, and social research methods. A t the end of the first year, students select their concentration area of policy, planning, and administration or forensic mental health\u2014each requiring 15 units of concentration course work and specific selectives. To complete the program, the student has two options: 1. Nonthesis: Professional practica (540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar) and 9 units of didactic selectives; OR 2. Thesis: 6 units of academic thesis and 3 units of didactic selectives. Concentration descriptions Policy and administration\u2014 Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coordination of governmentally operated criminal and/or juvenile justice systems. Students acquire an appreciation for working with community entities to develop, coordinate, and evaluate these systems in response to community needs. In addition, students develop an understanding of the policy-planning process and the role that criminal or juvenile justice planning councils perform in consensually revising or creating policies aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal and juvenile justice systems. Forensic mental health\u2014 Forensic mental health is a specialized branch of professional practice in which the clinical and criminal justice worlds overlap. Students choosing this area focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice systems who have serious emotional disorders and/or severe mental illness, and may also present with co-occurring substance abuse. Students gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming within a forensic mental health framework. In addition, this context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization v ersus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the dev elopment and implementation of assertive community treatment plans. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. Liberal arts preparation This degree program builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. Consistent with this view, the program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying for the M.S. degree in criminal justice. A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0 Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.)24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related criminal justice classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum).328 UNIVERSITY CATALOGUnit values represent a quarter system of measurement.

CARRIE ESKAY, Program Director FACULTY Beverly Buckles Carrie Eskay Kim Freeman G. Victoria Jackson Viola Lindsey Froylana Miller A complete list of part-time and voluntary faculty can be viewed on the department's Web site. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary-multidimensional study of aging and aging processes. It combines the study of physical, mental, social, and spiritual changes that affect individuals as they age. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge and skills required for competent practice, with considerable attention given to understanding the social, cultural, and economic factors that affect services for this population. The study of older adults has become increasingly important with the aging of the general population. In the next twenty years, the older adult population is projected to double\u2014resulting in a wide spectrum of needs facing this population, which necessitates competently educated professionals. MISSION The mission of the Gerontology Program is to provide graduate-level education for future and current professionals who are dedicated to enhancing the lives of older adults through advanced, evidenced- based interventions at the micro, macro, and mezzo levels of practice. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate human behavior and developmental theories of aging, incorporating a biopsychosocial-spiritual orientation to geriatric practice. Students will demonstrate the ability to use research in evaluating the effectiveness of practice and programs in achieving intended outcomes for older adults. Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate into practice an understanding of the life experiences and unique needs of older adults belonging to specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic groups; of men and women; and of those with different sexual orientations. Students will demonstrate knowledge of professional ethics to assist older adults who have diverse cultural, spiritual, and ethnic values and beliefs. Students will demonstrate the ability to complete a comprehensive assessment of biopsychosocial- spiritual factors that affect older adults' well-being. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the policies that shape and regulate the continuum of care and services available to older adults.Gerontology\u2014BH 349 Students will demonstrate knowledge of the importance of current issues in gerontology and the importance of the relationship of gerontology to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, nursing, and public health. Students will demonstrate the ability to utilize and integrate a strengths-based perspective, acknowledging the unique and special gifts and talents present in the older adult population. GENERAL OVERVIEW The 48-unit program begins with 22 units of core course work required for all students. Courses during the first year of study are divided into four professional areas: social science theory, religion and ethics, practice, and research methods. At the end of the first year, the student selects a concentration area (policy, planning, and administration; or clinical services) requiring 15 units of concentration-specific course work. Regardless of the concentration students choose, they are given either a thesis or a nonthesis (professional practicum) option. 1. Thesis: Students who choose the thesis option complete 6 research-related units and 5 units of selectives. 2. Nonthesis: Students choosing the internship option complete a practical orientation, 540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar, and 11 units of didactic selectiv es. CONCENTRATION DESCRIPTION Policy, planning, and administration: Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coordination of services for older adults. Students acquire an appreciation for the unique policy and systems structure influencing the delivery of services to older adults. Within this framework, students develop an understanding of the issues and challenges in creating and sustaining responsive systems of care for older adults and their families. Clinical services: Students opting for the clinical services concentration develop knowledge and skills in locating and providing resources, services, and opportunities for older adults and their families; as w ell as acquiring knowledge that supports enhancing the problem-solving and coping skills of older adults and their caregivers. Students gain an appreciation for the social support factors and community systems that create opportunities or exacerbate problems in daily living. Students develop an understanding of the issues that impact the creation of effective systems of care and responsive social policies. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about the multidimensional issues in gerontology that will provide students with a deeper understanding of policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. LIBERAL ARTS PREPARATION A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 units English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0 units350 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) 24.0-32.0 units Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W . degree classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). Unit values represent the quarter system of measurement. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS This program follows the admission requirements of the School of Behavioral Health, as follows: 1.

THE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY PROFESSION Marriage and family therapy is a distinct international mental health profession based on the premise that relationships are fundamental to the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) evaluate and treat mental and emotional disorders and other health and behavioral problems; and address a wide array of relationship issues within the context of families and larger systems. The federal government has designated marital and family therapy a coreMarital and Family Therapy\u2014BH 363mental health profession\u2014along with psychiatry, psychology, social work, and psychiatric nursing. All fifty states also support and regulate the profession by licensing or certifying marriage and family therapists. ACCREDITATION Loma Linda University's academic programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T. degree curricula are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body associated with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. Accreditation by COAMFTE means that students meet national standards for marriage and family therapy education. This accreditation facilitates graduates' eligibility to practice in California as w ell as across the country.

Data on student outcomes are collected through aggregate scores on the following: quarterly evaluations of clinical competency and results of qualifying examinations and clinical demonstrations, annual student activity reports on clinical and scholarly activities, client session and outcome data, and exit surveys and interviews of students at graduation. Alumni surveys are also conducted every two years to track graduates' attainment of marital and family therapy licensure, data on employment, and feedback regarding how well the program prepared graduates for their job responsibilities. The program faculty also maintains regular contact with community agencies and educational institutions in the region to obtain input into curriculum planning and improv ements in clinical training. CERTIFICATES The Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers certificate programs that can be combined with the Ph.D. or D.M.F.T. degrees to broaden a student's marital and family therapy skills and marketability. Students wishing to add specializations in the following areas must formally apply and be accepted into the desired certificate program(s). Prior to application, the student is advised to consult with the coordinator of the certificate program. Child Life Specialist Certificate Clinical Mediation Certificate Drug and Alcohol Counseling Certificate Family Counseling Certificate364 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Family Life Education Certificate Medical Family Therapy Certificate School Counseling Certificate: California Pupil Personnel Services Credential (PPS) (open to counseling and MFT students only) CORE IDEAS GUIDING THE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY DOCTORAL PROGRAMS Relational systems : People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change, therefore, occurs in the context of family, community, and interpersonal relationships. This program focuses on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness : The program encourages wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at ev ery level. Social forces : The program is guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on: research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the Southern California region; the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, and the effects of the changing health-care system and of medical technology; as well as collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Healing power of relationships : As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and healing are enhanced and the opportunity for making positiv e contributions maximized. Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relationship and community involvement skills such that they can cocreate an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity : Congruent with an appreciation for the importance of social forces is an interest in and respect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts\u2014such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic status\u2014result in a wide v ariety of meanings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The program seeks to create a div erse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involv ed to learn from the richness of multiple perspectives. Empirical process : The program encourages clinical work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to dev elop their capacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning; as well as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in therapy, program development and evaluation, and research. Education and prevention : Connections at family, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The program emphasizes helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality : This program sees spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The program places strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings.Marital and Family Therapy\u2014BH 365Global focus : The mission of the program reaches beyond the local and national lev els to the international community. This includes collaboration and experience with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families.

The policy assures that at least half of all interim master 's degree units and 60 percent of doctoral academic credit will be earned at Loma Linda, while enabling cooperative relationships with other accredited programs.Marital and Family Therapy\u2014BH 367Guidelines Advanced standing may be granted for previous course work equivalent in content and scope to required counseling and family sciences courses. This reduces the number of units to be taken at LLU. Determination of advanced standing is based on the following guidelines: 1. Residency requirements a. Interim master's degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 45 units for an interim master's degree earned in combination with a CFS doctoral degree. b. Doctoral degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 60 units for a Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy, Ph.D. degree in family studies, or Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F.T.). 2. Determination of Equivalency a. Courses applied to advanced standing must be graduate-level courses earned at an accredited institution. No credit may be applied for grades lower than B-. b. Courses completed in programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marital and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) or Certified Family Life Education (CLFE) programs approved by the National Council on Family Relations will be reviewed as a whole in relation to CFS program requirements. It is anticipated that comparable course content from these schools may be divided into different course configurations than LLU. Students wishing advanced standing based on units earned at other institutions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with COAMFTE or NCFR standards. c. Advanced standing is not granted for religion courses. d. Doctoral courses taken more than five years previously may be considered for advanced standing only if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis and the student can demonstrate current knowledge. e. Approved prior client contact hours may also be applied. See CFS doctoral handbook for approval process. f. A master's degree in marital and family therapy is a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree in MFT and the D.M.F.T. degree. Courses earned in completion of this degree are not eligible for advanced standing. 3. Approval Process Students seeking advanced standing should meet with their program director prior to admission or within the first two quarters of study and supply copies of each sy llabus of prior course work. Following course review, the program director will write a letter to the School of Behavioral Health that outlines which courses from previous institutions qualify for adv anced standing and which equivalent CFS courses will be waived. The letter will specify how many units and client contact hours the student will need to complete the degree. Rather than completing separate academic variances for each course, the student will submit one academic variance accompanied by the program director's letter outlining the advanced standing.368 UNIVERSITY CATALOGFinancial assistance Students who are accepted into the Ph.D. degree curriculum in marital and family therapy may apply for work-study and department-funded research, teaching, and administrative assistantships awarded by the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences.

Morton Holly Morrell Cameron Neece Jason Owen David A. Vermeersch LLU ASSOCIATE FACULTY Jerry W. Lee Helen Marshak MISSION STATEMENT The mission of Loma Linda University and Loma Linda University Medical Center is \"to make man whole\" through the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ. This mission, combined with the University's values of compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity, and humility are central to the Department of Psychology and its programs. The Department of Psychology seeks to adv ance the institutional mission, both nationally and internationally, through academic, research, and practice activities related to behavioral health. Loma Linda is part of a worldwide network of health-care systems, and is uniquely connected and poised to participate globally through its numerous clinics, hospitals, health-care facilities, and educational institutions throughout the world. This globalized health-care orientation provides expanded training opportunities for students who have a passion for a broader life experience in assisting with the health-care needs of diverse peoples around the world. This broader experience may also be realized through the Loma Linda International Trauma Team, which has provided trauma response services to Haiti, China, South America, Africa, and the U.S.\u2014to name a few. Students may be invited to join the team to help with providing services and assistance, thereby providing them with v aluable training related to global health. Students interested in and selected for these opportunities may be required take courses such as PSYC 694: Health Disparities, relevant courses; and, if needed, a384 UNIVERSITY CATALOGbasic language course related to the country of anticipated involv ement. Participation in such an experience would be integrated into the student's program so as not to impede his/her academic progress. The School of Behavioral Health's Department of Psychology offers a combination of innovative training opportunities in clinical psychology. Both the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in clinical psychology are APA-accredited. The Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology has been informed by the traditional scientist-practitioner model, which emphasizes training in research and clinical practice. The Doctor of Psychology degree, influenced by the practitioner-scholar model, emphasizes training in clinical practice based on the understanding and application of scientific psychological principles and research. The specific objective of the APA-accredited Ph.D. degree program in clinical psychology is to train its students to be scientist-practitioners\u2014which, according to the Loma Linda Univ ersity Ph.D. clinical model, means that they will be given: a solid academic foundation (minimum accepted grade is B or Satisfactory (S), high-level training in the empirical methods of science so that they are capable of conducting independent and original research, the skills to be highly competent clinicians for whom research and practice constantly inform each other, and preparation for academic careers. Among the outcomes measures used to determine the clinical Ph.D. degree program's success in achieving the above-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and successful completion of the comprehensive examination. 2. Training in empirical methods of science\u2014master's degree thesis; a doctoral degree dissertation; presentations, publications, and grants; research and teaching assistantships; teaching positions in area colleges/universities; and membership in scientific/professional organizations. 3.

Application of research design and methods appropriate to the doctoral project; involvement in community-based program development, evaluation, and consultation; membership in professional organizations; and passing the national licensing examination. The Psychology Program emphasizes research and practice based on the scientific principles and methods of psychology and related disciplines. This emphasis takes place within the context of an approach to human health and welfare that is consistent with the institutional motto, \"To make man whole.\" A systematic attempt is made, through the wholeness component of the curriculum, to promote an understanding of human behavior in relation to the psychological, physical, spiritual, and social/ cultural aspects of being human. In this way, the Psychology Program provides, in addition to the traditional training, a positive environment for the study of cultural, social, and spiritual issues relevant to psychological research and practice in contemporary American society and around the world.

SIMPSON, Program Director FACULTY Winetta Baker Ian P. Chand Brian Distelberg Curtis Fox Douglas Huenergardt Carmen Knudson-Martin Michelle Minyard-Widmann Mary Moline Cheryl Simpson Randall Walker Jackie Williams-Reade DEPARTMENT OF COUNSELING AND FAMILY SCIENCES The School Counseling Program certificate is one of two options in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences that qualify a graduate for the California pupil personnel pervices (PPS) credential in school counseling. Students pursuing the M. S. degree curriculum in the Counseling Program may choose school counseling as a single specialization embedded in the degree program, or combine it with the licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) specialization. Students in Marital and Family Therapy Program may add the School Counseling Program certificate to their M.S. degree curriculum. Successful completion of the certificate, including passing scores on all sections of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), will qualify graduates for the California PPS credential in school counseling. As with all department programs, the School Counseling Program certificate is designed in accordance with the department's vision of transforming relationships. Faculty are committed to the mission of facilitating wholeness by promoting health, healing, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, professional training, community service, and global outreach THE CALL TO SERVICE In the heart of campus, the University's commitment to service is memorialized in the Good Samaritan sculpture that contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. As counseling needs are more openly recognized and accepted across cultures, students and faculty are called to serv e together in local and global communities. Loma Linda University's relationships around the world continue to create unique opportunities for students to join in global partnership through field experience. PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING Professional school counselors are leaders of counseling programs within the educational system. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Counselors address academic, career, and personal/social needs through their work as advocates for K-12 students,396 UNIVERSITY CATALOGcollaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. Employment as a school counselor in public schools requires the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling. Combining the school counselor certification with licensure in clinical mental health is an excellent professional path that enhances competence and professional opportunities. Additional information is located on the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing internet address <ctc.ca.gov>. ACCREDITATION Loma Linda University's academic programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The pupil personnel services (PPS) credential curriculum in school counseling is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). Additional PPS information can be obtained by going to the CTC Web site at <ctc.ca.gov>. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Students pursuing the M.S. degree in the Counseling Program do not need to apply to the School Counseling Program (certificate) to qualify for the PPS credential because the curriculum is a specialization option within their degree program. Students pursuing the M.S. degree in the Marital and Family Therapy Program must complete the standard online application to enroll in the School Counseling Program (certificate) and are advised to consult with the certificate program director prior to initiating application submission. As with all programs in the School of Behavioral Health, applicants must meet admission requirements as outlined in the Loma Linda Univ ersity CATALOG and give evidence of academic ability, professional comportment, and mature judgment. Applicants who meet these requirements as well as the published deadlines for the following terms, may be admitted during Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring quarters.

On-campus group interviews are scheduled for early March and late April; other on-campus or telephone interviews are scheduled for individuals as indicated.School Counseling\u2014BH 397DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS The School Counseling Program certificate is paired with the M.S. degree at Loma Linda Univ ersity. An approved master's degree is required for state credentialing. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the certificate and receive a University recommendation for the school counseling credential until all degree and certificate requirements are completed. This applies to students pursuing the M.S. degree in the Counseling Program (credential option) and the M.S.degree in the Marital and Family Therapy Program (school counseling certificate option). Required courses for the certificate/credential program are listed at the end of this narrative. CERTIFICATE OF CLEARANCE PRIOR TO FIELD PLACEMENT School Counseling Program students must obtain a certificate of clearance (COC) from the state of California before they are allowed to begin field experience. The COC requires verification of a current TB test and a LiveScan in accordance with state guidelines. The process can take six-to-eight weeks. PRACTICUM AND FIELD EXPERIENCE Field experience requirements for the certificate program include 100 hours of prefield practicum, followed by 600 hours of field experience. For students in a clinical master's degree, prefield hours are met earlier in the program through clinical placements. In addition, 200 of the required 600 hours of school counseling field experience can be elective hours from clinical training. The remaining 400 hours must be completed as a school counselor trainee in public schools, ev enly divided between two different grade blocks (e.g., elementary school, middle school, or high school). CALIFORNIA TEST OF BASIC SKILLS (CBEST) Candidates for the school counseling certificate must take the California Basic Educational Skills T est (CBEST) within the first two quarters following admission to the program and must pass all sections of the CBEST before the University can recommend them for the school counseling credential.

Victoria Jackson Sigrid James Viola Lindsey Froylana Heredia-Miller Susanne Montgomery A complete list of part-time and voluntary faculty can be viewed on the department Web site. The profession of social work centers on improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full, productive participation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree offered by the Social Work Program (M.S.W.) in the School of Behavioral Health emphasizes an ecological perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system in relation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole\"; and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the development of the foundation curriculum, professional concentrations, and selection of practicum sites for the Social Work Program. MISSION The mission of the Social Work Program at Loma Linda University is to provide graduate-level education that prepares competent, ethical, and compassionate social work professionals who possess the knowledge, values, attitudes, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole person care in advanced practice and to leadership in behavioral health institutions and agencies. GOALS The goals of the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) are to: Provide a graduate curriculum that infuses the knowledge, ethics, values, and skills expected of professional social work practitioners.

ACCREDITATION The Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to provide graduate-level social work education. LIBERAL ARTS PREPARATION Students in the M.S.W degree program are required to have a broad liberal arts preparation. A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas is reviewed as part of the admissions process. Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20-24 units English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9-13 units Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) 24-32 units406 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudents not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W . degree classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before admission to the M.S.W degree program. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Following are the admission requirements for the Social Work Program: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college (official transcripts are evidence of courses completed). The department assesses the liberal arts preparation of each of its applicants in the balance of course work, in three liberal arts (see Liberal Arts Preparation). Applicants must submit a completed application\u2014including a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or university transcripts, and at least three letters of recommendation (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale). Special consideration may be given to applicants with grade point averages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant improvement. Applicants whose cumulative grade point average does not meet the minimum requirements stated above may receive further consideration for admission to the Social Work Program by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two y ears of related employment and/or volunteer experiences. Work and volunteer experiences must be verified by employer/supervisor statements on official agency stationery. Further consideration will also be given to individuals who provide evidence of additional certifications and/or training that illustrate commitment to a career in social work. Anyone who is admitted to the Social Work Program with a cumulative G.P.A. below 3.0 will be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning assistance program. Applicants must show evidence of professional compatibility, personal qualifications, and motivation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the department's admissions committee. Evaluation criteria for the interview include: verbal communication skills, critical thinking ability, values congruent with the social work profession, appreciation of human diversity, evidence of reflective learning, and comportment. No academic credit is given for life experience or previous work experience for any part for the Social Work degree program. CURRICULUM The M.S.W. degree consists of 78 units of didactic course work and 21 units of professional practica experience. Students must maintain a program grade point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0Social Work\u2014BH 407scale) and meet the knowledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for all courses is a B- (2.7). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selective courses must be repeated. Students are financially responsible for the cost of repeating courses in which grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. GENERAL OVERVIEW The program begins with the professional foundation content (first-y ear courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during the first year of study are divided into: human behavior in a cross-cultural environment, social welfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research, global social work practice, and field practicum. These areas are strengthened by the integration of social work values and ethics, as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppression). The advanced curriculum of the program is divided into four subdivisions: 1. Conjoining curriculum and processes\u2014further integrating the foundational first year with the program's advanced curriculum; 2. Advanced curriculum nucleus\u2014includes course work common to all second-year students; 3. Core courses of the two concentrations\u2014clinical practice and policy, planning, and administration; and 4. Culminating curriculum and processes\u2014a capstone academic experience that facilitates the final stage of reflection and review in the development of the scholar-practitioner. Each of these four curricular subdivisions articulates through the progressiv e presentation and integration of knowledge, practice roles, and intervention modes to develop the depth and breadth of proficiency expected in advanced practice within health and mental health. PROGRAM OPTIONS Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time, two-year option; a three-year, part-time option; and option. APPROVAL OF COURSE TRANSFERS AND PRACTICUM ADVANCED STANDING FOR B.S.W. DEGREE STUDENTS Students who have received a B.S.W. degree from a CSWE-accredited program within the past five years are supported in eliminating possible areas of redundancy in their education through (a) eligibility to transfer foundation course work and (b) consideration for practicum adv anced standing. Upon approval, eligible B.S.W. degree students may transfer up to 31 quarter units for specified courses. Students receiving practicum advanced standing complete four consecutive quarters of an advanced practicum, including an integrative seminar. These additional options for B.S.W. degree students recognize the accomplishments in knowledge and skills that individuals receiving a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program possess. As such, students are not admitted into the M.S.W. degree program with preapproval of course transfers or practicum advanced standing. Instead, once students are accepted into either the full-time or one of the part-time options, those students meeting the designated degree requirements may apply for course408 UNIVERSITY CATALOGtransfers and evaluation of their practicum advanced standing. Receipt of course transfers and evaluation of practice maturity are treated as separate processes. Students should contact the department for more information. TRANSFER STUDENTS Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W. degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with University policy and program guidelines. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Social Work Program offers two concentrations for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; and policy, planning, and administration. Clinical practice concentration The clinical practice concentration requires mastery of advanced practice roles, modalities of intervention, and methods used in clinical social work. Study is required regarding the integration of advanced practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solving skills and techniques; as well as the impact of policy upon the availability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy, planning, and administration concentration represents a specialized study designed to prepare students for administrative roles in behavioral health organizations and institutions. As such, this concentration focuses on giving students understanding and skills in establishing and maintaining systems of care to assist individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in context of the life cycle, promoting social change in public systems of care, policy analysis, program planning and implementation, program evaluation, and human resources management. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNATES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the Social Work Program because these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another\u2014presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to adv anced social work practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. The emphasis of SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or 9 professional practica units) is on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills\u2014including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and interventionSocial Work\u2014BH 409capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspectiv e as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar (600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or 12 professional practica units) reflects students' choice of concentration and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced practice capabilities. More specifically, advanced professional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skills achieved during the first year of study. Research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. PROFESSIONAL PROCESSES AND COGNATES Three academic review processes take place during the first year of the Social Work Program. These are: 1. M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 units completed toward the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achiev e at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement, provide feedback, foster an environment of self-evaluation, and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Ultimately, the results of this review help both the student and faculty to develop learning objectives for the concentration year. Students who fail the qualifying review are notified in writing and are required to take SOWK 595: Professional Development (please note that this course is not covered by financial aid unless the student is enrolled in and maintains enrollments in four or more financial aid eligible units during the quarter in which SOWK 595 is taken). A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process.410 UNIVERSITY CATALOG3. Wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during the professional practicum and seminar experience. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development begins during the first year of study and culminates during the second year of study as the student completes the final quarter of SOWK 787A,B,C. This experience emphasizes the student's plans for employment, lifelong learning, and integration of the core values of Loma Linda University; and is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of the transitioning professional.

The School of Dentistry is an incredible institution with a legacy of excellence in education, research, and state-of-the-art patient care in a uniquely Christian environment. We were one of the first dental schools in the country to initiate a service-learning program that has earned international recognition. This is an exciting time to enter into dentistry thanks to transformativ e research, new technology, and the electronic information explosion. Through a collaborative process, our faculty are developing innovative new approaches to diagnose and treat oral disease, deliver the highest quality health care, and prepare a new generation of health-care providers and scientists. At Loma Linda, every day we work together to enrich people's lives through learning, discovering, and healing. The catalyst for serving others is embodied in our faculty-student relationships and our school motto: \"Service is our calling.\" Our mission to teach the next generation of dentists includes not only educating exemplary clinicians, but also to be compassionate, selfless, and excellent communicators. LLU School of Dentistry's achievements are a tribute to the University, our faculty, our students, our staff, and our alumni. People are our most precious asset, and teamwork is our winning formula. It is a pleasure to have you as a member of our team! Ronald J. Dailey, M.A., Ph.D. Dean, School of DentistryDean's Welcome 417School Foundations HISTORY A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to establish an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men w ere the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectiv es through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Sev enth-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that y ear at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Sev enth-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree w as developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of P eriodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960, Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period, the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New adv anced education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s, the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced education programs were initiated418 UNIVERSITY CATALOGin pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program w as established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for internationally-trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain adv anced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensiv e, twenty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than tw enty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. A preclinical laboratory was remodeled into a simulation laboratory in 2008. The laboratory included flat-panel monitors with access to the substantial digital resource library created by faculty. In 2009, the Department of Orthodontics and the advanced education program moved into new facilities designed as a model for providing student education and patient care in a digital world. The School of Dentistry continues to regularly expand the opportunities for enhanced student learning by improving physical facilities; making regular curricular modifications; and introducing new interactive, navigable, nonlinear digital education programs. OUR MISSION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ wherein: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound biologic principles. Patients receive competent care that is preventive in purpose, comprehensive in scope, and provided with compassion and respect. Faculty, students, and staff value patient relationship, respect diversity, and share responsibility by working together toward academic, professional, spiritual, and personal growth. Scholarly activity and research provide a foundation for evidence-based learning and enhance whole person care.

Applicants are expected to have taken the DAT within the previous two years, preferably not later than October of the year preceding expected matriculation. In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and understanding, the applicant should include recommended science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first y ear of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of div erse knowledge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. Electives can broaden the applicant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the individual's ability to think and express him-/ herself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to develop basic resources for the resolution of personal problems and the growth of self-understanding the student must have in order to understand and help associates. An applicant from a college or university outside the United States or Canada or from a nonaccredited college or university in the United States must complete a minimum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accredited college or university in the United States or Canada. This includes the required specific core sciences in the areas of biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics (all sciences must include laboratories). A grade of C or above in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS). The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before August 1 in order to be competitive. To be given consideration for the next entering class, the student's application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University (LLU). 1.AADSAS application. The AADSAS application is completed online by the applicant at adea.org. The Office of Admissions receives applications from AADSAS four weeks after they are submitted. 2.Supplemental application. The applicant then receives an e-mail invitation from LLU to complete an electronic supplemental application. 3.Supplemental application deadline. The applicant must return the completed supplemental application and materials within thirty days. This includes an essay specific to Loma Linda University, a photograph, and the application fee of $100. 4.Transcripts. Official transcripts must be sent to AADSAS. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official transcripts\u2014mailed directly from all colleges/universities to LLU\u2014are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. 5.References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. These must include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employ er; a character or religious reference, such as from a minister. If the applicant has attended a college or univ ersity that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional ev aluation, it is required that Loma Linda University be sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will430 UNIVERSITY CATALOGbe accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommendation letters must be sent to AADSAS. 6.Dental Admission Test. The applicant is required to complete and meet specific criteria related to performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test by October of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired. The student entering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission criteria. The committee reviews all scores on the test. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Linda University before an acceptance to the school will be issued. Test results should be sent to Loma Linda University, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 7.Interview. The applicant's records will be screened when the supplemental application, recommendations, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the school for a personal interview. An interview is required for admission. The interview provides an opportunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors, including communication skills, personal values, motivation, and commitment to goals of the profession; as well as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the interview, a tour of the school will be given by a current student in the program. 8.Observation. It is important that preprofessional students seek experience observing and assisting in a dental office in order to become familiar with the work of a dentist. Prior to interviewing, applicants are expected to complete a minimum of fifty hours of observ ation/work experience in a dental facility, ten of which must be done in a general practitioner 's office. 9.Acceptance. The accepted student receives an acceptance letter. Upon payment of the deposit, accepted students receive an e-mail that serves as a receipt, as well as information about how to access registration information. 10. Pre-entrance health requirements/Immunizations. It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to before the student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration. Forms to document the required immunizations are provided for the physician in the registration information made av ailable electronically to the student by LLUSD. In order to avoid having a hold placed on registration, the student is encouraged to return the documentation forms to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. For a complete list of required immunizations and tests, see Section II of this CA TALOG under the heading \"Health Care.\" Documentation verifying compliance with this requirement must be provided before registration can be completed. For further information, consult the Student Handbook , Section V\u2014University Policies\u2014Communicable disease transmission prevention policy; or contact the Student Health Service office at 909/558-8770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinical facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, the student is required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 11. Deposits. The student accepted into dentistry must submit a nonrefundable deposit of $1,000 to the Office of Admissions. All deposits become part of the first quarter 's tuition. Failure to submit this deposit will result in loss of the applicant's position in the class. A second nonrefundable deposit of $1,000 is due on May 1 in order to secure a place in the class. The remaining balance of the first quarter's tuition and fees is due no later than the day of matriculation in late September. If the applicant has submitted a completed application for financial aid by March 2, and if the StaffordGeneral Information 431application has been submitted by June 15, the final installment can be paid utilizing Univ ersity- assisted sources. 12. Financial requirement. Non-U.S. citizens and nonpermanent residents are required by U.S. immigration regulation to pay for their first year's tuition and fees before they can register for Autumn Quarter. In addition, they must provide documentary evidence of sufficient funds for their second year. International students will receive the necessary visa applications and registration information after they have submitted their $1,000 deposit and payment plan. 13. Financial aid.

The qualified applicant will meet, or will hav e the potential to meet, the following technical standards for entrance into all its programs. Cognition Students must have abilities which allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize for critical problem solving. Students must be able to comprehend three- dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully solv e clinical problems. Effective dental education requires students to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at integrated solutions. Sensory and perceptual abilities For learning to occur, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, smell, and somatic sensation. Specifically, students must be able to acquire information from written documents and to visualize information presented in images from papers, videos, and digital media\u2014including interpretation of radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistiv e devices. Sufficient visual acuity is required to read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Adequate visual and tactile skills are also necessary to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Students must be able to observe and describe changes in mood, activity, and posture in their patients, possessing skills in effective perception and understanding of nonverbal communications. Accurately noting verbal and nonverbal communication is essential when performing dental operations or administering medications. Communication abilities Students must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, faculty, staff, and other students. Specifically, students must be able to observe, hear, and speak to patients in order to elicit and provide information. In addition, they must have the ability to read and understand written communications and generate effective oral and written communications with all members of the health-care team. This includes the ability to discern when a matter is of a confidential nature in order to maintain confidentiality. Fine and gross motor skills Students need sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to provide general dental care and to perform palpation, percussion, auscultation and other diagnostic maneuv ers; basic laboratory tests; and diagnostic procedures. These actions require fine and gross muscular mov ements, coordination, and equilibrium. Individuals must be able to operate foot controls utilizing fine mov ements, operating high- or low-speed dental instruments to achieve accurate movements of less than one-half millimeter. Students must also have the capability to utilize dental hand instruments with tactile sense and precise control.438 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudents must be able to perform basic life support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, physically restrain patients who lack motor control, and position themselv es around the patient and dental chair. Behavioral and psychosocial abilities Students must possess the emotional stability and demonstrate the resilience required by a challenging educational program. Success requires use of good judgment, insight, self-motiv ation, self-assessment, and self-control; high achievement striving; and development of mature, sensitive, and effective personal relationships. It is imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical issues of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, and cultural sensitivity are all required personal qualities. Disabled applicants and students It is the policy of Loma Linda University to comply fully with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sect. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The school is committed to providing dental education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations\u2014to qualified students to the extent that such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the school requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Admissions Committee requires written documentation of the disability, which will be reviewed prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. Students requesting accommodations must follow the guidelines outlined in the Univ ersity's Disability Accommodation Policy. The Office for Student Affairs helps students requesting accommodations complete the required evaluation and assessment procedures. POLICIES FOR THIS SCHOOL The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook at <llu.edu/assets/central/handbook/documents/student-handbook.pdf>. PROFESSIONAL ETHICS Successful students should demonstrate behaviors and attributes in harmony with School of Dentistry's core values. The school seeks students who openly and enthusiastically align themselves with the following core values: Belief in God Spiritual maturity Care and compassion Service to others Commitment to excellence Critical thinking Respect for self and othersStudent Life 439 Ethical integrity Principled care Pursuit of knowledge Conscientiousness and industry Effective communication The school code of ethics expands and elaborates Loma Linda Univ ersity's standards of ethical conduct. Organized dentistry is proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential if dentistry is to continue to maintain its position of trust in society. The establishment of peer review committees, ethics committees, codes of ethics, and other regulatory and/or advisory processes and standards within the profession indicate a vital and continuing concern for maintaining high standards of integrity. The School of Dentistry is a partner in this process where future professionals are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes consistent with the highest goals of the profession. The school seeks to broaden students' ethical perceptions by including a religious perspectiv e not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the professions' ethical frameworks, it is anticipated that the dental professionals' ethic will be more completely informed and not only will reflect concern for his or her fellows, but also will reflect an intimate relationship with the Creator God. The code contains specific admonitions that are limited in number but comprehensiv e in nature. It is anticipated that the the values of honesty, integrity, and altruism will be enhanced during professional training so that, following graduation, these virtues will be second nature in the service provided to patients. Thus, the relationship of trust between dental professional and patient can develop to benefit both the profession and the public. This is a goal the school feels it must meet as it seeks to train dental professionals to become competent in all aspects of patient care. The School of Dentistry code of ethics applies to all students (associate and baccalaureate dental hygiene; predoctoral, including international dentist students; graduate, certificate, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars; and exchange students). The School of Dentistry code of professional ethics with its specific guidelines is av ailable for review in Section VII of the LLU Student Handbook . STUDENT LEADERSHIP Professional organizations Students are invited to represent the school in the relevant professional organizations. The Office of Student Affairs facilitates the process of electing representativ es for the following organizations: Loma Linda University Dental Student Association (DSA) American Student Dental Association (ASDA) American Dental Hygiene Association (ADHA) California Dental Association (CDA) American Dental Education Association (ADEA)440 UNIVERSITY CATALOGDental Student Association The primary student organization in the School of Dentistry is the Dental Student Association (DSA ). The DSA purposes to foster service-learning activities, stimulate scientific research, facilitate professional development, involve students in the governance of the school, and encourage recreational and social experiences. All predoctoral dental students and dental hygiene students automatically become members of the DSA at matriculation. The DSA officers are elected by ballot ev ery Spring Quarter with their term beginning in Summer Quarter. Class leadership Class leaders are elected annually during the Autumn Quarter for the first year and Summer Quarters thereafter. Class colleagues elect leaders by confidential vote. The leaders work as a team to coordinate class events\u2014including learning, spiritual, and social experiences. The leaders also facilitate communication between their class and school administration. Committee representation Students are invited to serve on school standing committees. The Office for Student Affairs consults with DSA leadership to select students to serve on committees\u2014including the Admissions Committees, the Academic Review Committees, the Curriculum Committee, and the Professional Standards Committee. The election process takes place during the Summer Quarter. For professional organizations and class leadership positions, students must maintain a minimum G.P.A. of 2.7 (for president or vice president) and a minimum G.P.A. of 2.5 for all other offices. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Alumni-Student Convention The annual Alumni-Student Convention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and listen to presentations by prominent guest lecturers in the dental profession. Research presentation Students have the opportunity to give research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are invited to present their table clinics at state and national conv entions. Dedication service A dedication service is held during the Alumni-Student Convention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional lives to Christ. First-year students are presented with personalized Bibles; fourth-year students are given personalized Loma Linda University laboratory coats.Student Life 441Academic Information GENERAL POLICIES Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of Univ ersity Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration is completed online at the myLLU registration portal <ssweb.llu.edu/login>. Once at the portal, a student must clear registration holds\u2014student health, transcript, housing and finance. At the beginning of the first quarter of attendance, a student is required to have a picture taken for the student identification badge. International students must also register with the International Student Affairs office each quarter. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason. A charge is applied if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the first week of the term. A change in registration after the second week affects the grade record. A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the University without permission from the executive associate dean. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire third (D3) and fourth (D4) years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: Complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter. Achieve a term grade point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-. Receive no incomplete (I) grades on the grade report. Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course director at this University and the school's executive associate dean. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load.442 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSpecial examination It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director and the Office of Student Affairs prior to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take it, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arriv e on time. Repeating/remediating a course (predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs) If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/ her to do additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades), the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allow ed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2. For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade point average.

NATIONAL DENTAL BOARD EXAMINATIONS Successful completion of the National Board Dental Examination, P arts I and II (NBDE-I and NBDE-II) is a requirement for graduation. The National Board Dental Examinations are designed to assess cognitive knowledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibility to sit for either part of the National Board Dental Examination is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensiv e examination that assesses mastery of the test specifications prior to each National Board Dental Examination. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the National Board Dental Examination are stated below:Academic Information 445Part I First attempt Scheduled during June or July following completion of the second year. If a student fails the examination, s/he will have her/his scheduled clinic time substantially reduced. During this time, students will be required to study for a reexamination no later than December. Second attempt If a student does not successfully complete the second attempt of the P art I examination by the end of Autumn Quarter, s/he will be required to take a two-quarter leave of absence to prepare for reexamination the succeeding Summer Quarter. Third attempt After taking the reexamination in the succeeding Summer Quarter, the student will be allow ed to work on the clinic until examination results are received. If the student successfully completes the Part I examination, s/he will continue to work on the clinic for the Summer and A utumn quarters and will begin didactic courses again during the Winter Quarter with the current third-year students. If the student does not successfully complete the National Board Dental Examination, P art I on the third attempt, s/he will be discontinued from the program. Part II First attempt Scheduled in December of the fourth year. If the examination is not successfully completed, access to the clinic will be restricted in order to provide additional time for study. The student will be giv en an opportunity to retake the examination in the following Spring Quarter. National Board Dental Examination policy requires subsequent attempts to be at least ninety days apart. If a student fails the Part II examination, s/he will not be permitted to participate in licensure examinations. Second attempt A student who fails the Part II examination a second time will be required to take a leave of absence to prepare for a reexamination. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must hav e successfully completed Parts I and II of the National Board Dental Examination before being awarded the D.D.S. degree. PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW (PREDOCTORAL, IDP, AND DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAMS) There are six academic review committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the executive associate dean, the associate dean for student affairs, the associate dean for admissions, and the course directors of all courses required of the respectiv e class in the academic year. The associate dean for clinic administration, the clinic director, and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 academic review committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed.446 UNIVERSITY CATALOGThe academic review committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic performance is as follows: 1. The academic review committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a hearing called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to the academic disciplinary policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the decision of the academic review committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the academic review committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three- member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the academic review committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the process was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINARY POLICY (PREDOCTORAL, IDP, AND DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAMS) Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is giv en an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student.Academic Information 447Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing or unsatisfactory (U/F/D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation. Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. Level IV If a student meets the criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-campus, service-learning, or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fulfilled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action or remediation As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action for the student may consist of : 1. Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic y ear or portion thereof. 2. Other specified requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the academic review committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to re-entering the academic program.448 UNIVERSITY CATALOGThe following guidelines pertain to when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Dental Examination on schedule after two attempts and needs full study time to prepare for the National Board Dental Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation, yet shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the executive associate dean. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the academic review committee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the academic review committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are indicated below for predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene students: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A.

A remediation program must be specific in design, implemented, and monitored for any student/resident who is not performing up to a program's stated standards. It is important to have documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations of counseling, discussions, and corrective measures. Written statements from support staff should also be included if they have direct contact or knowledge of a matter involving a postdoctoral student/resident. Postdoctoral students/residents may be placed on academic probation, behavioral probation, and/or clinical probation. Probation begins at Level I and may progress to Level III. Postdoctoral students/ residents should be placed on probation for a prescribed period of time: one quarter, two quarters, etc. This information should be conveyed to a student/resident in writing (required) and also verbally (recommended). Continuation Students who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their y ear group for as long as necessary before being promoted to the next year or discontinued. To exercise this option, the associate dean for advanced education must inform University Records of the decision to continue a student/ resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination as to when to recommend continuing a student and when to recommend discontinuing a student/ resident and allowing him/her to graduate or continue his/her studies. Inv ariably, the length of the continuation period will determine when a student/resident actually completes his/her program.454 UNIVERSITY CATALOGDiscontinuation Students who do not make any measurable improvement by the end of the prescribed remediation and counseling periods may be recommended for discontinuation by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon recommendation of the respective program director to the associate dean for advanced dental education. Recommendations to discontinue a student/resident are then sent to the dean (in writing) for action. Criteria for discontinuation Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three consecutive quarters of academic probation. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to achieve eligibility for award of a certificate in the clinical specialty program within the standard number of full academic years. SERVICE-LEARNING Service-learning at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserv ed populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours, as described in each program. Predoctoral dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service-learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to thirty of the remaining eighty hours may be completed doing nondental service. Dental hygiene students must complete seventy-five service-learning hours. Thirty-five hours of local service are required, and up to fifteen nondental service hours may be credited. International Dentist Program students must complete sixty hours of service. Of the sixty hours, forty will be assigned by the program. Up to ten hours of nondental service may be completed as part of the sixty hours total requirement. In addition, a didactic component is included within the service-learning program. Lectures are embedded within existing courses and occur throughout the curricula. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. W ebster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs.Academic Information 455The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. BASIC SCIENCES The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serv e as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as part of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The purpose of the basic science curriculum is to provide a foundation of know ledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists.456 UNIVERSITY CATALOGFinancial Information FINANCIAL POLICIES The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must be settled. Satisfactory academic progress policy (all programs) To be eligible for federal, state, and University financial aid, students are required by the U.S. Department of Education and the state of California to maintain satisfactory progress tow ard their degree objectives. In compliance with prescribed regulations, the University and School of Dentistry have established guidelines that are designed to ensure that students successfully complete courses to promote timely advancement toward a specific degree objective. Definition of satisfactory academic progress The School of Dentistry defines satisfactory academic progress by the following three criteria: 1. Meeting a minimum grade point average requirement. 2. Making yearly progress by completing the academic requirements defined for a program. 3. Completing the degree objective within the maximum time allowed. Grade point average requirement To maintain satisfactory academic progress, students in the predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. In addition, dental hygiene students must achieve no lower than a C- grade in all core courses. Yearly progress requirement Each student's academic progress is evaluated by the academic review committee at the end of each academic term, and a cumulative review is conducted to determine eligibility for promotion at the end of each academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs monitors the minimum grade point average requirement. The Office of Financial Aid monitors yearly progress and the maximum time allowance. Students whose academic standing or degree progress falls below the standard receiv e a financial aid warning during the next quarter of registration. If their academic standing or degree progress is not raised to the standard by the end of the quarter in which the financial aid w arning was issued, their financial aid will be terminated until the requirements have been met.Financial Information 457Reasonable degree progress It is expected that students will complete the requirements for a degree within the scheduled curriculum time. The Doctor of Dental Surgery degree is scheduled to be completed in four y ears and may not exceed six. The Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in two years and may not exceed three years. The Bachelor of Science dental hygiene online degree completion program is scheduled to be completed in six quarters and may not exceed 12 quarters. The Associate in Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in sev en quarters and may not exceed 14 quarters. Certification of status The Office of Academic Affairs will certify the official status of each enrolled student at the end of each academic year to the Office of University Records and to the Office of Financial Aid. STUDENT FINANCIAL AID Federal loans are available only to United States citizens, green card holders, or those with permanent resident status. With good credit or a creditworthy cosigner, federal loans may be used to cover the entire academic budget.

DAILEY, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the deliv ery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. CURRICULUM Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectiv ely serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific know ledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include advancing knowledge and understanding health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health-care delivery system through basic and applied research. ADMISSION Information and procedures for applying to the dental program can be found under Application and Admissions in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CA TALOG.

Wolfram The Department of Periodontics provides education and training for predoctoral, dental hygiene, and postgraduate students in the art and science of periodontics. Periodontics encompasses the study of the supporting structures of the teeth; as well as the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that affect the supporting structures of the teeth. The study of periodontics helps to form basic concepts of health and disease. These concepts are applied in the treatment of periodontal diseases and in the maintenance of dental health over a patient's lifetime, providing comprehensive dental therapy for the individual patient. In this way, the Department of Periodontics contributes directly to the School of Dentistry's academic and service mission \"to make man whole.\"488 Units IDPP 754 Clinical Periodontics 2.0 Special in 2.0 PERI 705 Introduction to Periodontics 2.0 PERI 741 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Lecture 2.0 PERI 742 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Laboratory (Grade given at end of multiple-quarter course.

Armstrong Sharon Stirewalt-Boggs D. Darlene Cheek Janeen C. Duff Debra K. Friesen Shelley L. Hayton Marilynn G. Heyde Michelle T. Hurlbutt A. Lee Patricia M. Lennan Dyonne R. Stirlaeff Kristi J. Wilkins Colleen A. Whitt Debra A. Zawistowski Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the Bachelor of Science degree undergraduate curriculum of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and continuing care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. The online B.S. degree completion in dental hygiene is designed for licensed dental hygienists who graduated from an Associate in Science degree program, or its equiv alent, and wish to complete the baccalaureate (B.S.) degree in dental hygiene. This curriculum is the equiv alent of one full academic year. In addition to the degree completion courses in either education or public health, the student will need to complete any remaining general education requirements needed to fulfill a baccalaureate degree. The B.S. degree completion in dental hygiene is designed to be primarily online, with a requisite teaching or public health component that may be accomplished in the geographical area of the student. This program offers the challenge and quality of a traditional classroom, yet provides the flexibility to fit education into the life of the busy dental professional. Students can study at their own conv enience, learnDental Hygiene\u2014SD 493in small groups with expert faculty, and meet career goals at their own speed. Students who tend to be the most successful in this type of program are self-directed, computer literate, and self-motiv ated in their learning and study habits. Two areas of focus are included in this curriculum. The first is teaching, which prepares the student to instruct in a dental hygiene program. The second is a public health focus, which will either allow graduates to work in a community/dental public health program or enable them to teach in a dental hygiene program. The Associate in Science (A.S.) degree in dental hygiene, established in 2010, is designed to be completed at the School of Dentistry off-campus location in Palm Desert, California. The goal of the A.S. degree is to offer a unique educational opportunity for students in the Coachella V alley. Applicants who live in the Coachella Valley and have completed prerequisite course work at the College of the Desert will be given priority review in the School of Dentistry admissions process. The purpose of the A.S. degree, modeled after the B.S. degree in dental hygiene established in 1959, is to increase access to care in an area underserved by preventive oral health-care providers. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter clinical practice under the general and direct supervision of a licensed dentist. The A.S. degree graduate will be encouraged to pursue the B.S. degree online completion curriculum, preparing them for a variety of career options, including teaching and public health opportunities. The A.S. and B.S. degree curricula are approved by Loma Linda University Board of Trustees, Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The B.S. online completion program is approv ed by Loma Linda University Board of Trustees and Western Association of Schools and Colleges. PHILOSOPHY A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electiv es that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and caring persons prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and v alues to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society. GOAL The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and activ e members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectiv ely perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwov en into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can dev elop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific knowledge494 UNIVERSITY CATALOGand principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply evidence-based principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render. ADMISSION Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program can be found under the Application and Admissions section of the general information for the School of Dentistry in Section III. CURRICULUM Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with prev entive health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in private practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. The B.S. degree is organized as a four-year college curriculum. The freshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed, preprofessional study may be taken at any regionally accredited college . The professional curriculum begins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry. The curriculum is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The first class at this Univ ersity graduated in 1961. After completion of the required prerequisite course work, the A.S. degree dental hygiene student enters the seven-quarter program leading to the Associate in Science degree in dental hygiene. The student will meet eligibility in the sixth quarter, after successful completion of course work, for the written Dental Hygiene National Board Examination. After successful completion of the sev enth quarter, the graduate will be eligible to sit for a state and/or regional clinical board examination. DENTAL HYGIENE\u2014A.S.

Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of MedicineDean's Welcome 541School Foundations HISTORY The professional curriculum in medicine was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. For more than a century, the School of Medicine has kept pace with the rapid growth of know ledge and technology. Over 10,000 students have graduated from the school and have gone on to all corners of the earth, fulfilling the University's mission\u2014\"To make man whole.\" Since 1909 Since the school's inception, the first two years of medical school program have always been taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid-1960s, however, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center and at nearby Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be concentrated on the Loma Linda campus, beginning with the 1966-1967 school year. OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires\u2014 Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars.542 UNIVERSITY CATALOGResearch Cultivating an atmosphere of inquiry and discovering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, safe, comprehensive, whole person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole person care wherever the opportunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine.School Foundations 543General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III giv es the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs.544 UNIVERSITY CATALOGApplication and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, life experience, and significant qualities of character and personality. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparing for a career in medicine, students should quest for a broad understanding in the major areas of knowledge\u2014the natural sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the humanities\u2014which assists them in the process of learning throughout their life. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate the ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are review ed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMATION A total of 85 semester (128 quarter) units of credit from an accredited college is required for acceptance by the School of Medicine. Preference is given, however, to college graduates.

APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPTANCE It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process w ell in advance of the date of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is av ailable on the Web at <aamc.org/ students/applying/amcas>. AMCAS deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August of the following year. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1. The applicant submits a formal application through the AMCAS Web site, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's verified data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS.546 UNIVERSITY CATALOG2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests the applicant to complete an online supplementary application. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the y ear preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant responds online to his/her offer of admissions as a student, accepts the technical standards, and pays the $100 acceptance deposit online by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15 of the y ear in which the student has been accepted for entry. 6. In summary, the Admissions Office requires the following: Verified AMCAS application. Loma Linda University School of Medicine supplementary application and $75 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowledgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate college/university. Applicant's availability for interviews, should an offer for an interview be extended. Pre-entrance health requirement and health coverage Exposure to patients takes place during year one of medical education. Because of this, it is necessary for students to have immunizations against certain infectious diseases. In order to complete registration for the first academic quarter, students must give evidence in the form of physician records or college health serve records that they have met immunization requirements. Students without proper verification will be required to receive immunizations, and the charges will be billed to the students' account. The pre-entrance requirements may be found at <llu.edu/ssweb/documents/immunizations.pdf>. Please note: Tdap is now a requirement instead of Td. Students are also required to have certain injections and immunizations repeated at various intervals during their enrollment. These include influenza vaccine and an annual skin test for tuberculosis. Medical students will be required to have flu shots on an annual basis in order to meet the requirements of clinical sites where students will be working. These will be giv en by the Student Health Center at the beginning of each flu season. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with health coverage through the University's Department of Risk Management. The Student Health Plan remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the plan (as of the effective date of this CATALOG) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses or dental or optical care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current policy that covers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not have healthApplication and Admissions 547insurance coverage for his/her spouse/children will need to purchase it through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Government regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or hav e further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/651-4010). Annual tuition also cov ers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. EARLY DECISION PROGRAM A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Loma Linda Univ ersity, s/he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any school desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program. DEADLINES June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission to the School of Medicine) is the period for submission of application for the first year class. August 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of application under the Early Decision Program. August 15 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of the supplementary application for the Early Decision Program. November 15 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for receipt of the supplementary application for the regular applicant pool. May 15 (of the year of admission) is the date beyond which the acceptance deposit of $100 is not refundable. TRANSFER Under exceptional circumstances, the school accepts applicants into the junior y ear who are transferring from other U.S. medical schools. Such transfers must be for compelling circumstances and are subject to availability of space and approval of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Dean's Administrative Committee. The University reserves the right to require of an applicant satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Successful completion of USMLE Step I is required. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TECHNICAL STANDARDS Loma Linda University School of Medicine candidates for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills of five varieties, including: observation; communication; motor; intellectual (conceptual, integrative, and quantitative); behavioral and social. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in certain areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner without the use of a surrogate. OBSERVATION: The student must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals,548 UNIVERSITY CATALOGmicrobiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. COMMUNICATION: A student must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceiv e nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues, and other personnel. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health- care team. MOTOR: Students should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuv ers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.); carry out diagnostic procedures (proctoscopy, paracentesis, etc.); and read EKGs and X-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor mov ements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment of patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intrav enous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airw ays, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuv ers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. INTELLECTUAL-CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ABILITIES: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL ATTRIBUTES: A student must possess the emotional stability required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities; the exercise of others. Students must be able to maintain workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are expected of Loma Linda University School of Medicine students.Application and Admissions 549Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Loma Linda University Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available on the University Web site. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook \u2014including the section that pertains specifically to the School of Medicine\u2014and to abide by its policies. Additional information regarding policies specific to the School of Medicine are provided by the school at the orientation to each academic y ear. Students who have questions about the Student Handbook should contact the associate dean for student affairs. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The purpose of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine student organizations is to: 1. Create an avenue through which students may seek constructive solutions to problems and enhance their educational experience; 2. Develop ways to further the mission of the school and add to the medical school experience by organizing social, spiritual, and service activities; 3. Engage students in issues related to medical education and health care through participation in regional and national professional organizations.

Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR MEDICAL STUDENT EDUCATION Outcome I\u2014Basic Science Knowledge Through the study of organ systems, students will develop a knowledge base in the basic sciences essential for advancement to the next phase of their medical education. Outcome II\u2014Clinical Skills Students will develop the clinical skills that are integral to the safe and competent practice of medicine. Outcome III\u2014Whole Person Care Students will understand and apply the University philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. Outcome IV\u2014Clinical Reasoning Students will develop diagnostic reasoning and analytic problem-solving skills in order to assimilate information and establish appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans.Curriculum 551Outcome V\u2014Interpersonal and Communication Skills Students will develop effective interpersonal and communication skills, including sensitivity to those from diverse backgrounds (e.g., cultural, ethnic, gender, generational, socioeconomic, and religious). Outcome VI\u2014Medical Professionalism Students will develop professionalism in excellence and scholarship, accountability and responsibility, and altruistic behaviors. Outcome VII\u2014Ethical and Spiritual Foundation Students will integrate ethical and Christ-centered principles of conduct in their professional liv es. Outcome VIII\u2014Preparation for Lifelong Learning Students will develop a commitment to discovery and lifelong learning. GOALS FOR EACH YEAR Medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function\u2014including normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and biblical practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide v ariety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited quantitative laboratory experiences; and patient care experiences. The second year of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences\u2014basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to individual organ systems whenever possible. The second year will also continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to: experiences; and longitudinal patient-care experience. The third year of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in seven core clinical science disciplines to build foundational and comprehensive experiences for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain these experiences through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health- care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease, b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data, and c) the application of management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experiences in whole person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prev ention will be552 UNIVERSITY CATALOGintegrated into the seven core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. The fourth year of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in mandatory supervised patient-care experiences in emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, preventive medicine and public health; and a subintern- level experience in internal medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during the eighteen weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least two weeks of electives will be in a basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process.Curriculum 553Academic Information The academic progress of each student is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook available at <llu.edu/central/handbook>. COMMUNICATIONS Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. A student bulletin board is located in the student lounge. It is the responsibility of students to check their e-mail daily. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope Microscopes will be provided to students and a rental fee will be charged. If a student chooses to use his/her own microscope, it must be approved by the histology faculty in the Division of Anatomy. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered full time for the Doctor of Medicine degree course work during the entire junior and senior academic years. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensiv e examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course, s/he will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the advanced program. The course director, the senior associate dean of medical student education, and the student will work together to determine the content of the advanced program. Full tuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations In order to sit for an examination, students must be present when the chief proctor reads the examination instructions at the designated start time. Students who arrive late to an examination will be554 UNIVERSITY CATALOGdenied entrance. If, due to special circumstances, a student has been given permission by the Office of Medical Student Education to arrive late to an examination, the number of minutes the student is late will be deducted from their allotted examination time. Students who arrive after any other student has left the examination for any reason will not be permitted to take the examination. For National Board subject examinations, students will be denied entrance once the examination has started, without exception. Missed examinations Students who have an excused absence for one day of a three-day midterm examination will receive their two-day score, and the percentage earned on the cumulative final examination for each course will be substituted for the missed examination. If the final examination for the course is an NBME subject examination, then the average of the in-house examinations for that course will be substituted for the missed examination. Students who miss two or three days of a three-day midterm examination are required to take a makeup examination within two weeks of the missed examination dates at a date and time scheduled by the course director. Makeup examinations may differ in content and/or format from the missed examinations. In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. Should a student miss an in-house final examination because of an excused absence, arrangements must be made with the course directors to make up the missed examinations. The course directors, at their discretion, may opt to have the student take an examination that is different in format, content, or length from the final examination that was administered to the class. Should a student miss a National Board subject examination because of an excused absence, the student will be allowed one opportunity to take and pass the subject examination upon completing all other course work for that year at the end of the academic year. Arrangements for the makeup examination must be made through the Office of Medical Student Education. Conditions to be met for an \"excused\" absence In order to have an \"excused\" absence, the student must get a written excuse from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education prior to the administration of the test in question. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide written documentation of their illness from Student Health Center or another examining physician. Whether or not this documentation is an adequate excuse for missing a test will be left to the discretion of the senior associate dean for medical student education. Once a request for an examination excuse has been receiv ed, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education will determine whether or not the student will be required to make up the examination at a later date (generally within a w eek of the missed examination) or have the final examination count an extra amount proportional to the missed examination. Under no circumstances are students allowed to take examinations early. In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education (909/558-4255) must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education have an \"unexcused\" absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). Missing more than one examination in any course or combination of courses could result in a student having to repeat the course(s) during the next academic y ear.Academic Information 555Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course. The grade will reflect the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors. The University transcript records grades for completed courses as Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), or Marginal Satisfactory (MS). For purposes of determining eligibility for promotion, the School of Medicine utilizes grades of Satisfactory (S), Marginal Satisfactory (MS), In Progress (IP), and Unsatisfactory (U). Course directors submit a grade of Satisfactory when a student's performance clearly exceeds the requirements of the course. A grade of Unsatisfactory is recorded when a student's performance fails to meet the minimum requirements for the course. A grade of Marginal Satisfactory is recorded when the course director judges that the student's performance meets but does not exceed the minimum requirements of the course. A grade of In Progress is used to identify students having unfinished course completion requirements. Subjective narrative descriptions of student performance and other measures of student performance are submitted to the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and are used in making decisions regarding retention and promotion. Copies of complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Determination of class rank For the medical student performance evaluation (Dean's Letter), students will be assigned one of the following five designations for each course: H (honors) HP (high pass) P (pass) MP (marginal pass) U (unsatisfactory) Each designation will be based on predetermined criteria established by the course director in collaboration with the Office of Medical Student Education. The criteria for ranking may include student performance on faculty-generated examinations, national standardized subject examinations, activ e and computer-based learning activities, patient-care activities, objectiv e structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), medical simulations, and other academic activities as set forth by the course director. Junior and senior medical students will not be ranked against each other. Clerkship grades and performance on school-required activities will be reported on the MSPE (Dean's Letter ). Promotion Promotion from year to year is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. Cognitive and noncognitive (including personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession) academic progress are monitored by the Academic Review Committee. The committee ev aluates cumulative academic performance, not just performance in current or most recent course work. Students must pass each course to demonstrate overall satisfactory performance. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions.556 UNIVERSITY CATALOGDecelerated program\u2014freshman curriculum Students who experience academic difficulty during their first year of medical school may be assigned to a decelerated program with a reduced load. This reassignment will occur within the first two w eeks following the second midterm examination when, in the judgment of the dean's office, it appears the student will be unlikely to pass the year while carrying out a full load. Academic probation A student whose overall performance is judged to be unsatisfactory by the Academic Review Committee is placed on academic probation. For more information concerning the terms of academic probation, please see the Student Handbook . Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must meet with the senior associate dean for medical student education to determine educational appropriateness and file a Change of Program form. To completely withdraw from school, the student must complete the online withdraw al form. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdraw al used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allowed. School policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three attempts. Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three y ears of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed study student until s/he has either passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth time. During this directed study, the student will be charged tuition. The Student Handbook provides conditions and deadlines for taking and passing USMLE examinations. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The School of Medicine requires that a candidate for a degree or certificate from the school must hav e met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must have been spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, length of academic residence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations covering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum, as may be required.Academic Information 557 Successfully completed USMLE examinations (Steps I and II), as specified\u2014both clinical skills and knowledge components. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the University. The candidate is required to participate in graduation exercises upon completion of the academic program. If the candidate is out of sequence with his/her current class but would like to participate in the commencement exercises, s/he must have completed a minimum of three months of the required senior clerkships, i.e., medicine, pediatrics, family medicine or surgery subinternship, preventive medicine and public health, intensive care and emergency medicine by April 1 of the year of graduation. Consent for the student to be absent, granted by the president of the University, is contingent on the recommendation of the dean to the president. The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official conferring of degrees service. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE/ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Medicine/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program (M.D./OMS) is designed to provide an opportunity for qualified dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized, three-y ear period. Clinical surgical health-care delivery is emphasized. The content of the program conforms to the standards of the Commission on Accreditation and is designed to prepare the oral surgeon for certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents begin their residency program on the OMS service. They subsequently enter the second y ear at Loma Linda University School of Medicine with advanced standing. The residents then complete the second, third, and fourth years of medical school. The third year of the M.D./OMS curriculum consists of required clerkships in acute care, emergency medicine, a subinternship in ENT , and whole person care. An additional 30 units of electives, which include anesthesia and oral and maxillofacial surgery, complete the third year of the medical program. The graduate then enters a one-year general surgery internship, followed by two years of oral and maxillofacial surgery residency. GRADUATE COMBINED DEGREES PROGRAMS Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students.

SOWERS, Ph.D., Program Director OBJECTIVES Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and w ant to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the graduate program. In the first y ear, students participate in a new and revised, scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two-to-three y ears. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. PROGRAM ADMISSION Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the student's scores before s/he is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combinedMedical Scientist\u2014SM 581degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Cost-of-living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.* 2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the first and second years of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the first and second y ears is canceled. 4. Tuition waiver for both the third and fourth years of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. M.D./Ph.D. degree students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before beginning the third year of medical school. Students who have not completed the Ph.D. degree may apply for a tuition deferment for their third year of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the first term of their fourth year. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the first two years must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the associate dean for basic sciences, and the dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstances will a student be granted a tuition deferment or be allowed to register for the last term of medical school until s/he has finished the requirements for the Ph.D degree. If a student withdraws from the Ph.D. degree program his/her tuition deferments will be converted to a loan. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will convert to loan obligations at that time. * Stipends from the School of Medicine will be awarded for the first two years of the graduate program, provided that the student makes satisfactory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends cov ering study beyond the first two years should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research.582 UNIVERSITY CATALOGBiomedical Sciences\u2014SM Certificate (postbaccalaureate) KENNETH WRIGHT, Ph.D., Program Coordinator Students accepted into the postbaccalaureate certificate Biomedical Sciences Program enroll in basic science courses with first-year medical students. Faculty responsible for teaching students in the Biomedical Sciences Program will be those who teach these first-y ear basic science courses. The certificate program enables students to complete their studies with one academic y ear of full-time commitment. The program is intended to provide postbaccalaureate experience in the rapidly changing area of biomedical sciences. As such, it will either augment other career choices\u2014such as high school teaching, patent law, or biotechnology management\u2014or improve the preparation for professional training in medicine. ADMISSION Applicants to the Biomedical Sciences Program must satisfy the same requirements as those applying to the Medicine Program at Loma Linda University; that is, they will have completed a baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) with a course of study that includes a year each of general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry and general physics. Applicants are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) with no score less than 6 and an aggregate score greater than 20. COURSE OF STUDY Students are currently required to complete 38 units selected from courses indicated by the program coordinator. These courses will include 3 units of religion, with the remaining units selected from the first-year medical curriculum. The curriculum followed by the biomedical sciences certificate students will be developed in consultation with the program director, and will typically include gross anatomy, physiology, and either cell structure and function or biochemistry and neuroscience. In addition, students are asked to enroll in a critical thinking course and in one religion course. The total number of units for which students enroll during a school year is approximately 38. In special circumstances, students might be able to transfer course credits obtained in the Biomedical Sciences Program to a master's degree program in the basic sciences. In order to transfer credit to a master's degree program, the student must obtain a letter grade of B or better in a given course. Although several of the courses may share lecture experience and tests with the Doctor of Medicine degree program, such courses will not be transferred to the M.D. degree program; and a student subsequently admitted to the M.D. degree program should expect to take, and pay for, the normal M.D. degree curriculum.Biomedical Sciences\u2014SM 583First Year Units ANAT 510 Gross Anatomy 8.5 ANAT 515 Human Embryology 2.0 BCHM 519 Medical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics 4.5 MDCJ 508 Cell Structure and Function 8.5 PHSL 519 Medical Physiology 7.5 Totals 31.0 First Year, Summer Quarter Units BHCJ 501 Critical Thinking 4.0 Totals 4.0 Spring Quarter Units REL_ 5__ Graduate-level Religion 3.0 Totals 3.0 Overall Totals 38.0 LENGTH OF PROGRAM 10 months\u2014full-time enrollment required584 UNIVERSITY CATALOGMedicine\u2014SM M.D. H. ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. Instructional units are based on the quarter system. The first two academic years are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic years are made up of clinically oriented core instruction and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal dev elopment, structure, and function\u2014including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide v ariety of pedagogical methods\u2014including but not limited to traditional lecture, small group, problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitativ e laboratory experiences, and patient-care experiences. THE SECOND YEAR of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to individual organ systems whenever possible. The second year will continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditional lecture; small group, problem-based, and case-based learning; personalized computer-based instruction; quantitative laboratory experiences; and longitudinal patient-care experiences. THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of know ledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in seven core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain this foundation through a process of self- directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health-care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease; b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data; and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experiences in whole person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prev ention will be integrated into the seven core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine.Medicine\u2014SM 585THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in supervised patient-care experiences in emergency medicine, intensive care medicine and preventive medicine and public health, and a subintern-level experience in medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during a minimum eighteen weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least one month of elective may be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. WHOLE PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum.

Individuals, created to reflect the wholeness of God's character, hav e been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through human agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a body of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing.662 UNIVERSITY CATALOGGeneral Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

Students need to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook , which can be found online. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT Students are encouraged to become actively involved in the Associated Students of Nursing. Student representatives are invited to attend the Undergraduate Faculty Council, Master's Faculty Council, Doctor of Nursing Practice Faculty Council, Doctor of Philosophy Faculty Council, Spiritual Life and Wholeness Committee, and Diversity Committee, where they may contribute to the decision-making process. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The following student organizations enable students to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspects of University life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization of the School of Nursing. This association comprises all the students of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectiv es of this organization are to serve as a channel for communication between students and faculty, and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University Student Association (LLUSA) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. Class organizations The members of the junior and senior classes elect officers and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. HONOR SOCIETY: SIGMA THETA TAU INTERNATIONAL In 1975, LLUSN became an official chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International, the honor society for nursing. Students may be invited to become members if they meet the established criteria.670 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAcademic Policies and Practices UNDERGRADUATE DEPARTMENT Academic residence To qualify for an undergraduate degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 45 units at Loma Linda University; 32 of the units must be at the senior level. At minimum, three clinical nursing courses are required as part of these units. Nursing courses Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory, the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76 percent on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D Below 62% F Clinical experiences Clinical experiences are under the direction of the course coordinator. The student has supervised experience under a clinical instructor in the care of patients. T ardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Students must make up for absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $50 will be charged for make-up of clinical laboratory during nonclinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing, planning, and implementing nursing procedures; and ev aluating the care of individuals,Academic Policies and Practices 671families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the Univ ersity catalog and the University Student Handbook . Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client, using the Neuman Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may fail the course or be dropped from the program. Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required nursing course work listed in this CATALOG. Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanors, driving citations, and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Credit by examination Challenge/equivalency examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health-care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health-care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination cov ering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this Univ ersity with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. Advanced placement program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more Advanced Placement (AP) examinations with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the College Board to University Records. For specific policy and time limits regarding CLEP examinations, see \" Academic Policies\" in the Section II of the CATALOG. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, statistics, and writing. Any nursing or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. A nursing course or672 UNIVERSITY CATALOGrequired cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course or named cognate, or who have withdrawn (W) due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success and to communicate regularly with the academic advisor. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. See Student Handbook for grievance procedure. Graduation requirements A candidate must complete the undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to completion of degree. A degree will be granted when the student has met the following requirements: 1. Completed all requirements for admission to the respective curriculum. 2. Completed all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, and length of academic residence. 3.

Permission for the conferral of a degree in absentia is granted by the University upon recommendation of the dean of the school. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of A utumn or Winter quarter is invited, but not required, to participate in the subsequent conferring of degrees. Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. GRADUATE DEPARTMENT Academic residence To qualify for a degree from the graduate department in nursing at Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 80 percent of the academic curriculum while in residence at the Univ ersity, i.e., 42-68 units for the master's degree, depending on the selected concentration area; 50 units for Doctor of Nursing Practice; and 72 units for the Doctor of Philosophy degree.Academic Policies and Practices 673Transfer credits 1. A transfer student may transfer credits up to 20 percent of the units required by the chosen program to be applied to the degree requirements at Loma Linda Univ ersity. This transfer is limited to credits for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded and the course work w as done at an accredited institution and meets the requirements of a course for the degree. 2.

Students are expected to operate under the general policies of the University and school and the specific policies of the degree curriculum in which they are enrolled. The school reserves the right to update and modify its curricula to keep current with trends in health care. B.S. degree The primary aim of the School of Nursing's baccalaureate degree nursing curriculum is to prepare competent clinicians who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing know ledge and skills with knowledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care with clients from v arious ages, cultural groups, and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any regional accredited college or university. After completion of an additional eight quarters at Loma Linda University, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, and evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health-care team. Professional registration Satisfactory completion of the California Board of Registered Nursing required content prepares the student to sit for the NCLEX-RN examination. All states require that a nurse pass the NCLEX-RN examination for licensure to practice. California application forms and fees are submitted to the California Board of Registered Nursing, P.O.

The nurse-scientist who completes this program should be committed to the generation of knowledge critical to development of nursing science and practice. Graduates join other nursing leaders in furthering the dev elopment of nursing science and improving health care delivery throughout the world. The curriculum The Ph.D. degree is offered as a summers intensive program on campus at Loma Linda University, with selected online or traditional courses during the academic y ear. Completion of dissertation will follow. This schedule is designed to accommodate the needs of adult learners who are either full-time students or part-time students with ongoing commitment to professional work during the academic y ear. The core courses of the program are taught during four summer intensiv e sessions. Concentration and elective courses may be taken at Loma Linda University or through the *NEXus partnership; or a limited number of approved units may be transferred from another university. The doctoral degree program is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of know ledge development within the discipline of nursing through philosophical, theoretical, and scientific methods of inquiry. The credit requirement is 90 quarter units beyond the Master of Science degree. The core courses of the program emphasize these three areas. In addition to the core courses, each student is encouraged to select an individually focused area of concentration that will support the student's chosen area of expertise in nursing and that will focus her or his area of advanced inquiry. The area of concentration may fit established research programs of School of Nursing faculty and may also take adv antage of graduate courses throughout the University. LLU Scholars Seminar is required during the academic year while away from the Loma Linda University campus. The seminar focus is to integrate concentration and elective courses in the foundation for a dissertation at the University and to maintain momentum during the program. The program may be completed in four-to-seven years. *NEXus is a partnership among select Western Institute of Nursing institutions to facilitate enrollment in doctoral courses not available on the student's home campus. Through NEXus, the institutions have identified courses that are available at a distance and open for enrollments from partner institutions. Progression criteria The following sequential elements are required for progression in the doctoral program: 1. Area of concentration developed and approval of student's proposed academic plan by the end of the first year of full-time study. 2. Written and oral qualifying examination after completion of all required course work. 3. Advancement to candidacy. 4. Successful defense of research proposal. 5. Successful defense of dissertation.

William Hughes, Ph.D. Dean, School of PharmacyDean's Welcome 717School Foundations HISTORY In 1994, a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees; and in 1995, the board voted to continue to approve in principle the establishment of a school of pharmacy. On September 19, 2002, the pioneering class of 2006 began their study in the new School of Pharmacy. In July 2007, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education granted full accreditation status to the School of Pharmacy. In October 2012, the School of Pharmacy moved into Shryock Hall, a historical building in the core of the LLU campus. The administrative team, Department of Pharmacotherapy and Outcome Sciences, and Division of Experiential Education now call Shryock Hall home.718 UNIVERSITY CATALOGMission, Goals, and Values OUR MISSION Additive to the mission of Loma Linda University to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, the School of Pharmacy is committed to: Educating competent, caring pharmacists who will serve as integral members of the health-care team; Expanding through research the development of therapeutic regimens that will advance the knowledge and technology available for the treatment of disease; and Providing high-quality pharmaceutical care to all those within the global sphere of influence of Loma Linda University.

TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR ADMISSION, PROMOTION, AND GRADUATION Technical standards Introduction Pharmacy education requires that the accumulation of scientific knowledge be accompanied by the simultaneous acquisition of skills and professional attitudes and behavior. Pharmacy school faculty has a responsibility to society to matriculate and graduate the best possible pharmacists. Thus, admission to the School of Pharmacy is offered only to those who present the highest qualifications for the study and practice of Pharmacy. Technical standards presented in this document are requirements for admission to, promotion within, and graduation from the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy.724 UNIVERSITY CATALOGIt is the policy of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy that no person shall be denied admission, promotion, or graduation on the basis of any disability, provided that the individual demonstrates ability to meet the minimum technical standards set forth herein. Standards are dev eloped as criteria to achieve the Doctor of Pharmacy degree in preparation for licensure as a practicing pharmacist and for postgraduate professional training and education in any of the v aried fields of pharmacy. Further, the safety of the patient must be guarded as the final and ultimate consideration. Therefore, it is not only reasonable, but also essential, for competent patient care to require minimum technical standards for the education of pharmacists. Graduates of schools of pharmacy must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical, administrative, and leadership situations and to render a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical care. The Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy acknowledges Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and PL 11-336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA ) 1993, but ascertains that certain minimum technical standards must be present in the prospectiv e candidates. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education requires that the curriculum provide a general professional education, enabling each student to eventually practice as a pharmacist generalist. This requires the development of broad knowledge, skills, behaviors, ongoing self-directed learning, and the eventual ability to deliver competent pharmaceutical care within a reasonable timeframe and within the context of legal and ethical framework of the profession. Technical standards Technical standards specify those attributes the faculty consider necessary for initiating, continuing, or completing a high-quality pharmacy education program, thus enabling each graduate to enter practice, residency, or fellowship training. Faculty has responsibility to monitor the maintenance of these standards. Students must be able to perform independently all of the described functions. A candidate for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in the following areas: observation, communication, motor coordination and function, intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, behavioral and social attributes and ethical values. The School of Pharmacy will consider for admission any applicant who demonstrates the ability to perform or to learn to perform the skills listed in this document. Applicants are not required to disclose the nature of their disability(ies) to the Admissions Committee. How ever, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss his/her specific issue(s) with the assistant dean for student affairs and admissions prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant, reasonable accommodations will be provided. This commitment also holds for current students whose health or abilities change while enrolled in the program. The School of Pharmacy recognizes that certain student disabilities can be accommodated without compromising the standards required by the college and the integrity of the curriculum. T echnological compensation can be made for some handicaps in these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The school is committed to the dev elopment of innovative and creative ways of opening the curriculum to competitive and qualified disabled candidates, while protecting the care of patients. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, third parties cannot be used to assist students in accomplishing curricular requirements in the skill areas specified abov e. Observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations and conduct exercises in a variety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to monitoring of drug response andApplication and Admission 725preparation of specialty dosage forms and experiments in the basic sciences. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonverbal as well as verbal signals. The student must be able to observe and interpret presented information. Specific observation requirements include, but are not limited to the following abilities: visualizing and discriminating findings on monitoring tests; reading written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected images; observing and differentiating changes in body movement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and monitoring instruments and tests; observing a patient's environment; and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. Communication A student should be able to speak, hear, and listen to patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communications. Students must be able to relate effectively and sensitively with patients and their caregivers/partners, and convey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues and other personnel in the School of Pharmacy. Communication includes speech, reading, writing, hearing, and computer literacy. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectively and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health-care team. Specific requirements include but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with members of the health-care team individually and collectiv ely; eliciting a thorough medication and medical history; and communicating complex findings in appropriate terms that are understood by patients and their caregivers, partners, and various members of the health-care team (fellow students, pharmacists, faculty and staff members, physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social workers, and others). Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise but complete summaries of individual activities, decisions, and complex, prolonged encounters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appropriately document activities according to directions in a thorough and timely fashion. Motor coordination and function Students should have sufficient motor function and skills necessary to perform basic tasks in the practice of pharmacy and to elicit information from patients by v arious screening maneuvers. A student should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must be able to respond promptly to urgencies within the practice setting and must not hinder the ability of their co-workers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation, applying pressure to stop bleeding, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication, and preparing sterile intravenous medications. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Students must have sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug responses and to prepare and or dispense pharmaceuticals. A candidate should be able to perform basic laboratory tests (e.g., blood glucose and lipid levels); administer immunizations (intramuscular and subcutaneous); compound sterile and nonsterile dosage forms; use current technology for drug information ev aluation; read EKGs, drug blood levels, and other laboratory results. It is also necessary for the student to be able to access drug and disease information sources (both paper and electronic) within a reasonable timeframe and record data correctly so that it is clearly understood by other health professionals.726 UNIVERSITY CATALOGIntellectual\u2014conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities A student should possess sufficient intellectual, conceptual, integrativ e, and quantitative abilities to complete a rigorous and intense didactic and experiential curriculum. These abilities include measurement, calculation, rational reasoning, problem analysis and solving, decision-making, judgment, numerical recognition, information integration, and solution synthesis. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relations of structures. Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages for a v ariety of patient-specific conditions such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respiratory arrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involving appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc. must be made accurately and quickly. Problem solving and critical skills demanded of all pharmacists require all of the above-mentioned intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. The ability to incorporate new information from peers or teachers and to locate and evaluate new information from the literature to be used appropriately in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans is essential, as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Students must be able to identify and acknow ledge the limits of their knowledge to others when appropriate and be able to recognize when the limits of their knowledge indicate further study or investigation is essential before participating in decision making. A student must be fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, kindness, patience, good interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are required. Students must possess the emotional and mental health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the screening and care of patients, and the dev elopment of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients of differing cultures and backgrounds. Students must also be able to develop mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners\u2014providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate. Students must possess adequate endurance to be able to tolerate physically, intellectually, and emotionally taxing workloads; and to function effectively under stress or with distractions. At times, this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must develop the skills necessary to instruct and supervise technical personnel assisting with the delivery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate suggestions and criticism and, if necessary, respond quickly, appropriately, and cooperatively by modification of behavior. Empathy, patience, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motiv ation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and education processes. Ethical values A student must demonstrate the highest level of professional demeanor and behavior;and must perform in an ethical manner in all dealings with peers, faculty, staff, and patients. Students must also be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners while protecting patient confidentiality. Students must also meet the expected ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Good moral character, decent values, and principled judgment are paramount attributes for being a professional. In order to participate in key components of the curriculum, a studentApplication and Admission 727must be able to obtain and maintain a valid Intern Pharmacist License from the California State Board of Pharmacy and pass requisite criminal background checks and random illegal drug screens required by the Board of Pharmacy or affiliated clinical institutions of Loma Linda Univ ersity. Applicable technical standards requirements 1. The candidate/student observes demonstrations and participates in experiments in the basic pharmaceutical sciences. 2. The candidate/student analyzes, synthesizes, extrapolates, solves problems, and reaches therapeutic judgments and monitoring parameters. 3.

In summary Candidates for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have somatic sensation and functional use of the senses of vision and hearing. Candidates must have sufficient use of senses (touch, pain, temperature, position, pressure, movement, and vibratory), and motor function to permit them to carry out the activities described above. Students must be able to consistently, quickly, and accurately integrate all information received by whatever sense(s) employed; and they must have the intellectual ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Finally, students must hav e good moral character, decent values, and principled judgment; and they are expected to meet the ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Any faculty or administrative team member may question any enrolled student's or admission candidate's ability to meet any technical standard. A request for such an investigation of a specific individual must be made in writing to the assistant dean for student affairs and admissions, detailing the reasons why such an evaluation is deemed necessary. The dean will be notified if such a request is granted.728 UNIVERSITY CATALOGStudent Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The University Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Pharmacy prepares the school-specific Policy and Procedure Manual , which is provided to all pharmacy students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this manual. HEALTH CHECK REQUIREMENTS All new students are required to have the immunizations listed below completed before their first registration. Students will not be allowed to register without a valid and completed immunization record. It is strongly recommended that all required immunizations and physical examinations be obtained by the student before arrival on campus.

Consequently, all enrolled students must possess a v alid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license to participate in the experiential components of the Pharm.D. program. Application for this license is part of the orientation program scheduled prior to the start of the PY1 y ear. PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY Loma Linda University seeks to educate ethical and proficient pharmacists in a Christian paradigm. Fundamental core values of compassion, integrity, freedom, excellence, justice, purity, and humility are expected of each student attending the School of Pharmacy. Integrity is important in upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct and is consistent with the oath that is taken upon graduation. It includes being accountable for one's own conduct, as w ell as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues within the profession. Professionalism involv es treating others with courtesy and respect. It is expected that all School of Pharmacy students will exhibit conduct that shows respect to others at all times. CODE OF CONDUCT In harmony with the goals of Loma Linda University, students are expected to demonstrate a pattern of personal discipline with lifestyle expectations that are consistent with those of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Joining the Loma Linda University family is an honor and requires each individual to uphold the policies, regulations, and guidelines established for all members of the University team. The following are expected of each member of the Loma Linda University family: To respect oneself. To respect the dignity, feelings, worth, and values of others. To respect the rights and property of others and to discourage vandalism and theft. To prohibit discrimination while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions.

STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS Professional development Participation in the professional development sequence each academic quarter is part of the curriculum for the School of Pharmacy. The purpose of professional development is to encourage student participation that develops leadership skills in student organizations, the School of Pharmacy, and University activities.730 UNIVERSITY CATALOGProfessional organizations Involvement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational and professional experience within the School of Pharmacy. School of Pharmacy-recognized student professional societies include: American Pharmacists Association (APhA-ASP) California Pharmacists Association (CPhA) California Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (CSHP) American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Christian Pharmacist Fellowship International (CPFI) Student National Pharmaceutical Association (SNPhA) Organization membership by invitation The School of Pharmacy endorses three organizations in which student membership is by invitation only. Membership in these organizations is seen as prestigious and indicative of superior academic achievement and leadership. California Pharmacy Student Leadership (CAPSLEAD) Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society (RX) Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharmacy Leadership Society (PLS) Class leadership Each class elects leaders to serve as student representatives to administration and to guide the class in addressing student-related issues. The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders\u2014assisting with class issues, helping plan events, and facilitating a strong communication link to and from students. Each class also elects a full-time faculty member to serv e as class advisor. The advisor's function is to serve as mentor, keep abreast of class issues, and maintain an open communication link with the assistant dean for student affairs and admissions.Student Life 731Academic Policies and Procedures CURRICULUM OUTCOME OBJECTIVES The Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy student learning outcomes are to: Perform the functions necessary to provide patient-centered care. Perform the functions necessary to provide population-based care. Perform safe medication distribution and handling. Provide public health services. Apply the Loma Linda University philosophy of wholeness in one's personal and professional life. Apply core biomedical knowledge to patient-centered care. STUDENT PROGRESSION The curriculum is to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all of the professional courses in each quarter before enrolling in courses in the next quarter. The Academic Standing Committee reviews the academic standing of each student quarterly. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified in writing by the associate dean for academic affairs and/or chair of the Academic Standing Committee. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electiv es. A student's progression will stop following a core course failure. The student will then be placed on a leav e of absence status for two academic quarters (not including summer). Upon returning from the leave of absence, the student must repeat the course failed initially. Students needing financial aid upon their return must take at least 4 units of course work to be considered a part-time student and eligible for financial aid. Repeated courses are posted as actual grade earned (per LLU policy); however both grades remain on the transcript. Only the later grade is used for G.P.A. calculation. A student will be permitted a cumulativ e total of 9 units of unsatisfactory core course work during the academic program. Exceeding 9 units of unsatisfactory core course work, whether accumulated in a single academic quarter or throughout the entire academic program, will result in dismissal from the program. A student will hav e a maximum of six calendar years to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree, beginning with the initial date of matriculation. GRADING SYSTEM Grade and grade points Grading system The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades only. The exceptions are forum, professional development, and independent study, which will be graded on a \"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory\" basis. Each course coordinator is responsible for establishing the policy for rounding of scores in that class. Letter grades are determined based on performance in gaining a certain percentage of total points possible in each class. The grade distribution below shows the percentage range and the letter grade associated with each range. A passing grade of C- or above is required in all courses. At least 70 percent of the total points must be achieved to pass each course.732 UNIVERSITY CATALOG93-100 A 4.0 Outstanding performance 90-92 A- 3.7 87-89 B+ 3.3 83-86 B 3.0 Satisfactory performance 80-82 B- 2.7 77-79 C+ 2.3 73-76 C 2.0 70-72 1.7 Marginal 67-69 D+ 1.3 Unsatisfactory performance 60-66 D 1.0 <60 F 0.0 S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional development U 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional development Incomplete grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course overload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. In order to receive an incomplete, the student must initiate a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a Petition to Receive Incomplete Grade form and stating the reason for the request. If this request is approved, the instructor will report an \"I\" as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the prescribed time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions). Failure to complete course requirements will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. Grade changes A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in computing or recording. Such changes may be processed only up to the end of the following term. In order to satisfactorily complete a course for which a grade of less than C- has been earned, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lecture and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing the assigned work and taking any required examinations. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the permanent transcript record, but only the second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade point average (G.P.A.). A course may be repeated only once. Grade appeals Every student has the right to receive a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced evaluation based on a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore, instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, communicated to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors have the responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grading methods should be explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the instructor's judgment of record is authoritative and that the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involve a challenge of an instructor's grading standard. A student has the right to expect thoughtful andAcademic Policies and Procedures 733clearly defined approaches to grading, but it must be recognized that v aried standards and individual approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or regrade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatment. Only the final grade in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons\u2014such as clerical error, prejudice, or arbitrariness\u2014the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an appeal. Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise professional judgment. Prejudice: The grade awarded was motivated by ill will and is not indicative of the student's academic performance. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade on his or her own initiativ e. This procedure does not cover instances where students have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda University's sexual harassment policy. The grade appeal procedure strives to resolve, in a collegial manner, a disagreement between student and instructor concerning the assignment of a grade. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion and for the formal adjudication by a grade appeal panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the procedure outlined below. The grade appeal process must be started within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. Student grade-appeal process Step 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must discuss the matter first with the instructor within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is receiv ed. In most cases, the discussion between the student and the instructor should suffice, and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aware that the only valid basis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that w as arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error. Step 2. If the student's concerns remain unresolved after Step 1, the student may submit a written request to meet with the appropriate department chair within five working days of speaking with the instructor. In situations where the instructor of record is a department chair or associate dean, then the dean will serve as the appropriate department head in this step. The appropriate department chair will meet within five working days with the student; and, if the department chair believes that the complaint may have merit, s/he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the department chair, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain or change it. The department head will then communicate the result to the student and instructor. Step 3. If the matter remains unresolved after Step 2, the student should submit to the dean within five working days a written request that includes all supporting documents. The dean will appoint a grade appeal panel to review the request. The panel may require any or all individuals associated with the734 UNIVERSITY CATALOGappeal to appear. The panel is charged with determining whether the grade w as assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of unfair treatment\u2014such as arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error\u2014might justify changing the grade. The panel will make its decisions based on a majority vote. If the panel concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student and instructor, and the matter will be considered closed. If the panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it would request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, s/he must provide a written explanation for refusing. The panel, after considering the instructor's explanation and upon again concluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, will then determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the original grade. Having made this determination, each panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of University Records. The instructor and the student will be advised of the new grade. Under no circumstances may the grade be changed except by the original faculty member or the panel. Should the panel conclude that the instructor 's written explanation justifies the original grade, the panel will report this in writing to the student and the instructor; and the matter will be closed. CLASS ATTENDANCE Student attendance in classes is considered to be the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a course or as part of the grade a student earns. CHAPEL In keeping with the commitment to the mission of the University, all School of Pharmacy students are required to attend a weekly chapel service. The chapel service is a core component of the wholeness curriculum at Loma Linda University. Chapel services provide opportunities for members of the University community to benefit from programming that integrates faith and learning. By setting aside time each week for a chapel program, the University seeks to emphasize the value it places on spiritual development, corporate worship, and community. This also reaffirms the University's commitment to the ideals upon which it was founded. Regular attendance is required at the weekly chapel services, as well as the daily services during the quarterly Week of Devotion. Students are expected to fulfill this requirement as they would any other component of the curriculum. PHARMACY FORUM Pharmacy forum is a scheduled time during which professors and students come together to discuss pertinent issues and address professional topics that enhance the student's academic and professional experience. This is considered part of the pharmacy curriculum, and each quarter students receiv e a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grade for forum. Attendance is required and is a component of the forum grade. DEAN'S LIST AND HONOR ROLL The Office of Academic Affairs compiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade point average each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade point average with no incomplete grades during a term is given honor roll standing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade point average, with no incomplete grades, is given Dean's List standing.Academic Policies and Procedures 735HONORS AND AWARDS The School of Pharmacy awards excellence in scholastic attainment and leadership abilities. Awards are available to students whose performance and attitudes reflect the mission and goals of Loma Linda University and the School of Pharmacy. Students demonstrating excellence in scholarship, professionalism, and leadership ability may be nominated for recognition. Selection of students for the following awards is a function of the Honors and Awards Committee with input from the faculty. The PRESIDENT'S AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship and community service within the framework of commitment to the highest ideals of the University. The DEAN'S AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship. The WIL ALEXANDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated superior commitment to helping others. DEAN'S SCHOLARSHIPS are given annually to the top two students academically in the first three years of the Doctor of Pharmacy program. In addition, the School of Pharmacy receives funding annually from a variety of organizations dedicated to assisting the School in helping students meet the financial obligations for their education. These funds are distributed to students who have demonstrated a strong commitment to their studies as well as a commitment to the values of the institution. PERFORMANCE LEVELS Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulativ e grade point average of 2.30. Failure to maintain good academic standing will result in action by the Office of Academic Affairs. In addition to the cumulative G.P.A., a grade of at least a C- must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards completion of the requirements of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. ACADEMIC MONITORING Each student's academic status will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each academic quarter, including each student's cumulative G.P.A. as reported by University Records. A student with a cumulative G.P.A. of less than 2.30 will be monitored by the Academic Standing Committee until the student has achieved two successive quarters with a quarterly G.P.A. above 2.3. Each student being monitored by the Academic Standing Committee must meet with the director of academic support no less than two weeks after the end of the quarter. The director of academic support and the student will design an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL As each student's academic status is reviewed at the end of each academic quarter, including the cumulative G.P.A., if it is determined that a student has a cumulative G.P.A. below 2.30 for two successive academic quarters, the student will be dismissed. If previously stipulated probationary requirements from a previous quarter have not been met, the student will be dismissed.736 UNIVERSITY CATALOGSince required courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once), including APPEs, grades of D+, D, D-, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within these limits will also result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receive written notification from the associate dean for academic affairs in person. The notice will include procedures for appeal. Dismissed students are required to turn in any LLU identification badges and will have their electronic and parking privileges revoked. The school will also notify the California Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's intern pharmacist license. Readmission of dismissed students A dismissed student may appeal his/her dismissal from the program directly to the Office of the Dean within five business days. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM It is the student's responsibility to begin the withdrawal process from a course or the curriculum in a timely manner. It is important for the student to seek counseling or guidance from his/her faculty advisor or other administrative persons regarding a situation that may negatively impact upon academic performance. Failure to seek appropriate assistance will not be accepted as a v alid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic penalties. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the course of a quarter, the Office of Student Affairs must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made by submitting a Withdrawal from the Program form. Refer to the University's refund policy in the Financial Information section of the Student Handbook for information. An exit interview with the School of Pharmacy administration is required. EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approv ed supervised experiential program. The school will certify 600 of the required 1,500 hours of supervised experience required to sit for the licensing examination. Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and passing scores on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and a law examination or equivalent, are required in order to become a registered pharmacist (RPh) in the state(s) of choice. The experiential program consists of a variety of introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experiential program will receiv e a Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual . Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must be adhered to in order to successfully complete the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to convey instruction and information (classroom, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experiential education is related to or deriv ed from providing experiences in real-life professional settings. In pharmacy education, the experiential component is designed to provide in-depth exposure to and active participation in selected pharmacy practice settings. Pharmacy students are exposed to prescription processing, compounding, documenting services, obtaining drug histories, drug therapy monitoring, counseling, ev aluating drug usage, drug distribution systems, and other relevant pharmacy practice activities. Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offers introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) in the PYs 1-3 to enhance practice skills and prepare students to function asAcademic Policies and Procedures 737members of a health- care team. The advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) in the PY4 are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three y ears of pharmacy (didactic and experiential) course work. The purpose of the experiential education program is to apply didactic knowledge to pharmacy practice. The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce w ell-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible pharmacists who can deliver exemplary pharmaceutical care, as well as communicate effectively with diverse patients and other health-care professionals. Experiential education requirements The majority of the student's time during experiential courses is spent on out-of-the-classroom activity under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. When a student is off campus during an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from Univ ersity policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the following regulations are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their University e-mail account and are required to check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Division of Experiential Education and are the responsibility of the director of experiential education. No student is allow ed to change rotation sites. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receiv e financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and remov al from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the student's pharmacy education are the responsibility of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a valid driver's license and is responsible for transportation to and from sites. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educational activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receives instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Division of Experiential Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda University identification card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat must be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site has special attire or dress code requirements, the more stringent of the dress code requirements prevails, whether that of Loma Linda University or of the off-site institution.738 UNIVERSITY CATALOGPharmacy practice experience The director of experiential education coordinates both introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE). Introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) The goals of the introductory pharmacy practice experience are to sharpen students' clinical skills through direct patient-care activities in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings; to introduce the student to different career opportunities in pharmacy; and to assist them in determining their career choices. Under the tutelage of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student will be provided opportunities to apply didactic know ledge to patient care in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings early on. These experiences will enhance communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills through direct patient-care activities. Advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) Students are required to complete a total of six advanced pharmacy practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four experiences (each lasting six weeks) will be in required fields of hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical community practice. T wo experiences will be in elective fields. Prerequisites for advanced pharmacy practice experiences In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy practice experiences, a student must meet the following requirements: PY4 standing: Students must achieve PY4 standing as defined by the School of Pharmacy. Immunizations: Students must safeguard themselves and be sure that all University-required immunizations are up to date. Students are responsible for keeping the records of their own immunizations accessible. For the protection of patients and the students themselv es, it is highly recommended that students receive the influenza vaccine in October during their PY4 year. Some sites may require this immunization. HIPAA certificate: All students are required to complete HIPAA training and obtain a certificate of completion annually. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete a one- or two-step PPD test, depending on the practice site requirement) during summer of PY4. A chest X- ray may also be required. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Division of Experiential Education. A record of tuberculosis screening clearance must be on file in the office of the director of experiential education. Background check: Facilities require a background check of all personnel, including students who are placed on site for experiential education. Some institutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry into the School of Pharmacy. Annual review and update is required during the program. Random drug screening: Random drug screening may be required for some practice settings. This screening may be above and beyond school-mandated screening. Intern license: Students must hold a valid California pharmacist intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences.Academic Policies and Procedures 739CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid nonprobationary certification in both CPR and first aid. Effective dates must be current through PY4. Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student health insurance card with them at all times. CV:Students must present a copy of their professional CV to the site preceptor at each APPE location. LICENSING Pharmacy intern license All School of Pharmacy students must have a current California pharmacist intern license. Students begin the application process prior to the start of PY1. During the first-y ear orientation, applications for this license are completed. The Office of Student Affairs submits these applications to the California Board of Pharmacy. All students involved in introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) must hold a current nonprobationary pharmacy intern license. Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the W eb site <pharmacy.ca.gov/ forms/intern_app_pkt.pdf>. It is the student's responsibility to keep his/her pharmacy intern license current and v alid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address, student status, or name change. A photocopy of the student's valid pharmacy intern license must be on file in the school's Division of Experiential Education. Pharmacy intern hours The California State Board of Pharmacy requires each student to accrue 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. The School of Pharmacy's advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must consist of experience in a licensed pharmacy under the immediate, direct, and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominantly related to preparing, processing, and dispensing prescription products; compounding prescriptions; keeping records; and making reports required by California and federal regulations. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy at Loma Linda Univ ersity shall meet all of the following requirements: Satisfaction of all requirements for admission. Satisfactory completion of allrequirements of the curriculum, including\u2014 specified attendance at chapel and forum; the total number of credit units; all specified didactic and experiential course work; and all applicable qualifying and comprehensive assessment examinations successfully passed.

A student failing to meet any of these requirements may not graduate until such time as all requirements are met. Students may not participate in commencement exercises until all course work has been satisfactorily completed. Students with a maximum of one APPE to complete after the commencement date will be allowed to participate in commencement exercises. Receipt of the degree and certification of completion will occur only when all course work is completed satisfactorily and degree requirements are met.Academic Policies and Procedures 741Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority on all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or with this University must have been settled. Deposits Upon notification of acceptance, the applicant must deposit $500 to hold a place in the class.

The increase in diseases directly related to lifestyle choices, the reappearance of infectious diseases that science believed were under control, the widening gap between those who have and those who don't and its impact on their life and health are all examples of public health issues that demand our attention. And y et, they are not necessarily the most important. Why do bad things happen to good people? At the end of the day, what does any of this really matter? Am I important, of value to God or to other human beings? These questions are at the core of our existence and the answer to them can make the difference in someone's life, health, and future. This is the reason that Loma Linda University School of Public Health exists as one of the CEPH-accredited schools. We are a community that cares about public health issues. We value wholeness and the importance of healthy lifestyle decisions\u2014offering the only M.P.H. degree program in lifestyle medicine and a thriving nutrition department. We are serious about creating and advancing knowledge as our faculty members and students engage in research that spans epidemiological studies and community-based participatory enterprises; and w e care about people\u2014not just as populations, but also as individuals\u2014and about their access to comprehensiv e health care. We care about the environment we live in and the policies that are developed to empower people to make the right choices. We care about working with individuals and communities as we all strive to effectively connect what we know with how we live. The School of Public Health is special because it is part of an educational and health-care system that can be found in the whole world\u2014from the most remote village to the most adv anced metropolis; and our faculty members prepare our students to practice public health in such a world. However, the reason we exist as a school goes beyond all that has been mentioned. We are here because we want to explore the other questions with you. When you leave this institution, our prayer is that you will deepen your relationship with a God who loves you, who values you as an individual, who has a mission for your life, and to whom you matter.

In 1964, plans were laid for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine were accredited by APHA and organized under the name Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the school's emphasis on lifesty le. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. ACCREDITATION The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, DC 20001-3710. The school is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health.School Foundations 753General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

Department of Environmental Health and Geoinformatics Sciences DONNA GURULE, Chair FACULTY CORE FACULTY Donna Gurule Ryan Sinclair Rhonda Spencer-Hwang Padma P. Uppala Seth Yonan Benjamin Jesse Bliss Walleska Bliss William C. Hoffman Marilyn S. Kraft Robert I. Krieger Harold J. Marlow, Mark Stewart Steve Uhlman Description The protection of the human environment from natural and man-made hazardous conditions is a major issue of growing concern that affects the health and welfare of people throughout the world. Environmental and occupational health professionals strive to promote health and quality of life by preventing and reducing illness, disability, and death from interactions between people and their environment over their entire life span. The science and practice of environmental health currently covers many new responsibilities\u2014such as responding to emergencies, educating and training v arious audiences, and developing new standards and guidelines; or helping formulate public policy. The emergence of new issues and threats\u2014such as food security or natural, technological, humanitarian, and terrorism-related environmental emergencies\u2014establishes the need for an educated and w ell-prepared environmental and occupational health workforce. As environmental health professionals must be able to anticipate, recognize, and respond to traditional as well as emerging challenges, they also need to stay current on all of the latest information and technology tools av ailable. Environmental health practitioners are diverse in background, education, and function. Therefore, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and continually seeks to train individuals with a broad range of backgrounds, value systems, and perceptions of the world. The Environmental and Occupational Health Program provides a California state-approv ed professional program that leads to the Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree in environmental and occupational health. In addition, certain individuals are offered the opportunity to obtain an M.P.H degree that is not designed to meet the eligibility certification requirements. The Department of Environmental Health and Geoinformatics Sciences also makes available to students interdisciplinary options that integrate epidemiologic research skills or modern geospatial information technology tools into the standard M.P.H degree program. The department also partners with the U.S. Peace Corps to offer a dual degree, the M.P.H./Master's International Program (M.P.H./M.I.P). Goals The Department of Environmental Health and Geoinformatics Sciences endeavors to prepare distinguished environmental health professionals to serve local, national, and international communities; and to train graduates who will demonstrate the following standards of excellence: Conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner. Commit to public health protection and environmental justice. Serve communities as qualified, successful environmental health practitioners. Be prepared to enter into advanced or doctoral degree programs.756 UNIVERSITY CATALOGPrograms The department offers a Master of Public Health degree in environmental and occupational health, as well as a postbaccalaureate certificate in health geoinformatics. Outcomes The competency-based curriculum is built upon themes of environmental quality, stew ardship, and sustainability; and on a vocation for social justice. By the end of the program, graduates will be able to: 1. Understand the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of environmental and occupational hazards. 2. Assess environmental conditions that present actual or potential health hazards to employees and the general public; and recommend sustainable and cost-effective, practical mitigation techniques and monitoring strategies. 3. Manage environmental health programs and professionals. 4. Conduct applied policy and technical research that expands the existing knowledge base in the field of environmental and occupational health sciences, both in the United States and international communities. 5. Provide environmental and occupational health-related consultation to local and national governments, international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, industry, private associations, labor organizations, and academic institutions. 6. Advocate for environmental justice and equity on behalf of vulnerable and disadvantaged subgroups of the population 7. Meet the eligibility requirements to sit for the registered environmental health specialist (REHS) examination. Vision statement Inspired by a high calling to environmental stewardship and justice, the vision of the Department of Environmental Health and Geoinformatics Sciences is to prepare health professionals who, by helping to improve the environment, can also help ensure not only better health for individuals, but also healthier communities. Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Population Medicine SYNNOVE M. F. KNUTSEN, Chair FACULTY CORE FACULTY Khaled Bahjri W. Lawrence Beeson Gary E. Fraser Mark Ghamsary D. V. Gokhale Rhonda Spencer-Hwang Jayakaran S. Knutsen John W. Environment 757Floyd Petersen Joan Sabat\u00e9 David Shavlik Pramil Singh Loretta Wilber OTHER FACULTY David E. Abbey Terrence L. Butler Noha Daher Susan Hall Fatemeh Kiani Vichuda Matthews Jisoo Oh R. Peters Thomas J. Prendergast, Jr. Donna Thorpe Grennith J. Zimmerman Description Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists today consider the modern plagues such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, dementia, and injuries to be a part of this relatively young discipline. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations. Epidemiologists, therefore, apply a collection of investigative research methods that permeate all fields of public health in order to identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury, as w ell as health. The emphasis placed upon the investigative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. The diversity of this investigative science is illustrated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preventive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus to etiologic processes important in the development of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology include discov ery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. Goals The Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Population Medicine: 1. Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology. biostatistics, and population medicine. 2. Fosters a spirit of collaboration between students and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants.758 UNIVERSITY CATALOG3.

Conducts high-quality research, collaborates on research projects within the school and the University, and develops research collaboration with other academic and research communities. 5. Provides consultation services regarding research design; and analyzes and interprets results to other groups within the University, the community, and outside agencies. Programs The Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Population Medicine offers the following degrees: M.P.H. (biostatistics) M.P.H. (epidemiology, with concentrations in medical epidemiology and research epidemiology) M.P.H. (population medicine) M.S. (biostatistics) Dr.P.H. (epidemiology) Ph.D. (epidemiology) The department also offers three certificate programs: biostatistics, epidemiology, and epidemiology research methods. Outcomes Critically review the epidemiologic literature and identify strengths and weaknesses of design, analyses, and conclusions Participate in disease surveillance as practiced in state and county health departments Apply knowledge of disease mechanisms and information from the biological disciplines to the interpretation of statistical findings in biomedical research Collaborate with health professionals by providing technical expertise with regard to literature review, study design, data analysis, and interpretation and reporting of results Vision statement The mission of the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Population Medicine is to prepare professionals to serve local, national, and international communities as researchers and consultants qualified to provide an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease development and spread; as well as professionals qualified to select and apply appropriate statistical theories, strategies, and techniques to the solution of research problems.

Willing is not enough; we must do.\" \u2014Goethe Recent advances in science, technology, and communications have created a rapidly shrinking planet\u2014a veritable global, interconnected village\u2014with unique opportunities, new tools, and unparalleled challenges in health and development. Current global trends highlight increasingly ominous problems\u2014an upsurge in noncommunicable diseases, escalating threats of conflict, violence and760 UNIVERSITY CATALOGdisasters; a resurgence in infectious diseases (both old and emerging); deteriorating maternal, perinatal, and child health; endemic poverty, political instability, social injustice, and human rights violations; uncontrolled urbanization, environmental hazards, and a fragile ecosystem; societal disintegration, widespread substance abuse, and a growing tobacco pandemic\u2014all of which combine to amplify the stark inequities and shocking disparities in health and development that exist around the world. On the other hand, remarkable progress continues to be made through multisectoral and interdisciplinary efforts directed toward preventing disease, disability, and death; promoting health, safety and wellbeing; improving education and socioeconomic status, and ensuring improved standards of living. The availability of and access to simple, cost-effective, appropriate strategies is further reinforced by a heightened awareness of the underlying complex array of determinants, forces, processes, and systems (social, political, economic, epidemiological, religious, and cultural) that dynamically interact to impact health and development. The right to the highest attainable level of health as articulated in the charter of the World Health Organization frames the broad global health context and agenda for today and the future. The Institute1 of Medicine defines global health as \"the goal of improving health for all people in all nations by2 promoting wellness and eliminating avoidable disease, disabilities, and deaths. It can be attained by combining population-based health promotion and disease prevention measures with individual-level clinical care. This ambitious endeavor calls for an understanding of health determinants, practices, and solutions, as well as basic and applied research on disease and disability, including their risk factors.\" The Department of Global Health (GLBH) prepares committed professionals who are both technically competent and cross-culturally skilled in creating and facilitating sustainable health and dev elopment programs in diverse settings and populations. Utilizing an experiential, evidence-based model of learning and building on the global health competencies defined in the model developed by the Association of Schools of Public Health in 2011 , our program enables graduates to contribute towards a better quality of3 life for all people\u2014and especially for those who are vulnerable, underserv ed, marginalized, and disadvantaged. Our extensive network of global and local faculty and organizational resources affords a broad spectrum of options for students to learn and practice the \"art and science\" of this exciting discipline. Our program prepares career professionals who work in the nonprofit, relief, and dev elopment sectors. Graduates of the program may qualify for positions in nongovernmental, faith-based, and community- based organizations; county, state, and national health departments; priv ate foundations, public health enterprises, and public health practice organizations. Graduates also find positions in gov ernment and transnational organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and national assistance organizations like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Further academic training is also an option for graduates interested in teaching and research. Those with prior field experience and additional language/s proficiency (for example, French, Spanish) are generally giv en preference both during student admission and later when applying for jobs. Department goal The goal of the Department of Global Health is founded on the Christian v alues of love for and service to humanity and stewardship of the earth's resources. The department aims to educate culturally competent, ethical, committed, and compassionate professionals who engage communities\u2014especially the poor, disadvantaged, and underserved\u2014to help them achieve an optimal level of health and development.Learning Environment 761Programs The curricula of the Department of Global Health include the M.P.H. degree in global health; the Dr.P.H. degree in global health (currently closed for enrollment); and the certificate in emergency preparedness and response (CEPR). The curricular framework for the M.P.H. degree program is based on the Global Health Competency Model of the Association of the Schools of Public Health (Version 1.1; October 2011) which, in turn, is3 built upon the ASPH's MPH Core Competency Model (version 2.3; August 2006). Similarly, the4 certificate in emergency preparedness and response seeks to develop and enhance the core competencies as outlined in ASPH's Master's Level Preparedness & Response Competency Model (Version 1.1;5 November 2011).

ADVANCED STANDING Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limited units of advanced standing. If approved by the program director or department chair and the associate dean for academic affairs of the school, degree requirements\u2014exclusive of elective units\u2014are reduced. Courses taken during the past five years are considered in an evaluation of the student's qualification for advanced standing. Competency in courses taken more than five years previously may be considered if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis. No adv anced standing is granted for life experience that is not in conjunction with previous course work. RELIGION COURSE WORK REQUIREMENT Registration and completion of graduate-level religion course work is mandatory for completion of degree requirements. The religion requirement is designed to provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of public health students, to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges, and to provide opportunity for personal spiritual growth. Transfer of course units from other universities and institutions is not allowed; nor is a waiver option available, regardless of educational background. Traditional letter grading is required. Selection of religion courses to fulfill requirements for the various degrees should be made in consultation with the advisor, using the course schedule published online at < llu.edu/central/ssweb>. Master's degree students are required to complete a 3-unit, 500-level religion course per degree sought; and doctoral students are required to complete three 500-level religion courses in each of the religion content areas: ethical, relational, and theological studies. Only courses with REL_ code prefixes may be used to satisfy the religion course requirement. The religion requirement may not be w aived by registering for a religion course at a university other than Loma Linda University. STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Students enrolled in courses prior to receiving official acceptance into the School of Public Health are classified as \"nondegree\" students by the University. Students may retain this status only by permission of the director of admissions and academic records for a maximum of 12 units of credit before official acceptance into the school. SHARED UNITS The maximum number of units that may be shared between two degrees in a conjoint or combined degree relationship is as follows: 18 units between a doctoral and a master's degree program or between two master's degree programs, or 36 units between two doctoral programs. The maximum number of units that may be shared between a postbaccalaureate certificate and a master's or doctoral degree program is 9 units. Shared units between programs may not be automatically granted and apply only to programs that are taken concurrently. CONVOCATION ATTENDANCE Attendance at weekly University and quarterly school convocations is required. Unexcused absences are reported to the dean. Persistent failure to attend may jeopardize a student's regular standing.774 UNIVERSITY CATALOGCOURSE ATTENDANCE Only duly registered students may attend classes. Students are expected to attend all required contact elements in a course. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. ADDING AN ADDITIONAL MAJOR Students who wish to add another major must complete a written petition to revise or make a change in their program. This request will be reviewed by the relevant departmental committee for approval to add the major. After approval, the student must work with the assigned advisor in the secondary department to determine the course work and other requirements that must be fulfilled for the additional major. These requirements must be specified on the Degree Compliance Report (DCR) for the student within one quarter of acceptance into the added major; otherwise the student will be administrativ ely withdrawn from the added major. Because each combination of majors is unique, there is no guaranteed timeline for completion of the requirements for the additional major. Adding another major may also impact financial aid. Additional majors require a minimum of 18 unique units beyond those required for the primary major, with a grade point average of at least 3.0 for those added units. All successfully completed majors will be listed on the student's transcript. TIME LIMIT The time lapse from first enrollment in courses applied to a master 's degree curriculum to the conferring of the degree may not exceed five years. For a doctoral degree, the maximum time allowed for advancement to candidacy is five years, and seven years to completion of the degree program. Students who show evidence of appropriate academic progress may be granted up to two one-y ear extensions for master's and three one-year extensions for doctoral degrees. These extensions are not automatic but must be initiated by student request and be approved by the major department and the associate dean for academic affairs. Exceeding the time limit requirements may have financial aid implications. ACADEMIC PROBATION Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress, as defined elsewhere in this Catalog, will be placed on academic probation. Students with two quarters of unsatisfactory performance jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS Residency requirements may be met by a student taking, through the School of Public Health, the minimum number of units specified for the appropriate degree. The minimum didactic unit residency requirement for a single master 's degree is 47 units (plus 9 units of transfer credit, or 56 units total) and for a single doctoral degree is 60 units (plus dissertation units).

They may be part of an ongoing research or policy project at the Univ ersity or in the community. Faculty maintains a research agenda and invites participants to join them in ongoing projects. It is anticipated that the research conducted by the program participants would coincide with the research interests of one or more faculty. Individuals who may benefit from the program Participants will be drawn primarily from public health; but they also will be drawn from health care, higher education, community-based organizations, and those working in public policy. This program is specifically designed for individuals interested in multidisciplinary approaches to problem solving and creating a healthier future. HEALTH POLICY AND LEADERSHIP\u2014DR.P.H. DAVID S. PENNER, Program Director Currently closed for new admissions. General description The current, rapidly changing leadership arena demands a diversity of leadership talents to respond to the varied challenges posed by the global community. Moreover, creative approaches are needed to meet these challenges. The Doctor of Public Health degree in health policy and leadership at Loma Linda University provides a unique and wonderful opportunity to serve at the very heart of leadership development. The primary focus of this program is to enhance the skills and abilities of those in positions of leadership; to add to the body of knowledge about leadership through observation, reflection, and research; and to bring together leaders who desire to learn, mentor, and model exemplary leadership. This program, in part, meets the great need for leaders of integrity and understanding in both research and practice.832 UNIVERSITY CATALOGLeadership talents cannot be taught, but they can be developed and strengthened. The design of the program is to help individuals discover their talents and strengths, imagine how they can be developed, and then devise plans to increase and extend their skills and know ledge around those unique strengths. Description of the curriculum components Orientation Each participant must complete the Orientation for Leadership (12 units) no later than one year from the start of the program. Composed of three courses, this orientation includes time for assessing individual leadership strengths and academic potential, understanding personal leadership sty les and skills, exploring areas of future leadership development, and preparing academic plans. Admission to the orientation is limited to thirty students per cohort. Admission to the degree is limited to nine-to-tw elve students per cohort. Admission to the Orientation for Leadership does not necessarily constitute admission to the doctoral degree program. Academic plan During the Orientation for Leadership, each participant creates an individualized academic plan. This plan outlines the specific details for the participant's degree program. It includes elements such as a statement of goals, a record of past experience, the result of v arious leadership tests and assessments, a personal statement of vision of achievement by the end of the program (and beyond), and a specific plan of how the participant will demonstrate the eight areas of leadership competency. For each of the areas of competency, the participant indicates how that particular competency is to be achiev ed\u2014listing specific courses, strategic experiences, directed research, past experience, and/or other evidence to be presented as part of his/her portfolio. The completed academic plan is presented as part of the application for admission to the doctoral program and must be approved by the program faculty before the participant is admitted to the doctoral program. Changes in the academic plan may be made during the program with approval of the program faculty. Portfolio Achievement of competency is demonstrated by the evidence contained in the portfolio, not in attendance records or simply the completion of required course work. Based on the academic plan approved at the time of admission to the doctoral program, the participant assembles the portfolio throughout the program. The completed portfolio is presented at the end of the program as evidence that all areas of competency have been met and the requirements of the program satisfied. Academic courses Depending on specific needs outlined in the academic plan, participants choose from a v ariety of courses and mentored activities. Courses are available in traditional classroom settings, online, or through directed study and mentored activities. Research projects Throughout their program of study, participants are involved in research at various levels. They may be part of an ongoing research project at the University or elsewhere. The doctoral dissertation is an integrated part of the degree.Health Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 833Support Given the nature of the program and the discipline, interaction with many other persons is paramount. Leadership cannot be studied in isolation; collaboration is encouraged and modeled throughout the program. Since support and advisement is so critical, special emphasis is placed on academic support. Three examples follow. Faculty advisors and professional mentors. All participants have a primary academic advisor assigned from the core health policy and leadership faculty. In addition, participants may choose additional mentor(s) from beyond the department or University. These mentors provide support and encouragement, as well as depth and expertise. Learning and study support groups. There are at least two specifically designed study groups. One group of fellow participants (three to five) serves as a creative force and idea exchange. The group meets on a regular basis to keep members of the group focused on completing the degree. Another group, created by each participant and formed of individuals primarily outside the program (fiv e to eight) creates an extended learning environment and helps to create/provide opportunities in which the participants can improve and demonstrate their leadership skills. These learning groups include mentors, work colleagues, professional associates, and friends. Although not technically part of the health policy and leadership faculty, members of these groups nonetheless become extensions of the ethos and mission of the program. Yearly conferences. As professionals, all participants attend an annual health policy and leadership conference until the completion of their programs and may continue to do so afterw ard. These open conferences provide students opportunities to discuss current health policy and leadership issues, present scholarly papers, consult with academic advisors, report on their progress in the program, and meet with fellow participants for collaborative and networking activities. The first three conferences are taken for academic credit. Learning outcomes In addition to the eight University learning outcomes, the Health Policy and Leadership Program has chosen five additional learning outcomes. 1.Leadership: Participants understand a broad range of leadership issues and participate in future- oriented planning and change processes. 2.Health policy: Participants understand that health policy is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry and practice concerned with the delivery, quality, and costs of health and health care for individuals and populations. 3.Ethics: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, values, and professional practices implicit in their discipline and personal ethics. 4.Reflection: Participants model reflective leadership. 5.Scholarship: Participants develop skills in reading, evaluating, conducting, and reporting research. Areas of leadership competency and underlying themes In order to more clearly define the range of meaning and expectations for this program, eight areas of leadership competency and two underlying themes have been identified and elaborated. These form the framework in which the academic plan is developed and the portfolio evaluated. 1.Policy development and strategy: Participants understand the framework for policy development and explain how strategy is essential to achieving outcomes.834 UNIVERSITY CATALOG2.Systems thinking: Participants explore the dynamic interactions among human and social systems and seek to improve the interrelated and interdependent relationships among individuals, groups, organizations, and communities. 3.Community building: Participants, in Peter Block's words, \"create hospitable space, invite collective attention to what is important and make the group's intelligence visible to itself.\" 4.Understanding diversity: Participants utilize leadership skills in bringing together a variety of persons, including those who are different from themselves (age, gender, religion, work ethics, mind styles, etc.) in a way that strengthens organizations/communities. 5.Leading change: In creating a supportive environment for change, participants encourage creativity and innovation and help bring about both individual and organizational change. 6.Effective communication: Participants accept responsibility for and respond to finding appropriate avenues to communicate with a variety of audiences. 7.Conflict resolution : Participants, through careful deliberation, good listening and understanding, interest-based negotiation, and mutually beneficial collaboration, practice the fragile process of addressing conflict. 8.Management and governance: Participants observe, participate in, evaluate the various styles of management and governance, and explore management strategies and governance structures for the future. Integrated themes Woven throughout the eight areas of competency, two themes elevate the developmental process and increase the value of the discussion within each area. While the areas of leadership competency are broadly found in many similar programs, the emphasis on ethics and scholarship makes this program particularly valuable to those seeking to model leadership characterized by integrity and understanding. 1.Ethics\u2014Virtue and obligation: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, values, and professional practices implicit in their discipline and personal ethics. 2.Scholarship\u2014Research and reflection: Participants practice reflective leadership and develop skills in reading, evaluating, conducting, and reporting research. Educational effectiveness Initial assessment The Orientation for Leadership begins with intense evaluation and feedback as participants discover and evaluate their talents, skills, and strengths. Each participant works closely with a program advisor to prepare an academic plan. This plan is evaluated at the end of the orientation and must be approved by the program faculty before admission to the program. Annual progress reports and portfolio reviews Yearly progress reports and portfolio reviews are scheduled at the time of the annual conferences. The program advisor and other program faculty (two or three) meet with the participant to review the progress of the portfolio, consider any changes and/or additions to the academic plan, answ er questions, and give advice as necessary. These yearly evaluations should not be seen as isolated conversations but more as markers along the way in an ongoing dialogue with the program faculty. If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of warning is given following the review. Failure to achieve satisfactoryHealth Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 835progress will result in termination of the participant or in a hold being placed on his/her registration until the necessary progress is made. In all cases, a summary of the review will be included in the participant's portfolio. Faculty involvement in learning groups The academic advisor meets regularly with the participant's mentors and support group to ev aluate portfolio progress and opportunities to enhance the learning experience. The frequency of these meetings will vary, depending on the specific activities related to the demonstration of competency. It is anticipated that much of this will be done in the first three or four y ears of the degree. Notes from these meetings will be included in the participant's portfolio. Progress through dissertation Involvement in research and reflection is encouraged throughout the program. Already included in the academic plan is an outline of such activities to be completed during the degree program. It is anticipated that the academic advisor and participant will discuss the progress of topic dev elopment and formulation of dissertation proposal even within the first year. Research courses taken early in the program will also provide feedback on satisfactory progression in this area. Building on the existing School of Public Health's Doctoral Handbook , a clear set of guidelines will be further developed to apprise both the advisor and the participant of the steps required in taking the dissertation from topic to proposal, approv al, research, writing, and defense. The dissertation committee will oversee the progress of the dissertation to the point of satisfactory defense. Admissions requirements (in addition to the University admissions requirements) 1.

As a result, many courses contain a significant component of field application. Some courses consist of field practicum. But more importantly, the program is designed around \"taking learning to the workplace.\" As such, participants are expected to develop a learning environment at their place of work. The work in these learning groups will be evaluated by the local work supervisor and the University advisor and will be included in the final portfolio. Culminating experience In addition to the dissertation defense, which is itself a major culminating experience, participants will present their portfolios at the end of the program. The portfolios are based on the academic plan and the eight areas of leadership competency, supported by evidence and v alidated as sections are completed, and assessed at the end of the program as the participants present them in the culminating degree activity. Research Throughout their program of study, participants are involved in research at various levels. They may be part of an ongoing research project at the University or elsewhere. The doctoral dissertation is an integrated part of the degree from the beginning of the degree program. Leadership faculty maintains a research agenda and invites participants to join them in ongoing projects. It is anticipated that the research conducted by the program participants will coincide with the research interests of one or more faculty. To support and encourage research, the program includes a faculty member whose task is to coordinate the research efforts of those enrolled in the program. Underscoring the importance of research, one of the underlying themes supporting the leadership competencies is scholarship. As such, participants will practice reflectiv e leadership; develop skills in reading, evaluating, conducting, and reporting research; develop a habit for and practice in reflective838 UNIVERSITY CATALOGthinking and critical self-evaluation in all areas of competency; analyze and evaluate research published in professional journals in both qualitative and quantitative traditions in four or more areas of competency; present posters, professional papers and/or research findings at one or more professional conferences in two or more areas of competency; demonstrate the ability to conduct independent research at an advanced level, from problem definition to research and oral defense, in at least one research tradition while addressing issues in one or more areas of competency; and participate in the dialogue of the discipline by submitting at least two articles for publication. Individuals who may benefit from the program Given the context of Loma Linda University, participants will be drawn primarily from public health. They will also be drawn from health care; higher education; nongov ernmental organizations that have developed health initiatives; and other related groups. Two important requirements are that those admitted to the program will have had sufficient experience in the workplace (normally five years or more) and that they are currently employed in an organization that is supportive of their degree program and the unique requirement to develop a \"learning environment\" at the workplace.Health Policy and Leadership\u2014PH HILDEMAR DOS SANTOS, Program Director LIFESTYLE MEDICINE\u2014M.P.H. In the Lifestyle Medicine Program, health professionals with relevant clinical health professional degrees are empowered to provide lifestyle change interventions and promote healthy behaviors for patients with chronic diseases or patients at risk of chronic diseases, while understanding the population determinants of wellness, health, and disease. The curriculum emphasizes interventions based on scientific data and established behavioral and learning theories that promote individual and public health through the processes of education, health behavior change, and health promotion. It emphasizes that health professionals who are not physicians are not enabled to practice medicine when aw arded this degree. The curriculum focuses on teaching public health practice classes that are needed to possess core skills in public health, in evaluating the scientific literature, and in understanding and applying the science of disease prevention in the context of mind-body interaction. More practice-oriented classes teach the scientific basis and applications of exercise prescriptions, nutrition counseling, tobacco cessation, and health behavior change techniques. Graduates may use their skills acquired in the program to enhance their current clinical knowledge and skills in medicine, nursing, clinical psychology, osteopathy, pharmacy, or other health professions. They are academically prepared to apply preventive methodologies to chronic diseases and risk factors; conduct individual health assessments; provide medical lifestyle counseling; properly evaluate and apply lifestyle medicine-related research findings, and lead and evaluate health promotion projects. Course work for the Lifestyle Medicine program is currently offered as a 60-unit, predominantly on- campus program. Almost one-half of the total course work (up to 30 units) may be completed online. Students who hold a clinical health professional degree may apply to the program. Learner outcomes Graduates of the program in lifestyle medicine will: Possess a core field of knowledge of public health, with emphasis on the application of preventive methodologies to chronic diseases. Accurately assess lifestyle-related risk factors for chronic diseases. Provide appropriate interventions in regard to these risk factors, e.g., medical behavioral counseling in exercise, nutrition, and tobacco dependence. Evaluate and properly apply lifestyle medicine-related research findings. Provide leadership for and evaluate community-based, health promotion projects.

The School of Religion has four degree programs that associate areas in the sciences with religion. But the major task of the School of Religion remains enriching programs in the other seven schools of the University with a faith-based, wholistic approach to the health sciences. So, in whatever program you have enrolled, you will come in contact with School of Religion offerings that hav e been uniquely designed to help you prepare for wholistic ministry within your chosen profession. Studying at Loma Linda University is about more than just careers and professions; it is about mission and purpose for all of life. The School of Religion is pleased to have an important role in helping to prepare you for the most fulfilling life and career possible. Detailed information about our four master's degrees in religion is contained in this section of the Catalog. These programs have been designed to specifically equip graduates with skills in clinical ministry, chaplaincy, bioethics, and religion and the sciences. How ever, within the framework of our academic programs, we also offer a unique opportunity for LLU students in other professional programs to apply for dual enrollment in either bioethics or clinical ministry. Students enrolled in dentistry (D.D.S.), marital and family therapy (M.S.), medicine (M.D.), nursing (M.S.), psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.), and social policy and social research (M.A.) are eligible to apply for admission to the master 's degree in either the Bioethics or Clinical Ministry program. Please refer to The Combined Degrees Programs of the University section to learn more about our dual enrollment degree programs. On behalf of the faculty and staff of the School of Religion, let me personally invite you to seriously consider the courses and the programs that we offer. We can help strengthen your faith; broaden your spiritual and academic horizons; enhance your ability to serve; and prepare you not only for this life, but also for eternity. May God enrich your studies, Jon Paulien, Ph.D. Dean, School of ReligionDean's Welcome 879School Foundations HISTORY In the configuration of Loma Linda University as a health sciences university, the role of religion as integrative in each of the programs of the University is mandated and continuously affirmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) w as established to assist in this integration. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Humanity's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. MISSION STATEMENT The School of Religion is committed to the following four tasks, as informed by the teachings and practice of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage and mission: 1. To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3. To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal involvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice.880 UNIVERSITY CATALOGGeneral Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III giv es the general setting for the programs of each school and the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs.General Regulations 881Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to apply Loma Linda University manages all applications through an online process. The application, all required forms, and instructions are available online at <llu.edu/central/apply>. The School of Religion has a rolling admission policy in which completed applications are review ed and students are accepted on a continual basis. Applications must be completed by the deadlines listed for the quarter in which the student wishes to enroll: Autumn Quarter: August 1 Winter Quarter: November 1 Spring Quarter: February 1 Summer Quarter: May 1 Application procedure 1. Complete the online application and submit all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references by the deadlines listed above. 2. Complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools should be provided. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts, including official English translations and evaluations, if applicable, sent directly by the registrar (or a recognized, authorized institutional representativ e) of each school attended to the University Admissions Office. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is desirable and should be arranged with the director of the program in which the student wishes to study. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Religion. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be remov ed while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance into the program.882 UNIVERSITY CATALOGScholarship Applicants to the Clinical Ministry Program, Chaplaincy Program, or the Religion and the Sciences Program are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point av erage of B (3.00) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Some students with an overall grade point average between 2.50 and 3.00 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior, or there is other evidence of capability. For scholarship requirements for the Bioethics Program, please go to the Bioethics Program section in this CA TALOG. Academic probation Degree students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Students who are on academic probation and fail to earn a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 after two quarters, jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program and may be dismissed from school. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Religion program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exception to this are the combined degrees programs, discussed at the end of Section III of this CATALOG.Application and Admissions 883Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installments are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. ON- AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING Students may go to <llu.edu/central/housing> for housing information and a housing application form.884 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAdditional Requirements For additional policies, governing Loma Linda University students, see Section II of this CATALOG, as well as the University Student Handbook .

CLINICAL MINISTRY\u2014M.A. The Clinical Ministry program leading to a Master of Arts degree encourages students to explore the theological, biblical, and historical roots of ministry within the institutional setting and to prepare for the practice of such ministry. The program is especially valuable as preparation for careers in chaplaincy and other fields of ministry. It is specifically designed for three types of students: 1. those at the beginning of their professional lives; 2. those pursuing this degree in order to enhance or shift their existing careers; and 3. those pursuing this degree as a steppingstone to further study. This degree furthers education in caring for the whole person. The student will dev elop clinical skills applicable to contemporary ministry. The program includes education in two areas: academic and clinical. Academic preparation is provided by the School of Religion and other cooperating departments within the Univ ersity. Settings providing clinical opportunities for training in institutional ministry include: Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (BMC), and Campus Ministries.Clinical Ministry\u2014SR 893Loma Linda University Medical Center, under the auspices of the Department of Chaplain Services, is an accredited Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) Center.

This certificate will satisfy the denominational studies requirement. The development of this certificate has been a collaborative effort between Loma Linda University and Loma Linda University Medical Center Chaplains Department, in consultation with ACM. This certificate is a response to the stated need of ACM for denominational education that includes the following four areas: 1) Seventh-day Adventist history and heritage; 2) Seventh-day Adventist doctrines, beliefs, and practices; 3) Seventh-day Adventist perspectives on Daniel and Revelation and how they inform the issues of suffering and pain; and 4) Seventh-day Adventist health, wellness, and lifestyle issues. TEACHING METHODOLOGY The education model designed for this academic certificate will be through distance learning online modalities that use a combination of online work and two cohort on-campus intensiv es. This is a two-year, online program with two on-campus intensives, online courses, and personal growth class-driven learning activities. Students begin their program as a cohort and are expected to complete the program with their cohort. The program begins with an orientation on-campus intensiv e and closes with an on-campus intensive session, which includes an individual report, preparation and presentation of a portfolio, and an exit interview. STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS After completing the requirements, graduates of the Denominational Studies for Chaplains Program will be able to articulate the following student learning outcomes: 1.

LARSON, Program Director As the academic study of religion has developed over the past fifty years, the exploration of religion and science has emerged as a discipline of its own. Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sciences, and numerous applied sciences recognize the importance of examining religion from their particular perspectives. In addition, religion scholars appreciate the importance of the questions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. As a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences university, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a positive relation between religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a variety of health professional programs reflects the belief that the natural world is God's good creation, and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various avenues of graduate study, expresses the belief that all truth is God's truth; and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our pow ers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scientific knowledge within the overarching perspective of Christian faith. The Master of Arts degree in religion and the sciences is designed for sev eral types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also hav e an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interface of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is administered by the School of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Behavioral Health; and other faculties in the University, as well as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. Upon completion of the Religion and the Sciences Program, students will demonstrate: 1. A knowledge of the research methods of religious studies and at least one branch of the natural and human sciences. 2. An understanding of the contrasting and complementary aspects of scientific inquiry and religion experience. 3. The ability to bring into critical conversation the theoretical foundations of science and philosophical perspectives on religion. 4. Critical thinking in the areas of religious and scientific inquiry. 5. The ability to contribute to the field of religion and the sciences in the areas of research and writing. 6. An understanding of the relation of wholeness and values to one's scholarship in the area of religion and the sciences. ADMISSION In addition to meeting admission requirements for the School of Religion, the applicant to the Religion and the Sciences Program must:Religion and the Sciences\u2014SR 8991.

HYMAN, Program Director HEALTH CARE HUMANITIES: The humanities encourage an anthropological dig into that which explains, depicts, shapes, and calls on us to be human. They are our histories; our stories \"liv ed\"; our cultural, social, religious identities. The humanities define us as \"human.\" For more than fifty years, Loma Linda University has officially prized \"wholeness.\" Because of the specialized nature of Loma Linda University's curricula, a humanities component of the health-related professional programs is important to realize the University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Health care and research are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, and only a breadth of integrated know ledge adequately prepares tomorrow's leaders. Loma Linda University alumni will influence and be influenced by a complex society; a disciplined study of the humanities is no luxury. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Board of Trustees voted in December 2006 to establish a Humanities Program within the School of Religion. The goal is to establish a core of humanities scholars, beginning with one professor each in literature and in history, who will teach humanities courses and develop innovative means to enhance the humanities ethos on campus. Loma Linda University's Humanities Program has two emphases: undergraduate and professional education. Undergraduate. The Humanities Program for undergraduates largely builds on the humanities course work that students bring from prior college enrollment. Additionally, the Univ ersity is now searching for the ideal way to meaningfully embed the humanities within students' ongoing professional studies. Ideas that are being explored include: (a) a new capstone academic course in which students examine their personal and professional values; (b) a wholeness portfolio that requires students to explore the integration of personal values, societal needs, and professional aspirations; and (c) a medical humanities certificate. The Humanities Program furthers Loma Linda University's educational objectives: Values-based education Critical thinking skills Effective communication Contribution of the humanities and the arts to society Lifelong learning Human wholeness Professional. The impact of the Humanities Program on professional education is largely outside the classroom\u2014lectures, workshops, film discussions, and brown bag sessions. These experiences are important in themselves, and the humanities faculty will greatly strengthen this aspect of campus life. The University also envisions honors programs that will require instructor-led integrative discussions\u2014often supplemented with assigned reading. Discussion has begun with v arious schools of the University regarding the development of honors programs that focus on demonstrated excellence in one's specialized field of study; as well as integration of that knowledge with at least one humanities discipline (e.g., history, literature, religion).902 UNIVERSITY CATALOGFaculty of Graduate Studies Dean's Welcome Foundations of Graduate Study Philosophy Objectives General Regulations Application and admissions Scholarship From master's to Ph.D. degree Student Life Academic InformationFinancial Information General financial practices On- and off-campus student housing Additional Requirements Graduate degrees overseen by the Faculty of Graduate Studies Master's degrees Doctoral degrees Combined degrees programsFaculty of Graduate Studies 903Dean's Welcome We are very pleased that you have chosen to continue your education at Loma Linda University in a graduate program coordinated by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies904 UNIVERSITY CATALOGFoundations of Graduate Study Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963, the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School\u2014with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda Univ ersity\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005, the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the University; promotes and encourages independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achievements to the service of humankind. PHILOSOPHY In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. OBJECTIVES The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of humankind.Foundations of Graduate Study 905General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all transfer courses unless otherwise specified in specific program requirements; C- grades are not acceptable for transfer. An overall college G.P.A. of at least 2.5 to 3.0 is expected, depending on the program to which the student applies.914 UNIVERSITY CATALOGTranscripts Transcripts are accepted only when sent directly to the University Records office by the issuing institution. Transcripts received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution upon request of the student. GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Admission requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to graduate programs in the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point av erage of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students with an overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior y ears are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with application for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than fiv e years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Web site at <ets.org/gre>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. English-language competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensiv e American Language Institute prior to entering their program, because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress.Application and Admissions 915All Earth and Biological Sciences Graduate Degree Programs MASTER OF SCIENCE AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, ev aluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. Advisors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates are required to hav e demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda Univ ersity or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. However, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but these must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serv e as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. The time allowed from admission to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years; time allowed for the Ph.D. degree is seven years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if recommended by the guidance committee and supported by the dean. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion; for the Ph.D. degree, course credit is nullified eight y ears from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Minimum required grade point average Students must maintain a grade point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the master's or doctoral degree. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply916 UNIVERSITY CATALOGtoward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. In some cases, programs have specified higher or additional requirements. Students should consult with their particular program of study. Professional performance probation Graduate programs in the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in program guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensive and final examinations Master's degrees: The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school in which the program is housed. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Doctoral degree: The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final y ear of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until they have completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CA TALOG for each program. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter.All Earth and Biological Sciences Graduate Degree Programs 917Candidacy Admission to the school in which the program is housed or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (Form A ) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the school in which the program is housed for candidacy for the master 's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will also include confirmation that comprehensiv e written and oral examinations have been passed. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a master's degree. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (courses numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. All doctoral students are required to take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered betw een 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the appropriate office in final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the office of the academic dean of the school in which the program is housed). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the Univ ersity Library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies.918 UNIVERSITY CATALOGDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship, productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean of the school in which the program is housed, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receiv es a copy of the committee's recommendation. Dissertation All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done at the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prev ent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee, to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies provides appropriate information and forms.All Earth and Biological Sciences Graduate Degree Programs 919Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. 920 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAcademic Information CONDITIONS OF REGISTRATION, RESIDENCE, ATTENDANCE Academic residence A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree. A year of residence is defined as three quarters of academic work. The master's degree candidate must complete one year of residency. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limited periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Such time away may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the school in which the program is housed. Programs in the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences at the doctoral lev el require a minimum of two years of residency, during which the student devotes full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Transfer credits Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this Univ ersity that earns less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that hav e been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. The maximum number of transfer credits toward a master's degree or doctoral degree may not exceed 20 percent of the minimum credits required for the degree. Transfer credit may reduce the minimum requirements of credit units for a degree earned at Loma Linda University; however, residency requirements are not to be altered. Transfer credit is normally not applicable if the course work was completed more than seven years prior to registration at Loma Linda University. Transfer credit courses must be equivalent to courses appropriate to degree requirements as specified in this CATALOG of the University. Academic probation Degree students whose overall grade point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Students who are on academic probation and fail to make a 3.0 for the next quarter or who fail to have an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 after two quarters may be dismissed from school.Academic Information 921Financial Information SCHEDULE OF CHARGES (2013-2014) Tuition $715 Per unit, graduate credit $290 Per unit, undergraduate credit; $3,480 per quarter $350 Per unit, audit, graduate Special charges* $60 Application fee $733 Enrollment fee per quarter $60 Fee for credit by examination $30 Per unit fee to have credit earned by examination appear on transcript * Programs may have additional fees.922 UNIVERSITY CATALOGBiology M.S., Ph.D. STEPHEN G.

Hayes Kevin E. Nick Timothy Standish SECONDARY APPOINTMENTS Ronald L. Carter W. William Hughes V. Leroy Leggitt Samuel Soret Seth Wiafe The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences (EBS) offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental sciences (ENVS). This program builds upon a strong interdisciplinary breadth in natural, physical, and earth systems sciences to help understand the effect of human activities on environmental sustainability and management. In addition, since understanding the environment has become highly dependent on advanced technology, students will learn to use marketable geospatial applications, such as: geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, computer systems modeling, and global positioning systems (GPS). These tools will help students address environmental problems, such as: climate change, biodiversity decline, groundwater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, and air and noise pollution. Students have a choice of advanced expertise in one of the following concentration areas: conservation biology and biodiversity, environmental geology, or health geographics. Lastly, this program will encourage students to develop critical thinking skills, healthy lifestyles, and service-oriented attitudes that are necessary to develop effective and ethical solutions to environmental problems on a local and global scale. LEARNING OUTCOMES Demonstrate breadth and depth of knowledge of earth's environment by understanding the dynamic and interdependent nature of each of earth's component systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere). Demonstrate the ability to critically evaluate the relation of science and faith within an environmental context.938 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Demonstrate written, technical, oral, and problem-solving skills necessary to collect, analyze, and share environmental data with scientific and public communities. Demonstrate awareness of the professional and academic opportunities in the environmental science field, as well as knowledge of concurrent environmental science research. Obtain an understanding of the human and natural causes to some of earth's environmental problems and learn how the environmental scientist addresses them. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The student in the B.S. degree in Environmental Sciences (ENVS) Program will generally take the first two years of required corequisite course work (96-105 units) at any accredited community college or university, and the last two years of the ENVS curriculum at Loma Linda University. Students may obtain early entrance with the approval of the Earth and Biological Sciences Department after completing at least 48 quarter units of corequisites at a college of their choice. Students accepted early will concurrently take course work at a nearby community college in order to complete their outstanding corequisite requirements. All students seeking admission into the Environmental Sciences Program must have a 2.5 G.P.A. and three letters of recommendation from faculty members at the institutions previously attended. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES Career options in the field of environmental sciences are diverse and abundant. The Environmental Sciences Program prepares students for entry-level jobs in environmental sciences or GIS fields. Graduates may pursue jobs in the public sector through local, state, and federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Department of Fish and Game. In the private sector, graduates may seek jobs in environmental consulting firms, foundations, and organizations. Some examples of career paths that environmental science graduates pursue include environmental engineering, science, and social policy; a wide variety of natural resources management fields, such as soil science, forestry, agriculture, watershed science, range management, wildlife conservation, recreation resources, land management, and ecology; landscape architecture, conserv ation science, geographic information science (GIS), climatology, diverse health sciences; as well as public policy, law, or planning careers. Environmental scientists may also become involved through employment or volunteering with nonprofit organizations such as Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) International and help world populations learn how to use the earth's resources to their adv antage in a sustainable manner. PREPARATION FOR TEACHING A student preparing to teach at the elementary or secondary level will need to complete the requirements for a teaching credential, in addition to the environmental sciences major. The student should consult the undergraduate program director for further information. General electiv e units can be used for education courses. PREPARATION FOR ADVANCED PROGRAMS Because of the strong foundation in the natural and physical sciences acquired in the Environmental Sciences Program, students have the option of applying to a variety of graduate programs; as well as medical, dental, and engineering programs. In most cases, these programs would require full-y earEnvironmental Sciences 939courses in general biology, general chemistry, general physics, and organic chemistry. One or more courses in calculus may also be required. Students are highly encouraged to contact their prehealth or graduate program of choice early in their major to ensure they meet specific course requirements. ENVIRONMENTAL INTERNSHIP The Environmental Sciences Program offers students the opportunity to engage in \"hands-on\" application of fundamentals learned in course work by enrolling in ENVS 487. W ith the supervision of a faculty advisor, students will develop an academic component of the internship and will be permitted to earn up to eight units of general elective credit towards the B.S. degree. All internship appointments are subject to Environmental Scientist Program director approval. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH Following approval of an academic advisor and research professor, students interested in field research may gain training and experience in one of the three concentration areas offered by the program.

Concentrations One of the following concentration areas will be chosen in consultation with the environmental sciences program director. Conservation biology and biodiversity One year each of general biology and general chemistry are required for this concentration. This concentration is suitable for students wishing to empirically analyze the health of an ecosystem, including population and distribution of plants and animals and environmental degradation and its causes, with the goal of proposing methods of improving the health of the ecosystem. Graduates in this track normally work closely with government, conservation agencies, and industry to develop land and water management plans and educate the public about threats to the health of ecosystems. This concentration is also appropriate as background for graduate study in such disciplines as biology, ecology, forestry, and environmental health. Environmental geology One year of general chemistry and general physics is required for this concentration. This track will prepare students to objectively study geologic information and apply it to contemporary environmental problems such as pollution, waste management, resource extraction, natural hazards, and human health. For example, an environmental geologist might evaluate the risk and damage potential from natural hazards such as floods, landslides, volcanoes, or earthquakes. They might be involv ed in a land-use planning process that assesses the impact a sanitary landfill would hav e on groundwater. This concentration is also appropriate as background for graduate study in areas such as geology and earth sciences. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) One year each of general biology and general chemistry is required for this concentration. Geographic information systems (GIS) allows researchers to model and assess multiple lay ers of environmental, human health, and demographic information. Students in this track will learn to use GIS as a multidimensional tool to understand the complete environmental and health risks of an area.

The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences offers the Master of Science degree in geology. Research and course work emphasize field and laboratory studies in sedimentology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleoecology, and taphonomy. Areas of curriculum strengths include sedimentary geology, paleontology, and environmental geology. Research in paleontology may also be pursued through the M.S. and Ph.D. degree curricula in biology, and through the Ph.D. degree curriculum in earth science. Program objectives The Geology Program focuses on field-oriented geology\u2014particularly sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleontology. The integrated core course sequence provides students with the tools to conduct research in the subdisciplines of sedimentology, paleontology, or environmental geology. Fieldwork is emphasized because it provides a first-hand experience with geological phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily grasped or understood solely from classroom or laboratory study. Throughout the geology curriculum, students are encouraged to develop an open-minded and investigative approach in the application of the scientific method to the resolution of geologic problems. Consideration of multiple working hypotheses is encouraged.Geology 953The Geology Program aims to instill in students the values of honesty, scientific integrity, careful research, and independent critical thinking; provide the tools and intellectual environment in which geologists can attain their highest potential in scholarship and research; and challenge graduate students to consider the relationships among science, faith, and societal responsibility. Learning outcomes 1. Demonstrate advanced breadth and depth of knowledge in earth science. 2. Plan and carry out independent research. 3. Demonstrate written and oral communication skills, and the integration of technology in communication. 4. Demonstrate ability to analyze and synthesize previous knowledge. 5. Demonstrate a professional aptitude and attitude. 6. Demonstrate critical evaluation skills in relation to faith, science, and public interest issues. Financial aid Research and teaching assistantships are available from the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences on a competitive basis. Further information can be obtained by contacting the department at <ebs@llu.edu>. Qualified students are also encouraged to seek fellowships from federal and private agencies with the help of their advisors. Application Applications are accepted at any time.

The combined degrees programs provide opportunities for especially w ell-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, students must have a baccalaureate degree and must already be admitted to the schools offering their chosen combined degrees program. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more y ears (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended. The usual degree requirements apply. Interested and qualified students may choose from the combined degrees programs offered by the University.

WALTERS, Program Director, Bioethics, School of Religion RONALD J. DAILEY, Program Coordinator, School of Dentistry FACULTY The faculty for the combined degrees program in Bioethics with Dentistry is drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Religion and School of Dentistry. The program The combined degrees Bioethics with Dentistry Program is designed to fit the schedule of D.D.S. degree students. Ethics in dentistry is well-established at Loma Linda University. Loma Linda University's School of Dentistry is one of a select few in the nation known for their expertise in ethical issues. How many additional course work units would an M.A./D.D.S. student take beyond the standard D.D.S. (262 units)? Answer: 36 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units. How ever, the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 12 units in the following manner: 1. 8 units from four courses in the dental curriculum are counted for credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) RELR 717 Diversity and the Christian Health Professional, b) DNES 794 Public Health Dentistry, c) RELR 715 Christian Dentist in the Community, and d) DNES 851 The Dentist and the Law. Acceptance of these 2-unit courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrativ e, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2. 4 units come from a) the deletion of RELE 734 Christian Ethics for Dentists from the combined degrees student's curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program, and b) the dental curriculum lists one 2-unit \"religion selectiv e\" that will now be taken in the bioethics selectives. How much course work would the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answer: 40 units. 8 units (from four 2-unit courses) are purely double counted. These four courses (named abov e) have sufficiently similar content to bioethics that they warrant being applied to both the D.D.S. and the M.A. degree in bioethics, once the supplemental papers are approved. These short papers integrate professional course work with bioethics content. How much course work is taken in the regular D.D.S. curriculum? Answ er: 258 units (four fewer than the standard 262 units). Four units are deleted because their content is more than duplicated in the M.A. degree curriculum.The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 965How will D.D.S. students be selected for this program? Students are selected through a competitive process, led by the School of Dentistry, in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. The School of Dentistry academic dean recommends students, triggering a streamlined admissions process to the M.A. degree in bioethics curiculum. Currently, one student per year is eligible for a full tuition scholarship for this combined degree.

How many additional course work units would an M.A./M.D. student take beyond the standard M.D. (242 units)? Answer: 30 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. However, the M.A./M.D. combined degrees student is able to deduct 18 units that would otherwise be needed if the M.A. and M.D. degrees were taken separately: 1. 12 units from three courses in the medical curriculum count as credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) MDCJ 543, 544 Medical Neuroscience, b) PSYT 514 Psychopathology, and c) PR VM 514, 515, 516 Clinical Preventative Medicine. Acceptance of these 2-unit courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrative, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2. 6 units come from three School of Religion courses: a) RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics, b) RELE 714 Advanced Medical Ethics, and c) the deletion of one RELT course from the medical student's combined degrees curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program. (Students are informed of the combined degrees option at the beginning of their freshman year and are encouraged not to take RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics during Autumn Quarter if they are contemplating the combined degrees program. The School of Medicine's determination about student acceptability for the combined degrees program can be made immediately after Autumn Quarter grades are posted.)The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 967How much course work would the M.A./M.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answer: 36 units. The rationale: 12 units are double-counted\u2014the three courses in medicine, previously indicated in 2-a.b.c., that have sufficiently relevant content to bioethics that they academically warrant being applied to the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements. How will M.D. degree students be selected for this program? Students are selected through a competitive process, led by the School of Medicine, in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. Selection is based upon the standard admission criteria for the M.A. degree in bioethics minus the GRE, because the MCAT includes a critical thinking component.

JAMES W. WALTERS, Program Director, Bioethics, School of Religion ELIZABETH BOSSERT, Program Coordinator, School of Nursing FACULTY The faculty for the combined degrees Bioethics with Nursing Prorgam is primarily drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Religion and School of Nursing. The program The M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees Bioethics with Nursing Program is designed to facilitate greater integration and more efficient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interest in both nursing and ethics. Students who complete this program will be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to both fields. Students are required to gain separate acceptance into the M.A. degree in bioethics curriculum and the Ph.D. degree curriculum in the Nursing Program. How many additional course work units would an M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student take beyond the required 90 units in the Nursing Program? Answ er: 20 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. However, the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 28 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1. 12 units come from three courses in the nursing curriculum denoted as \"concentration\" courses that are taken in the M.A. degree in bioethics offerings. These three courses focus on the field in which the dissertation will be written. 2. 8 units come from two electives in the nursing curriculum that are taken in the M.A. degree in bioethics offerings. 3. 4 units come from one course in the nursing curriculum that is counted for M.A. degree in bioethics credit: NRSG 665 Philosophical Foundations of Nursing Science (4 units). 4. 4 units come from any one of the M.A. degree in bioethics courses that meet the School of Nursing Ph.D. degree requirement of one bioethics graduate-level course. How much course work would the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answer: 44 units. 4 units (from two 2-unit courses) are simply double counted. These two courses hav e sufficiently similar content to M.A. degree in bioethics courses that they warrant being applied to both the Ph.D.degree curriculum in the Nursing Program and the M.A. degree in the Bioethics Program (see item 3 above).The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 969How much course work is taken in the regular Ph.D. degree curriculum?

WALTERS, Program Director, Bioethics, School of Religion RASHID MOSAVIN, Program Director, School of Pharmacy FACULTY The faculty of the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is primarily drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Pharmacy and School of Religion.972 UNIVERSITY CATALOGThe program The M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is designed to fit the schedule of Pharm.D. students. Loma Linda University has been a leader in bioethics education for health-care professionals for nearly half a century. The Univesity's School of Pharmacy places a high premium on moral values and is a pioneer as the only pharmacy school in the nation to offer an M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program. How many additional course work units would an M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student take beyond the required 183 units for a Pharm.D.? Answer: 22 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. But the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 26 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1. 9 units come from three courses in the pharmacy curriculum that are counted for M.A. degree in bioethics credit: a) RXSA 545 Public Health and Lifestyles, b) RXSA 547 Pharmacy Law, and c) RXSA 751 Social-Behavioral Aspects of Pharmacy Practice Preventative Medicine. Acceptance of these 2-unit courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrativ e, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2. 8 units come from the deletion of three School of Religion courses because their content is duplicated by the Bioethics Program content. 3. 9 units of additional credit come from three electives in bioethics taken by Pharm.D. students. How much course work would the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answer: 39 units. Nine units are simply double counted\u2014the three pharmacy courses noted abov e. How much course work is taken in the regular pharmacy curriculum? Answ er: 175 units (rather than the standard 183). 8 units of the standard Pharm.D. program that are duplicated by content in the bioethics curriculum are deleted from the 183 units of the regular Pharm.D. degree total. What is the additional tuition cost for a Pharm.D. degree student who takes the M.A./ Pharm.D. combined degrees program? Answer: Fifty percent of tuition for additional M.A. degree courses. Tuition is cut in half for the 39 units of the M.A. degree in bioethics curriculum. Currently, this amounts to a $12,500 scholarship. How will Pharm.D. degree students be selected for this program? Students will be selected through a competitive process, led by the School of Pharmacy in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. The School of Pharmacy academic dean recommends students. The recommendation triggers a streamlined admissions process of the M.A. degree in bioethics. Four students per year are eligible for a half-tuition scholarship for this combined degrees program.The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 973M.A. degree requirements School of Pharmacy and School of Religion courses transferred from standard pharmacy course work RXSA 545 Public Health and Lifestyles 3.0 RXSA 547 Pharmacy Law 3.0 RXSA 751 Social-Behavioral Aspects of Pharmacy Practice 3.0 Totals 9.0 A model curriculum of bioethics course work taken throughout the four y ears of pharmacy school First year Spring QuarterRELE 567 World Religions and Bioethics 4.0 Spring QuarterRELE 565 The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Moral Aspects of Art and Illness 4.0 Totals 8.0 Second year Autumn QuarterRELE 542 Bioethics Integration I 1.0 Autumn QuarterRELE 543 Bioethics Integration II 1.0 Spring QuarterRELE 588 Explorers of the Moral Life 4.0 Totals 6.0 Third year Summer QuarterRELE 568 Bioethics and the Law 4.0 Summer QuarterRELE 589 Biblical Ethics 4.0 Autumn QuarterRELE 544 Bioethics Integration III 1.0 Autumn QuarterRELE 564 Ethics and Health Disparities 4.0 Winter QuarterRELE 566 Heroes of Health Care 4.0 Spring QuarterRELE 555 Clinical Ethics Practicum II 4.0 Totals 21.0974 UNIVERSITY CATALOGFourth year Winter QuarterRELE 598 Master's Seminar I 2.0 Spring QuarterRELE 599 Master's Seminar II 2.0 Totals 4.0 Overall Totals 39.0 BIOETHICS\u2014SR with PSYCHOLOGY\u2014BH M.A./PSY.D.

The program This program combines study for the M.A. degree in bioethics (offered by the School of Religion) with either the Psy.D. or Ph.D. degree in psychology (offered by the Department of Psychology of the School of Behavioral Health). The purpose of the combined degrees program is to facilitate more efficient completion of graduate programs in ethics and psychology for the student interested in both areas. Students who complete the program should be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the fields of psychology and of ethics. In order to enter this combined degrees program, students must gain separate acceptance into the M.A. degree in ethics curriculum and to one of the doctoral degrees in psychology. Admission information is available from the School of Behavioral Health. Course requirements Students in this combined degrees program will complete all the requirements for both degrees with greater efficiency by taking a number of courses that fulfill requirements for both degrees. Approv al for selective courses should be sought from the student's advisors for both degrees. M.A. curriculum A total of 48 quarter units is required for the M.A. degree.

WALTERS, Program Director, Bioethics CHRISTIANE SCHUBERT, Program Director, Social Policy and Social Research, Department of Social Work and Social Ecology FACULTY The faculty for the combined degrees Bioethics with Social Policy and Social Research Program is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology in the School of Behavioral Health. Purpose of the program The purpose of the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees Bioethics with Social Policy and Social Research Program is to facilitate an integrated and more efficient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interests in both bioethics and social policy. Students who complete this combined degrees program will be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the field of social policy and ethics. Individuals working in the area of social policy must be able to undertake and publish research on social problems. This requires the ability to apply ethical theory to real-world policy scenarios. Graduates will be able to provide leadership to the social policy arena by conducting interdisciplinary research on various issues and agendas that have significant moral implications. Course work requirements To enter the proposed program, students must gain separate acceptance to both graduate programs. To the extent possible, research projects in both programs focus on the interface of ethics and social policy. How many additional course work units would an M.A./Ph.D degree student take beyond the required 105 Social Policy and Social Research Program units? Answ er: 16 units. If an M.A. degree in bioethics is taken as a stand-alone degree, the requirement is 48 units. How ever, the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 32 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1. 16 units from four courses in the social policy curriculum count toward the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements because of their similarity to ethics-type courses. Those courses are a) SPOL 613 and SPOL 614: Social Science Concepts I and II, b) SPOL 655: Research Methods II, c) SPOL 615: Economic Theory and Social Policy. 2. 12 units from electives in the social policy curriculum are taken in the master's degree in bioethics curriculum. 3. 4 units come from one bioethics course in the social policy curriculum that is already required: RELE 588: Explorers of the Moral Life.The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 977How much course work would the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum?

CLINICAL MINISTRY\u2014SR with MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014BH M.A./M.S. SIROJ SORAJJAKOOL, Program Director, Clinical Ministry MARY E. MOLINE, Program Director, Counseling and Family Sciences FACULTY The faculty for the combined degrees Clinical Ministry with Marital and Family Therapy program is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences in the School of Behavioral Health. The program The combined Master of Arts degree in clinical ministry and the Master of Science degree in marital and family therapy (MFAM) have many common subject areas, such as the spiritual and clinical emphasis in caring for the whole person. The joining of the two degree curricula provides the student with the added Christian clinical counseling skills needed to minister to many spiritual and mental health problems. The marital and family therapy degree also prepares the student for a clinical license. Licensure allows the student in the M.A./M.S. combined degrees program more options for practice, including priv ate practice. The student's ability to provide more services to the community\u2014in addition to the traditional areas of practice, such as hospitals, churches, and schools\u2014is increased. Objectives The combined degrees Clinical Ministry with Marital and Family Therapy Program has the following objectives: 1. Students will gain clinical skills related to the field of spiritual care and marriage and family therapy that will enable them to become competent practitioners. 2. Students will learn to integrate theoretical, theological, biblical, and philosophical foundations pertaining to the study of spirituality and marriage and family therapy.980 UNIVERSITY CATALOG3. Students will be able to identify spiritual issues within the context of marital relations and health care and offer spiritual interventions. 4. Students will be knowledgeable of the legal and ethical standards relevant to the fields of chaplaincy and marital and family therapy and apply their knowledge to their clinical practice. The family clinical ministry track provides the basis for doctoral work in mental health and religious studies. Outstanding students are encouraged to explore possibilities for further studies. Admission Applicants will need to apply to both programs separately, be accepted to both programs separately, and follow their admission requirements in order to qualify for the combined degree.

(See \"Combined degrees\" programs in the School of Dentistry.) MEDICAL SCIENTIST\u2014SM (M.D. WITH PH.D.) The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and w ant to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies (IGBS) graduate programs (anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, pharmacology, and physiology). In the first year, students participate in a scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first y ear, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement in individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees may also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two-to-three y ears. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum.988 UNIVERSITY CATALOGUpon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination.
