It's not always easy to determine what causes low energy, as many different factors can contribute to acute or chronic symptoms of fatigue. Sometimes, low energy is the result of an underlying medical condition; in other cases, it's due to daily habits or lifestyle factors. Some common causes of low energy are: - Extreme physical activity - Excessive alcohol use - Poor sleep habits - Unhealthy diet - Certain medications - Hormone imbalance Some common medical conditions that might cause low energy are: - Anxiety or depression - Diabetes - Cancer - Heart disease - Chronic inflammation - Autoimmune conditions If you have an underlying medical condition combined with poor eating or lifestyle habits, you may experience even more symptoms of low energy. What are the symptoms of low energy? Symptoms of low energy can be similar to symptoms of a mood disorder or another chronic condition. Some common symptoms are: - Lack of initiative - Mental fatigue or poor concentration - Tiring easily after activities - Sleep disturbances or insomnia - Muscle or joint pain - Headaches - Feeling lethargic and run down despite rest Low energy isn't the same as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which is a condition characterized by consistently low energy over several months or years.
