In your breast, armpit and neck there are also collections of lymph nodes. These are small glands, each about the size of a pea, that drain your breast of lymph fluid, helping your body fight infection and disease. Your chest muscles and ribs lie beneath your breasts. You may notice that your breasts are slightly different in shape or size or that one is slightly higher than the other - this is very common. If your breasts have always been like this, these differences are normal. "}
