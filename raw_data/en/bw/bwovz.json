It contains all the nece ssary information to give the drug safely. However, those centres who have a firm local policy in place which differs in administration detail (but not dose) from the suggestions put forwa rd here can administer high dose methotrexate within UKALL14 according to their local policies. One week before admission for the 1st methotrexate infusion the Cre atine Clearance (measured according to local practice) should be determined. The initial Creatinine Clearance before starting methotrexate should ideally be > 100 mls/minute. Patients with a clearance between 80-100 mls / minute before the first dose of High Dose Methotrexate MUST have a measured Creatinine clearance (24 urine collection) BEF ORE the second dose and dose adjustments (as above ) made if the result is less than 80 mls /minute. Also repeat Creatinine Clearance before the 2nd infusion if there is de layed methotrexate excretion after the first course. Based on a dose of 3g/m 2of Methotrexate and renal function pre-treatment use Dose redu ctions as follows: Pre 100% 50-80 mls/min 50 % <50 mls/min 0 CrCl(ml/min) Dose > 50 mls/min 100% <50 mls/min 0 % Consult the TMG if in any doubt regarding the high dose methotrexa te. METICULOUS ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID AT ALL TIMES TO C HANGES IN CREATININE CLEARANCE DURING THE HIGH DOSE METHOTREXATE PHASE. (B OTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN EACH COURSE OF METHOTREXATE). On admission for each methotrexate infusion, measure: xSerum creatinine xBilirubin and AST or ALT potassium xFBC UKALL14 - Protocol - v5.0 20.07.12 Page 131 of 134 Guidelines for dosing high dose methotrexate in Liv er impairment Bilirubin (micromol/L) AST Dose <50 And < 180 100% 51-85 Or > 180 75% > 85 Contraindicated It is expected that patients receiving high dose methotrexate will dev elop hypertransaminasemia and occasionally hyperbilirubinemia.These elevations can last up to 2 weeks follo wing the methotrexate infusion and are not considered toxicities requiring discontinuation of repe ated administration of methotrexate. Persistant hyperbilirubinemia and/or grade 3-4 hypertransaminasemia for longer than 3 weeks should result in discontinuation of the drug. Dose reduce, particularly in patients with concomitantly impaired renal function. The drug is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Pre-hydration - For at least 6 hours prior to the commencement of the intravenous m ethotrexate. Hydration fluid - 1 litre dextrose saline which has been added 50 mmol sodium bicarbo nate and 20 mmol potassium chloride. Infusion rate - 125 ml/m 2/hour. Check urine pH - Adjust the sodium bicarbonate concentration to maintain the urin ary pH between 7 and 8 (i.e. alkaline). A urinary pH of 7.5 or greater must be ac hieved before starting the methotrexate infusion. Alternating bags of sodium chloride 0.9% and glucose is 10% (i.e. 300 mg/m 2) given over 1 hour (loading dose) in 200 mls sodium chloride 0.9% 90% (i.e. 2700 mg/m 2) given over next 23 hours in 1 litre sodium chloride 0.9% NOTE: The infusion of methotrexate must always stop at 24 hours even if not c ompleted for any reason. FOLINIC ACID RESCUE MUST START AT 36 HOURS FROM THE START OF METHOTREXATE. The first dose of folinic acid (to be given at 36 hours after the start o f methotrexate infusion) must be written up at the time of prescribing the methotrexate infusion. Dosage of folinic 15 mg/m 2iv every 3 hours. From then on: Give doses as per table below until methotrexate level is le ss than 0.1micromol/litre. Monitoring of plasma methotrexate levels following in fusion . Times given are from time 0 (time of starting intravenous methotre xate infusion). The following plasma samples are required for patient's safe rescue with folinic acid: 48 hours, 72 hours, and then every 24 hours until methotrexat e level is less than 0.1micromol/litre Table for the calculation of folinic acid rescue on t he basis of MTX plasma levels. Time after starting MTX folinic acid is required provided MTX levels are below 0.1 mic romol/litre at 48h. b Dose and schedule of folinic acid: q6h = every 6 hours. c At time points after 120h folinic acid administration should be continu ed as recommended for 120h. Hydration regimen during and after completion of intra venous methotrexate infusion Continue to infuse at a rate of 125 ml/m 2/hour for a minimum of 48 hours after start of methotrexate wit h: 1L dextrose saline containing 50 mmol of sodium bicarbonate and 20 mmo l potassium chloride. Alternating bags of sodium chloride 0.9% and glucose 5% is acceptab le. Continue to ensure that urinary pH is above 7 by adjusting sodium bic arbonate dose. After 48 hours from the start of the intravenous methotrexate, ENSURE a combined oral and/or intravenous intake greater than 3 litres/m 2/24 hours until plasma methotrexate levels<0.1 micromols/litre. Check fluid balance at regular intervals (at least 4-hourly) thro ugh each day, taking early action if fluid overload occurs by giving furosemide if the urine output falls below 40 0 ml/m 2in any given 4-hour period. Other investigations during folinic acid rescue: Daily Creatinine, sodium and potassium. Alternate days Bilirubin, AST, ALT, albumin, full blood count. These investigations should also be checked at least twice during the week following the first and second methotrexate infusion to detect any toxicity that might occur.

Avoid concurrent u se of Non steroidal anti inflamatories (NSAIDs) including salicylates and sulphonamides . Large doses of penicillin may interfere with the active renal tubular secr etion of methotrexate. It is recommended that prophylactic co-trimoxazole be stopped one week before high dose MTX therapy, until maintenance therapy starts. "}
