That includes cleaning hacks that can help you accomplish two things at once, like clean your carpets and freshen the air in your home! That's exactly what the vacuum hack in this post does, and it's so easy to do! With this simple tip, you can take advantage of the air moving in and out of your vacuum to freshen the air while you pick up dust, dirt, and pet hair off your floors. How To Freshen The Air While You Vacuum It couldn't be easier: just add a few drops of your [essential oil or oil blend](https://shop.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/collections/essential-oils) of choice to a cotton ball, then place the cotton ball in your vacuum's dust cup. As you vacuum, the air flow will disperse the scent of the essential oil and freshen the air as you go \u2014 sort of like a diffuser! (If your vacuum doesn't have a dust cup, stir a few drops of essential oils into a handful of baking soda and sprinkle it over your carpet. Let it sit for a few minutes, then vacuum it up \u2014 it will have a similar effect!) I'm always amazed at just how well this little trick works! You'll be shocked by how effortlessly you can infuse your home with the delightful aroma of your favorite essential oils. 7 Essential Oils To Use With This Vacuum Hack 1.
