However, scholarships and fellowships can greatly alleviate the financial burden of paying for graduate school. This section will walk you through information relevant to seeking scholarships and fellowships to afford graduate school. FINANCING GRADUATE SCHOOL APPLICATIONS Financing graduate school applications can be costly; however, there are a number of resources that can help. Please see \"Graduate School Preparation and Application Assistance Programs\" above for a list of those open to undocumented students. In addition, many graduate programs offer application fee waivers for low-income individuals. Even if a program does not list publically on its website that they offer fee waivers, it would be a good idea to call or email someone in the office to inquire about potentially being considered for a fee waiver. For some professional school programs whose admissions process is organized through a centralized system (namely law and medical schools), see specific information below. We also recommend you investigate directly with the graduate programs you are applying to and let them know that you do not have enough income to afford application fees and would like to request a fee waiver. Be prepared to show your tax documents (W-2 and 1040 forms), as the school is likely to request them as verification of your income. If you receive an unfavorable response from staff, try contacting the school's graduate diversity office as they may be more sensitive to diverse student applicants. For Medical School Applicants: Medical school applications are administered through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), which offers low-income individuals reduced MCAT exam fees and free medical school application to a number of schools through their Fee Assistance Program (FAP). Unfortunately, this program is currently not open to undocumented individuals. After completing the primary application through AMCAS, schools will offer applicants secondary applications individually administered through the schools. Applicants may request fee waivers for secondary applications by emailing the school's admission offices; many schools will grant them on a case-by-case basis regardless of legal status. For Law School Applicants: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients may complete the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) Fee Waiver Application (below), to apply for the following: fee waivers for two Law School Admission Tests (LSAT) per two-year fee waiver period; registration for LSAC's Credential Assembly Service (CAS), which assists students in gathering all the necessary documentation for online law applications; four free law school reports; and a copy of The Official LSAT SuperPrep . \u00bbLSAC Fee Waiver Application: http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/ usfeewaiverinstructions.pdf WHAT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS? There exist many opportunities to fund graduate studies in the form of scholarships, fellowships and grants. Below is a brief description of each: Scholarships offer financial support to individuals pursuing a college education and are often referred to as fellowships for individuals pursuing graduate studies. Fellowships are designed to provide financial support to graduate students in pursuit of their advanced degree studies. Selection criteria for fellowships can include an applicant's ethnicity, personal qualities, academic performance, field of study, and/or financial need. Fellowships are sponsored by either internal graduate school or external funds and usually cover educational and living expenses. Often, fellowships require individuals to teach, perform research or work in a specific lab as terms of the program.1 Grants offer graduate students financial support to conduct their research projects. They usually cover expenses related to the individual's specific project such as computer software, laboratory supplies, travel costs, and conference fees. Applications for 1\"Fellowships, \" from UC Berkeley Graduate Division worksheet, \" What everyone needs to know about funding for Graduate School .\"50 grants often require a research proposal and detailed itemization of expenses relating to the project. In addition, there exist loan repayment programs, teaching assistant positions, private loans, and individual fundraising efforts that assist in financing graduate school. This guide only covers information on scholarships and fellowships. WHERE TO LOOK FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS You can find funding opportunities through: \u00bbA school's graduate division website and specific department website (we recommend you contact department staff to direct you to resources) \u00bbConversations with graduate students in your field or program of interest \u00bbProfessional associations - nonprofit organizations that seek to further a particular profession \u00bbSearch engines such as www.fastweb.com, www. finaid.org, and GRAPES -a searchable database of funding opportunities for students pursuing master's and doctoral programs maintained by UCLA: http:// www.gdnet.ucla.edu/grpinst.htm.2 Also, be on the lookout for grant writing classes offered by nonprofit organizations or your university! WHAT SHOULD I BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR? When searching for funding opportunities, be on the lookout for: Full-ride fellowships: multi-year packages that often cover educational and living expenses for several years Fellowships for specific phases of graduate study: \u00bbPre-doctoral Fellowships - Administered by private foundations, public research agencies and universities; they are often multi-year. Students granted multi-year fellowships are often required to teach for one year of their graduate program. Teaching year may be negotiated with the department before accepting fellowship based on the individual's situation (e.g. DACA eligible -yes/ no). \u00bb Dissertation Fellowships - Financial awards for individuals who have completed graduate coursework to complete their dissertation. \u00bb Post-doctoral Fellowships - Financial awards for individuals who have recently earned a PhD to continue research projects in their field. \u00bbSmall grants for specific purposes such as: \u00bbTravel -Covers expenses related to travel such as flight, hotel, and taxi fare. \u00bbSummer -Covers expenses for summer activities relevant to your field of study. \u00bbConference attendance -Covers expenses for conference attendance such as travel and conference registration. 3 HOW TO INQUIRE ABOUT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS If you find a program that requires a social security number or has residency requirements, you might want to ask for more information about these requirements. If you are a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient, see specific \"Advice for DACA Recipients\" below. Consider asking: \"Are residency requirements fixed?\" or \"Can students who do not meet the residency requirement still apply?\" Note: Students with pending family petitions usually have a form called I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative). Although it might take years for this petition to become current, some scholarships have accepted the I-130 as proof of residency. 2\"Funding Opportunities, \" from UC Berkeley Graduate Division worksheet, \"What everyone needs to know about funding for Graduate School .\" 3\"What Should I Be on the Lookout For?\" from UC Berkeley Graduate Division worksheet, \"What everyone needs to know about funding for Graduate School. \"51 \"Can students use an ITIN (Individual Tax Identification Number) instead of a SSN (Social Security Number)?\" Scholarship awards can be processed with just the student's name and address. If a scholarship or fellowship specifically requests a SSN, ask if it is possible to submit an ITIN instead. Find an advocate to help you. If you're uncomfortable, ask your counselor or teacher to inquire on your behalf. Make sure that whoever makes the call is knowledgeable about your immigration status. Don't lie about your status. If it turns out that the scholarship or fellowship has specific residency requirements, just move on and look for another scholarship. If the scholarship catches you lying, your award will likely be revoked. ADVICE FOR DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS (DACA) RECIPIENTS The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, announced by President Obama on June 15, 2012, has widened the number of scholarships and fellowships (hereafter referred to as \"scholarships\") available to undocumented students. DACA is a renewable government program that, among other benefits, gives eligible undocumented youth work authorization, a social security number, and permission to stay in the country for two years. For more information about the program, check out E4FC's Deferred Action Resources on our website: http://e4fc. org/legalservices/deferredactionresources.html. Historically, many scholarships have excluded undocumented students because they do not have valid social security numbers, work authorization, and/ or lawful presence in the United States. DACA offers an opportunity for scholarship providers to re-evaluate their policies regarding undocumented students. Nationwide we have already seen some scholarship providers change their policies and allow DACA recipients to apply. However, most scholarship providers do not know about the program yet and/or have not re- evaluated their policies. Because DACA is a new program, it is important for DACA recipients to educate scholarship providers about the DACA program and the opportunities it affords to recipients. While some scholarship providers may continue to restrict their eligibility to U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, we hope that many will decide to allow DACA recipients to apply. To help DACA recipients determine whether a scholarship might consider them for their award, we have created the following guidelines: Investigate whether the scholarship is government-funded. Scholarships that are funded by government dollars have very strict eligibility criteria limiting their scholarships to legal U.S. residents. If you find that a scholarship is government funded, we recommend you save your time and energy and not apply for the scholarship. Some examples of government-funded organizations include the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). To investigate if a scholarship is funded through the government, you can do a quick web search of the scholarship by looking up the organization's website, scanning their homepage and looking for an \"About Us\" section. This section should describe if the organization/scholarship is privately or publicly (government) funded. Privately funded non-profit organizations are often described as 501(c)(3) organizations\u2014they include private or family foundations, community foundations and civic or charitable organizations. Some privately- owned businesses and corporations also offer scholarships. Ask the scholarship provider if there is a U.S. citizenship or permanent residency requirement for the scholarship. If the scholarship appears to be privately funded, we recommend you carefully review the eligibility criteria for the scholarship. If the scholarship criteria include a U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residency requirement, we suggest you send an email to the scholarship provider. Search for a \"Contact us\" section on their website. You can ask a question such as, \"I would like to apply for your scholarship, but I am not a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. Is there any possibility that I can be considered for your scholarship?\" (Please see \"How to Inquire about Scholarship Requirements\" for additional tips). Ask the scholarship provider why there is a U.S. citizenship or permanent residency requirement. If the scholarship provider responds 52 that they do have a residency requirement, carefully investigate why this is the case. They might provide a response such as \"scholarship recipients must be eligible to work after graduation\" or \"we don't want international students applying to our scholarship\" or \"students need a SSN for tax purposes\". If their response falls along these lines, we strongly advise you to educate the provider about the DACA program, the benefits to DACA recipients, and your particular situation. You might try writing something like, \"While I am not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, I am a recipient of the federal government's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. This grants me lawful presence, a social security number, and the ability to work legally in this country. Furthermore, I have lived and attended school here in _______ since I was _____ years old and fully intend to remain here after I graduate from college. Is there any possibility that I can be considered for your scholarship?\" If, however, the scholarship provider responds with something such as \"our donors have set the eligibility requirements\" or \"we have a firm stance on this policy\" or \"at this moment we do not support undocumented applicants, \" then it is unlikely you will be able to apply to their scholarship this year and we advise you to look elsewhere. However, do not let these negative responses discourage you! Simply by making inquiries and sharing your story, you are making scholarship organizations aware of the DACA program and DACA recipients' need for financial support. The more inquiries from DACA recipients that scholarship providers receive, the more likely they will be to re-evaluate their policies. You are making a difference just by courageously making the ask! BEST PRACTICES WHEN APPLYING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS Seek resources in your undergraduate campus. We strongly urge you to utilize your campus career center and to search for allies on campus to assist you with graduate school and funding applications. Career centers often have resources for graduate school applicants such as workshops on applying to graduate programs and funding opportunities, counselors that provide assistance in editing essays for applications, a letter service program to store letters of recommendation, and more. We also recommend to search for an ally on campus to help you with graduate school and fellowship applications. This individual can provide guidance on fellowships and programs to apply to, provide assistance editing essays for applications, and be your advocate when inquiring about eligibility criteria for programs. This person can be a major advisor, counselor, professor, an undergraduate research advisor, or a trusted mentor. In addition, it is helpful to contact undocumented student groups -either on or off campus -to inquire if anyone is aware of individuals or resources to help you through the application process (please visit \"Additional Resources\" above for regional and national undocumented student groups). Seek an ally within your graduate program of interest. Navigating through the graduate application process and seeking graduate funding opportunities as an undocumented student can be overwhelming. Finding an ally in the graduate program or school you are planning to apply to can help you through the process. An ally can guide you to resources at the school, connect you with other individuals that may have knowledge of scholarships and fellowships you may be eligible for, be your advocate when communicating with other departments such as financial aid, and provide encouragement and emotional support. Try asking professors you are familiar with if they know of welcoming faculty or staff at your school of interest. You can also try a web search of faculty members whose work aligns with your research interests and send a friendly email where you introduce yourself, express your interest in the school, and ask to learn more about their graduate program (sharing a curriculum vitae where you detail your academic and work experience can help them learn about you). A phone call or web conference may help in establishing a relationship with this individual. Once you submit your graduate school application, keep this ally informed about any updates on your application. Be sure to thank this person for their assistance and time! Letters of recommendation are essential! Letters of recommendation are essential in graduate school admissions and in fellowship and scholarship applications. They can often be the determining factor if a student should be admitted and receive financial awards. Letters should be requested as early as possible, but no less than one month prior to the application deadline to give recommenders time to 53 write strong letters. Provide your recommender with a polished CV; unofficial transcripts; a solid draft of your statement of purpose; fellowship essay or grant proposal; and a cover letter with information you would like them to address in their letter of recommendation. Ask recommenders if they would like reminders as the deadlines approach -it is important that they submit their letter on time for you to have a complete application. Some programs will not accept late letters of recommendation and will consider your application incomplete if all letters are not submitted on time. Be sure to send a thank-you note to your recommender once your application is complete and update them on the status of your application! Be conscious about disclosing personal details in applications. Many graduate fellowships select recipients based on the applicant's academic achievements, scholarly endeavors or specific field of study. In contrast, many undergraduate scholarships greatly take into consideration an applicant's personal characteristics, challenges he/she overcame, and significant life experiences. Carefully read through application essay prompts and evaluate how much personal information is appropriate to disclose. If personal experiences have greatly contributed to your interest in graduate studies, sharing this information with the selection committee can make you a strong candidate for the award yet divulging personal details not explicitly requested for in the application can distract scholarship readers or leave less space for you to share other information the selection committee is looking for. Keep organized to maximize opportunities! It is essential to carefully read through application guidelines, keep track of deadlines and search for separate fellowship applications (if any) when applying to graduate school. \u00bbCarefully read through eligibility criteria and other guidelines -in addition to citizenship requirements, there may be GPA, field of study, degree (pursuing a Master's, Ph.D. or professional degree), or geographic (where you are from or where your school is located) requirements. To save time, be sure you are eligible for the fellowship or graduate program. Also, keep track of additional application guidelines such as submitting all requested documents and materials. \u00bbKeep track of deadlines as to not miss out on opportunities -most programs do not accept late applications and do not make exceptions. To help ensure you have a complete application by the deadline, keep your letter-writers organized by sending friendly reminders about the application due date. \u00bbTake note of additional application requirements for incoming student fellowships! Graduate programs often offer fellowships for incoming students. Though you may automatically be considered for these fellowships when submitting your graduate school application, some fellowships require a separate application and have a different due date than the program application. Apply to graduate school and fellowship programs early. Many graduate programs offer acceptances to graduate school and financial aid awards on a rolling basis. Thus the earlier you apply, the greater chance you have of receiving financial awards. In addition, as an undocumented applicant, there may be unforeseen obstacles in processing your application that may require staff time to resolve the issue. Applying early can ensure that your application will be reviewed and considered for awards. In addition, many Ph.D. fellowship applications now use application interfaces (e.g. Interfolio) that may be tricky to navigate. Start early on the application, even before completing essays, resume, etc. to familiarize yourself with the application interface to avoid unexpected technical challenges. Some interfaces require a subscription fee. We recommend applying at least one month before the application due date if possible! Keep on trying! Don't get discouraged if you don't receive an award the first time you apply! You can often ask the fellowship or grant program for feedback on your application. Inquire what you can do to strengthen your application for the next cycle! In addition, you can search for programs that have similar application requirements and submit a revised application.
