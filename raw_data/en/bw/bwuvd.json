Generally speaking, naturopathy or naturopathic medicine involves preventing disease, assessing and supporting conditions of the body and mind. It is a complementary form of functional medicine , in the sense that it aims to find the underlying cause of the condition(s) and to treat the whole person, mind and body, rather than just focus on treating only symptoms. Naturopathy helps your body and mind get back to an optimum state of health and well-being by drawing up on your natural healing abilities, whilst working at helping to prevent chronic disease in the future. NATUROPATHY CAN DO FOR YOU As a naturopath, I use a combination of different modalities in order to help my patients gain their way back to their natural state of balance and well-being, and when appropriate, may give advice on: - nutrition and lifestyle: ' We are what we eat ', a naturopathic diet works to prevent illness, increase energy and improve overall health. - gentle detoxification protocols - supplements - Bach Flowers - herbal remedies - and Tissue Salts and homeopathy My naturopathic practice is enriched from and infused with my Chinese Medicine training and I often use Chinese Medicine diagnostic tools such as tongue observation and pulse-taking in order to refine my naturopathic diagnosis. Why see a Naturopath? The role of a Naturopath is to recognise and remove the obstructions to the healing process. A Naturopath will aim to: - address the underlying cause of imbalance or dysfunction, and not treat only the symptoms - treat the person as a whole 'body, mind and spirit' - support the body's own healing ability - develop and discuss realistic strategies to maintain good health with their patients and therefore - empower the patient to take care of and work on their own health and well-being, and to make the lifestyle changes necessary for the best possible health. What happens during your naturopathic consultation? Before we meet for the first time, I will ask you to complete and return a health questionnaire and a 3 to 7- day food diary , at least 48 hours prior to your consultation so that we can maximise our time together. A first naturopathic consultation includes a thorough discussion about : - the conditions you would like me to help you with - your current and previous health, diet and lifestyle habits, personal and family medical history, current medications and supplements you take among others . This results in your personalised nutrition and lifestyle plan - tongue + nail observation and diagnosis , pulse-taking and diagnosis - your treatment plan, with personalised nutrition, supplements and lifestyle recommendations. When appropriate, I may recommend laboratory testing * , or refer for additional therapies. During your initial consultation, we will usually schedule a follow-up appointment usually 4-6 weeks later for a thorough update on your condition and improvement, review your test results and finetune / recalibrate the naturopathic protocol if need be. PLEASE NOTE THAT outside of each appointment, dedicated time, thought and care is spent on your personal plan, which will be sent to you by email following your appointment. A note on how I practise as a complementary practitioner I am a complementary medicine practitioner, which means I work within safe guidelines and will refer you back to your primary care GP or other healthcare practitioner if something is outside my scope of practice. Naturopaths do not diagnose or treat specific diseases, but work with the whole person to support digestive, hormonal, immune, nervous systems among others in order to support you towards better health and vitality. It also works well alongside conventional medicine. Although naturopaths do not treat specific illnesses in the way a GP might do, there are certain conditions that respond well to naturopathy therapy. All patients will need to confirm in writing that any prescription medications they are taking under the care of a their GP or other healthcare practitioner or consultant will not be withdrawn without their knowledge or supervision. (*) Most of my work is carried out in clinic . However, if I feel that functional testing would help to identify the causes of specific symptoms, I may advise you to consult with your GP for routine blood tests or recommend laboratory testing for a more comprehensive diagnostic testing. The price of these tests vary and payment is made directly to the laboratory. bottom of page "}
