Measure save response burden and leverage NIH investment. Prior to clinic visit, patient notified to complete measures specific to their condition (e.g., PASTOR, MOTION). PROCR data fulfills two essential clinical needs. User -Case -Specific Report Shared with patient to improve communication and inform individual treatment plans. Seamless Flow from Collection to Application Data Repository Big data resource for clinical research and health utilization studies.MOTION A Use Case focused on musculoskeletal health. Includes measures specific to musculoskeletal outcomes, readiness, and screening.PROCR Communities (Use Cases) All Use Cases (functional communities) utilize Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) PROMIS scales. PROMIS CAT scales save response burden & leverage NIH investments. A common set of PROMIS measures will be collected across Use Cases . PROMIS can be configured to meet Use Case needs, such as collecting additional data unique to their focus areas.Assessment & Data Collection Data captured via the MHS Enterprise platform fill critical unmet needs.Registration & Demographics Patients are registered into the PROCR via a MHS Enterprise platform. PASTOR A Use Case for pain & functional assessment. Includes measures on pain, functioning, pain-related psychosocial factors, screening & treatment history.
