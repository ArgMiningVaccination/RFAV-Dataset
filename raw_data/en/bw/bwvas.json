BOX 83720 BOISE, ID 83720 -0306 (208) 332 -1820 July 2016 Page 2 PREFACE WHY IS THERE A FOOD CODE? Foodborne illness in the United States is a major cause of personal distress, preventable death, and avoidable economic burden. It has been estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 48 million illnesses, 128 ,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths each year. Epidemiological outbreak data repeatedly identify five major risk factors related to EMPLOYEE behaviors and preparation practices in retail and FOOD SERVICE ESTABLI SHMENTS as contributing to foodborne illness: Improper holding temperatures , Inadequate cooking of FOODS , such as undercooking EGGS , Contaminated EQUIPMENT , FOOD from unsafe sources, and Poor personal hygiene The FOOD Code addresses controls for risk factors and further establishes five key public health interventions to protect CONSUMER health. Specifically, these interventions are: demonstration of knowledge, EMPLOYEE health controls, controlling hands as a vehicle of contamination, time and temperature parameters for controlling pathogens, and the CONSUMER advisory. The first two interventions are found in Chapter 2 and the last three in Chapter 3. WHO IS RES PONSIBLE FOR FOOD SAFETY? It is a shared responsibility of the FOOD industry and the government to ensure that FOOD provided to the CONSUMER is safe and does not become a vehicle in a disease outbreak or in the trans mission of communicable disease. This s hared responsibility extends to ensuring that CONSUMER expectations are met and that FOOD in un ADULTERATED , prepared in a clean environment, and honestly presented. Accordingly, the provisions of the FOOD Code provide a system of prevention and overlapping safeguards designed to minimize foodborne illness, as well as ensure EMPLOYEE health, industry manager knowledge, safe FOOD , nontoxic and cleanable EQUIPMENT , and acceptable levels of SANITATION on FOOD ESTABLISHMENT PREMISES ; and promote fair dealings with the CONSUMER . WHAT ARE UNIFORM S TANDARDS? The FOOD Code provides well -written scientifically sound, and up -to-date standards that are recognized as an advantage by industry and governmental officials. Industry conformance with acceptable procedures is much more likely where regulatory officials \"speak with one voice\" about what is required to protect the public health , why it is important, and which alternatives for compliance may be accepted. It is useful to business in t hat it provides accepted standards that can be applied in training and quality assurance programs. INFORMATION TO ASSIS T THE USER CHAPT ER THROUGH SUBPARAGR APH: FOOD Code provisions address essentially four areas: personnel (Chapter 2), food (Chapter 3), equipment /facilities/supplies (Chapter 4, 5, 6, 7), and compliance and enforcement (Chapter 8). The structural nomenclature of the document is as follows: Chapter 9 Part IN ITALI CS: Portions of some sections are written in italics . The provisions are not requirements, but are provided to convey relevant information about specific exceptions and alternative means for compliance. CRITICAL, NONCRITICA L, AND POTENTIALLY -CRITICAL ITEM Requirements contained in the FOOD Code are presented as being in one of three categories of importance: CRITICAL ITEMS ; POTENTIALLY -CRITICAL ITEMS (i.e., those that may or may not be critical; dependin g on the circumstances); and NONCRITICAL ITEMS . A bold, superscripted letter P after a tagline (which is the language immediately following a section number that introduces the subject of the section) indicates that all of the provisions within that section are CRITICAL unless otherwise indicated, as follows: Any provisions that are POTENTIALLY -CRITICAL ITEMS are followed by the bold, superscripted letter Pf . Any unmarked provisions within a section that has a bold, superscripted letter P tagline are CRITICAL ITEMS . All provisions following a tagline that is not marked with a P are NONCRITICAL ITEMS . DEFINED WORDS IN CAP S: Defined words and terms are capitalized in the text of the FOOD Code chapters to alert the reader to the fact that there is a specific meaning assigned to those words and terms and that the meaning of a provision is to be inte rpreted in the defined context. A concerted effort was also made to capitalize all forms and combinations of those defined words and terms that were intended to carry the weight of the definition. IDAHO CHANGES TO THE FOOD CODE: Additions, m odifications and deletions added by the State of Idaho are preceded by the letters IDAPA and the section numbers from the Idaho Administrative Rules 16.02.19 - FOOD SAFETY AND SANITATION STANDARDS FOR FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS (THE IDAHO FOOD CODE).
