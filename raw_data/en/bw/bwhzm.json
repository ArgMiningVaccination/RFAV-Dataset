Humanitarian aid agencies have been delivering water by trucks, and while this has ensured Syrians have adequate non-contaminated water, it has come at a financial and environmental cost. Water sources are being depleted and aid agencies are spending considerable sums to provide a service that is not sustainable. This study looks at the obstacles to providing more sustainable solutions: extending piped public water to settlements, focusing on the financial, social and legal feasibility requirements. A multi-level governance approach is recommended to address water supply to all affected communities.
