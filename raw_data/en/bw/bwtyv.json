Many travellers increasingly want more out of their holiday than spending a fortnight on a sun lounger. Those precious few weeks are a chance to recharge and - for some - get a helping hand to attain those long-held goals to finally get fit, address a niggling health concern or de-stress. It's not all about coming home with a six pack, but rather seeking a more transformative element to the time away. Needless to say, the industry is taking notice of this shift. This month, the luxurious, beachside Mandarin Oriental (00 90 252 311 1888; [mandarinoriental.com](http://mandarinoriental.com)) hotel in Bodrum, Turkey, launched a new collaboration with the US's prestigious Mayo Clinic.

Prices start from \u20ac950 per person, per night.
