The main question it aims to answer are: Is TG01/QS-21 vaccination safe and tolerable for this patient group? Is TG01/QS-21 vaccination treatment efficient in this group in terms of increased overall response rate, overall survival rate, progression-free survival, and time til next treatment? Is there an immunological response to the vaccine? Participants will be given TG01/QS-21 vaccination treatment. Treatment consists of 12 doses of TG01/QS-21 vaccine given every two weeks in the first 12 weeks, followed by every eight weeks until week 52. | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years and Over| |Gender||All| | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. Experimental: TG01 TG01 is a sterile lyophilizate consisting of a mixture of seven peptides. The finished product is a white powder for injection, consisting only of the active substances containing 2.1 mg of peptides (individual peptides comprising 0.3 mg each). The lyophilizate is to be reconstituted with QS-21 for injection before use. QS-21 is a naturally occurring saponin molecule purified from the South American tree Quillaja saponaria Molina. QS-21 Solution is supplied in a 2 mL CZ resin vial as a sterile, solution in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL QS-21 (500 mcg/mL) with each vial containing 0.7 mL intended single use only. The vaccine will be given subcutaneously Treatment consists of 12 doses TG01/QS-21 vaccine given every 2 weeks in the first 12 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until week 52. TG01 dose 0.7 mg dose and QS-21 50 ug. Biological: - TG01 All participants will receive the same treatment as described under arm If you are interested in learning more about this trial, find the trial site nearest to your location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone.
