In the study, the drug reduced the number of deaths by one-third for people on ventilators, and by one-fifth for people on oxygen. There was no benefit found for people who didn't require respiratory support. Do not use this medication to treat COVID-19 unless your doctor recommends that you do so. If you have questions about the use of dexamethasone for COVID-19, talk with your doctor.

It's available as an oral tablet, oral solution, eye drops, and ear drops. It's also available as an injectable solution or an intraocular solution given after surgery. These last two forms are given only by a healthcare professional. The dexamethasone tablet is available as the brand-name drugs DexPak and Decadron. It's also available as a generic drug. Generic drugs usually cost less than the brand-name version. In some cases, they may not be available in all strengths or forms as the brand-name drug. Why it's used The dexamethasone oral tablet is used to treat conditions that cause [inflammation](/articles/248423), conditions related to immune system activity, and [hormone deficiency](/articles/321486). These conditions include: - inflammation - allergic for [chemotherapy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158401)to reduce inflammation and side effects from cancer medications - certain [leukemias and lymphomas](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321692) [adrenal insufficiency](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/adrenal-insufficiency)(a condition where the adrenal glands don't produce enough hormones) How it works Dexamethasone belongs to a class of drugs called [steroids](/articles/corticosteroids). A class of drugs is a group of medications that work in a similar way. These drugs are often used to treat similar conditions. - For conditions with inflammation: With certain conditions, inflammation can cause the immune system to be overactive. This can damage the body's tissues. Steroids such as dexamethasone help block the immune system's response to inflammation, which helps prevent this damage. - For adrenal insufficiency: The adrenal gland helps control certain body functions. These functions include managing [blood glucose](/articles/249413), defending against infection, and managing stress. In people with adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal gland releases lower amounts of certain hormones. Dexamethasone helps replace these hormones. Dexamethasone oral tablet doesn't cause drowsiness, but it can cause other side effects. More common side effects The more common side effects that can occur with dexamethasone oral tablets include: [nausea](/articles/269511) - vomiting - stomach upset - swelling ( [edema](/articles/159111)) [headache](/articles/73936) - dizziness - mood changes, such as [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933), shifts in mood, or personality changes [trouble falling asleep](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327339) [anxiety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454) [low potassium](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325065)levels (causing symptoms such as tiredness) - high blood glucose [high blood pressure](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159283) If these effects are mild, they may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. If they're more severe or don't go away, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. Serious side effects Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects.

However, because drugs affect each person differently, we cannot guarantee that this information includes all possible side effects. This information is not a substitute for medical advice. Always discuss possible side effects with a healthcare professional who knows your medical history. Dexamethasone oral tablet can interact with other medications, vitamins, or herbs you may be taking. An interaction is when a substance changes the way a drug works. This can be harmful or prevent the drug from working well. To help avoid interactions, your doctor should manage all of your medications carefully. Be sure to tell your doctor about all medications, vitamins, or herbs you're taking. To find out how this drug might interact with something else you're taking, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. Examples of drugs that can cause interactions with dexamethasone are listed below. This is not an exhaustive list. Speak with your doctor before taking any new medications or supplements. Antibiotics Erythromycin is used to treat infections caused by bacteria. When used with dexamethasone, this drug can increase the amount of dexamethasone in your body. This raises your risk of side effects. Antifungal drugs When used with dexamethasone, certain drugs used to treat fungal infections can increase the level of dexamethasone in your blood. This can raise your risk of side effects. Examples of these drugs include: - ketoconazole - itraconazole - posaconazole - voriconazole Amphotericin B is another drug used to treat fungal infections. Using this drug with dexamethasone raises your risk of low potassium levels. (Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves, muscles, and organs work normally.) This can cause [muscle cramps](/articles/muscle-spasms), weakness, tiredness, and an [irregular heartbeat](/articles/8887). Blood thinners Using dexamethasone with certain blood thinners can decrease the levels of these drugs in your body. This can make them less effective, and raise your risk of clots or stroke. Examples of these drugs include: [Warfarin](/articles/261316) is also used to thin the blood. Using dexamethasone with this drug may result in changes to your risk of bleeding. Your doctor may need to monitor you closely. Cholesterol drugs If you take dexamethasone with certain [drugs used to lower cholesterol](/articles/cholesterol-medications), it can keep your body from absorbing dexamethasone well. This could keep dexamethasone from working well. Examples of these drugs include: - cholestyramine [colesevelam](/articles/drugs-colesevelam-cost) - colestipol Cushing's syndrome drugs Aminoglutethimide is used to treat symptoms of [Cushing's syndrome](/articles/172744) (a disease of the adrenal gland). Using this drug with dexamethasone may decrease the amount of dexamethasone in your body. This means it may not work as well. Diabetes drugs Dexamethasone may increase your blood glucose, although it is rare. If you take [diabetes drugs](/articles/311300), your doctor may need to change your dose. Examples of these drugs include: - amylin analogs, such as: inhibitors, as: saxagliptin sitagliptin insulin meglitinides, - - rosiglitazone Diuretics (water pills) When used with dexamethasone, these drugs reduce your body's potassium levels. (Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves, muscles, and organs work normally.) This can cause muscle cramps, weakness, tiredness, and an irregular heartbeat. Examples of these drugs include: - bumetanide [furosemide](/articles/furosemide-oral-tablet) [hydrochlorothiazide](/articles/hydrochlorothiazide-oral-tablet) Epilepsy drugs When used with dexamethasone, certain [drugs used to treat epilepsy](/articles/epilepsy-medication) can lower the level of dexamethasone in your blood. This can keep dexamethasone from working well. Examples of these drugs include: - phenytoin - fosphenytoin - phenobarbital - carbamazepine Heart drugs Digoxin is used to treat heart rhythm problems or heart failure. Taking this drug with dexamethasone could increase your risk of irregular heartbeats caused by low potassium levels. (Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves, muscles, and organs work normally.) Hormones Taking certain hormones with dexamethasone can cause decreased levels of these hormones in your body. Your doctor may have to adjust your dose of either the dexamethasone or hormone medications. Examples of these drugs include: HIV drugs Taking certain [drugs used to treat HIV](/articles/324300) with dexamethasone can potentially reduce the levels of these drugs in your body, although it's rare. This means they may not work as well, and your body may stop responding to your HIV medications. Your doctor may avoid the use of these drugs with dexamethasone. Examples of these drugs include: [protease inhibitors](/articles/323872), reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as: (NSAIDs)](/articles/179211) with dexamethasone raises your risk of stomach ulcers or bleeding events. Talk with your doctor about whether you can take these drugs together. Examples of NSAIDs include: Tuberculosis drugs When used with dexamethasone, certain drugs used to treat tuberculosis (TB) can lower the level of dexamethasone in your blood. This can keep dexamethasone from working well. Examples of these drugs include: - rifampin - rifabutin - rifapentine Isoniazid is another TB drug. When it's used with dexamethasone, levels of isoniazid can be lowered. This can keep isoniazid from working well. Vaccines Avoid getting live vaccines when taking dexamethasone. With live vaccines, you're injected with a small amount of a virus so your body can learn to build an immune response against it. You should not get these vaccines while using dexamethasone because the drug weakens your immune system. If this happens, your body will not be able to properly defend against the vaccine, and it may make you sick. Live vaccines you should avoid while taking dexamethasone include: Other drugs Aspirin is an NSAID. It's often used to treat pain, as well as thin the blood to reduce your risk of a heart attack. Dexamethasone can decrease your aspirin levels. This can make aspirin less effective and increase your risk of a heart attack. Also, aspirin can increase your risk of bleeding from stomach ulceration (sores) when used with dexamethasone. If you take aspirin, talk with your doctor about whether dexamethasone is safe for you. Thalidomide is used to treat skin lesions and [multiple myeloma](/articles/161727). Combining it with dexamethasone can cause toxic epidermal necrolysis. This skin condition can be life threatening. If your doctor prescribes both of these drugs for you, they will be cautious about the effects the combination can cause. [Cyclosporine](/articles/325563) is used to prevent organ rejection in people who receive a [transplant](/articles/325631), as well as to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Taking this drug with dexamethasone could increase the risk that your immune system will be suppressed (will not work well). This would raise your risk of infection. [Seizures](/articles/seizures) have also been reported when these drugs are used together. Disclaimer: Our goal is to provide you with the most relevant and current information. However, because drugs interact differently in each person, we cannot guarantee that this information includes all possible interactions. This information is not a substitute for medical advice.

For people with certain health conditions For people with infections: Dexamethasone may make a systemic fungal infection worse. (Systemic means it affects the whole body, not just one part.) This drug should not be used if you're taking medication to treat a systemic fungal infection. Also, dexamethasone may hide the signs of a nonfungal infection. For people with congestive heart failure: Dexamethasone can increase [sodium levels](/articles/hypernatremia), edema (swelling), and potassium loss. This can make your heart failure worse. Before taking this drug, talk with your doctor about whether it's safe for you. For people with high blood pressure: Dexamethasone can increase sodium levels and edema (swelling). This can increase your blood pressure. Before taking this drug, talk with your doctor about whether it's safe for you. For people with peptic ulcers: Dexamethasone can increase the risk of stomach or [intestinal bleeding](/articles/gastrointestinal-bleeding) and ulcers. If you have [peptic ulcers](/articles/9273) or other conditions in the intestines, talk with your doctor about whether this drug is safe for you. Conditions of the intestines include: [diverticulitis](/articles/152995) - ulcerative colitis For people with osteoporosis: Dexamethasone decreases bone formation. It also increases bone resorption (breakdown of bone). As a result, it raises the risk of osteoporosis (bone thinning) with long-term use. The risk is higher for people already at an increased risk of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal people. For people with [hyperthyroidism](/articles/9153): This drug is removed from the body more quickly than usual. Your doctor may adjust your dose of this drug based on your condition. For people with eye problems: Long-term use of dexamethasone may cause eye problems such as cataracts, glaucoma, or [increased pressure in the eye](/articles/ocular-hypertension). Your risk is higher if you already have eye problems. For people with tuberculosis: If you have latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, dexamethasone can reactivate the disease. If you test positive for tuberculosis, talk with your doctor about whether taking this drug is safe for you. For people with a recent history of heart attack: If you've recently had a heart attack, the use of dexamethasone may lead to a tear in your heart muscle. Before you start this drug, be sure your doctor knows you've had a recent heart attack. For people with diabetes: Dexamethasone can increase blood sugar levels. As a result, your doctor may change the dose of drugs for your diabetes. For people with myasthenia gravis (MG): If you have MG, using dexamethasone with certain drugs used to treat [Alzheimer's disease](/articles/159442) can cause severe weakness. Examples of these drugs include: - memantine - rivastigmine [donepezil](/articles/drugs-aricept) If possible, wait at least 24 hours after taking these drugs to start dexamethasone therapy. For pregnant people Talk with your doctor if you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Animal research has shown adverse effects on the fetus when the gestational parent takes the drug. There haven't been enough studies done in humans to determine how the drug might affect the fetus. This drug should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. For people who are nursing Dexamethasone is not recommended for people who are nursing. The drug can pass to a child through breast milk and may cause side effects. For seniors The kidneys and liver of older adults may not work as well as they used to. This can cause your body to process drugs more slowly. As a result, more of a drug stays in your body for a longer time. This raises your risk of side effects.
