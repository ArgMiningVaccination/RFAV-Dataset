While there have been many Ayurvedic medical schools giving scientific training, lasting as long as the modern medical training does, in many countries outside India, there is a new school even in London's Thames Valley University. The most important aspect of this method of health care is that it looks at the patient as a whole, in addition to his environment. Healthy diet, yogic exercises, and change of mode of living are the main pillars of Ayurveda, in addition to herbal drugs. Ayurveda believs that the whole need not necessarily be the sum total of the bits and, therefore, stresses on the whole extract being administered in place of the so called \"active ingredient\". While there are many drugs being marketed after careful toxicologic studies and efficacy trials in Japan, Germany and the USA, the area of chronic diseases all over need the effective Ayurvedic methods. Whereas there is no doubt that for emergency treatment modern medicine has no equals, less expensive but effective methods of palliation are available for chronic illnesses in Ayurveda. More research needs to be done here to get this system into the mainstream of complementary medicine. Efforts are on in this direction. Prevention of diseases is Ayurveda's forte. This includes the highest technology of eradication by vaccination of the only disease, small pox. Edward Jenner's vaccination methods were supported by Dr. T.Z.Holwell, a Fellow of the London Royal College of Physicians, in his report to the College in the year 1747. Holwell studied the efficacy of Ayurvedic vaccination technics over a period of twenty years in \"The Bengall\" and wrote in his report that \"the method has the field record of success and antiquity..\" The original report has been traced to the archives of the Royal Society, which had sent many scholars to study the science and technology in India in the eighteenth century. Health care delivery would be less expensive if complementary systems get scientifically evaluated to be included with mainstream medicine. "}
