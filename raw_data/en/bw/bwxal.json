Table 2 : Supplemental Dose of Soliris after PE/PI Type of Plasma Intervention Most Recent Soliris Dose Supplemental Soliris Dose with Each Plasma Intervention Timing of Supplemental Soliris Dose Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange 300 mg 300 mg per each plasmapheresis or Within 60 minutes after each 6 plasma exchange session plasmapheresis or plasma exchange 600 mg 600 mg per each plasmapheresis or plasma exchange session Fresh frozen plasma infusion 300 mg 300 mg per infusion of fresh frozen plasma 60 minutes prior to each infusion of fresh frozen plasma 2.6 Preparation Dilute Soliris to a final admixture concentration of 5 mg/mL using the following steps: Withdraw the required amount of Soliris from the vial into a sterile syringe. Transfer the recommended dose to an infusion bag. Dilute Soliris to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by adding the appropriate amount (equal volume of diluent to drug volume) of 0.9% Sodium USP; or Ringer's Injection, USP to the infusion bag. The final admixed So liris 5 mg/mL infusion volume is 60 mL for 300 mg doses, 120 mL for 600 mg doses , 180 mL for 900 mg d oses or 240 mL for 1200 mg doses (Table 3) . Table 3: Preparation and Reconstitution of Soliris Soliris Dose Diluent Volume Final Volume 300 mg 30 mL 60 mL 600 mg 60 mL 120 mL 900 mg 90 mL 180 m L 1200 mg 120 mL 240 mL Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted Soliris solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluent. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Prior to administration, the admixture should be allowed to adjust to room temperature [18\u00b0-25\u00b0 C, 64 \u00b0-77\u00b0 F]. The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit . 2.7 Administration Only administer as an intravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection . Administer the Soliris admixture by intravenous infusion over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients via gravity feed, a syringe -type pump, or an infusion 7 pump. Admixed solutions of Soliris are stabl e for 24 h at 2\u00b0-8\u00b0 C (36 \u00b0-46\u00b0 F) and at room temperature. If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of Soliris, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time shou ld not exceed two hours in adults . Monitor the patient for at least one hour following completion of the infusion for signs or symptoms of an infusion -related reaction. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection: 300 mg /30 mL ( 10 mg/mL ) as a clear, colorless solution in a single -dose vial. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Soliris is contraindicated in : Patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitid is, unless the risks of delaying Soliris treatment outweigh the risk s of developing a meningococcal infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Serious Mening ococcal Infections Risk and Prevention Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with Soliris. The use of Soliris increases a patient's susceptibility to serious meningococcal infections (septicemia and/or meningitis). Soliris is associated with a n approximate 2,000 -fold increased risk of meningococcal disease in comparison to the general U.S. population annual rate (0.14 per 100,000 population in 2015) . Vaccinate for meningococcal disease according to the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for patients with complement deficiencies. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations , considering the duration of Soliris therapy. Immunize patients withou t a history of meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of Soliris . If urgent Soliris therapy is indicated in an unvaccinated patient, administer meningococcal vaccine (s) as soon as possible and provide patients with two weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis . In prospective clinical studies, 75/100 patients with aHUS were treated with Soliris less than 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination and 64 of these 75 patients received antibiotics for prophyla xis of meningococcal infection until at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of meningococcal infections in patients receiving Soliris have not been established . Vacci nation reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. In clinical studies, 2 out of 196 PNH patients developed serious meningococcal infections while receiving treatment with Soliris; both had been vaccinated [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In clinical studies among non - PNH patients, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. In addition, 3 out of 130 previously vaccinated patient s with aHUS developed meningococcal infections while receiving treatment with Soliris [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life - threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Discontin ue Soliris in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infections. REMS Because of the risk of meningococcal infections, Soliris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Soliris REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials, an d ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine (s). Enrollment in the Soliris REMS program and additional information are available by telephone : 1- 888-SOLIRIS (1 -888-765-4747 ) or at www. solirisrems.com . 9 5.2 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than N. meningitid is), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Soliris blocks terminal complement activation ; therefore patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, esp ecially with encapsulated bacteria. Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with Soliris may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilu s influenza e type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilu s influenza e type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP guidelines. Use caution when administering Soliris to patients with any syst emic infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after Soliris Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patient s after discontinu ing Soliris for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis . Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing Soliris, m onitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications for at least 12 weeks . In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued Soliris treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and Soliris was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical sign s and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decr ease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during Soliris treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during Soliris t reatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or mo re over baseline or nadir during Soliris treatment . If TMA complications occur after Soliris discontinuation, consider reinstitution of Soliris treatment, plasma therapy [ plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion ( PE/PI )], or appropr iate organ -specific supportive measures. 5.4 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during Soliris treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with Soliris should not alter anticoagulant manageme nt. 5.5 Infusion -Related Reactions Administration of Soliris may result in infusion -related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions . In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion -related reaction which required discontinuation of Soliris. Interrupt Soliris infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur. 10 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal I nfections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Other Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5. 2)] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after Soliris Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 3)] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [ see Warnings and Precautions (5. 4)] Infusion -Related Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)] 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving Soliris. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient . Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post -study follow -up period [see Warn ings and Precautions (5.1 )]. PNH The data described below reflect exposure to Soliris in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18 -85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. Soliris was studied in a placebo -controlled cl inical study (PNH Study 1 , in which 43 patients received Soliris and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2 ); and a long term extension study (E05-001). 182 patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommen ded Soliris dose regimen. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the Soliris group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with Soliris.

The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving Soliris experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with Soliris in the single arm, clinical study or the follow -up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo -controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adv erse reactions were: viral pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of Soliris therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single -arm studies , three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08 -002A/B, C08-003A/B , and C10 -004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study ( Study C09 -001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08 -003A/B and C10 -004. All patients received the recommended dosage of Soliris . Median exposure was 67 weeks (range: 2 -145 weeks) . Table 5 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10 % of patients in Studies C08 -002A/B, C08 -003A/B and C10 -004 combined .

In Studies C08 -002A/B, ) of patients experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%) . Five patients discontinued 13 Soliris due to adverse events ; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10 -003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of w hich 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of Soliris. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose -87 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C 10-003.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors includin g assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to eculizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies i n other studies or to other products may be misleading. The immunogenicity of Soliris has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti -eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab frag ment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro - chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecul e as target was used for the aHUS , gMG, and NMOSD indication s, as well as for additional patients with PNH . In the PNH population, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 patients using the ECL In the , antibodies to in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay . None of the 62 patients with gMG had antibodies to Soliris detected following the 26 -week active treatment. Two of the 96 (2%) Soliris - treated patients with NMOSD had antibod ies to Soliris detected during the entire treatment period. An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH, the 3 patients with aHUS , and the 2 patients with NMOS D with anti -eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay . Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%) , and none of the 96 patients with NMOSD had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies . No apparent correl ation of antibody development to clinical response was observed. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post -approval use of Soliris. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Soliris exposure. Fatal 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data on outcomes of pregnancies that have occurred following Soliris use in pregnant wom en have not identified a concern for specific adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the Soliris mole cule (murine anti -C5 antibody) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 2-8 times the human dose (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage f or the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized p regnancies is 2 -4% and 15 -20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease -associated maternal and/or fetal/neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including worsening cytopenias, thrombotic events, infections, bl eeding, miscarriages and increased maternal mortality, and adverse fetal outcomes, including fetal death and premature delivery. aHUS in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including pre -eclampsia and preterm delivery, and adverse feta l/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal death and low birth weight. Data Human Data A pooled analysis of prospectively (50.3%) and retrospectively (49.7%) collected data in more than 300 pregnant women with live birth s following exposure to Soliris have not suggested safety concerns. However, these data cannot definitively exclude any drug -associated risk during pregnancy, because of the limited sample size. Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mic e using doses of a murine anti -C5 antibody that approximated 2 -4 times (low dose) and 4 -8 times (high dose) the recommended human Soliris dose, based on a body weight comparison. When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation, no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 o ffspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose; however, the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from 20 implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although limited published data does not report detectable levels of eculizumab in human milk, maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Available information is insufficient to inform the effect of eculizumab on the breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of eculizumab on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Soliris and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eculizumab or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of PNH , gMG, or NMOSD in pediatric patients have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients. Use of Soliris in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well -controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS . The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years). The safety and ef fectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6 .1), and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Administer vaccinations for the prevention of infection due to Neisseria mening itidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus according to ACIP guidelines [see Warnings and Preca utions (5.1, 5.2)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Fifty-one patients 65 years of age or older (15 with PNH , 4 with aHUS , 26 with gMG 6 with NMOSD ) were treated with Soliris in clinical trials in the approved indications . Although there were no apparent age -related differences observed in these studies, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 11 DESCRIPTION Eculizumab , a complement inhib itor, is IgG2/4 antibody produced by murine myeloma cell culture and purified by standard bioprocess technology. Eculizumab contains human constant regions from human IgG2 and human IgG4 sequences and murine c omplementarity -determining regions grafted onto the human framework light - and heavy -chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa. Soliris (eculizumab ) injection is a -free 10 mg/mL solution for intravenous infusion and is supplied in 30 -mL single -dose vials. The product is formulated at pH 7 21 and each 30 mL vial contains 300 mg of eculizumab, polysorbate 80 (6.6 mg ) (vegetable origin) mg ), sodium phosphate monobasic (13.8 mg ), and Water for Injection, USP. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b -9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement complement -mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b -9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in NMOSD is unknown, but is presumed to involve inhibition of aquaporin -4-antibody induced terminal complement C5b -9 deposition 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo -controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1 ), Soliris when administered as recommended reduced LDH levels from 2200 \u00b1 1034 U/L (mean \u00b1 SD) at baseline to 700 \u00b1 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 \u00b1 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the si ngle arm clinical study (PNH Study 2 ), the effect was maintained through week 52 [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In patients with PNH, a HUS, gMG, and NMOSD , free C5 concentrations of < 0.5 mcg/mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C max) was 194 \u00b1 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C trough) was 97 \u00b1 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C trough was 242 \u00b1 101 mcg/mL . Following intravenous ma intenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean \u00b1 SD C max was 783 \u00b1 288 mcg/mL and the C trough was 341 \u00b1 172 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with NMOSD, at week 24, the observed mean\u00b1SD Cmax was 877\u00b1331 and the Ctrough was 429\u00b1188 mcg/mL. Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that 22 eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose -linear and time -indepen dent over the 600 mg to 1200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%. Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient wa s 5 L to 8 L. Elimination The half -life of eculizumab wa s approximately 270 h to 414 h. Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 250-fold and reduced the half -life to 1. 26 h. Supplemental dosing is recommended when Soliris is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2. 5)]. Specific Populations Age, Sex, and Race: The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by ag e (2 months to 85 years), sex, or race. Renal Impairment: Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH (c reatinine clearance of 8 mL/min using Cockcroft -Gault formula ), (estimated of 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 to105 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula), or gMG patients (eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 168 mL/min/1.73 using MDRD formula). Drug Interactions Intravenous immunogl with Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as eculizumab and thereby decrease serum eculizumab concentrations. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab in patients treated with IVIg. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long -term animal carcinogenicity studies of eculizumab have not been conducted . Genotoxic ity studies have not bee n conducted with eculizumab . Effects of eculizumab upon fertility have not been studied in animals. Intravenous injections of male and female mice with a murine anti -C5 antibody at up to 4 -8 times the equivalent of the clinical dose of Soliris had no adverse effects on mating or fertility. 23 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) The safety and efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 26 week study ( PNH Study 1 , NCT00122330 ); PNH patients were also treated with Soliris in a single arm 52 week study ( PNH Study 2, NCT00122304 ) and in a long - term extension study (E05-001, NCT00122317 ). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris. In all studies, the dose of Soliris was 600 mg study drug every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days for the study duration. Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes. PNH Study 1: PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either Soliris (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the \"set -point\") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcome s. The hemoglobin set -point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, th e number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health -related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set -point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the e ntire 26 week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medicati ons. Major baseline characteri stics were balanced (see Table 10).

These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre -study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; > 25 units). After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health - related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of Soliris on thrombotic events could not be determined.

Concomitant medications included anti - thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of the patients. Overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. 187 Soliris - treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension stud y. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, th e majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during Soliris therapy was not studied [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 14.2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( and one retrospective : C09-001r (NCT01770951 )] evaluated the safety and efficacy of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS. Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris or received p rophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 \u00b1 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg 7 \u00b1 2 days later, then 1200 mg every 14 \u00b1 2 days there after. The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09-001r and Study C10-003 was based on body weight [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic micr oangiopathy ( the following: platelet count change from baseline hematologic normalization (maintenance of normal platelet counts and LDH levels for at least four weeks) complete TMA response (hematologic normalization plus at least a 25% reduction in serum creatinine for a minimum of four weeks) TMA -event free status (absence for at least 12 weeks of a decrease in platelet count of >25% from baseline, plasma exchange or plasma infusion, and new dialysis requirement ) Daily TMA intervention rate (defined as the number of plasma exchange or plasma infusion interventions and the number of new dialyses required per patient per day). 26 aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (Study C08 -002A/B ) Study of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening . One patient had no PE/PI the week prior to screening because of PE/PI intolerance. In order to qualify f or enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count 150 x 109/L, evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH , and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal , without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 28 (range: 17 to 68 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08 - 002A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 70%-121%. Seventy -six percent of patients had an identified comp lement regulatory factor mutation or auto -antibody. Table 12 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease -related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C08 -002A/B .

In Study C08 -002A/B , the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during Soliris therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 23 \u00b1 15 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseli ne to 56 \u00b1 40 mL/min/1.73m2 by 26 weeks; this effect was maintained through 2 years ( 56 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an in crease in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of complement -mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C08 - 002A/B , mean plate let count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 109 \u00b1 32 x109/L at baseline to 169 \u00b1 72 x109/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (210 \u00b1 68 x109/L), and 2 years (205 \u00b1 46 x109/L). When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response . Hematologic Normalization and Complet e TMA response were maintained by all responders. In Study C08 -002A/B , responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

All patients had received PT at least once every two weeks, but no more than three times per week , for a minimum of eight weeks prior to the first Soliris dose . Patients on chronic dial ysis were permitted to enroll in Study C08 - 003A/B . The median patient age was 28 years (range: 13 to 63 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08 - 003A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 37%-118%.

In Study C08 -003A/B , the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 114 weeks (range: 26 to 129 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was maintained during Soliris therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) was 31 \u00b1 19 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline, and was maintained through 26 weeks (37 \u00b1 21 mL/min/1.73m2) and 2 years ( 40 \u00b1 18 mL/min/1.73m2). No patient required new dialysis with Soliris. 28 Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in a ll patients after the commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of complement -mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) was 22 8 \u00b1 78 x 109/L at baseline, 233 \u00b1 69 x 109/L at week 26 , and 224 \u00b1 52 x 109/L at 2 years . When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achi eved Complete TMA response. Complete TMA Response and Hematologic Normalization were maintained by all responders. In Study C08 -003A/B , responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.

In Study C08 -003A/B , 85% of patients had normal platelet counts and 80% of patients had normal serum LDH levels at baseline, so hematologic normalization in this population reflects maintenance of normal parameters in the absence of PE/PI . Retrospective Study in Patients with aHUS ( C09-001r ) The efficacy results for the aHUS retrospective study ( Study C09 -001r) were generally consistent with results of the two prospective studies. Soliris reduced signs of complement -mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 171 \u00b1 83 x109/L at baseline to 233 \u00b1109 x109/L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 254 \u00b1 79 x109/L). A total of 1 9 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years ) received Soliris in Study C09 -001r. The median duration of Soliris therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children <2 years of age (n=5), 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for ch ildren 2 to <12 years of age (n=10) , and 38 weeks (range 1 to 69 weeks) for patients 12 to <18 years of age (n= 4). Fifty -three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto -antibody. Overall, the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08 -002A/B and C08 -003A/B (Table 16). No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with Soliris. 29 Table 16: Efficacy Results in Pediatric Patients Enrolled in Study C09 -001r Efficacy Parameter <2 yrs (N=5) 12 <18 yrs (N=4) Total (N=19) Complete TMA response , n (%) 2 (40) 5 (50) 1 (25) 8 (42) Patients with eGFR improvement 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, n (%)2 2 (40) 6 (60) 1 (25) 9 (47) Platelet count normalization, n (%)1 4 (80) 10 (100) 3 (75) 17 (89) Hematologic Normalization, n (%) 2 (40) 5 (50) 1 (25) 8 (42) Daily TMA intervention rate, median (range) Before eculizumab On eculizumab treatment 1 (0, 2) <1 (0, <1) <1 (0.07, 1.46) 0 (0, <1) , normalization was defined as a platelet count of at least 150,000 X 109/L on at least two consecutive measurements spanning a period of at least 4 weeks. 2. Of the 9 patients who experienced an eGFR improvement of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, one received dialysis throughout the study period and another received Soliris as prophylaxis following renal allograft transplantation. Adult Patients with aHUS ( Study C10 -004) Study C10 -004 enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microang iopathy (TMA). In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count < lower limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in Study C10 -004 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 28%-116%. Fifty -one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto -antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab. Table 17 summarizes the key baseline clinical and disease -related characteristics of patients enrolled in Study C10 -004. 30 Table 17: Baseline Characteristics of Patients Enrolled in Study C10 -004 Parameter Study C10 -004 (N=41 ) Time from aHUS diagnosis until start of study drug in months, median (range) 0.79 (0.03 - 311) Time from current clinical TMA manifestation until first study dose in months, median (range) 0.52 (0.03 -19) Baseline platelet count (\u00d7 109/L), median (range) 125 (16 - 332) Baseline LDH (U/L), median (range) 375 (131 - 3318) Patients in Study C10 -004 received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C10 -004, the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 50 weeks (range: 13 weeks to 86 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 17 \u00b1 12 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline to 47 \u00b1 24 mL/min/1.73m2 by 26 weeks. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during Soliris treatment. Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of complement -mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C10- 004, mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 119 \u00b1 66 x109/L at baseline to 200 \u00b1 84 x109/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean plate let count (\u00b1 SD) at week 26: 252 \u00b1 70 x109/L). In Study C10 -004, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins o r auto -antibodies to factor H.

In Study C10 -003, the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 44 week s (range: 1 dose to 88 weeks). Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. The mean eGFR (\u00b1 SD) increased from 33 \u00b1 30 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline to 98 \u00b1 44 mL/min/1.73m2 by 26 weeks. Among the 20 patients with a CKD stage 2 at baseline, 17 (85%) achieved a CKD improvement of 1 stage. Among the 16 patien ts ages 1 month to <12 years with a CKD stage 2 at baseline, 14 (88%) achieved a CKD improvement by 1 stage. Nine of the 11 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during Soliris treatment. Responses were observ ed across all ages from 5 months to 17 years of age. Reduction in terminal complement activity was observed in all patients after commencement of Soliris. Soliris reduced signs of complement -mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count (\u00b1 SD) increased from 88 \u00b1 42 x109/L at baseline to 281 \u00b1 123 x109/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (\u00b1SD) at week 26: 293 \u00b1 106 x109/L). In Study C10 -003, responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto -antibodies to factor H.

Through data cutoff (October 12, 2012) . 14.3 Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) The efficacy of Soliris for the treatment of gMG was established in gMG Study 1 (NCT0199722 9), a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, multi -center trial that enrolled patients who met the following criteria at screening: 1. Positive serologic test for anti -AChR antibodies, 2. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II to I V, 3. MG-Activities of Daily Living ( MG-ADL) total score 6, 4. Failed treatment over 1 year or more with 2 or more immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs) either in combination or as monotherapy, or failed at least 1 IST and required chronic plasmapheresis or plasma exchange (PE) or intravenous immunoglob ulin (IVIg). A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, including age at diagnosis (38 years in each group ), gender [66% female (eculizumab) versus of [9.9 (eculizumab) versus 9.2 (placebo) years ]. Over 95% of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase ( AchE ) inhibitors , and 98% were receiving immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs ). Approximately 50% of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs. Soliris was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The primary efficacy endpoint for gMG Study 1 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis -Specific Activities of Daily Living scale ( MG- ADL ) total score at Week 26 . The MG -ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. Each item is assessed on a 4 - point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0 -24). A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG -ADL total scores [ -4.2 point s in the Soliris -treated group compared with -2.3 points in the place group (p=0.006)] . 33 A key seconda ry endpoint in gMG Study 1 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at Week 26 . The QMG is a 13 -item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness . Each item is assessed on a 4 -point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represent s severe weakness (total score 0 -39). A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [- 4.6 points in the Soliris -treated group compared with -1.6 points in the placebo -treated group (p=0.001)]. The results of the analysis of the MG -ADL and QMG from gMG Study 1 are shown in Table 2 1. Table 2 1: Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 2 6 in MG -ADL and QMG Total Scores in gMG Study 1 Efficacy Soliris Mean (N=62) (SEM) Placebo -LS Mean (N=63) (SEM) Soliris change relative to placebo - Mean; Soliris -LSMean = least square mean for the treatment group; Placebo -LSMean = least square mean for the placebo group; LSMean -Difference (95% CI) = Difference in least square mean with 95% confidence interval; p-values (testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms a: in least square means at Week 26 using a repeated measure analysis; b: in ranks at Week 26 using a worst rank analysis). In gMG Study 1, a clinical response was defined in the MG -ADL total score as at least a 3 -point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5-point improvement . The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for Soliris compared to placebo for both measures . For both endpoints, and also at higher response thresholds (4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8 -point improvement on MG -ADL, and 6 -, 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10 -point improvement on QMG) , the proportion of clinical responder s was consistently greater for Soliris compared to placebo . Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of Soliris treatment . 14.4 Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD ) efficacy of Soliris for the treatment o f NMOSD was established in NMOSD Study 1 (NCT01892345 ), a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial that enrolled 143 patients with NMOSD who were anti -AQP4 antibody p ositive and met the following criteria at screening: 1. History of at least 2 relapses in last 12 months or 3 relapses in the last 24 months , with at least 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to screening, 34 2. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 7 (consistent with the pr esence of at least limited ambulation with a id), 3. If on immunosuppressive therapy (IST) , on a stable dose regimen , 4. The use of concurrent corticosteroids was limited to 20 mg per day or less , 5. Patients were excluded if they had been treated with rituximab or mitoxantrone within 3 months or with IVIg within 3 weeks prior to screening. A total of 96 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 47 were randomized to receive placebo. The b aseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups . During the treatment phase of the trial, 76% percent of patients receive d concomitant IST, including chronic corticosteroids ; 24% of patients did not receive concomitant IST or chronic corticosteroids during the treatment phase of the trial. Soliris was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [ see Dosage and Administration (2. 4)]. The primary endpoint for NMOSD Study 1 was the time to the first adjudicated on -trial r elapse. The time to the first adjudicated on -trial relapse was significantly longer in Soliris -treated patients compared to placebo -treated patients (relative risk reduction 94%; hazard ratio 0.058; p < 0.0001) (Figure 1) . 35 Figure 1 : Kaplan -Meier Survival Estimates for Time to First Adjudicated On -Trial Relapse - Full Analysis Set Note: Patients who did not experience an adjudicated on-trial relapse were censored at the end of the study period.

DO NOT SHAKE. 37 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read FDA -approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Meningococcal Infection Prior to treatment, patients should fully understand the risks and benefits of Soliris, in particular the risk of meningococcal infection. Ensure that patients receive the Medication Guide. Inform p atients that they are required to receive meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of Soliris, if they have not previously been vaccinated. They are required to be revaccinated according to current medical guidelines for meningococcal vaccine s use while on Soliris therapy. Inform p atients that vaccination may not prevent meningococcal infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Signs and Symptoms of Meningococcal Infection Inform p atients about the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection, and strongly advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if these signs or symptoms occur. These signs and symptoms are as follows: headache with nausea or vomiting headache and a fever headache with a stiff neck or stiff back fever fever and a rash confusion muscle aches with flu -like symptoms eyes s ensitiv e to light Inform p atients that they will be given a Soliris Patient Safety Information Card that they should carry with them at all times. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to immediately seek medical evaluation. Other Infections Counsel patients about gonorrhea prevention and advise regular testing for patients at -risk. Inform p atients that there may be an increased risk of other types of infections, particularly those due to encapsulated bacteria. Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Inform p arents or caregivers of children receiving Soliris for the treatmen t of aHUS that their child should be vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza e type b (Hib) according to current medical guidelines. 38 Infusion -Related Reactions Advise patients that administration of SOLIRIS may result in infusion -related reactions. Discontinuation Inform p atients with PNH that they may develop hemolysis due to PNH when Soliris is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 8 weeks following Soliris disconti nuation. Inform p atients with aHUS that there is a potential for TMA complications due to aHUS when Soliris is discontinued and that they will be monitored by their healthcare professional for at least 12 weeks following Soliris discontinuation. Inform patients who discontinue Soliris to keep the Soliris Patient Safety Information Card with them for three month s after the last Soliris dose, because the increased risk of meningo coccal infection persists for several weeks following discontinuation of Soliris.

SOLIRIS is a medicine that affects your immune system. SOLIRIS can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. SOLIRIS increases your chance of getting serious and life -threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections ma y quickly become life -threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early. 1. You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of SOLIRIS if you have not already had this vaccine. 2. If your doctor decided that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed, you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible. 3. If you have not been vaccinated and SOLIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, you should also receive two weeks of antibiotics with your vaccinations. 4. If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccination before starting SOLIRIS. Your doctor will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccination. 5. Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningo coccal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your doctor or get emergenc y medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection: o headache with nausea or vomiting o headache with a stiff n eck or stiff back o fever and a rash o muscle aches with flu -like symptoms o headache and fever o fever o confusion o eyes sensitive to light Your doctor will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last SOLIRIS dose. Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of SOLIRIS. It is important to show this card to any doctor or nurse who treats you. This will help them diagnose and treat you quickly. SOLIRIS is only available through a program called the SOLIRIS REMS. Before you can receive SOLIRIS, your doctor must: enroll in the SOLIRIS REMS program counsel you about the risk of meningococcal infectio n give you information about the symptoms of meningococcal infection give you a Patient Safety Card about your risk of meningococcal infection, as discussed above make sure that you are vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine and, if needed, get re vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if you need to be revaccinated. SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. If your child is treated with SOLIRIS, make sure that your child rece ives vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilis influenza e type b (Hib). Certain people may be at risk of serious infections with gonorrhea. Talk to your doctor about whether you are at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea preve ntion, and regular testing. Certain fungal infections (aspergillus) may also happen if you take SOLIRIS and have a weak immune system or a low white blood cell count. What is SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS is a prescription medicine called a monoclonal antibody. SOLIRIS is used to treat: patients - with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) . adults and children Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) . SOLIRIS is not for use in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC - HUS). adults with a disease called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti -acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody positive adult s with a disease called neuromyelitis optica spectr um disorder (NMOSD) who are anti -aquaporin -4 (AQP4) antibody positive . It is not known if SOLIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH , gMG , or NMOSD . Who Do not receive SOLIRIS if you: have a meningococcal infection. have not been vaccinated against meningitis infection unless your doctor decides that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed. See \"What is the most important information I should know about SOLIRIS?\" Before you re ceive SOLIRIS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have an infection or fever. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if SOLIRIS will harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if SOLIRIS passes into your breast milk. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over -the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. SOLIRIS and other medicines can affect each ot her causing side effects. It is important that you: have all recommended vaccinations before you start SOLIRIS. receive 2 weeks of antibiotics if you immediately start SOLIRIS . stay up -to-date with all recommended vaccinations during treatment with S OLIRIS. Know the medications you take and the vaccines you receive. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I receive SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS is given through a vein (I.V. or intravenous infusion) usually over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients. If you have an infusion -related reaction during your SOLIRIS infusion, your doctor may decide to give SOLIRIS more slowly or stop your infusion. If you are an adult, you will usually receive a SOLIRIS infusion by your doctor: o weekly for five weeks, then o every 2 weeks If you are less than 18 years of age, your doctor will decide how often you will receive SOLIRIS depending on your age and body weight After each infusion, you should be monitored for one hour for infusion -related reactions. See \"What are the possible side effects of SOLIRIS?\" If you miss a SOLIRIS infusion, call your doctor right away. If you have PNH, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS. Stopping treatment with SOLIRIS may cause breakdown of your red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: o drop in the number of your red blood cell count o kidney problems o drop in your platelet counts o blood clots o confusion o difficulty breathing o chest pain If you have aHUS, your doctor will need to monitor you closely during and for at least 12 weeks after stopping treatment for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to abnormal clotting (thrombotic microangiopathy). Symptoms or problems that can happen with abnormal clotting may include: o stroke o difficulty breathing o confusion o kidney problems o seizure o swelling in arms or legs o chest pain (angina) o a drop in your platelet count What are the possible side effects of SOLIRIS? SOLIRIS can cause serious side effects including: See \"What is the most important information I should know about SOLIRIS?\" Serious infusion -related reactions. Serious infusion -related reactions can happen during your SOLIRIS infusion. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you get any of these symptoms during your SOLIRIS infusion: o chest pain o trouble breathing or shortness of breath o swelling of your face, tongue, or throat o feel faint or pass out If you have an infusion -related react ion to SOLIRIS, your doctor may need to infuse SOLIRIS more slowly, or stop SOLIRIS.
