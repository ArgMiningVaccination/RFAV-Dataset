Aims: This narrative review analyzes the literature regarding these two immunitary processes and more specifically: (a) the duration of natural immunity; (b) cellular immunity; (c) cross-reactivity; (d) the duration of post-vaccination immune protection; (e) the probability of reinfection and its clinical manifestations in the recovered patients; (f) the comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated as to the possible reinfections; (g) the role of hybrid immunity; (h) the effectiveness of natural and vaccine-induced immunity against Omicron variant; (i) the comparative incidence of adverse effects after vaccination in recovered individuals vs. COVID-19-na\u00efve subjects. Material and Methods: through multiple search engines we investigated COVID-19 literature related to the aims of the review, published since April 2020 through July 2022, including also the previous articles pertinent to the investigated topics. Results: nearly 900 studies were collected, and 246 pertinent articles were included. It was highlighted that the vast majority of the individuals after suffering from COVID-19 develop a natural immunity both of cell-mediated and humoral type, which is effective over time and provides protection against both reinfection and serious illness. Vaccine-induced immunity was shown to decay faster than natural immunity. In general, the severity of the symptoms of reinfection is significantly lower than in the primary infection, with a lower degree of hospitalizations (0.06%) and an extremely low mortality. Conclusions: this extensive narrative review regarding a vast number of articles highlighted the valuable protection induced by the natural immunity after COVID-19, which seems comparable or superior to the one induced by anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Consequently, vaccination of the unvaccinated COVID-19-recovered subjects may not be indicated. Further research is needed in order to: (a) measure the durability of immunity over time; (b) evaluate both the impacts of Omicron BA.5 on vaccinated and healed subjects and the role of hybrid immunity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-25", "cleaned_text": "[https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11216272](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11216272) [Immunology](/journal/jcm/sections/Immunology)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-jcm-11-06272)]. Both natural [3](#B3-jcm-11-06272)] and vaccine-induced immunity [ [4](#B4-jcm-11-06272), [5](#B5-jcm-11-06272)] may be useful to reduce the mortality/morbidity of this disease, but still a lot of controversy exists on the best strategy to manage this complex socio-health issue. [6](#B6-jcm-11-06272), [7](#B7-jcm-11-06272)]. Thus, the evaluation of natural immunity should include adjunctive parameters to the classical determination of the antibody titre. In fact, the complexity and multi-modality of the immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 is being highlighted in several papers in the last two years, though the available evidence on the basic differences between the natural and the vaccine-induced immunity is still limited. 2. Aims 3. Material and Methods 4. Results 4.1. Duration and Type of Immunity from Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection [8](#B8-jcm-11-06272), [9](#B9-jcm-11-06272), [10](#B10-jcm-11-06272), [11](#B11-jcm-11-06272), [12](#B12-jcm-11-06272)]. Already in the first part of 2021 the presence of antibodies for at least 8 months was clear [ [13](#B13-jcm-11-06272), [14](#B14-jcm-11-06272), [15](#B15-jcm-11-06272)]. Two studies conducted until September 2021 reported the long-term humoral and cellular immunity findings in patients who were affected by COVID-19 and followed up for more than 1 year after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to characterize in details the long-term humoral as well as cellular immunity. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and antibodies could be detected for a period of more than 1 year after infection [ [16](#B16-jcm-11-06272), [17](#B17-jcm-11-06272)]. By the end of 2021, the persistence of neutralizing antibodies one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans was highlighted by other authors as well [ [18](#B18-jcm-11-06272)]. Fundamentally, SARS-CoV-2 features 4 structural proteins: spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. As to literature data, the most relevant immunogenic role as been attributed to S and N proteins. Protein S especially appears to be the central antigen capable to induce a \"protective\" host cellular/humoral immune reaction. It specifically stimulates the formation of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), which play a central role in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus. [19](#B19-jcm-11-06272)] 39,086 specimens were collected nationwide (USA) and the seropositivity rate was analyzed. This study was performed through the access to a large database of longitudinal data regarding patients recovered from COVD-19. The authors demonstrated the presence of both anti-S and anti-N IgG in the blood samples, and this finding was evident also 300 days post-infection. More specifically, there was an average seropositivity for N-protein in 68% of the subjects after 293 days and a 87% seropositivity of antibodies to S-protein at 300 days. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the subjects under the age of 65 had a higher antibody seropositivity. [20](#B20-jcm-11-06272)] demonstrated, in a cohort of 214 patients (in asymptomatic, mild to severe forms) recovered from COVID-19, the presence of neutralizing antibodies for a period of more than 480 days. In this study it was also shown that the antibody-dependent immunity can regard also the currently circulating virus variants. In a cross-sectional study of unvaccinated adults [ [21](#B21-jcm-11-06272)], antibodies were detected, respectively, in 99% of individuals who reported a positive COVID-19 test, in 55% of subjects who referred a probable COVID-19 contagion without being tested and, finally, in 11% of subjects who referred no specific symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection. In the same study anti-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD) levels were observed after a positive COVID-19 test for a duration of nearly 20 months. [22](#B22-jcm-11-06272)] detected the presence of neutralizing IgG antibodies in a sample of 116 individuals 11 months after the infection, confirming the presence of an immunological memory. In many other publications the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in COVID-19 convalescent [ [23](#B23-jcm-11-06272), [24](#B24-jcm-11-06272), [25](#B25-jcm-11-06272), [26](#B26-jcm-11-06272), [27](#B27-jcm-11-06272), [28](#B28-jcm-11-06272)]. Of interest, in the work of Wei et al. [ [2](#B2-jcm-11-06272)], a randomized sample of 7256 UK citizens previously affected by COVID-19 (with up to 12 months of follow-up) showed the presence of protective antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 after about 1.5-2 years, as they demonstrated the presence of anti-spike protein IgG antibodies with an average life of about 184 days. Another study focused on the typology of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a selected population of 203 patients recovered from an asymptomatic-to-severe disease [ [29](#B29-jcm-11-06272)]. It was shown that 99% of the cases featured the presence of antibodies against the virus, and in 90% of individuals the presence of T CD8 HLA-A2 lymphocytes, specifically directed against the virus. [30](#B30-jcm-11-06272), [31](#B31-jcm-11-06272)], have shown the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG at 14 months in recovered patients. More recently, an interesting meta-analysis included 54 studies from 18 countries for a total of 12,011,447 individuals with 8-month (average) post-infection follow-up [ [32](#B32-jcm-11-06272)]. Overall, the authors demonstrated in these subjects the presence of IgG, CD4+ T lymphocytes and B memory cells in 90.4%, and 80.6% of the cases, respectively; moreover, the prevalence of a reinfection was 0.2%. [33](#B33-jcm-11-06272)]. It has also been documented that there are mutations in the B memory cell compartment, which continue to evolve in the 12 months post-infection [ [34](#B34-jcm-11-06272)]. Furthermore, the same mutations were shown to sustain a lasting protection by the memory cells, keeping the germinal centers always active. The presence of persistent antigens has been also demonstrated in other locations, such as the intestine [ [33](#B33-jcm-11-06272)]. This specific finding is linked to the constant evolution of antibodies in the germinal centers, which is maintained over time, and which strengthens the immune memory. Recent studies have also documented the presence of IgAs on the surface of the nasopharyngeal mucosa which appear to have the ability to neutralize the infection in the upper airways for several months [ [34](#B34-jcm-11-06272), [35](#B35-jcm-11-06272)] ( [Figure 1](#jcm-11-06272-f001)). [36](#B36-jcm-11-06272)]. To prevent one reinfection in the natural immunity cohort during the follow-up, 767 individuals needed to be vaccinated with two doses. In the same study, vaccination was shown to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and hospitalization for up to 9 months, although the differences in absolute numbers, especially as to the hospitalization rate, were small. [37](#B37-jcm-11-06272), [38](#B38-jcm-11-06272), [39](#B39-jcm-11-06272)]. An older study regarding SARS-CoV infection already showed the presence of SARS coronavirus-specific T cells in three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years follow-up. It was also shown that all the detected T memory cell responses targeted the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Furthermore, these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post-infection [ [24](#B24-jcm-11-06272)]. [40](#B40-jcm-11-06272)]. [41](#B41-jcm-11-06272)]. This issue will be highlighted and discussed in the next section. 4.2. Cellular Immunity [42](#B42-jcm-11-06272)]. As per the basic immunology notions, the immune cell response to viral infections notoriously plays a crucial role in limiting clinical progression and in the protection against subsequent infections [ [43](#B43-jcm-11-06272), [44](#B44-jcm-11-06272), [45](#B45-jcm-11-06272), [46](#B46-jcm-11-06272), [47](#B47-jcm-11-06272), [48](#B48-jcm-11-06272)] which applies to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. In fact, similar to many other viral infections, COVID-19 was found to be efficiently controlled in most infected individuals through the coordinated activation of the innate and adaptive components of the immune system. [49](#B49-jcm-11-06272)]. Conversely, individuals who were mildly symptomatic were able to rapidly develop both a virus-specific antibody and T-cell response, as reported in several immunity was shown to occur regardless of the severity of the clinical picture related to the infection itself [ [60](#B60-jcm-11-06272), [61](#B61-jcm-11-06272)]. Interestingly, no statistically significant differences between the effectiveness of the immune response to natural infection or to the hybrid stimulation (vaccination + natural infection) was documented after about 20 months [ [36](#B36-jcm-11-06272)]. This finding confirms the valid antiviral protection put in place by our immune system over time, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In these patients the circulating memory of the T CD8+ leukocytes also includes cells with a memory phenotype which is similar to that of stem cells, with sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity. Consequently, these immune cells are likely to play a crucial role in supporting an anamnestic response [ [62](#B62-jcm-11-06272)]. [33](#B33-jcm-11-06272), [63](#B63-jcm-11-06272), [64](#B64-jcm-11-06272), [65](#B65-jcm-11-06272)]. More importantly it was documented that the spike-specific B cells have been detected for longer periods of time even in elderly patients with rapidly declining neutralizing antibody levels [ [66](#B66-jcm-11-06272)]. [67](#B67-jcm-11-06272), [68](#B68-jcm-11-06272), [69](#B69-jcm-11-06272)]. With reference to this durable immune condition, a recent study suggested that T cells may target different regions of the Spike protein, including those that are not involved in major mutations. Moreover, these mutations seem to decrease the neutralizing action of the antibodies produced in response to the H1N1 flu, cross-reactivity has been demonstrated by those who had already contracted the virus of swine origin [ [43](#B43-jcm-11-06272)]. At the same time, neutralizing T CD8+ lymphocytes were found in patients who had had H1N1 infection and who were subsequently protected from symptomatic flu episodes [ [44](#B44-jcm-11-06272)]. [45](#B45-jcm-11-06272)]. Instead, influenza vaccines did not allow the development of cross-reactivity towards the H1N1 virus [ [77](#B77-jcm-11-06272)]. Basically, cross-reactivity seems to be an exclusive phenomenon occurring within natural immunity. This feature was even found in survivors of the Spanish flu, who 90 years later still had circulating B cells capable of producing antibodies. In this case, cross-reactivity was demonstrated against viral agglutinins from 1930's swine flu [ [78](#B78-jcm-11-06272)]. The reactivity of T lymphocytes against SARS-CoV-2, which was present in 20-50% of people with no documented exposure to the virus, was early studied in 2020 [ [79](#B79-jcm-11-06272), [80](#B80-jcm-11-06272)]. [81](#B81-jcm-11-06272)]. Additionally, cross-reactivity has also been demonstrated following previous beta-coronavirus infections [ [82](#B82-jcm-11-06272)] and cellular immunity of T lymphocytes from other coronaviruses has been investigated by several research groups as well [ [41](#B41-jcm-11-06272), [71](#B71-jcm-11-06272), [82](#B82-jcm-11-06272), [83](#B83-jcm-11-06272), [84](#B84-jcm-11-06272)]. [Figure 2](#jcm-11-06272-f002)shows the possible different the basis of cross-reactivity immunity elicited through T-lymphocytes. [85](#B85-jcm-11-06272)]. Lastly, cross-reactivity of T lymphocytes was also found starting from cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza viruses [ [86](#B86-jcm-11-06272), [87](#B87-jcm-11-06272)]. It seems cross-reactivity is a phenomenon which is equally distributed between different genders and ages, although it is more common in children [ [88](#B88-jcm-11-06272)], and furthermore this beneficial immunological memory was found of clinical relevance in terms of mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [89](#B89-jcm-11-06272)]. [90](#B90-jcm-11-06272), [91](#B91-jcm-11-06272)]. From this point of view, an important study [ [92](#B92-jcm-11-06272)] has shown that the immune activity stimulated by other coronaviruses (HCoV) is associated with higher immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, indicating a cross stimulation. Above all, HCoV immunity was reported to affect the severity of the disease, since patients with high HCoV reactivity were less likely to require hospitalization. Beyond the cellular immunity of T lymphocytes, also some antibody-based immunity against SARS-CoV-2 deriving from B cells has been demonstrated in subjects previously infected by different coronaviruses [ [10](#B10-jcm-11-06272), [93](#B93-jcm-11-06272), [94](#B94-jcm-11-06272)]. [95](#B95-jcm-11-06272)] In this study, HCoV-derived IgG and IgA have been found significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic seropositive individuals. Thus, it has been hypothesized that pre-existing cross-reactive HCoVs antibodies could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. [Figure 3](#jcm-11-06272-f003)shows the complex interplay among several immune system elements which are involved in the cellular/humoral response to wild pathogens and reinfection of homologous or variant pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). [96](#B96-jcm-11-06272), [97](#B97-jcm-11-06272)]. This potential secondary cross-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory tract bacteria may induce a natural cross-reactivity immunity, and this pose the necessity to better treat these patients, also using tailored antibiotics and probiotics when needed [ [98](#B98-jcm-11-06272), [99](#B99-jcm-11-06272)]. 4.4. The Duration of Post-Vaccination Immune Protection [100](#B100-jcm-11-06272)]. Furthermore, the evidence of long-term protection of vaccines in people under the age of 16 against the multiple variants of COVID-19 is even more limited [ [101](#B101-jcm-11-06272)]. [102](#B102-jcm-11-06272)]. Currently, it is not known the additional protection induced by the vaccine over the previously infected people. However, it was documented that following vaccination, the efficacy against infection reaches its peak in the first month after the second dose and then it gradually decreases and reaches about 20% in months 5 to 7 after the second dose; at the same time, protection against hospitalization and death persists at a solid level for 6 months after the second dose [ [5](#B5-jcm-11-06272)]. The decline in vaccine efficacy appears to be greater in the elderly people, i.e., those aged 65 and over [ [103](#B103-jcm-11-06272)]. [96](#B96-jcm-11-06272)]. The efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among 842,974 vaccinated individuals was shown to decay and rapidly tend to vanish after about 6-7 months, possibly becoming even negative for longer time intervals [ [36](#B36-jcm-11-06272)]. The ongoing generation of new variants, resulting from the selective pressure exerted by the vaccine on the virus, has been reported by a few authors as a possible explanation for this short-term efficacy of vaccination [ [104](#B104-jcm-11-06272), [105](#B105-jcm-11-06272)]. Moreover, it is known that vaccines induce a spike-protein targeting immune response, and in fact most virus mutations affect just this protein, which may additionally explain the short duration of the protective action of vaccines. [106](#B106-jcm-11-06272), [107](#B107-jcm-11-06272)]. In order to investigate this issue more in depth, since 21 June 2021 German authorities have been collecting data about the rate of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated patients. This percentage was increasingly higher and was calculated as 58.9% on 27 October 2021. These figures have basically provided some evidence about the growing relevance of vaccinates as a possible source of transmission. Beyond the German data, other authors have highlighted that fully vaccinated people equally spread SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [108](#B108-jcm-11-06272)], showing viral loads similar to unvaccinated individuals. Similarly, the relative need for further checks of the spread of the infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated people was proposed by several authors [ [109](#B109-jcm-11-06272), [110](#B110-jcm-11-06272)]. [111](#B111-jcm-11-06272)]. A major attention over the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission was suggested, in order to improve measures regarding public health control [ [112](#B112-jcm-11-06272)]. 4.5. Probability of Reinfection in the Recovered Subjects, and Its Clinical Manifestations [113](#B113-jcm-11-06272)]. A few key elements have been described within the re-infection issue were described: the probability of reinfection, the duration of natural immunity, the severity of the disease in case of relapse (hospitalizations and deaths) and the antibody concentration. [114](#B114-jcm-11-06272)]. Similar experiences have confirmed relapse rates in the previously infected subjects which varied among 0% [ [115](#B115-jcm-11-06272)], 0.11% [ [120](#B120-jcm-11-06272)]. [121](#B121-jcm-11-06272)]. Another study performed on healthcare workers in Brazil indicated a relatively high rate of reinfection which was strictly correlated with the lowest antibody responses, but in most cases the data did not formally distinguish between reinfection and re-emergence of a chronic infection reservoir. More specifically, this Brazilian study was performed on a small sample (33 patients) and the risk of reinfection was estimated about 7% [ [122](#B122-jcm-11-06272)]. Another, much larger, study [ [123](#B123-jcm-11-06272)] found a significantly higher reinfection rate, equal to 10% of the analysed cases; however, in the event of reinfection, the viral load was found about 10 times lower than the one of the primary infection. The 3076 participants were investigated for a period of 6 weeks, which represents a very short follow-up, and the healed subjects were in a small number. [124](#B124-jcm-11-06272)] (0.7%). A relevant issue in these studies concerning re-infection rate is represented by the possible false positive cases among the new infections, in fact the re-emergence of the primary infection can be traced to the remaining virus within the digestive system [ [125](#B125-jcm-11-06272)]. The main data and features of the studies cited above are summarized in [Table 1](#jcm-11-06272-t001). [126](#B126-jcm-11-06272)], the peak of relapses was shown to depend upon the spread of the Omicron variant. Some studies have shown that the presence of a high quantity of antibodies developed following the primary infection guarantees greater coverage from the risk of reinfection [ [123](#B123-jcm-11-06272), [125](#B125-jcm-11-06272), [127](#B127-jcm-11-06272)]. High levels of antibodies also seem to guarantee lower hospitalization rates [ [128](#B128-jcm-11-06272)]. Interestingly, even subjects who have contracted the infection in an asymptomatic form can produce high quantities of antibodies [ [129](#B129-jcm-11-06272)]. [130](#B130-jcm-11-06272), [137](#B137-jcm-11-06272)] concerning the lower severity of the symptoms in case of reinfection, in comparison to the primary infection, with a lower degree of hospitalizations and almost no related deaths. For example, among 7173 subjects previously recovered from the infection, 24 cases of reinfection were highlighted, of which 4 required hospitalization (0.06%) and only one subject died [ [119](#B119-jcm-11-06272)]. A recent study, published by Crawford and coll. in The Lancet [ [131](#B131-jcm-11-06272)], analyzes the cases of relapse in a pediatric population; the lowest reinfection rate has been found in children under the age of 5, i.e., in that age group where vaccination was basically not practiced. This outcome is confirmed by the absence of cases of relapse in minors during the period March 2020-May 2021 [ [119](#B119-jcm-11-06272)]. As none of the minors was vaccinated at that time, the post-COVID-19 natural immunity has likely played a fundamental role. Crawford study is of some importance as it featured a long follow-up time (515 days) and demonstrated a very low risk of reinfection, from 0.18% in children under 5 years, up to 0.73% in older than 16 years, in the investigated population. [138](#B138-jcm-11-06272), [139](#B139-jcm-11-06272)]. A recent systematic review [ [140](#B140-jcm-11-06272)] collected and analyzed 11 cohort studies published during 2020 and 2021 and regarding 615,777 COVID-19 infected subjects, with a follow-up of more than 10 months. From this comprehensive review the following outcomes can be highlighted: (a) reinfection is a relatively rare event (probability of reinfection between 0% and 1.1%), (b) no studies report an increased risk of recurrence over time. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that the protection against contagion provided by vaccinations is both inferior and less lasting than the protective effect of the natural immunity after COVID-19 [ [141](#B141-jcm-11-06272)]. More specifically, the authors have also noticed that natural immunity does not vanish at least in the 10 months following the primary infection. A similar conclusion was reached in another trial [ [136](#B136-jcm-11-06272)] where it was shown that in the 90 days following primary infection, immunity tends to grow; this finding suggests that natural immunity can last for a very long time. 4.6. Comparisons between Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Subjects in the Development of Immunity and Therefore of Possible Reinfections [142](#B142-jcm-11-06272)] and in individuals subjected to complete vaccination course [ [143](#B143-jcm-11-06272)]. Specifically, in the review carried out by the group of Kojima et al. [ [142](#B142-jcm-11-06272)], the weighted mean reduction in the risk of reinfection was 90.4% with a standard deviation of 7.7%. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection has been observed for 10 months and was similar to that offered by vaccination [ [144](#B144-jcm-11-06272)]. [145](#B145-jcm-11-06272), [146](#B146-jcm-11-06272), [147](#B147-jcm-11-06272)] and reported a relatively small group of healed in the subgroup analysis (3-0.15% of the overall cohort). Among the four retrospective observational cohort studies, one non-sponsored study examined the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 52,238 employees of a US healthcare system. This incidence was nearly zero among healed unvaccinated subjects, previously healed vaccinated subjects and also among vaccinated COVID-19-na\u00efve subjects. Furthermore, no statistically significant benefit was found for vaccination in individuals recovered from COVID-19. [148](#B148-jcm-11-06272)], included 6.3 million adults and used a dynamic model with adjustment for age, gender, previous PCR test results, and common risk. This study found excellent vaccine efficacy in the COVID-19-na\u00efve group, which was greater than 92%. Additionally, in this study, protection in the unvaccinated cohort was slightly higher with 94.8%, 94.1% and 96.4% protection against infections, hospitalization and serious illness, respectively. The main limitation of this study is the short observation period (3 months). Another recent study [ [149](#B149-jcm-11-06272)] documented that SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to unvaccinated-previously-infected individuals, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant for symptomatic disease as well. When investigating the data related to the infection occurring at any time between March 2020 to February 2021, evidence of the waning naturally acquired immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve vaccinees still had a 5.96-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold increased risk for symptomatic disease. [150](#B150-jcm-11-06272)]; moreover, in one case [ [150](#B150-jcm-11-06272)] only the less frequently used ChAdOx1 Nov-19 vaccine was used. Lastly, some trials were conducted during the Delta strain emergency, which led to a reduced average follow-up. However, the authors of the review conclude that previous SARS-CoV-2 infection provided greater protection than the one afforded by the single or double dose vaccine. [133](#B133-jcm-11-06272), [151](#B151-jcm-11-06272), [152](#B152-jcm-11-06272), [153](#B153-jcm-11-06272), [154](#B154-jcm-11-06272)]. Specifically, a recent study has shown a relative 96.7% reduction in the incidence of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 in the group of recovered unvaccinated patients [ [135](#B135-jcm-11-06272)]. [155](#B155-jcm-11-06272)] analyzed the incidence rate of reinfections and hospitalizations in California and New York during the period between May and November 2021. From this analysis it appears that what affects the incidence rate granting immunity is mainly the timing of the last event, i.e., the time elapsed since the infection and/or vaccination. In fact, the hypothesis of a faster decline in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections in COVID-19-na\u00efve vaccinated than in unvaccinated recovered individuals has been verified by multiple studies [ [156](#B156-jcm-11-06272), [157](#B157-jcm-11-06272)]. Interestingly, literature data [ [152](#B152-jcm-11-06272)] show that in vaccinated subjects the initially highest antibody titers decrease by up to 40% each subsequent month, while in convalescents the reduction is about 5% per month. Moreover, it was clearly shown that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination elicits a strong systemic immune response by drastically increasing the development of neutralizing antibodies in the serum, but not in the saliva, thus failing to limit the acquisition of the virus upon its entry [ [158](#B158-jcm-11-06272)]. [159](#B159-jcm-11-06272)]; 13, 14, 18 months in the studies by Gallais et al. [ [154](#B154-jcm-11-06272)], Eyran et al. [ [157](#B157-jcm-11-06272)] and Dehgani-Morabaki et al. [ [160](#B160-jcm-11-06272)]). [161](#B161-jcm-11-06272), [162](#B162-jcm-11-06272)], as also confirmed through laboratory in vitro tests [ [163](#B163-jcm-11-06272)] and especially documented through the data provided by a systematic review [ [164](#B164-jcm-11-06272)]. [72](#B72-jcm-11-06272)], T CD4+ and CD8+ cells specific for to lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C in convalescent COVID-19 subjects and in subjects vaccinated with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. The authors proved that overall reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is similar in magnitude and frequency of response, with decreases in the 10-22% range observed in some test combinations. Unfortunately, this study does not include the last two Omicron variants (B1 and B2), however one recent study [ [93](#B93-jcm-11-06272)] found that in hospitalized patients with Omicron infection there were T-cell responses to spike protein, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins which were comparable to those found in patients admitted to hospital in previous waves dominated by Beta or Delta variants. Therefore, despite Omicron's extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, most responses from the T lymphocytes, induced by vaccination or infection, recognize the variant through a cross reactivity. [165](#B165-jcm-11-06272)]. Comparing the efficacy of natural and artificial immunity, a recent study found evidence of an increased risk of infection by the Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants compared to the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant after vaccination, without clear differences between vaccines. In contrast to vaccine-induced immunity, in the same study there was no increased risk for re-infection with Beta, Gamma or Delta variants relative to Alpha variant in individuals with [ [174](#B174-jcm-11-06272)] documented that the levels were similar in the two groups as to above, but this statistical finding was affected both by the numerical difference of the two compared subgroups in favor of the uninfected vaccinated (35 vs. 228) and by the short observation period (3 days after the 1st dose, 7-21 days after the 1st and 7-21 days after the 2nd dose in COVID-19-na\u00efve subjects). 4.7. The role of Hybrid Immunity [164](#B164-jcm-11-06272), [171](#B171-jcm-11-06272), [175](#B175-jcm-11-06272), [176](#B176-jcm-11-06272)] or improve the outcome of the disease [ [150](#B150-jcm-11-06272), [170](#B170-jcm-11-06272)] but in some cases these studies have been carried out only in vitro, and therefore do not consider the clinical aspects (see for instance [ [177](#B177-jcm-11-06272), [178](#B178-jcm-11-06272), [179](#B179-jcm-11-06272)]). For example, there are some studies cited by the European Medical Association (EMA) regarding the administration of two vaccine doses to the recovered subjects [ [148](#B148-jcm-11-06272), [179](#B179-jcm-11-06272), [180](#B180-jcm-11-06272), [181](#B181-jcm-11-06272)]. Actually, these studies contain various biases, such as the failure or insufficient performance of verification tests for previous infection, and, consequently, the detection of subsequent reinfection. As for reinfections, no clinical data emerges on the rates of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, which are fundamental for identifying the real clinical need to vaccinate a recovered individual. Finally, the groups are not closed: patients could be transferred from one to another depending on the vaccination or infection status. Therefore, the accuracy of the follow-up time estimates may have been compromised. [182](#B182-jcm-11-06272)] proved that the probability of infections after vaccination is significantly lower than reinfections after natural infection. It should be noted that in the same study reinfections were identified as two positive PCR samples, interspersed with a negative PCR, in the same subject after more than 60 days. According to both the CDC and the ISS, by definition, reinfection must take place at least 90 days after the first diagnosis. Alternatively, there must be sequencing that demonstrates the presence of a viral strain different from the previous one. The need to distance the diagnosis of reinfection, due to the possible viral persistence for more than 90 days, has been also highlighted by several authors [ [132](#B132-jcm-11-06272), [136](#B136-jcm-11-06272), [183](#B183-jcm-11-06272)]. [184](#B184-jcm-11-06272)] was meant to evaluate the reinfection rates in recovered patients, comparing them with the group of subjects who underwent COVID-19 vaccination. In this study the recovered population was divided into two groups (unvaccinated and vaccinated). This subdivision was dynamic, that is, the participants who were vaccinated remained in the first group (unvaccinated) for the first 7 days after administration, citing the time necessary for the vaccine to prove effective as a motivation. In fact, the same company producing one of the vaccines observed that within the first 7 days of vaccination there is a 43% increase in infections (FDA Briefing Document, [ [145](#B145-jcm-11-06272), [146](#B146-jcm-11-06272), [147](#B147-jcm-11-06272)]). Therefore, the allocation of the vaccinated subjects for the first 7 days in the unvaccinated group after vaccination in the study cited above renders the authors' conclusions on the comparison of reinfections in the two population groups debatable. [185](#B185-jcm-11-06272)]. Abu-Raddad et al. [ [186](#B186-jcm-11-06272)] through a large cohort study of 1.531.736 mRNA-vaccinated individuals in Qatar, found that among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 reinfections in those without antecedent infection 14 days or more after the second dose. Similarly, among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without antecedent infection. They concluded that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. A recent comparative trial [ [134](#B134-jcm-11-06272)] proved that the risk of reinfections, hospitalizations and deaths is reduced in SARS-CoV-2 reinfections versus primary infections. Furthermore, the authors compared naturally immunized subjects with vaccinated subjects and they concluded that natural immunity may offer equal or greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to individuals receiving two doses of an mRNA vaccine, but the published data are not fully consistent. Lastly, the role of hybrid immunity remains unclear, as to their findings. [187](#B187-jcm-11-06272)], circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells in recovered subjects after the second vaccine dose [ [159](#B159-jcm-11-06272), [188](#B188-jcm-11-06272), [189](#B189-jcm-11-06272)]. When present, this increase is characterized by the rapid decay of the antibody titer [ [160](#B160-jcm-11-06272)], concurrent with a greater occurrence of the post-vaccine adverse events. Additionally, in one of the previously reported systematic reviews [ [143](#B143-jcm-11-06272)] it was observed that vaccination in subjects recovered from COVID-19 provides modest protection from reinfection (RR = 1.82 [95% CI 1.21-2.73], p = 0.004) with an extremely marginal difference in absolute risk (RA = 0.004 person-years [95% CI 0.001-0.007], p = 0.02); at the same time, adverse events after vaccine injection were more frequent after the second dose (mean: 0.95 vs. 1, 91) in healed subjects compared to the COVID-19\u2014na\u00efve ones (mean: 1.63 vs. 2.35). 4.8. Effectiveness of Natural and Artificial Immunity against Omicron [190](#B190-jcm-11-06272)] was first announced on 24 November 2021. This variant has over 30 mutations concerning the Spike protein [ [191](#B191-jcm-11-06272)], of which 15 mutations are located in the Binding Domain of the Receptor (RBD), that is, in one of the main targets of neutralizing antibodies [ [192](#B192-jcm-11-06272)]. In total, the Omicron variant genome contains 18,261 mutations, from which more than 97% are present in the coding region, and the remaining 558 are detected in the extragenic region [ [193](#B193-jcm-11-06272), [194](#B194-jcm-11-06272)]. Preliminary indications showed that the Omicron variant is highly contagious but less dangerous than the previous ones [ [195](#B195-jcm-11-06272), [196](#B196-jcm-11-06272), [197](#B197-jcm-11-06272), [198](#B198-jcm-11-06272)]. There is evidence of a reduced risk of hospitalization for Omicron compared to Delta variant infections [ [196](#B196-jcm-11-06272), [197](#B197-jcm-11-06272), [199](#B199-jcm-11-06272)]. Interestingly, the (low) risk of hospitalization in children under the age of 10 does not differ significantly between the Delta and Omicron variant. Since the Omicron variant became dominant [ [200](#B200-jcm-11-06272)], there have been more infections among children, but of lesser severity. [201](#B201-jcm-11-06272)] involved almost 652,000 children under the age of five in the USA, and it showed significant reductions compared to Delta in terms of access to the emergency room, hospitalizations (34%), access to intensive care (65%) and use of assisted breathing (85%), which were however rare events. This study comprehensively showed a series of reassuring data which are most useful for estimating disease severity among children. [197](#B197-jcm-11-06272)]. Similar results were achieved also in a very recent Italian study [ [202](#B202-jcm-11-06272)]. In England, out of over 1.5 million cases (over a million with Omicron and 450,000 with Delta), Omicron variant in the unvaccinated was 5 times less lethal than Delta one in all age groups, and about 10 times less lethal in middle-aged subjects. [68](#B68-jcm-11-06272), [192](#B192-jcm-11-06272), [203](#B203-jcm-11-06272), [204](#B204-jcm-11-06272), [205](#B205-jcm-11-06272)]. However, it was shown that the individuals who have overcome the natural infection are protected from an Omicron infection slightly more than those who have had two doses of the vaccine. The difference, 61.9% versus 55.9%, is not statistically significant, but vaccination protection is known to decline much more rapidly over months than that following a natural infection [ [206](#B206-jcm-11-06272), [207](#B207-jcm-11-06272)], in addition to the lack of the mucosal protection which is typical of vaccines, and which is oppositely conferred by natural infection [ [158](#B158-jcm-11-06272)]. [197](#B197-jcm-11-06272)]. Part of this reduced severity is likely to be attributed to the protection of the previous immunity: those patients who previously had a Delta variant infection, when infected with Omicron, have a significantly lower chance of severe disease (62.5% vs. 23.4%) [ [208](#B208-jcm-11-06272)]. Hence, it was also speculated that a pre-existing innate cellular immunity, with or without detectable neutralizing antibodies, is likely to continue to protect against severe disease [ [192](#B192-jcm-11-06272)]. In particular, it was proven that the protection provided by previous COVID-19 infections against hospitalization or death appears solid, regardless of the variant considered [ [207](#B207-jcm-11-06272), [208](#B208-jcm-11-06272)]. Interestingly, a clinical study documented that a previous ascertained SARS-CoV-2 infection offers some protection against hospitalization and especially a high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals [ [197](#B197-jcm-11-06272)]. [207](#B207-jcm-11-06272), [208](#B208-jcm-11-06272)]. With regard to studies involving vaccinated patients, the results on the protection against contagion from Omicron seem to be currently contradictory. Some studies have analyzed T lymphocytes taken from people who received a COVID-19 vaccine or were infected with a previous variant and found that these T lymphocytes can respond to Omicron. Indeed, while antibody immunity may be short-living, the more resistant T lymphocytes are able to perform a variety of immune functions, including their ability to act as \"killer\" cells that destroy virus-infected cells and limit the spread of infection [ [191](#B191-jcm-11-06272)]. Overall, these specific T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, induced by a previous infection or vaccination [ [209](#B209-jcm-11-06272)] provide a broad immune coverage against the Omicron variant as well [ [210](#B210-jcm-11-06272)]. Unsurprisingly, a substantial degree of natural cross-reactive immunity between the different variants was also described in both two-dose vaccinated patients and in the infected patients [ [180](#B180-jcm-11-06272)] which is possibly due to the robust T Cellular CD4+ and CD8+ response generated by both vaccination and previous infection, rather than to the single antibody response [ [93](#B93-jcm-11-06272)]. [211](#B211-jcm-11-06272)]. In a retrospective cohort analysis of the entire population of an Italian region, a few authors followed 1,293,941 subjects from the beginning of the pandemic to the current scenario of Omicron predominance (up to mid-February 2022). After an average of 277 days, they recorded 729 reinfections among 119,266 previously infected subjects (overall rate: 6.1%), eight COVID-19-related hospitalizations (7/100,000), and two deaths. [212](#B212-jcm-11-06272)]. [190](#B190-jcm-11-06272)] and the natural immunity resulting from infections with previous variants [ [204](#B204-jcm-11-06272)]. In fact, the vaccine efficacy against Omicron has been shown to be significantly lower than that against Delta infection and it rapidly decreases in a few months [ [183](#B183-jcm-11-06272), [204](#B204-jcm-11-06272)]. It is also unclear whether boosting with Omicron-specific vaccines would improve immunity and protection [ [213](#B213-jcm-11-06272)]. [214](#B214-jcm-11-06272)], the Technical Advisory Group on the Composition of anti-COVID-19 Vaccines, while reporting about the most recent data concerning effectiveness of the vaccines against hospitalization, severe illness and death, declared the need for alternative, different vaccines; actually, the WHO committee indicated the necessary improvement and update of the vaccines, in order to have a high impact on the prevention of infection and transmission, also to stimulate a broad, strong and long-lasting immune response, finally to reduce the need for booster doses. [215](#B215-jcm-11-06272)]. All of these investigated patients had a symptomatic course of COVID-19 with mild to moderate manifestations. Basically, this further evidence documents that three doses of the mRNA vaccine do not prevent infection and symptomatic disease from the Omicron variant [ [215](#B215-jcm-11-06272)]. Furthermore, among infected individuals, Omicron viral load was similar between adults who received 3 or 2 doses of vaccine, which could suggest that the booster dose does not positively affect Omicron viral load [ [216](#B216-jcm-11-06272)]. [217](#B217-jcm-11-06272)] did not find large differences in the median duration of viral shedding among participants who were unvaccinated, those who were vaccinated but not boosted, and those who were vaccinated and boosted. [213](#B213-jcm-11-06272), [218](#B218-jcm-11-06272), [219](#B219-jcm-11-06272)]. Recently, Windsor et al. [ [220](#B220-jcm-11-06272)] identified three antibodies that neutralized all VOCs tested (including Omicron BA.1) and used cryo-EM of these antibodies bound with SARS-CoV-2 spike to suggest ways in which somatic mutation might restore VOC recognition by other antibodies. [206](#B206-jcm-11-06272), [207](#B207-jcm-11-06272)]. [193](#B193-jcm-11-06272)]. Furthermore, it was shown that BA.5 is resistant against the majority of monoclonal antibodies [ [205](#B205-jcm-11-06272)] but more robust data are necessary to assess the real clinical impact of the latest variants on the vaccinated and healed non-vaccinated population. 4.9. Incidence of Adverse Effects after Vaccination in the Recovered Compared to COVID-19-Na\u00efve Subjects [221](#B221-jcm-11-06272)]. [222](#B222-jcm-11-06272)] demonstrated that the antibody response of patients who had had COVID-19 was relevant and protective, thus focusing on the possible hyper-stimulation reaction triggered by additional vaccines. Alternatively, vaccination of recovered subjects could cause the formation of low affinity antibodies which would result in a so-called ADE\u2014Antibody-Dependent Enhancement\u2014phenomenon, above all when again exposed again to SARS-CoV-2. In fact, it was reported the association between more clinically significant symptoms after the first dose of vaccine in subjects previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [223](#B223-jcm-11-06272)]. In other well-conducted studies, it was shown that anti-COVID vaccination in patients with a previous infection can exacerbate the systemic response to the vaccine [ [188](#B188-jcm-11-06272), [224](#B224-jcm-11-06272)]. [188](#B188-jcm-11-06272)] specifically demonstrated that antibody titers of vaccinates with pre-existing immunity were 10 to 45 times higher than those of vaccinates without pre-existing immunity at the same time points, after the first vaccine dose (e.g., 25 times as high at 13 to 16 days); similarly they found that the antibody titer exceeded the median antibody titers measured in participants with no pre-existing immunity after the second vaccine dose by a factor more than 6. Although the antibody titers of vaccinates without pre-existing immunity increased by a factor of 3 after the second vaccine dose, no increase in titers was observed in COVID-19 survivors who received the second dose of the vaccine. The same study showed that local side effects occurred with similar frequency among participants with and without pre-existing immunity, whereas systemic symptoms were more common among participants with pre-existing immunity. [225](#B225-jcm-11-06272)], showed an approximately 50% increase in the risk of developing systemic reactions in the recovered and subsequently vaccinated subjects, compared to COVID-19-na\u00efve vaccinated individuals. The risk of local adverse events was also greater (from 20 to 40%) in the recovered vaccinated subjects in comparison to COVID-19-na\u00efve ones. In an experimental study which focused on the possible blood variations related to vaccination [ [226](#B226-jcm-11-06272)] it was established through a mathematical model that subjects with symptomatic COVID-19 after vaccination have a higher expected blood viscosity than those who have had asymptomatic COVID-19 or have not had it at all. [227](#B227-jcm-11-06272)]. [228](#B228-jcm-11-06272)]. In addition, to other published data regarding a higher incidence of vaccine-induced side effects in patients who overcame COVID-19 [ [229](#B229-jcm-11-06272)], a few authors highlighted that these patients previously affected by COVID-19 and then vaccinated had an increased incidence of side effects already since the administration of the first dose of the vaccine, as well as a greater severity of these adverse events compared to COVID-19-naive patients. Furthermore, also after the second dose of vaccine an increase in the side effects and severity was documented as well [ [169](#B169-jcm-11-06272)]. [230](#B230-jcm-11-06272)] documented that adverse events correlated to the first dose of mRNA vaccines are more serious in subjects previously affected by COVID-19 than in seronegative ones. [188](#B188-jcm-11-06272)]. 5. Discussion [102](#B102-jcm-11-06272)]. [143](#B143-jcm-11-06272)] -RR = 1.82, whereas it is significantly lower as absolute risk-RA = 0.004 person-years. Furthermore, the greatest protection refers to an event (reinfection in those who have already overcome an infection) which is already uncommon in itself [ [184](#B184-jcm-11-06272)]; moreover, it is also debatable whether it is worthwhile to vaccinate a recovered person, considering that the clinical manifestations of a reinfection are milder than the first episode. [225](#B225-jcm-11-06272)] in comparison to the side effects of vaccinated subjects without prior infection [ [229](#B229-jcm-11-06272)]. In these terms, the benefits/risks balance of hybrid immunity should also include the adverse reactions which take place in vaccinating not exist. [222](#B222-jcm-11-06272), [239](#B239-jcm-11-06272), [240](#B240-jcm-11-06272)]. [241](#B241-jcm-11-06272)]. Regarding Omicron variants, there are still some uncertainties. In fact, COVID-19 induced immunity mitigates the clinical manifestations of a re-infection with Omicron strain, hence the relative hospitalization rate is low. At the same time, vaccination shows a very low protective role against contagions with Omicron. [242](#B242-jcm-11-06272)]. [221](#B221-jcm-11-06272), [243](#B243-jcm-11-06272), [244](#B244-jcm-11-06272)]. Basically, if the host's immune system is overloaded with repeated exposure to the same antigen, reaching levels that exceed its stability limit, i.e., the self-organized criticality, there risk to develop autoimmunity increases. [Figure 4](#jcm-11-06272-f004)(adapted from [ [244](#B244-jcm-11-06272)]) shows how the repetition of the exposure to the same antigen, rather than the usual exposure to various antigens, may determine the phenomenon described above. 6. Conclusions [36](#B36-jcm-11-06272)]. [171](#B171-jcm-11-06272)]); of note, subsequent vaccination may raise this protection further. [245](#B245-jcm-11-06272), [246](#B246-jcm-11-06272)]. Due to the documented prolonged immune response after COVID-19, the further administration of vaccine doses, especially from the second onwards, according to the majority of the studies does not lead to a significant improvement in immunity. [227](#B227-jcm-11-06272)]. When taking into consideration future vaccination strategy, WHO indicted the need for a rapid update of the currently available vaccines; similarly, in the after-COVID-19 subjects, in view of the mild clinical manifestations of the reinfections and of Omicron infections, updated therapeutic and epidemiological strategies could be developed.
