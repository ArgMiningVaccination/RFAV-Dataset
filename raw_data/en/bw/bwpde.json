Whilerandomizedcontrolledtrials(RCTs)arethegoldstandardforevidence-basedmedicine,theydonotalwaysreflectthereal condition of patients in the real-world setting, which limits their generalizability and external validity. Real-world evidence (RWE), generated during routine clinical practice, is increasingly important in determining external eectiveness of the tightly controlled conditions of RCTs and is well recognized as a valuable complement to RCTs by regulatory bodies currently. Since it couldprovidenewideasandmethodsforclinicalecacyandsafetyevaluationoftraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM)andhigh- quality evidence support, real-world study (RWS) has received great attention in the eld of medicine, especially in the eld of TCM. RWS has shown desirable adaptability in the clinical diagnosis and treatment practice of traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, it is increasingly essential for physicians and researchers to understand how RWE can be used alongside clinical trial data on TCM. Here, we discuss what real-world study is and outline the benets and limitations of real-world study. Furthermore, using examples from TCM treatment on cancer, including Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, integrated TCM and Western medicine treatment, and other treatments, we elaborate how RWE can be used to help inform treatment decisions when doctoring patients with cancer in the clinic. 1.Real-World Study (RWS) 1.1. What Is Real-World Study (RWS) and Real-World Evi- dence(RWE)? Real-world study refers to the process of the collection of data (real-world data) related to the health ofresearch subjects in a real-world setting or aggregated dataderived from preset clinical questions and through analysis,to obtain medication utilization, potential benets, andbenet-risk clinical evidence. Real-world data refer to di-verse data collected on a routine basis related to physicalconditionsofpatientsbesidesdiagnosis,treatment,andcare.Notallreal-worlddatacanbecomereal-worldevidenceafteranalysis, and only real-world data that satisfy applicabilitycangeneratereal-worldevidence.Real-worldevidencereferstoclinicalevidenceontheuseandpotentialbenet-riskofa drugobtainedthroughappropriateandadequateanalysisof applicable real-world data, including evidence from retro-spective or prospective observational studies or interven-tional studies such as pragmatic randomized controlledstudies [1]. RWS is characterized by the use of large-scalesample data, relaxation of inclusion and exclusion criteria,long-term follow-up, attention to the real clinical setting,and selection of dierent interventions according to thepatient's actual condition and willingness, as well as the selection of broadly clinically signicant indicators to evaluate outcomes [2, 3]. RWS has been widely used in theresearch of long-term outcome evaluation of postmarketingdrugs, patient compliance, disease characteristics, raresubtypes of cancer, and special populations [4-8]. 1.2.BenetsandLimitationsofReal-WorldStudy. Foralong time, it has been rmly convinced that RCT is the most eective research mean to verify causality and the gold standard for testing treatment eects which drive the highinternal authenticity and accuracy conclusions of researchstudies [4, 9, 10]. However, with the poor extrapolation ofRCTand the sample size limited by dierent diseases, RCTrequires a lot of nancial, materials, labor, and time costinvestment which cause both operability and economicHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2022, Article ID 7770380, 10 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7770380benets dicult to attain [9, 10]. and they also have dierent benets and limitations. Case-control studies are easy to organize and carry out and cansimultaneously study the association between multiplefactors and a disease.

Second, the time sequence of exposure factorsanddiseasesisclear,sotheabilitytodemonstratethe causal relationship is strong.

Second, it is not suitable to studydiseaseswithaverylowincidence.(%_hird,becauseofthelongfollow-uptime,itispronetolossoffollow-upbias.Fourth,itrequires high design requirements and complicated datacollection and analysis. Traditionalclinicaltrialsplayaveryvitalroleinpromoting the modernization and standardization of traditional Chinesemedicine, but traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes theintegrationofheavenandearth,respectsindividualdierences,and follows the characteristics of syndrome dierentiation fortreatment, which determines that the types of studies men-tioned above are dicult to reflect the curative eect andcharacteristic advantages. Based on real-world settings, whichgeneralizes the conclusions, the emergence of RWS compen-sates the both scientic rigor and flexibilityshould be given to reflect the objective reality. RWS can fully reflectthesecharacteristics,providinganewpathandmeanfor TCM ecacy evaluation and evidence accumulation. In ad-dition, RWS can also be used for paradigm and programoptimization of complementary advantages of integrated tra-ditional Chinese and Western medicine to establish evidencefor clinical ecacy improvement. Finally, it can provide thebasis for early clinical research to develop new treatmentmethods. Although RWS has many advantages, this open,nonrandom research method also has some limitations: First,because of the lack of randomization and low internal au-thenticity, the reliability of the results will be questioned. Second,observerbiasaectsthequalityoftheresearchresults, especially the dierentiation of TCM syndrome and personalexperience, autonomy, and randomness. (%_hird, patients'compliance may not be high due to long follow-up time.Fourth, there are many confounding factors, so it is not onlydicult to distinguish the eectiveness of a single componentintheoverallinterventionbutalsotheresultsofthestudymaybe close to meaningless. Fifth, to a certain extent, because it isanobservationalstudyandnointerventionmeasuresaretaken,its research eectiveness has a certain lag [11]. In addition, itrequires a large number of research samples and even mul-ticenter events and has high diculty in data collection, hugeworkload, strong data heterogeneity, and higher requirementson statistical methods than traditional research, and most of them are retrospective analysis or post hoc analysis, so how to ensure the eectiveness of research evidence is a challenge.Nevertheless,RWS can complementother typesof researchtofurther supplementing evidence of ecacy summarizes the distinction between real-world studiesandrandomizedcontrolledtrials,cohortstudies,andcase reports. 2.Real-World Evidence from Traditional Chinese Medicine on Cancer Clinicalecacyandsafetyhavealwaysbeenthecorecontentof research in the eld of traditional Chinese medicine.However,withthecontinuousdeepeningofresearchaswellasitslimitations,RCTshavebeenunabletomeettheclinicaldemandoftraditionalChinesemedicinewhichisconsideredwith unique diagnostic advantages.

Traditional Chinese medicine has remarkable eects on cancers in the clinical practice, either directly inhibiting theoccurrenceanddevelopmentoftumors,orreducingthesideeects caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or re- ducing thedosage of other therapies.

Since acupuncture, moxibustion, and other treatments of TCM are rarely used in the treatment of tumors alone, they are mainly used to treat the adverse reactions andtumor-related complications.

A real-world study led by Li included 1988patientswithnewlydiagnosedlocallyadvancedmetastaticlungadenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2012 who received rst-line therapy getinib or erlotinib as well as the Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant treatment.

In addition, a real-world study of traditionalChinese medicine in the treatment of liver cancer analyzed thecommonly used Chinese herbal medicine treatments in livercancer patients and their impact on the survival of liver cancerpatients. It turns out that Jiawei Xiaoyao San and ChaihuShugan Decoction were the most eective Chinese herbalformula to improve the overall survival, as well as signicantlyimprove the survival rate of patients with liver cancer [19]. Byobserving the clinical ecacy and adverse reactions of patientswith advanced colorectal cancer treated with Jianpi JieduTongluo formula combined with tegafur maintenance under real-worldconditions,theresultsindicatedthatthisschemecan improve the quality of life of patients and prolong the disease-free survival of the disease [20].

As thebirthplace and most widely used country of traditional Chinese medicine, in fact, more than 80% of cancer patients in China have received traditional Chinese medicine treat-ment more or less, indicating that traditional Chinesemedicinehasanirreplaceablepositionandimportanceinthetreatmentofmalignanttumors.TraditionalChinesemedicinehas abundant experience in the treatment of cancers and hasdenite curativeeect on avariety ofcommon precancerouslesions [43, 44]. A large number of studies have also proved that traditional Chinese medicine including Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion as well as othertreatments exert their antitumor eects from multiple per-spectives and multiple targets [44-52]. (%_he antitumormechanismofChineseherbalmedicineisshownin Figure 1. Real-world study has received global attention since its inception due to its consistency to clinical practice [53].China, the United States, and European countries havesuccessively passed a series of policy bills to support thedevelopment of RWS [53-56]. Undoubtedly, the concept ofthe real world is extensively accepted by clinical researchers and RWS has set o a global research boom [57]. RWS is closely linked with human life and health in the eld ofmedicine which is clinical problem-oriented research thatinvolved all stages of the diagnosis and treatment processsuchasdiseaseetiology,diagnosis,treatment,prognosis,andclinical prediction models, which will overwhelmingly im-prove the quality of life and health of patients. Despite there are already reviews on the clinical ecacy and mechanism of TCM in the treatment of cancer, theclinical ecacy of TCM in the real world remains to bestudied [58]. In the eld of traditional Chinese medicine, RWSismostlyusedtoevaluatetheeectivenessandsafetyof prescriptionsthatcombinetraditionalChineseandWesternmedicine or to analyze the relationship between \"drug-drug,\" \"drug-syndrome,\" and \"disease-syndrome.\" In termsof research methods, the most widely applied one is ob-servational study.
