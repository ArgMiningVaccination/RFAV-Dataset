The CDC is tracking [reports of severe allergic reactions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html). If you see patients with reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine, please report them to the [Dermatology COVID-19 Registry](https://www.aad.org/member/clinical-quality/clinical-care/covid-19/registry). Each vaccine has different contents. Both vaccines the FDA has authorized for emergency use contain polyethylene glycol, an allergen seen with some regularity in chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose Three cases of facial swelling reported in Moderna vaccine trial Recently there have been some cases and case series of adverse dermatologic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines either on the injection site or post-vaccination. This includes small vessel vasculitis (1), cutaneous mucormycosis reactions (4), herpes-zoster (5-6), and nonspecific inflammatory reactions (7). Further monitoring and data are needed to determine if these adverse events are directly related to COVID-19 vaccination. The Academy is closely monitoring any reports of cutaneous side effects as the vaccine roll out gets underway and asks physicians to report cases of potential dermatologic side effects in the [COVID-19 Dermatology Registry](https://www.aad.org/member/clinical-quality/clinical-care/covid-19/registry). A [recent paper](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(21)00658-7/fulltext) in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology discusses 414 vaccine reaction cases reported to the registry, indicating that while cutaneous reactions to the mRNA vaccines are possible, none resulted in serious adverse events.
