The first issue of the bibliography was published in July 1964; since that time, irregular supplements have been issued. In its subject coverage, Aerospace Medicine and Biology concentrates on the biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental effects to which man is subjected during and following simulated or actual flight in the earth's atmosphere or in interplanetary space. References describing similar effects on biological organisms of lower order are also in- cluded. Such related topics as sanitary problems, pharmacology, toxicology, safety and sur- vival, life support systems, exobiology, and personnel factors receive appropriate attention. In general, emphasis is placed on applied research, but references to fundamental studies and theoretical principles related to experimental development also qualify for inclusion. Each entry in the bibliography consists of a bibliographic citation accompanied by an abstract. The listing of the entries is arranged in two major sections: IAA Entries and STAR Entries, in that order. The citations and abstracts are reproduced exactly as they ap- peared originally in IAA or STAR, including the original accession numbers from the respective announcement journals. This procedure, which saves time and money, accounts for the slight variation in citation appearances. Two indexes\u2014subject and personal author\u2014are included. An annual index will be prepared at the end of the calendar year covering all documents listed in the 1971 Supplements. inAVAILABILITY OF CITED PUBLICATIONS IAA ENTRIES (A71-10000 Series) All publications abstracted in this Section are available from the Technical Information Service, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., (AIAA), as follows: Paper copies are available at $5.00 per document up to a maximum of 20 pages.

A system for navigation, guidance, and control of a spacecraft to rendezvous with an orbiting target, based entirely on observations by handheld, unpowered instruments, and computations done entirely by hand, has been developed. This paper describes results of an interactive digital simulation of this system through a selected set of rendezvous missions. A previously reported study to evaluate the influence of error sources on the'system is extended to two new test cases. In addition, several perturbing influences not covered hereto- fore are examined, specifically: errors in the method of star sight averaging made to compensate for nonsimultaneity of a pair of sightings, incorrect knowledge of the interceptor spacecraft's orbital period, and astronaut computation error. An activity chart is included which shows the apportionment of two astronauts' time in carrying out rendezvous using the manual system. It is shown that rendezvous is achieved on all error missions without undue increase in fuel and/br~time~ relative to an 'error-free' missionr \u2014(Author)AVAILABLE ON MICROFICHE AUTHORS L_ AUTHORS'-.

(>(), DECEMBER 1971 IAA ENTRIESattention should be directed toward the forces which normally hold the system in equilibrium, as the gravitational force will change very little from its value at the surface of the earth. The forces which normally produce equilibrium tend to be reduced to zero in satellite motion. Even in the weightless environment of a satellite a finite-sized system will have to sense very small stresses to hold its geometric configuration so that threshold values of stimuli should be considered. In an experiment it was found that plants have a lower limit to their ability to sense gravity. G-R- A71-39969 Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A.

Effects of gravitation on the properties and behavior of living matter. Among the topics dealt'with are physical and physiological phenomena associated with geotropism; the responses of in- vertebrates and vertebrates to gravitation; gravimorphism in plants and animals; and the effects on organisms of 'weightlessness,' both simulated and actual. G.R. A71-39970 The organism and gravity - An introduction. Allan H. Brown (Pennsylvania, University, Philadelphia, Pa.). In: Gravity and the organism, j Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 1-9. In favorable examples it has been shown that the test organisms sense an accelerating force, loosely called g, as a vector, whether acceleration arises from gravitational, centrifugal, or other inertial forces, separately or in combination. The experimental evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the intensity of g can be the organism's guide to function and to development. A widely distributed ubiquitous g-sensing device of animals is the statocyst. The sensing devices which plants use for gravity perception are not well understood. A number of questions to be investigated by means of biological researches in space are pointed out. G.R. A71-39971 The physics of gravity and equilibrium in growing plants. G. D. Freier and F. J.

It is shown by mathematical analysis that it would be pointless to expect any effect of gravity to introduce perturbations in the action of diffusion unless the cell exceeded about 10 micron in diameter. The theoretical conclusions are confirmed by experiments on bacteria at 50,000 g. Physical considerations regarding a 'gravity receptor' are discussed together with effects of stress on membranes and the influence of gravity on the enzymatic transport. G.R. A71-39973 Oscillatory movements in plants under gravita- tional stimulation. Anders Johnsson (Lund Institute of Technology, Lund, Sweden). In: Gravity and the organism. .' Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 35-39. 8 refs. In living organisms the detectable response to a,gravitational stimulation often lags behind the stimulus. This time lag must be introduced into the equations describing gravitational compensating movements in plants. In the sunflower plant, Helianthus, large oscillatory movements occur. These movements can be described satisfactorily by a differential equation. Experimental findings are found to be in good accordance with the theory after a 'memory' function with respect to gravitational stimulation is introduced. G.R.

To discuss the physical forces involved in graviperception, several assumptions about the nature of the sensor are made. Accepting the hypothesis of a cellular statolith particle mechanism, a subdivision of the geostimulation is proposed. A method is described to test correlations between microscopically visible cell particles and the direction of geotropic bending. Within the framework of the starch statolith hypothesis, evidence is presented that the sensor does 557A71-39975 not stimulate by mere presence at the lower membrane but by some 'mechanical' action dependent on gravitational force. Features of auxin transport in corn coleoptiles are discussed. G.R. A71-39975 Gravity receptors in lower plants. Andreas Sievers (Bonn, Universitat, Bonn, West Germany). In: Gravity and the organism.

The gravity receptors of lower plants have been analyzed in detail only in two cases involving the sporangiophores of phy- comyces and the rhizoids of Chara. The negatively orthogeotropic sporangiophores possess two different kinds of georeceptors. Their specific nature is still unknown. The rhizoids of Chara foetida are positively orthogeotropic. In their tips they contain statoliths whose chemical composition deviates from normal cell particles. In the Chara rhizoid the Golgi apparatus and the statoliths function as a self-regulating cell system. G.R. A71-39976 Gravity receptors in phycomyces. David S. Dennison (Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 65-71; Discussion, p. 71, 72. NSF Grants No. G-8719; No. G-18889. The sporangiophore responds to gravity in two distinct ways. In the transient response, the physical distortion of the cell causes a brief but rapid bending in the opposite direction. In the long-term response, some intracellular mechanism, not related to mechanical distortion of the cell surface, responds to lateral acceleration and triggers a steady but slow bending that continues until the cell axis is lined up with the resultant acceleration vector. The cell surface distortion could be largely removed in experiments in which the sporangiophores were centrifuged while immersed in a fluid whose density is equal to that of the sporangium. G.R. A71 -39977 The susception of gravity by higher plants. Poul Larsen (Bergen, Universitetet, Bergen, Norway). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 73-87; Discussion, p. 102-104. 37 refs. On the basis of their behavior in geotropically sensitive organs it appears that the movable amyloplasts in certain cells are the particles whose interaction with gravity initiates the geotropic reaction chain. Experiments conducted with Lepidium roots furnish strong support for the starch statolith hypothesis. Most of the existing evidence can be reconciled with the view that amyloplasts function as statoliths. The susception of gravity, however, can evidently also take place in the absence of statolith starch, at least in certain organs as shown by the results of Pickard and Thimann (1966) on wheat coleoptiles. Starch-free, but still elongating, Lepidium roots, on the other hand, did not respond even to several hours of gravitational stimulation. G.R.statoliths in the roots of Lepidium. It is pointed out that, nevertheless, the kinetics of the Lepidium root response can probably be explained without reference to statolith behavior, though they seem also to be compatible with it. Current kinetic evidence must thus be viewed as contributing a great deal to the knowledge of geotropism without providing proof for a functional role for statoliths in roots. G.R. A71-39979 A case against statoliths. Arthur H. Westing (Windham College, Putney, Vt.). In: Gravity and the organism. 'Edited b\\ S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 97-101; Discussion p. 102-104. 39 refs. Some objections are raised regarding conclusions drawn by Larsen (1962, 1965) that his research findings support a statolith theory of gravitational perception. It is pointed out that of the various cell organelles and inclusions only starch grains (or amylo- plasts) seem capable of serving the statolithic function. A list of cases is presented in which plant organs perceive gravity apparently without the benefit of mobile starch. Certain additional lines of evidence that speak against statoliths are also mentioned. The- question is raised of whether it is likely that more than one means of gravitational perception exists within a single plant. G.R. A71-39980 Hormone movement in geotropism. Malcolm B.

The relationship between auxin transport and the geotropic response of roots and shoots is analyzed on the basis of a broad review of theoretical and experimental results. Geotropic responses are examined in three broad mechanistic categories, depending on whether curvature is brought about by the development of different rates of growth of the upper and lower halves of an organ which is already growing by irreversible expansion of cells in its subapical region (root and shoot); or by initiation of growth on one side of an essentially nongrowing region of an organ (glass node); or by differential increase in turgidity of cells in the upper and lower halves of an organ which is nongrowing and has no potential for further growth (pulvinus of Phaseolus).

The notions that the Cholodny-Went theory, which implies a supraoptimal content of auxin in roots, is not valid, and that indoleacetic acid is not the growth regulator functioning in roots, are critically examined. Experimental evidence obtained with wheat roots is presented to support the concept of a supraoptimal auxin content as well as the presence of indoleacetic acid in roots. V.P.

Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 131-133; Discussion, p. 134,135. 8 refs. It is shown that the classical type of explanation of geotropic curvature may well occur in many cases, and that lateral auxin distribution may occur through the gravity alteration of lateral auxin 558A71-39990 transport. On the other hand, there exist several alternatives for geotropic mechanisms, including redistribution of auxin following alterations in the polar transport system and involving other growth substances, such as ethylene, or even by qualitative changes which do not require differential cell enlargement on one side of the stem. V.P. A71 -39983 Linkage between detection and the mech- anisms establishing differential growth factor concentrations. L J. Audus (Bedford College, London, England), In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M, J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 137-149; Discussion, p. 149,150. 33 refs. In view of the diversity of structure in organs which detect and respond to gravity, the probability that different linkage mechanisms may operate for different organs is considered. In the root, it may be accepted as reasonably certain that amyloplast statoliths in the root cap ars the gravity sensors. Evidence is presentee* to support the theory that the lateral redistribution of these amyloplasts sediment- ing under gravity, coupled with an intrinsic radial polarity of some ultrastructural/biochemical organization of the root cap cells, causes the differential production of a 'message' from the upper and lower halves of the root cap. The message, which may be electrical or hormonal in nature, could induce the production of a greater amount of a growth inhibitor in the lower tissues of the growth zone, thus causing positive geotropic response. The coupling mechanism between gravity sensing and hormone distribution in the tip is likely to be induction of a lateral polarity in the statocyte cells themselves, resulting in a lateral transport of auxin and a differential release into the growth zone. Auxin redistribution seems to result from both a lateral movement and an augmented longitudinal transport on the lower side. Here, the linkage mechanism will depend strongly on what the gravity sensor proves to be in those organs. V.P. A71-39984 Bioelectric phenomena in graviperception. C. H. Henz (Lund Institute of Technology, Lund, Sweden). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago. University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 151-156; Discussion, p. 156-158. 31 refs. The older theories on the origin of the geoelectric effect (GEE) are reviewed, and its role in the geotropic reaction of plants is considered. It has long been known that an electrical potential develops across a plant shoot which is placed horizontally. Since the validity of the older theories was questioned by many physiologists, the GEE has been investigated in detail during the last few years. New measuring techniques have been developed without the drawbacks of earlier methods. With these techniques it was found that theories of the generation of the GEE and its role in the geotropic reaction chain were incorrect, and that the GEE was not a primary result of the action of gravity on the plant. Instead, it derives from the asymmetric distribution of plant hormone which takes place as a consequence of the effect of gravity on the plant. The precise reactions leading the GEE are not yet known. M.V.E, A71-39986 Geotropic curvature of Avena coleoptiles as affected A. R. Schrank (Texas, University, Austin, Tex.l. In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 163-165.8 refs. NSF Grant No. GB-5683. Data are presented that reveal some of the effects of externally applied indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on elongation and geotropic bending of Avena coleoptites which relate to auxin-induced electrical responses. The data presented suggest that, contrary to the belief held by some researchers that the action of auxin elicits a geoelectric effect, it is somewhat premature to relate auxin-induced electrical responses to the geoelectric effect.

NIH Gram No. N8-07631; Grant No. AF AFOSR 1246-67, Some of the known reflex mechanisms by which insects maintain stable flight are discussed, and an explanation of how these reflexes interact with the preprogrammed flight command is attempted. The most nearly pure gravity receptor organs in insects are shown to be the neck proprioceptors involved in the optomotor reaction that corrects both yawing and rolling errors and probably helps to control pitch, too. Other discussed flight orientation organs include wind-sensing hairs, companiform sensillae, and halteres. All of these organs are believed to interact with a central nervous program both by contributing to its overall state of excitation and by modulating details of its output pattern when such modulation is necessitated by organismal or environmental irregularities. M.V.E. A71-39988 Flying insects and gravity. Torkel Weis-Fogh (Cambridge University, Cambridge, England). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M, J, Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 177-183; Discussion, p, 183, 184.16 refs. The effect of gravity on flying animals is considered, and their gravity and lift perception is examined. Except for very small insects, flying animals make use of ordinary airfoil action and are con- structed so that the aerodynamic cross forces balance the pull of gravity. When the pull of gravity is compensated for, the animal is accelerated in a direction perpendicular to its normal path, the adjustment of the angles of attack may then seem upset and the wings unusable as airfoils. Effective aerial locomotion in the 'weightless' state would require a symmetrical construction which resembles a fish more than a winged animal. Some unpublished experiments have shown that the detection of lift in flying desert locusts seems to depend on a forward movement of the hindwings during the first two-thirds of the downstroke. In contrast to the movement of the forewings, this forward movement is a passive consequence of the aerodynamic lifting force, making it possible for the insect to differentiate between wind and mass forces. M.V.E. A71-39989 Proprioceptive gravity In: Gravity and the organism. 3996921-04) Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 185-194. 32 refs. Proprioceptive hair plates on several joints are shown to act as gravity receptors in ants and bees. The experimentally determined relative importance of different joints for graviception is found to be correlated with the development of hair plates at the respective joints. Owing to gravity, the positions of an ant's body are altered relative to each other when the animal's position in space is changed. Although these deflections are large enough to be measured, they are still kept under feedback control by the ant. Ams and bees can be trained to run a constant-angle course with regard to gravity and thus to find their way in the dark on a vertical or inclined surface. M.V.E.

Two alternative interpretations, differing in the signal used for gravity orientation, are proposed to explain the observation that the elimination of proprioceptive hair plates in several joints of bees and ants reduces their gravity orientation capability. In view of their connection through a feedback loop, both hair plates and strain receptors are accepted as possible gravity receptors. The experiments with stick insects show that the linear component of the body pressure on the legs is an adequate stimulus for gravity receptors in the legs.

In all cases accessible to studies the mechanical sensitivity of the sensory cilium was directed at right angles to the line joining the central pair of fibrils. It was also found that the rootlets, ciliary shafts and stereocilia were not essential in mechanical transduction. V.Z.

The relations between the statocyst function and the motor activity of Crustacea are discussed at various levels of complexity, covering basic anatomy of the statocyst and the mechanism of stimulation, statocyst input and compensatory eye movements, integration of the statocyst and proprioceptor information, and locomotion orientation of intact animals with respect to the gravitational field. Sensory hairs are found to be stimulated when they are bent by the shear component of statolith weight. Electro- physiological tests indicate that the conversion of a mechanical input into nervous activity in the receptor system is linear and that the equilibrium reactions and the compensatory eye movements depend on the statocyst input. Spiny lobsters are used to study the compensatory eye movements during the interaction between the statocyst and a proprioceptor. It is also found that orientation in shrimps under various g is controlled by a feedback loop in which the statocysts are the recording devices. V.Z. A71-39993 The integrative action of the nervous system in crustacean equilibrium reactions. William J. Davis (Oregon, Uni- versity, Eugene, Ore.). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 237-247; Discussion, p. 247-250. 21 refs. PHS Grants No. 5 R01 NB 01624; No. NS-09050. The integrative role of the central nervous system of Homarus americanus in converting the gravity sensation into equilibrium reactions is discussed on the basis of published studies. Covered among the reactions are compensatory responses by which the animal adapts to tilted positions and righting responses seeking to restore the upright position. Details are given on the righting responses of abdominal swimmerets and uropods which are con- trolled exclusively by statocyst receptors. It is indicated that either the right or the left statocyst can alone control the righting responses of the appendages of both sides, even though the afferent responses of the two statocysts to roll in one direction are opposite. Neutral models based on the bilaterally reciprocal organization of statocyst influences are proposed to account for these findings. It is contended that these results may be applicable to higher animals. V.Z. A71-39994 Functional anatomy of the vertebrate gravity receptor system. 0.

Discussion of the otolith function in spatial orientation in thelight of various studies and theories. The anatomy of the otolith organs and sensory cells and the hair cell topography and function in the elasmobranch labyrinth are considered. Details are given on work by the author et al. (1968) on the labyrinth of lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis. It is concluded that the otolith organs of the vertebrate labyrinth respond to linear accelerations in general and, con- sequently, may be viewed as potential gravity receptors. They may also respond to linear translation, centrifugal stimuli, and rotating linear vectors at constant speed as well as to linear oscillatory accelerations in the form of vibrational and acoustic stimulation.

Discussion of the existence of true statoceptors in the vestibule. \\The main index for receptors responding to gravity is indicated as 1 lack of accommodation of the evoked activity, or at least as the presence of only a partial accommodation over an indefinite period , of time of constant linear acceleration. Various observations show that true statoceptors are found in the vestibule according to the accommodation standard. The basic characteristics of the stato- ceptors do not seem to vary significantly in mammals in comparison with lower vertebrates. The sensory coding by which the statoceptors send information to the primary analyzers is also discussed. The origin of the randomness of firing is classified as due to two factors, one intrinsic to the cell, and one extrinsic. It is pointed out that one of the most important extrinsic factors is the vibration of the head following the heart beat (head ballistocardiogram). M.M.

Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 283-291. 13 refs. Grant No. AF EOAR 64-44. Discussion of four different types of fish angular orientation behavior: the dorsal light reaction, the gravity reaction, the mainte- nance of an internally commanded position, and the semiconductor canal reaction. It is shown how these behaviors may be plausibly, but not unambiguously, interpreted in terms of their underlying sensory structures. Mittelstaedt's bicompetent theory is criticized, and the search for alternative models and new tests for that theory are advocated. It is stressed that the experiments made reflect an attempt to establish the semicircular canal response alongside the gravity response as an essential feedback loop in the orientation of fish. M.M.

Discussion of an additional uncertain area of sensitivity in central nervous tissue involving the possibility of a direct sensing of certain accelerational stimuli when these have a vibratory character. It is pointed out that orientation in the weightless state requires consideration not merely of vestibular mechanisms and closely related ocular coordination but of the whole hierarchy of functions in focusing of attention and visual discrimination. The former constitute the basic platform in a pyramid of increasingly complex central integration. The latter involve the interplay between cortical 560A71-40003 sensory systems and subcortical structures that are profoundly influenced by limbic activity. Limbic controls, particularly in the hippocarnpal system, appear essential to the fine focusing of attention necessary for laying down memory traces about spatially organized stimuli. Interference with such controls leads to degrada- tion of spatial discriminative abilities in subtle but important ways that have particular relevance to problems of space flight, where gravitational cues no longer provide a key segment of environmental information and where compensatory mechanisms for this loss might evolve in prolonged space flight.

Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 311-313. 10 refs. Discussion concerning the function of the vestibular apparatus and related neuronal activities in the central nervous system. The influence of the vestibular apparatus on the core of the brain, such as the reticular formation, is considered, and certain findings concern- ing the possibility of vestibular inhibition of brainstem activities are evaluated, showing that a postsynaptic commissural inhibition may act as a compensatory mechanism for vestibular-induced oculomotor or postural adjustment. It is also shown that, together with the vestibular influences on the somatic activity in the brainstem, inhibitory and excitatory effects on the autonomic functions mediated through the medulla may occur.

Description of research on the influence of gravity on linear growth, lateral bud and shoot development, apical dominance, the initiation of flower buds, orientation of plant organs, and flower morphology. Some of the generalizations made are: (1) unramified shoots, coleoptiles, or roots inclined from the vertical toward the horizontal grow at a slower rate; (2) buds on a horizontally oriented shoot develop asymmetrically. Those located on the upper side form vigorous laterals, whereas those on the underside form only short shoots or do not develop at all; (3) apical dominance depends on a position of a shoot in relation to gravity; (4) fruit bud-set is often enhanced by inclination of a tree or branch toward the horizontal position; (5) there is a direct effect of gravity on the initiation of flower bud formation; and (6) the form (habit) of a plant depends on the orientation of its parts in relation to gravity.

Analysis of the geoepinastic bending of Fritillaria axes as a prototype of geoinduced plagiotropic growth, since plagiogeotropism appears to be a characteristic example of gravimorphism. Within the curved region of the axis a straightening zone is found below a zone of bending. Both of these zones move acropetally, along with the acropetal displacement of the zone of main elongation, during the development of the axis. The gravimorphotic process should be distinguished from the negative geotropic reaction induced by a brief geostimulation. which appears in a region below the curved part of the axis in older but still elongating cells.

Investigation of wheat seedling responses to chronic acceleration between 1 and 500 times gravity and of the factors which influence these responses. Chronic acceleration between 10 and 500 g produces effects on wheat seedlings grown in the dark at 25 plus or minus 1 C, such as: (1) the total height attained by the coleoptile in the four days of its development decreases proportionally to the accelerative force employed; (2) with higher accelerative force, the coleoptile diameter increases and the cross section becomes more circular; (3) as the accelerative force increases, total root length decreases both absolutely and relatively in relation to coleoptile height; (4) the work done by the seedling in erecting its shoot increases proportionally to the increased accelerative force up to about 100 g, beyond which the work increases but is no longer compensatory; (5) continuous accelerative forces retard growth more effectively at the temperature optimal for gravity than at lower temperatures; and (6) continuous accelerative force of 150 g following single-dose X-radiation reduces the sensitivity of seedlings to growth retardation produced by the radiation.

Discussion of the effects and significance of chronic accelerative forces on terrestrial animals. The following findings are pointed out: (1) over the range of observations, changes induced by chronic acceleration are covariant with, and appear to be dependent on, the intensity of the ambient accelerative force; (2) there are relatively little pertinent data for hypo- and hyperdynamic environments; (3) if the relationships developed at normal gravity and in greater, tolerable fields do not apply in the region from 0 to 1 g, there must be different and discontinuous (nonlinear) regulatory processes for accelerative forces above and below earth gravity; and (4) whether or not the chronic acceleration 'predictions' of weightlessness effects describe the real situation, thoy are useful. They provide a logical basis for designing satellite experiments with organisms which reflexively would substantiate or disprove the continuity of hypo- and hyperdynamic effects. M.M. A71-40003 * The effects of chronic acceleration of animals - A commentary. C. C. Wunder (Iowa, University, Iowa City, Iowa). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 389-410; Discussion, p. 410, 411. 48 refs. Research supported by the University of Iowa, the American Cancer Society, NIH, and NASA. Chronic centrifugation is a new area of investigation confined to a relatively few laboratories working with several different species of animals. Studies at the University of Iowa have established that such g fields: (1) influence the growth rate of animals, progressively decreasing the rate at sufficiently high fields but sometimes stimulating growth at moderate intensities in a manner dependent on temperature and size but largely independent of the nongravitational artifacts of centrifugation; (2) can sometimes provoke a temporary reduction in food intake, which is a partial cause of the initial decrement in growth observed with mammals; (3) results in eventual adjustments, which can include enhanced caloric intake, increased efficiency of oxygen metabolism, relatively larger supporting bones and muscles, enhanced circulatory pressure reflexes, together with altered circulatory resistance and altered fluid balance; and (4) influence life expectancy in a manner dependent on field strength.

Examination of the properties of plants subjected to continuous reorientation of field direction by clinostat, with discussion of two of the areas investigated: the effects of gravity compensation on tropism and the forces required for geotropic response. It was found that oat seedlings can perceive accelerations of the order of one ten-thousandth that of gravity, which indicates that any postulate as to the identity of the sensor must be compatible with sensitivities of this order. It may be inferred that the displacements induced in the geosensor by unidirectional continuous accelerations of such minute magnitude are not nullified by thermal motion or by protoplasmic movements such as streaming or localized sol-gel transitions.

Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 427-437; Discussion, p. 437. 9 refs. NASA-supported research. The horizontal clinostat was used in studies of auxin transport and distribution for the purpose of gaining information on the evolutionary mechanisms by which the typical terrestrial plant grew tall and spread its foliage for efficient capture of radiation. Clinostat speed was kept low enough to avoid the introduction of stress and vibrational factors. The reduction of basipetal transport reported by Shen-Miller and Gordon for coleoptiles is in agreement with the stunning effect on internodal length that appears when plants are made to grow for weeks without the additive effect of gravity on such transport. Gravity is found to equalize the downward move- ment of auxin in the stems of plants which are held erect by negative geotropism that depends on a lateral, downward transport of auxin. T.M. A71-40006 Effect of net zero gravity on the circadian leaf movements of pinto beans. Takashi Hoshizaki (California, University, Los Angeles. Calif.). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 439-442; Discussion, p. 442. Experimental research on the effects of simulated weightlessness on the circadian rhythms of leaf movements in pinto beans shows that the time at which the rotational treatment is started (in relation to the phase of the circadian rhythm) has a profound effect on leaf movements. Initiation of the simulated weightless environment during one phase of the rhythm has little effect on the leaf movements. If simulated weightlessness is initiated in another phase, the leaf movements cease; they do not resume until two or three days have passed. The results have significance for the performance and analysis of biological experiments in space. T.M. A71-40007* The experiments of Biosatellite II. J. F. Saunders, 0. E.

Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 443-450. 30 refs. NASA-AEC-sponsored research. Thirteen experiments performed on board Biosatellite II were designed to study (1) the influence of weightlessness on various biological processes and (2) the interaction of weightlessness with radiation produced by an on-board strontium-85 gamma ray source. Additional post-flight tests were performed to distinguish the effects of gravity from other flight factors. Findings which are considered to be indicative of weightlessness effects include abnormal chromosometranslocations in larvae, death of Tradescantia microspores, and cellular changes in wheat seedlings. T.M. A71-40008 Responses to gravity in plants - A summary. A. W. Galston (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.). In: Gravity and the organism. Edited by S. A. Gordon and M. J. Cohen. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971, p. 453-467. 23 refs. Research supported by the Whitehall Foundation and NSF. The varied responses of plant organs to the gravitational stimulus are examined from the viewpoint of the main functions and strategy of the higher green plant, and the patterns of response are discussed for specific ontogenetic stages. The geotropic response is broken down into components of sensing, transduction, amplifica- tion, and growth regulation. Experimental results obtained in an analysis of the movement of pea tendrils in response to mechanical stimulation are described, and a hypothesis of tendril movement is related to geotropism. T.M.

The advisability of considering animal phenomena in terms of only molecular mech- anisms is debated, and recent results on gravity sensor cells and intracellular conduction mechanisms are reviewed.

Hartmann (Oslo, University, Oslo, Norway). Acta Physiologica Scandinavica, vol. 82, Aug. 1971, p. 447-452. 13 refs. The possibility is investigated of identifying specific taste modalities e.g., the four basic modalities of bitter, salty, sour, and sweet - by applying a factor analysis technique to a suitable set of data. The technique is based on a correlation matrix between independent stimuli calculated from data recorded from chorda timpani single fibers in rats and on the assumption that specific taste sensation may be explained by an 'across-fiber pattern' input into gustatory primary afferents. The analysis procedure used strongly, supports the idea that there are specific and independent taste modalities. M.V.E. A71-40098 Expiratory p02 and pCO2 curves no. 1, 1971, p. 72-83. 16 refs. In German. Research supported by the Europaische Gemeinschaft fur Kohle und Stahl. To investigate intrapulmonary gas mixing, the expiratory pO2 and pC02 curves have been followed simultaneously and con- tinuously by mass spectrometry in 10 subjects. The curves were plotted against tidal volume during breathing of the following gas mixtures: 79%N-21%02, 79%He-21%02, and 79%Ar-21%02. The results indicate that the differences in the volume of gas expired for a given change in partial pressure may be attributed to variations in diffusion and convection in the central parts of the lung, whereas the differences in the alveolar plateaus of the partial pressure curves can be explained by diffusion in the peripheral parts of the lung and by the shape of the dissociation curves of 02 and C02.

A neosynthesis of alpha-glycerophosphate and 2,3- diphosphoglycerate was found in a human extraocular muscle. The mechanism of action of these substances as regulators of muscular metabolism is discussed. While with alpha-glycerophosphate no differences were found in the neosynthesis of muscles of patients with normal muscular equilibrium, a significant increase in 2,3- diphosphoglycerate radioactivity was observable in the extraocular muscle of squinting persons. A possible connection between ATPase deficiency and a stimulated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate synthesis is shown. M.V.E. A71-40136 Computer-generated displays for psychological research. V. D. Hopkin and J. F. Parsons (RAF, Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, Hants., England). In: Displays; Institution of of Tech- nology, Louqhborough, Leics., England, September 7-10, 1971, Proceedings London, Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE Conference Publication No. 80), 1971, p. 331-338. The type-338 programmed buffered display consists of an 8K PDP8 computer and a display subsystem controlling a 16-in. diameter CRT. The display can provide almost any combination of points, lines, or symbols, with control of intensity and scale. The picture can be static, moving, or steerable in the sense that the entire display area can appear to be steered over a larger potential display area. Lightpen and keyboard controls are provided, and joystick and rolling ball controls can be adapted. The operation of the system is explained for psychological experiments involving interception tasks, tracking tasks, steering exercises, climbing arrows tasks, and memory and calculation tasks. j.M A7 1-401 45 How does the nervous system function (Comment fonctionne le systeme nerveux). Jacques Taxi. La Recherche, vol. 2, Jan. 1971, p. 41-58. 8 refs. In French. Study of the structure of the nerve cell (the neuron) and the electrical phenomena of which it is the seat. Much knowledge has been gained by electronic microscopy and refinements of electro- physiology. Biochemical analytical methods have penetrated to the heart of the most complex molecular mechanisms. The simultaneous use of these three approaches has made it possible better to understand the transmission of nervous influx, a functional charac- teristic of the nervous system. This phenomenon sets chemical substances in play, the study of which has opened a new chapter of pharmacology. F.R.L. A71-40147 The human body and vibrations (Le corps humain et les vibrations). Alain Berthoz. La Recherche, vol. 2, Feb. 1971, p. 121-129. 5 refs. In French. The results of neurophysiological studies of the effects of vibration on the human body are briefly' reviewed, along with the status of attempts to determine safe limits of human exposure to vibration, to formulate specific preventive or prophylactic measures, and to devise therapeutic applications of vibrations. The vestibular origin of motion sickness is discussed, and some of the techniques are outlined that make it possible to determine the threshold of vestibular effects induced by low-frequency oscillations. Following an explanation of the worst deleterious biomechanical effects produced by oscillations close to frequencies of 4 or 5 Hz, muscular responses to vibrations are considered, and human safety require- ments are examined. In conclusion, the perception of high-frequency vibrations and the possibilities of therapeutic vibration utilization are discussed. M.V.E.A71-40149 Chronobiology (La chronobiologie). Alain Reinberg. La Recherche, vol. 2, Mar. 1971, p. 242-250. In French. Demonstration of the purposes and techniques of chrono- biology, revealing certain interesting possibilities resulting from its application. Chronobiology is defined as a scientific discipline having as its purpose the study of the time structure of organisms. The possibility of obtaining approximate values of various parameters of a rhythmic or cyclic variation is demonstrated. The determination of the spectra of biological rhythms and the classification of the rhythms into frequency groups are discussed. It is shown that biological rhythms are a part of the genetic patrimony, but can be affected by certain periodic variations of the ambient medium. Desynchronization effects due to transmeriodional flights are in- vestigated, noting some findings concerning the time required to reestablish certain circadian rhythms. The relation between the effects of medicines and the time at which they are administered is explored, and the possibility of altering the time structure of the organism is considered. A.B.K. A71-40174 * Effect of prefrontal lesions on trained antici- patory visual attending in cats. M. Schlag-Rey and D. B. Lindsley (California, University, Los Angeles, Calif.). Physiology and Behavior, vol. 5, 1970, p. 1033-1041. 23 refs. PHS Grant No. NB-8552; Contract No. N 00014-69-19-0200; Grant No. NGL-05-007-049. Five cats were trained to look at a left and at a right target on alternate trials and, while looking, to keep fixating the correct target for a criterion duration necessary to receive a visual stimulus, signalling a milk reward. Four cats showed a clear performance deficit in this task, after bilateral removal of the anterior sigmoid and dorsal proreus gyri. The fifth cat, although temporarily impaired following a similar unilateral lesion, did not show any deficit after a second contralateral lesion, more laterally placed in the frontal pole. A quantitative analysis of various biases underlying overt responses showed that the cats were impaired on specific dimensions of oculomotor responses. These results agree with recent stimulation studies localizing a frontal eyefield in the cat and support the hypothesis that in carnivores, as well as in primates, the frontal eyefields control voluntary eye movements. Some performance deficits in tasks requiring use of directional cues and selective attention, observed in carnivores following frontal lobe lesion, may be due to invasion of such frontal eyefields. (Author) A71-40176 The corneo-retinal potential as the generator of alpha rhythm in the human electroencephalogram. Jean A. Ennever, 0. C. J. Lippold, and G. E. K. Novotny (University College, London; Graylingwell Hospital, Chichester, Sussex, England). Acta Psychologica, vol. 35, Aug. 1971, p. 269-285. 15 refs. Research supported by the Medical Research Council. The amplitude of the waves of the occipital alpha-rhythm is significantly related to the value of the corneo-retinal potential. If the latter is zero, alpha rhythm is absent. The corneo-retinal potential can be experimentally changed by a factor of about three in each eye independently. Simultaneous recording, on the two sides of the occiput, of alpha waves, shows that their amplitude is directly proportional to the value of the corneo-retinal potential from the eye on the same side. This finding rules out the possibility that nervous connections from the retina are responsible for the concordance, since optic nerve fibers are distributed equally to both hemispheres. A new theory to account for alpha rhythm is proposed on the basis of this and other evidence. It is postulated that the source of alpha waves is the corneo-retinal potential, which is modulated at 10 Hz by tremor in the extraocular muscles. As a result of the anatomical arrangements of these muscles in the orbit, the 10 Hz waves are picked up mainly over the occipital regions.

Research supported by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Fund, the Swedish Medical Research Council, and the Swedish Council for Social Science Research. Catecholamine output, heart rate, and performance efficiency were examined in 28 Ss during two contrasting stimulus conditions, one of understimulation, and one of overstimulation. During understimulation the subject spent 3 hr performing a vigilance task, and during overstimulation he was exposed for the same time period to a complex sensorimotor test. Both understimulation and over- stimulation produced a significant increase of adrenaline and noradrenaline release as compared with a control condition involving a medium amount of stimulation. Subjects who excreted relatively more adrenaline performed significantly better during understimula- tion, whereas subjects with relatively lower excretion rates of adrenaline tended to perform better under overstimulation. When performance efficiency was related to heart rate it was shown that high-heart rate subjects performed better during understimulation, while low-heart rate subjects performed better during overstimula- tion.

A71-40185 Arterial pressure changes during spontaneous sleep in man. G. Coccagna, M. Mantovani, F. Brignani, p. 9 refs. Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Grant No. 69.02078-115.0817. An R 35F Galileo polyphysiograph with a catheter was used for continuous measurement of blood pressure in the brachial artery during spontaneous night sleep in 8 normotensive subjects 38 to 68 years old. EEGs, horizontal eye movements, electromyograms, EKGs, pneumograms, cardiotachograms, and digital photoplethysmo- grams were also recorded simultaneously. The arterial pressure was lower during the first period of sleep, increased gradually during the later hours and tended to be slightly higher during rapid eye motions. V.Z. A71-40213 * Bicarbonate requirement for elimination of the lag period of Hydrogenomonas eutropha. Roy Repaske, Carol A. Ambrose, Anne C. Repaske, and Margaret L. De Lacy (National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Md.; Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.). Journal of Bacteriology, vol. 107, Sept. 1971, p. 712-717. 11 refs. NASA Contract No. R-21-081-001; Grant No. NGR-09-005-022. Study of the effect of carbon dioxide and oxygen on the lag period of chemoautotrophically grown Hydrogenomonas eutropha. Minimum lag periods and high growth rates were obtained in shaken flask cultures with a prepared gas mixture containing 70% H2, 20% O2, and 10% CO2. However, excessively long lag periods resulted when the same gas mixture was sparged through the culture. The lag period was shortened in sparged cultures by decreasing both the 02 and CO2 partial pressures, indicating that gas medium equilibrationhad not occurred in shaken cultures. The lag period was completely eliminated at certain concentrations of 02 and C02. The optimum O2 partial pressure was 0.05 atm, but the optimum C02 partial pressure varied according to the pH of the medium and the physiological age of the inoculum. The changes in C02 partial pressure required to compensate for the pH changes of the medium had the net effect of maintaining a constant bicarbonate ion concentration. Initial growth of H. eutropha was therefore indirectly related to the CO2 partial pressure and was directly dependent on a constant bicarbonate ion concentration. A.B.K. A71-40225 * Perceptual masking - Peripheral vs central factors. Mitchell L. Kietzman, Robert C. Boyle, and Donald B. Lindsiey (California, University, Los Angeles, Calif.). Perception and Psychophysics, vol. 9, no. 4, 1971, p. 350-352. 25 refs. PHS Grant No. NB-8552; Grant No. NGL-05-007-049; Contract No. N 00014-69-A-0200-4024. Perceptual masking was studied under binocular and dichoptic conditions in order to separate peripheral and central interference effects. Under binocular conditions, when the test flash (TF) and the blanking flash (BF) fell on both retinas, both retroactive and proactive masking were demonstrated. Under dichoptic conditions, when the TF fell on one eye and the BF on the other eye, thus eliminating opportunity for intraretinal interference, there was partial retroactive perceptual masking and no proactive masking. These results suggest that binocular proactive masking is due to peripheral light adaptation, that binocular retroactive masking is due to both peripheral and central effects, and that dichoptic masking is due solely to central retrochiasmal interference. It is proposed that dichoptic retroactive perceptual masking affords a method of investigating central perception time, i.e., the time to consolidate a perceptual experience.

New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1970, p. 147-188. 79 refs. PHS Grant No. NS 08552-01; Grant No. NGL-05-007-049; Contract No. Nonr-4756. Study of mechanisms of arousal and activation which involve reticulo-thalamo-cortical systems. Thought, worry, and anxiety reflect emotional arousal at the cortical level; weeping, sweating, intestinal and other visceral activities regulated by the autonomic nervous system reflect cortical, diencephalic, and brain stem arousal; facial expression, muscle tension, and tremors manifest somatomotor arousal. Mechanisms of arousal and activation are especially iden- tified with the reticular formation of the lower brainstem. Upward extensions, including the ascending reticular activating system and its subsystems are closely related to, and interactive with, diencephalic and limbic systems which control emotional expression and emotional-motivational behavior. The concept of an activation theory of emotion is discussed in the light of early and more recent supporting evidence. F.R.L. A71-40250 Automaticity and automatic rhythms. Mario Vassalle (New York, State University, Brooklyn, N.Y.). American Journal of Cardiology, vol. 28, Sept. 1971, p. 245-252. 32 refs. Research supported by the American Heart Association, the New York Heart Association, and PHS. The nature of the automatic process in cardiac pacemakers is discussed with special reference to the mechanism of diastolic depolarization in cardiac Purkinje fibers as investigated by the use of the voltage clamp technique. The major factors controlling cardiac automaticity - the sympathetic nerves, the vagi and overdrive suppression - are analyzed. Under different conditions, both sym- pathetic and vagus nerve stimulation can lead to a slowing or acceleration of cardiac pacemakers. The mechanism by which the sympathetic nerves can slow and the vagus nerve accelerate the 564A71-40345 pacemaker rate is reported. The inhibition exerted by the sinus node on idioventricular pacemakers through overdrive suppression is described: overdrive suppression is a form of inhibition that operates when a pacemaker is driven at a rate faster than its own. The mechanism of overdrive suppression is indicated by a frequency- dependent electrogenic sodium extrusion. Automatic rhythms are classified according to different mechanisms of production; they can result from an exaggeration of the normal automatic process or from mechanisms absent under normal conditions. Examples of different arrhythmias are given, and it is noted that some types of tachycardias can occur while automaticity is depressed. (Author) A71 -40255* Centrifugally obtained artificial gravity. Robert E. McGaughy (Bellcomm, Inc., Washington, D.C.) and Donald B. Hoffman (McKinsey and Co., Inc., Washington, D.C.). Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, vol. 18, May-June 1971, p. 323-354. 17 refs. Contract No. NASw-417. The physical nature of the artificial gravity field produced by rotating a spacecraft in earth orbit is examined from the point of view of an astronaut living inside. He will experience an unusual environment which is caused by (1) a much larger Coriolis force, relative to the nominal gravity strength, than on earth, and (2) a larger head-to-toe gravity gradient. We examine the detailed kine- matics of freely-falling particles and the dynamics of typical tasks performed by men inside the spacecraft. The results are discussed in terms of the ratio h/R, where h is the height above the floor at which the activity occurs and R is the radius of spacecraft rotation. It is found that if h/R exceeds about 0.1, the rotation effects become noticeable. Objects falling downward drift away from the rotation direction, and objects thrown upward drift in the opposite direction. Tasks requiring dynamic manipulative skill, such as hammering nails and walking, will require a significant amount of relearning if h/R is greater than 0.1. These unusual phenomena are particularly im- portant inside the hub of a rotating space station, since its effective radius is small. (Author) A71-40259 Some results of the flight of the Soyuz -9 spacecraft. A. G. Nikolaev. (International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress, 21st, Konstanz, West Germany, Oct. 4-10, 1970, Paper.) Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, vol. 18. May-June 1971, p. 390-396. Translation. Discussion of the flight of the space vehicle 'Soiuz-9,' which had a duration of 18 days and was undertaken, in connection with the program for solving problems of manned orbital space stations. One objective of the flight was the investigation of changes regarding the astronauts and their ability to perform work upon long term exposure to conditions of weightlessness. It was found that the human organism adapts itself to space conditions within a certain time. This time varies individually from a few hours to several days. However, difficulties in a readaptation to normal gravity after the flight are reported, and the preparation of special measures for solving this problem in case of flights of a duration of several months are recommended including a provision of artificial gravity for interplanetary flights. A number of scientific tests conducted by the astronauts during the flight are discussed. G.R. A71-40341 # Field study of transport aircrew workload and rest. Bryce 0. Hartman (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 817-821.7 refs. Study of transport aircrew sleep patterns in relation to fatigue and sleep disturbances. Sleep data were obtained from selected transport crewmembers flying 100 logistics missions and maintaining a log on work and rest on an around-the-clock basis starting 12 hours prior to each mission and ending after 3 days of post-mission rest. These sleep data indicate that a mission constitutes a significant physiologic load and that during the course of a mission a physiologic debt develops, despite the fact that regular periods areprovided for sleep and rest. The various 'stressors' acting upon crewmembers are discussed, and their implications are reviewed. M.V.E. A71-40342 Pulmonary capacity for dissipation of venous gas emboli. Merrill P. Spencer and Yohtaro Oyama (Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, Wash.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 822-827. 24 refs. Research supported by the Boeing Employees Good Neighbors Fund; NIH Grant No. HE-10258. Description of an experiment in which nine unanesthetized sheep with chronically implanted ultrasonic Doppler flow probes on pulmonary and brachiocephalic arteries were subjected to experi- mental intravenous injections of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Three different rates of injection (0.03, 0.09, and 0.15 cc/Kg/min) were used for 30 min each. Findings included transient and moderate elevation of right ventricular pressure, decrease in pulmonary blood flow, and diminished arterial 02 partial pressure. The degree of these vascular and respiratory changes was dependent on the kind and dosage of gas used. Bubble signals on the brachiocephalic artery were detected in 1 out of 5 02 and 3 out of 5 N2 injections at the 0.15 rate. C02 had the least effect and did not embolize the systemic circulation. Because of absence of clinical signs and plateauing of effects, it was concluded that the effects of continuous venous gas embolization at these doses can be tolerated and are reversible. (Author) A71-40343 * Bone density changes in a Macaca nemestrina monkey during the Biosatellite III project. Pauline Beery Mack (Texas Woman's University, Denton, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 828-833. 19 refs. Contract No. NAS 2-2711. The method of evaluating bone density in the flight monkey of Biosatellite III is described, with changes in density in 17 anatomic sites given during the period of the mission, both for the flight animal and the back-up animal which served as a ground-based control during the same period, with the former markedly surpassing the latter. A discussion is given concerning possible causes of losses in skeletal density in some anatomic areas of both animals, with losses generally more extensive in the primate which experienced 8.8 days of weightlessness than in the control monkey. (Author) A71 -40344 Decompression sickness - A fundamental study of 'surface excursion' diving and the selection of limb bends versus C.N.S. symptoms. B. A. Hills (Duke University, Durham, N.C.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 833-836. 16 refs. Contract No. N 00014-67-A-0251-0015. The total decompression time of goats has been titrated using the standard Naval schedule both with and without interposing an excursion towards the surface between the exposure and the decompression. For a dive of 30 min. to 170 ft it was found that a surface interval of 1 min had no significant effect. For greater exposures it was found that there was a threshold depth for the excursion interval separating C.N.S. from limb bends as the symptoms arising during subsequent titration of the decompression. The results are discussed in relation to emphasizing the fundamental inadequacies of conventional supersaturation theories of decom- pression sickness. The surface excursion is suggested as a very useful model for studying the treatment of C.N.S. symptoms. (Author) A71-40345 Study of reactivity of the organism exposed to transverse accelerations and radioprotectants. V. V. Antipov, M. V. Vasin, B. I. Davydov, F. Panchenkova, and P. P. Saksonov (Akademiia Nauk SSSR, Moscow, USSR). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 837-839. 26 refs. Description of the results of a study of the effect of drugs protecting against ionizing radiation on mice and the tolerance to back-to-chest accelerations. The investigations have demonstrated that radio-protectants may reduce the tolerance of the animal body 565A71-40346 to accelerations, whereas stress effects may increase the toxicity of aminothiols. This emphasizes the importance of studying the response of the human body to space flight factors in order to develop indications of taking certain drugs in these circumstances. M.M. A71-40346 Electrophysiological changes in humans during sensory isolation. E. A. Serafetinides, J. T. Shurley, R. Brooks, and W. P. Gideon (Oklahoma, University; U.S. Veterans Administration Hospital, Oklahoma City, Okla.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 840-842. 9 refs. Research supported by the U.S. Veterans Administration. EEC, EMG, EOG, EKG and Electrodermal Measures were obtained from 16 normal volunteer female subjects during a 4-hour period of sensory isolation of the water-tank variety. The results showed significant decrease of EEC voltage and frequency, of ECG rate and an increase in some of the electrodermal measures. The findings are discussed in terms of progressive reduction of cortical activities as distinct from sleep and diverse autonomic reactivity resulting from an overall reduction of sensory input. (Author) A71-40347 Effect of increased pressures of normoxic helium, nitrogen and neon on EEC and reaction time in man. R. E. Townsend, L. W. Thompson, and llmar Sulg (Duke University, Durham, N.C.; University Hospital, Lund, Sweden). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 843-847. 22 refs. NIH Grants No. HE-07896; No. HE-5662; Contracts No. NR-10-758; No. N 00014-67-A-0251-0016; PHS Grant No. HD-00668. The paper examined the effects of hyperbaric, normoxic breathing gas mixtures of helium, nitrogen and neon on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and simple reaction time (RT) in man during a chamber saturation dive. Subjects breathed helium-oxygen at One, 4.02, 7.05, and 8.57 Ata; nitrogen-oxygen 4.05, and 7.05 Ata; and neon-oxygen at 7.05 Ata. The only meaningful changes on any of the dependent variables occurred with increased pressures of the nitrogen breathing gas. There was a linear increase in RT, a suggestion of increased mean alpha frequency and an increase in failures to respond during the RT task with increased pressures of nitrogen-oxygen. Clearly defined EEG alpha block was observed at all pressures and with all breathing gases studied. The relationship of this finding to previous reports of a decrease in alpha block with increased pressures of gases containing a high partial pressure of nitrogen is discussed. (Author)Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 851 -855. 20 refs. Basal heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and maximum breath-holding time were studied in 20 healthy subjects of age group 22-28 years at an altitude of 11,000 ft. They were divided into two groups. One group was subjected to hypoxia, while the other group was exposed to hypoxia and cold simultaneously. The results indicate that simultaneous exposure to hypoxia and cold brought about a return of heart rate to near sea-level values and elevated basal minute ventilation. Basal blood pressure and respiratory rate did not show any significant change. Maximum breath-holding time showed a trend towards a rise after 10 days, while the other group (hypoxia alone) lagged behind in this response. (Author) A71-40350 Measurement of tremor in the Makai Range 520-foot saturation dive. Arthur J. Bachrach, David R. Thome, and Kenneth J. Conda (National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 856-860. 16 refs. Muscle tremor was measured on three aquanauts using a muscle force transducer developed to measure response variation within a specified force band. Tests were made during the 12-hour com- pression to 520 feet at 40 feet per hour, and during the 5-day decompression. Analysis of the power spectra revealed significant and stable differences among individuals, but in all cases tremor magnitude was within normal surface limits. Although there was a tendency for high frequency tremor components to drop out with higher pressures, neither total tremor nor the amount of tremor within particular frequency bands showed a significant systematic change with pressure. The stability of the differences among the divers may allow for the establishment of individual tremor 'signatures' as a monitoring standard. (Author) A71-40351 Noise and aircrew effectiveness. William R. Pierson (Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 861-864. 15 refs. Aircrew effectiveness was equated with the ability to interpret display data (perceptual judgments) and to make correct decisions when the choices are few in number (intellectual judgments). Eight hours' exposure to 100 dB(A) aircraft cabin noise had no effect on perceptual judgment ability or on the time required for intellectual judgment. During the second 4 hr of the 8-hr exposure there was a significant increase in the number of errors committed in the intellectual judgment task. A significant shift in hearing acuity threshold occurred, but normal hearing was recovered within 48 hr. M.M. A71-40348 Variables associated with split-period sleep regimes. Wilse B. Webb and Harman W. Agnew, Jr. (Florida, University, Gainesville, Fla.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971. p. 847-850. 5 refs. Contract No. AF 41(609)-67-C-0028. Eight young adult males had their daily sleep period split into two periods of 4 hours in length. Different lengths of intervening wakefulness were introduced between the two periods; 1 hour, 4 hours, and 12 hours. One of the two sleep periods began at 2300 each day. It was found that the total amount of the various sleep stages in the two periods did not differ from baseline sleep in the 1 hour and 4 hour split conditions; there was an increase in waking and light sleep and a decrease in REM sleep in the 12 hour condition. An internal examination of the sleep within the two periods for the three conditions indicates that the particular outcome of split periods of sleep will be dependent upon three factors: the time interval between periods, the length of the periods, and the sidereal time of onset.

IV - Production and prevention of decompression sickness in 'non-susceptible* animals. Chryssanthos Chryssanthou, Fritz Teichner, and William Antopol (New York, City University; Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, N.Y.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 864-867. 12 refs. Research supported by the Saul Singer Foundation and the Lenore Weinstein Fund; Contract No. N 00014-68-A-0393. Thin mice subjected to 90 psi absolute air pressure for 5 hr and then decompressed to sea level within 1 min do not develop decompression sickness. A relatively small incidence of the syndrome is observed when the animals, after a short surface interval, are further decompressed to a simulated altitude of 26,000 ft. SMAF (a smooth muscle-acting factor) markedly increases the incidence if administered prior to exposure to altitude. When, however, 2-(4- phenyl-1-piperazinylmethyl) cyclohexanone is given before exposure to 90 psi none of the animals develops the disease. The findings support the postulated implication of humoral smooth muscle- stimulating factors in the pathogenesis of decompression sickness, thus providing a new pharmacological approach for the prevention or amelioration of the syndrome. M.M. A71-40353 Changes in human urine and blood chemistry during a simulated oxygen-helium dive to 1,500 feet. P. B. Bennett 566A71-40360 and S. P. Gray (Royal Naval Physiological Laboratory, Alverstoke, Hants., England). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 868-874. 25 refs. Description of experiments in which two subjects simulated saturation oxygen-helium dives to 100, 300, 450 and 1,500 ft. Blood was collected before and after the dives and analyzed for hemoglobin, white cell count and differential, hematocrit, platelets, lactic dehydrogenae, and electro- lytes. Urine was also analyzed. In the experiments at 100 to 450 ft, due to lack of heating, there was a cold diuresis with urine electrolyte excretion following the increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At 1,500 ft, with no cold diuresis, there was retention of sodium, calcium, magnesium and chloride and a diuresis of potassium and phosphorus with a high corticosteroid excretion. No changes were noted in the blood except in the 1,500-ft experiment when post-dive there was a rise in leucocytes and a fall in platelets. The results are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms involved and correlated with the results of previous experiments. M.M. A71-40354 * Vascular and extravascular fluid changes during six days of bedrest. Philip C. Johnson, T. B. Driscoll, and William R. Carpentier (Methodist Hospital; NASA, Manned Space- craft Center, Houston, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 875-878. 10 refs. PHS Grant No. HE-05435-11; Contract No. NAS 9-7280. Body fluid spaces were determined before and after one and six days of bedrest. All fluid spaces were calculated and compared on the basis of fluid volume per kilogram body weight. The nine male subjects who participated in the study were divided into two groups according to their deviation from an ideal body weight as determined from individual heights. The subjects below ideal weight had a statistically greater mean ml/kg red cell mass, extracellular fluid volume and total body water than the respective means from the group whose weights were above ideal. During bedrest a decrease of statistical significance was found in the plasma volume but not in the red cell mass, total body water and extracellular fluid volumes. The data do not support the often stated theory of fluid and electrolyte diuresis as the cause of the slowly decreasing plasma volume loss found after the first 24 hours of bedrest. (Author) A71-40355 Heat acclimatization by the prevention of evaporative cooling. E. Shvartz and D. Benor (Negev Institute for Arid Zone Research, Beer-Sheba, Israel). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 879-881. 11 refs. The effect of a heat-acclimatization program was assessed in 5 male subjects by a work-heat test (5 km/hr; 50 C; 20% relative humidity). The acclimatization program included 4 exposures to 40 C, over a period of 2 weeks, during which the men walked on a treadmill at a speed of 3.5 km/hr while wearing vapor-barrier suits. Acclimatization resulted in final mean heart rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature, and sweat rate of 125 beats/min, 37.8 C, 37.7 C, and .918 kg/hr respectively. Three of the subjects, whose pre- acclimatization values were compared, showed mean heart rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature and sweat rate decrease of 21 beats/min, 1.0 C, 0.1 C and .113 kg/hr respectively. Sweat rate, expressed as per degree rise in rectal temperature, about doubled. These results suggest that preventing evaporative cooling presents a major factor in heat acclimatization.

Klemm (USAF, Environmental Medicine Div., Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 882-888. 10 refs. Comparison of physiologic responses to an hour of hyper- thermic stress (66 C ambient air, 10 mm Hg ambient vapor pressure).where the head was maintained in comfort, with those obtained under unventilated and air-cooled undergarment (MA-3) conditions. Head and MA-3 ventilation temperature was 15.5 C. Airflow to the head and one MA-3 subcondition was 5 cu ft/min. For the remaining MA-3 subcondition it was 12 cu ft/min. Head ventilation, involving merely 8% of total body surface area, more effectively reduces physiologic strain (in terms of cardiovascular and sudomotor responses) than ventilation of 60% (MA-3) of total body surface area under equivalent (5 cu ft/min) or even operational (12 cu ft/min) conditions. The premise is advanced that inclusion of the cold sensitive facial area in the cooling system design inhibits the otherwise active discharge of neural impulses from thermoreceptors. Depression of this neurogenic activity significantly attenuates the response of heat-compensatory mechanisms.

Lafontaine (Compagnie Nationale Air France, Paris, France). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 889, 890. 8 refs. Three cases of epileptic conditions of flight personnel with unconsciousness during flight are described. The nonexistence at the present time of techniques for detecting potential epilepsy is indicated. Careful examinations of the personal histories, with particular attention to head trauma and impairment of con- sciousness, and systematic EEC with hyperventilation and photic stimulation tests, are suggested to minimize epileptic fit hazards in the air. v.Z. A71 -40358 ff Vertiginous flyer - A review of 6 years' experience of the aeromedical consultation service. Frederic M. Brown (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971. p. 891-893. 5 refs. In this article the population of patients referred to the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine Consultation Service for vertigo, symptoms suggestive of vertigo, or vertigo-related diseases during a six-year period is described. Of the 96 cases studied 21 were found to have symptoms other than vertigo. Vertigo, cause undetermined, was the diagnosis in 42 of the remaining 75 vertigo cases. Such a large proportion of cases which could not be specifically diagnosed was probably due in part to an incomplete acute evaluation. A rigorous acute evaluation of all cases of vertigo is recommended in order to institute proper treatment, predict the likelihood of recurrence, and make the appropriate aeromedical disposition. (Author) A71-40359 Epidemiology of USAF spatial disorientation aircraft accidents, 1 Jan 1958-31 Dec 1968. Ferdinand Barnum and Robert H. Bonner (USAF, Directorate of Aerospace Safety, Norton AFB, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Aug. 1971, p. 896-898 6 refs. Demonstration that spatial disorientation is still a significant flight safety problem. It is indicated that 192 mostly highly qualified USAF pilots lost their lives because of disorientation during the decade from 1958 to 1968 and that age, experience and phase of flight contributed little to these accidents. Operational analysis of training, of flight, environment and of indoctrination programs is suggested to remedy this situation. V.Z.

An earth-like, 'back to nature' ecology for space colonies is advocated, in contrast to present highly complex, machinery-filled space base designs. Submitted here for general evaluation is the concept of a hollow, sunlit rotating space chamber in which human. 567A71-40406 plant and animal life cycles are sustained in a controlled weather environment. (Author) A71-40406 Resting and postexercise. apexcardiogram cor- related with maximal treadmill stress test in normal subjects. Wilbert S. Aronow, John Cassidy, and Ronald R. Uyeyama (U.S. Veterans Administration Hospital, Long Beach; California, University, Irvine, Calif.). Circulation, vol. 44, Sept. 1971, p. 397-402. 9 refs. Ninety-eight normal subjects (mean age 51 years) who had a maximal treadmill stress test were found to have a satisfactory apexcardiogram at rest and after a double Master's test. The mean resting a-wave ratio was 11.6% in 13 normal subjects with an abnormal maximal treadmill test, and 7.8% in 85 normal subjects with a normal treadmill test (P smaller than 0.001). The mean postexercise a-wave ratio was 19.7% in 13 normal subjects with an abnormal treadmill test, and 12.8% in 85 normal subjects (2%) who had a normal treadmill test. Seven of 13 normal subjects (54%) with an abnormal treadmill test had a postexcercise a-wave ratio of greater than or equal to 20% compared to eight of 85 normal subjects (9%) who had a normal treadmill test. V.P. A71-40407 Role of parasympathetic inhibition in the hyperkinetic type of borderline hypertension. Stevo Julius, Arturo V. Pascual, and Richard London (Michigan, University, Ann Arbor, Mich.), circulation, vol. 44, Sept. 1971, p. 413-418. 19 refs. Research supported by the University of Michigan. Eleven patients with borderline hypertension and high cardiac output were compared to 16 paid healthy volunteers. Cardiac output, heart rate, and intraarterial blood pressure were determined at rest, after administration of 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol i.v., and after administration of an additional 0.04 mg/kg of atropine. In four additional patients, response to infusion of isoproterenol before and after administration of 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol i.v. was evaluated. Resting heart rate and cardiac output in patients with borderline hypertension were elevated. After propranolol infusion, the values decreased more in the patients with borderline hypertension, but remained significantly elevated. After atropine administration, the difference in cardiac output and heart rate between the two groups disappeared. Consequently, patients with borderline hypertension and hyperkinetic circulation simultaneously exhibit an increase of sympathetic and a decrease of parasympathetic tone.

Berlin, East Germany, Akademie-Verlag, 1971. 195 p. $12. The papers are divided into four main sections: ecology of microorganisms in manned space flight; biological studies in space; sterilization and quarantine; and exobiology and origin of life. Much attention is given to questions of immunity and of microbial flora, and to problems of contamination in space flight. V.P.State-of-the-art knowledge on the development of specific active immunity, the factors responsible for 'natural' and nonspecific resistance, and how prolonged space flight may hamper these highly complex mechanisms is summarized. Viruses which classically may be induced to cause recurrent infections, such as herpes simplex and herpes zoster are described. The effects that altered host defenses might have on slow virus infections, such as kuru and virus-induced malignancies are examined. V.P.

Meeting co-sponsored by the Inter- national Union of Biochemistry, the International Union of Biolo- gical Sciences, and the International Union of Physiological Sciences. Edited by Wolf Vishniac. Berlin, East Germany, Akademie-Verlag, 1971, p. 11-16. 24 refs. Alterations in microbial flora and immunologic response of man which may occur during long-term confinement in a sealed cabin are examined. These changes depend on the environmental parameters, the duration of the exposure to various environmental factors, and on work-rest schedules. It is shown that under these conditions, some significant shifts in intestinal microflora, including a reduction of the number of species, can occur.

Methods of affecting protein synthesis in immune responsive cells are studied as a step toward the development of procedures that can be used to normalize human resistance to infections resulting from changes in endogenous microflora and immunologic reactivity of the human organism during prolonged space flights. It is found that ribonucleic acids stimulate antibody formation. Ribonucleotides accelerate the proliferation of immunocompetent cells. A single parenteral injection of a stimulant of this type is sufficient to sustain capacity for accelerated antibody formation for a long time. Methods of maintaining antigen balance are examined.

Three months old germ-free, monocontaminated (Staph. albus) guinea pigs, and guinea pigs with reduced fecal microflora, were used in the experiments. The lymphoid tissue in microflora-reduced animals, and especially in monocontaminated animals, was found to be underdeveloped. These changes were, however, less pronounced than in germ-free animals. It is suggested that a decrease in the number of microflora species in a macroorganism reduces the lymphoid tissue; the macroorganism may develop severe reactions of the microbial shock, when occurring in a normal microbial environment.

The capacity of lymphoid cells to participate in immunity reactions is evaluated by blast transformation of lymphocytes under the influence of phytohemagglutinin, blast transformation being measured by cytologic analysis and autoradiographic investigation of the rate of RIMA synthesis in cells (using tritiated uridin as label). An experiment performed with three test subjects over a period of one year showed that the blast transformation level of lymphocytes was significantly affected by various situations (changes in physical loads), and particularly by changes in the atmosphere.

Eighty-three microbiological tests of feces of 27 subjects were carried out with the object of obtaining detailed information on the composition of the normal human microflora, including the in- testinal flora. It is found that sporeless anaerobic bacteria pre- dominate (90%) in the fecal microflora. Aerobic microorganisms (lactobacilli, E. coli,-streptococci) amounted to less than 6% of the total microorganisms. Clostridia, staphylococci, yeast, and protozoa are always present in the normal fecal microflora, but in insignificant amounts (0.01% of the total). Changes in the microflora due to prolonged isolation are also studied. The data are discussed from the point of view of immunological responses of the human body. .V.P.

At the beginning of the experiment, colicinogenic E. coli (col/D and col/B) was found in one of the three test subjects (U-85%); he also showed the highest stability of intestinal microflora throughout the experiment. The two other test subjects displayed colicinogenic microorganisms of the same type plus an unidentified type only during and immediately after emergency situations. Hemolytically active E. coli was isolated from the subjects with unstable microflora under emergency situa- tions and at the end of the experiment. Periodicity in the predominance of Escherichia with antagonistic and hemolytic ac- tivity is related to the changes in the physiological state of the macro-organism and the rate of mechanical and possibly genetic exchange within the microbial associations in the human intestine.

Under conditions of long-term isolation in a sealed environment the microbial contamination of the skin and upper respiratory tract of man was much more pronounced than under normal conditions. This intensification of the contamination went on in a series of periodic increases in the amount of micro-organisms. Every such increase in micro-organisms was much more prominent than the preceding one. The harmful nature of trie rise of the level of microbial contamination of human epidermal tissues was expressed by the development of bacterial population shifts and periodic increases in the number of pathogenic microbial forms.

One to three persons were confined for 5 to 40 days in rooms measuring from 5 to 21 cu m, and the dynamics of the spreading of common and hemolytic microflpra on bodies, clothes, walls, and in the air were studied. After 30 to 40 days, the skin was found to be covered with several thousand microbes per sq cm, of which hemolytic staphylococci amount to about 500 cells per sq cm. Linen contained tens of thousands of bacteria per sq cm, including up to 7000 hemolytic staphylococci per sq cm. Contamination of the air increased during the experiments. Bacteria were found to accumulate steadily on floors and horizontal working areas, whereas accumula- tion on ceilings and walls were appreciably lower. The results suggest the need for special precautions to prevent the outbreak of various diseases among crew members. V.P. A71-40561 H Microbiological problems of manned space flight J.

Preflight assessment of immune status is recommended. A graduated preflight isolation period to permit exchange in flora, to protect astronauts from new agents, and to allow most infections to emerge is suggested. \\/ p A71-40562* # The ecology of micro-organisms in a closed environment.

Experimental data are presented which have a bearing on the susceptibility of astronauts to infectious diseases. These experiments include the observation of growth by two bacteria in Biosatellite 2, in which higher mean densities were attained than in earth-based controls. In addition, weightlessness combined with the special environment of a space vessel may affect the physiology of the astronauts. Earth-based studies in closed chambers were carried out under a variety of conditions with regard to pressure and oxygen content. One notable result was the transfer of micro-organisms from subject to subject. Comparative experiments were carried out in Antarctica and it was shown that the tests in closed chambers differed markedly from the Antarctica experience. The objectives and procedures of microbiological tests of the Gemini and Apollo programs are outlined.

An attempt is made to explain the unexpected demise of a monkey 16 hr after it was aborted on the ninth day of a projected 30-day orbital flight in June, 1969. An analysis of collected data indicates that weightlessness and the hypothermia acted to shift blood volume centrally, thus providing a strong drive for the reduction of blood volume. Restraint, unusual vestibular sensations, and the continuing polydipsia all acted to disturb the central mechanisms affecting salt and water metabolism; it is probable that the function of the kidney was significantly affected and that an excessive amount of salt was lost. Indications are that a serious electrolyte disturbance was superposed on growing dehydration. Unpleasant vestibular sensations may have contributed to the high evaporative loss by automatic disturbance, the whole problem being compounded and reinforced by the unnatural restraint to which the monkey was subjected.

Observations on phage induction are discussed and compared with results obtained aboard Biosatellite 2. A number of monolayer cultures of human cells (HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and A-1 cells) were repeadly exposed to the space environment. In one instance, HeLa 19 cells increased in size after exposure to space conditions, a change which appeared to be genetically stable. HeLa 19 cells which were carried on six separate space flights showed a higher viability than corresponding cultures which were exposed only once aboard Zond 5.

Space effects on the viability and heredity of the unicellular green alga Chlorella were studied during the Soyuz 5 flight in earth orbit and in Zond 5, 6 and 7 on their earth-moon-earth flight. A culture of strain LARG-1 was exposed aboard the ship on mineral agar medium in the dark. The flight in earth orbit aboard the Soyuz 5 brought about a significant falloff in cell survival and a gain in their mutability. There was a trend toward the percent growth of anomalies in autosporulation. The results obtained in experiments aboard the automatic stations of the Zond series were rather contradictory. The flight aboard Zond 6, like the earlier Zond 5, led to a statistically significant falloff in cell survival. The cell mutability remained unchanged. Space had no effect on cell viability in the experiment aboard Zond 7, but there was a trend toward anti- mutagenic action of the space factors.

Studies of the Martian environment as a possible life-sustaining medium are reviewed in an attempt to summarize information which could support the hypothesis of the existence of life on that planet. The temperature, humidity and atmosphere composition on Mars are discussed in the light of available data, particularly from Mariners 4, 6 and 7. Also covered are simulation experiments on bacteria, emphasizing the fact that radiation resistance of unicellular organisms depends on the state of their cells. It is also indicated that a low atmospheric pressure alone does not affect microorganisms, plants and even insects, and that Protozoa sustain an atmosphere of 99% C02 with 1% oxygen, so that even traces of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere may be sufficient for supporting micro- organisms.

A comparative evaluation of various methods for the detection of extraterrestrial life led to preference of the following ones: observation of the growth dynamics of bacterial cultures in nutrient media; increase in content of iron porphyrin proteins and ATP; change in pH of a medium; and measurement of radioactivity after addition of labelled carbon compounds to nutrient media. An electronic apparatus has been designed that makes it possible to receive signals indicating microtaial activity either by individual methods successively, or by three methods applied simultaneously (photometry, manometry, and measurement of radioactive C02). Studies on the optical activity, of soils provided evidence that the measurement of optical activity of soils can give an indication of life. The comparison of these different methods formed the basis for the design of a biological station aimed at the detection of extrater- restrial life. M.V.E.

The role of pilot fatigue, due to lack of sleep, irregular duty patterns, and sleep disruption, in pilot performance is analyzed. It is shown that sleepiness has much the same effect as alcohol on human skills and that there is a measurable deterioration of performance with lack of sleep. Inability to discriminate (or even detect) small signals was established in test subjects with two to three hours of sleep. Evidence is presented that pilot performance varies diurnally, and that it is affected by desynchronization of diurnal rhythm by time-zone crossing. Rest and duty schedules that would contribute to flight safety are proposed. V.P. 571A71-40693 A71-40593 * Studies of the electron transport chain of extremely halophilic bacteria. VI. Janos K.

Investigation of the contributions of hypoxia and hypercapnia to the differentiated changes of regional sympathetic activity during asphyxia in anesthetized, paralyzed rabbits. Under artificial ventila- tion with gas mixtures of various 02 and CO2 contents, the discharges of a postganglionic nerve twig accompanying the retro- auricular artery (cutaneous sympathetic) and of a splanchnic nerve branch (visceral sympathetic) were recorded. Pa02, PaCO2, pH, arterial pressure, and heart rate were measured. Moderate hypoxia (PaO2 27.2 torr) induced a differentiated response of regional sympathetic activity similar to that observed during moderate asphyxia - i.e., increase of visceral and decrease of cutaneous sympathetic activity. During severe hypoxia (Pa02 16.4 torr) both visceral and cutaneous sympathetic activity increased, the latter after a temporary decrease. During hypercapnia (PaC02 59.3 torr) only a slight increase of visceral sympathetic activity was observed, while cutaneous sympathetic activity did not change. It is concluded that the differentiated responses of the sympathetic nervous system during asphyxia are caused mainly by hypoxia.

Blood flow in arteries supplying cutaneous and intestinal vascular regions were simultaneously measured with an electro- magnetic flowmeter in anesthetized dogs, paralyzed with succinyl choline. The hypothalamic preoptic region was selectively heated and cooled by means of a stereotaxicaMy inserted, water perfused thermode. Skin blood flow increased during hypothalamic heating and was reduced during hypothalamic cooling. Conversely, intestinal blood flow decreased during heating and increased during cooling. Arterial pressure was not influenced by hypothalamic cooling and decreased slightly during heating. The changes of blood flow distribution observed in the experiments are in keeping with the results obtained during selective spinal cord heating and cooling. It is assumed that antagonistic changes of blood flow in the cutaneous and intestinal vascular beds represent typical thermoregulatory responses of systemic circulation induced by regionally antagonistic changes of vasomotor activity.

In anesthetized cats, the thoracic and lumbar sections of the cervical vertebral canal were selectively heated or cooled. Single unit activity was recorded with steel microelectrodes from the spinal cord. The positions of the electrode tips were determined by micromarking. The existence of two groups of temperature- dependent ascending spinal units was confirmed. One group of units was activated by spinal cord cooling below normal body tempera- ture. The other group was activated by spinal cord heating. No temperature-dependent neurons were found, so far, exhibiting maximum discharge rates at normal body temperature. A roughly proportional relation between discharge rate and vertebral canal temperature seemed to exist in both heat-sensitive and cold-sensitive units within a limit range of spinal hyperthermia or hypothermia respectively. Part of the units exhibited dynamic responses to changes of vertebral canal temperature in addition to their static responses. M.M.

Hypercapnia was induced by increasing inspiratory carbonic acid concentration at constant oxygen concentration. The mean arterial carbonic acid partial pressure increased from 40.5 to 70.5 mm Hg. The mean pH decreased from 7.30-7.14. Under these conditions the coronary flow did not change. Systolic and diastolic aortic pressure, left ventricular pressure, and the maximal rate of pressure rise in the left ventricle remained unchanged. Alterations of coronary blood flow caused by increased carbonic acid concentrations as described by other authors can be explained by a change of hemodynamic conditions.

A wireless measuring device for long term measurements of the diurnal temperature rhythm on unrestrained rats is presented. Up to 572A71-40854 5 rats could be tested simultaneously. The electronic units, the coating problems for the implanted transmitter, and the tissue reaction are described. It is observed that the circadian temperature rhythm in subcutis and in mammary cancer is almost in phase. The consequence of this is discussed. (Author) A71-40668 Visual field projection columns and magnifica- tion factors in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat. K. J. Sanderson (Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). Experimental Brain Research, vol. 13, no. 2, 1971, p. 159-177. 40 refs. The precision of the projection of the visual field to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat was studied by plotting the receptive fields of single neurons recorded extra-cellularly in the nucleus. The concepts of a 'projection column' and of 'random scatter in the location of receptive fields' have been defined in relation to cells in the LGNd. The projections of adjacent areas of visual field overlap extensively in the LGNd. In this study, the overlap of retinal afferents in the LGNd was measured in terms of the random scatter of receptive field positions for cells recorded in a given electrode penetration parallel to projection columns in the nucleus. The monocular receptive field scatter within a column in the LGNd is about of the same magnitude as both the monocular receptive field scatter within a cortical column and the binocular receptive field disparities of cortical units. The differential magnifica- tion of the visual field on the LGNd is a reflection of the ganglion cell density differences in the retina. M.M.Maffei. Vision Research, vol. 11, Aug. 1971, p. 833-840. 20 refs. Research supported by the Medical Research Council. A high-contrast grating was used to induce the tilt aftereffect. The effect was found to occur only close to the vertical and horizontal orientations. The interocular transfer of the effect is complete. Judgement of the horizontal and vertical orientations (as measured by determining the standard deviation at a number of orientations) is much more precise than for oblique orientations even when the cue of gravity is removed. All of the characteristics of the tilt aftereffect cannot be accounted for by adaptation of neurons selectively sensitive to orientation, even though they may play a significant role. T.M. A71-40706 * Stimulation experience and incentive variables as determinants of behavior elicited by hypothalamic stimulation. Verne C. Cox (Texas, University, Arlington, Tex.) and Jan W. Kakolewski (South Dakota, University, Vermillion, S.'D.). Psycho- nomic Science, vol. 24, Sept. 10, 1971, p. 245, 246. 7 refs. NIH Grant No. M-4529; Grant No. NGL-36-005-001. Extensive stimulation experience is shown to increase the proportion of hypothalamic electrode sites yielding elicited eating and drinking during electrical stimulation. The great number of stimuli required for some electrode sites, prior to the emergence of elicited eating and drinking, suggests the possibility that changes in neural tissues surrounding electrode sites underlie the appearance of elicited behavior. M.V.E. A71-40669 The properties of the binocular receptive fields of lateral geniculate neurons. K. J. Sanderson, P. 0. Bishop, and I. Darian-Smith (Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). Experimental Brain Research, vol. 13, no. 2, 1971, p. 178-207. 66 refs. The majority of cells in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body (LGNd) in the cat have two receptive fields: one for each eye. Of the cells tested for binocularity (113), only 21 (18%) were purely monocular. The remainder had receptive fields for the nondominant eye, the great majority of which (81 or 88%) were purely inhibitory and only 11 (12%) were excitatory. The proportion of inhibitory receptive fields for the nondominant eye was slightly greater when the dominant eye was ipsilateral (77%) than when it was contralateral (68%). The properties of the inhibitory receptive fields were studied with moving slits of light and stationary flashing spots. Most of the fields were purely inhibitory and varied in size from 1.5 to 6 deg across. There were no specific stimulus requirements other than a change in contrast within the receptive field. The inhibitory effect was usually fairly weak, the spontaneous discharge of the neuron being inhibited much more readily than the driven discharge. M.M. A71-40670 The retinal directional effect - A model based on the Gaussian distribution of cone orientations. Aran Saf ir (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, N.Y.), John Philpot (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J.), and Lyon Hyams. Vision Re- search, vol. 11, Aug. 1971, p. 819-831. 5 refs. NIH Grants No. NB-05895; No. EY-473. Additional measurements of the retinal directional effect in several subjects confirm the validity of a previously advanced theory which describes the retinal directional effect in terms of a Gaussian distribution of the orientations of a population of retinal cones. Arguments are given which show that the proposed population distribution theory is capable of explaining not only the directional brightness effect (Stiles-Crawford effect), but also its spectral variation and the hue shift.

Williams (U.S. Navy, Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Pensacola, Fla.), Karl S. Pearsons (Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., Canoga Park, Calif.), and Michael H. L. Hecker (Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, Calif.). Acoustical Society of America, Spring Meeting, 81st, Washington, D.C., Apr. 19-23, 1971, Paper. 13 p. Outline of a special test procedure to derive the relation between intelligibility scores and articulation index (Al) for time- varying aircraft noise. This relation is then compared with a relation between intelligibility scores and Al obtained for steady-state simulated aircraft noise. A secondary objective of the study was to compare various physical measures of aircraft noise with respect to their effectiveness in predicting speech intelligibility. It is shown that for a given Al, time-varying noise provides less masking than steady-state noise. E. Drets and Margery W. Shaw (Texas, University, Houston, Tex.).

Individual pairs of human chromosomes can be reliably identified by a new method that does not require special optical equipment and that results in permanent preparations. This method, . which is based on treatment of the chromosomes in situ with NaOH, followed by incubation in sodium chloride-trisodium citrate and Giemsa staining, results in highly specific banding patterns in characteristic regions of the chromosome arms. It should prove useful for the detection of small structural changes in chromosomes.

Lyons (California, University, Riverside, Calif.). National Academy of Sciences, Proceedings, vol. 68, Sept. 1971 p. 2092-2094. 10 refs. Citellus lateralis squirrels were kept at 23 and 4 deg C in experiments designed to determine the metabolic processes in 573A71-40864 mitochondrial membranes during hibernation. The activity of succinate oxidase from isolated mitochondria of hepatic cells of active showed a Arrhenius plot, suggesting that lipids in mitochondrial membranes may undergo a phase change at about 23 deg C. This discontinuity was not evident in mitochondria from the livers of hibernating squirrels, indicating the nonoccurrence of this phase change in their mitochondrial lipids in a state of hibernation. \\j z A71-40864 Criteria for the onset of vascular murmurs. Alvin H. Sacks, E. Glenn Tickner, and Ian B. Macdonald (Palo Alto Medical Research Foundation, Palo Alto, Calif.). Circulation Re- search, vol. 29, Sept. 1971, p. 249-256. 11 refs. PHS Grant No HE-11498. In an attempt to determine what blood flow conditions give rise to vascular murmurs, a general 'sound boundary' curve was devel- oped which establishes the combinations of minimum flow Reynolds numbers and percent stenosis required for the onset of vascular murmurs. The curve was derived by a combination of engineering analysis and animal experiments in which thin circular orifice plates were implanted in the descending aortas of anesthetized dogs. The results indicate that the sounds are produced by jet instability and associated 'free turbulence' in the flow. M.V.E. A71-40865 The two components of the human atrial action potential. Alexandre Fabiato Orsay, Essonne, France). Research, vol. 29, Sept. 1971, p. 296-305. 21 refs. Research supported by the Delegation Generale a la Recherche Scientifique et Technique and the Societe Medicale des Hopitaux de Paris. Action potentials studied in 36 human atrial muscle strips at 27 C were found to be separated into two components. Simultaneous recordings with two microelectrodes demonstrated an independent conduction of the second component through selective and variable pathways. Increased separation of the two components was elicited by higher rate and lower intensity of stimulation. It is concluded that the separation is attributable to a nonhomogeneous excitation of the preparation and that the two components are triggered by two relatively independent depolarizations using different channels.

Review of current concepts on the colloidal nature of proto- plasm, and survey of research on the coacervative state of colloidal suspension and on coacervative systems containing biological cata- lysts. The theory for the regulation of enzyme functions in a living cell is examined within the framework of colloidal-chemical ap- proaches to the study of life. Coacervates are examined from the following three viewpoints: (1) as models of the protoplasm and its elements, (2) as systems simulating the multiple-phase conditions of the cell for studies of the enzyme catalysis, and (3) as models of structures leading to the formation of the simplest organisms.

Journal of Experimental Psychology, vol. 90, Sept. 1971, p. 1-7. 14 refs. Contract No. NASr-54(06). A model-matching technique was used to derive estimates of two parameters, system gain and effective time delay, of a differential-equation model for the tracking behavior of fourth, seventh, and tenth graders. These parameters appear to provide more analytic insight into Ss' performance than did tracking error scores alone and suggested that the differences in time delay represent maturational effects while system gain is sensitive to more in- dividualistic properties of Ss' behavior.

Research supported by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Founda- tion and NASA; PHS Grant No. MH-10993. Cardiac rate-variability control and an initial demonstration of systolic blood-pressure variability control using visual feedback of physiological information were examined. Continuous measures of respiration, heart rate, EKG waveform analysis, and systolic blood pressure were obtained for both experimental groups and for yoked controls who saw the same visual display as the experimental Ss. Ss successful at reducing heart-rate variability showed clear changes in the P-R wave relationships of the EKG, indicating possible direct attempts to manipulate heart rate so as to reduce variability. Ss controlling blood-pressure variability who had high heart rates were 574A71-41060 more successful in reducing variability than those with low rates, possibly because of differential feedback to Ss with high and low heart rates. In addition, apparently as a reaction to E's adjustment of the visual target range, experimental Ss showed decreases in mean blood-pressure levels.

The tests were carried out with white mice of mixed breed weighing from 20 to 25 g and guinea pigs weighing from 300 to 350 g. The animals were subjected to back-to-chest transverse accelera- tions in a centrifuge. All the tested radioprotectants, which were administered 30 min and 4 hrs before acceleration, reduced the resistance of the organism to acceleration. The reactivity of the organism to radioprotective compounds during the aftereffect of transverse accelerations was also G.R. A71-41055 * Influence of aminazine and chloral hydrate on the intensity of the metabolism of individual components of the brain gangliosides Leningrad, Sistema, no. 11, 1970, p. 14-18. 14 refs. In Russian. Experimental data demonstrating different effects exerted by aminazine and chloral hydrate on brain gangliosides and on such ganglioside components as N-acetylneuramine acid and N- acetylgalactosamine. Aminazine does not substantially affect either the entire ganglioside molecule or the polysaccharide section components. Chloral hydrate changes the metabolism of the entire molecule and sharply increases the activity of N-acetylgalactosamine. The tests were performed on rats. T.M. A71-41056 ti Metabolism of glycerides in the brain under normal conditions and during hypoxia (Obmen glitseridov golovnogo no. 11, 1970, p. 18-22.8 refs. In Russian. The metabolism of individual fractions of glycerides in the brain of rats was studied under normal conditions and during hypoxia in order to obtain information on the role of glycerides in the biosynthesis of phospholipids. The results show that monoglycerides are intermediate compounds in the metabolism of the other glycerides and phospholipids. Diglycerides exhibit the highest specific activity of the fractions studied. The specific activity of both monoglycerides and diglycerides increases sharply during hypoxia. The largest increase (3.7 times) is exhibited by diglycerides which shows that they play a vital role in the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids. The triglycerides show only a small increase in specific activity during hypoxia, and it is considered likely that they constitute a reserve for the synthesis of biologically more important lipids under specific conditions. T.M. A71-41057 *' Content of gangliosides and cerebrosides in the brain under normal conditions, during hypoxia, and under the action of small doses of X-ray radiation (Soderzhanie gangliozidov i tserebrozidov (Leningradskii Gosudarstvennyi Universitet, Leningrad, USSR). Nervnaia Sistema, no. 22-26. 16 refs. In Russian. ._ ... .The content of cerebrosides in the brain of growing rats was reduced by 2.5 times and the ganglioside content was reduced by almost four times after short exposures to acute hypoxia. The cerebroside content of adult rats remained unchanged, and their ganglioside content was reduced by three times. The cerebroside and ganglioside contents of both adult and growing rats remained within normal limits after exposure to moderate hypoxia. The cerebroside and ganglioside contents remained unchanged for fifteen days after exposure to small doses (40 r) of X-ray radiation. The data show that small doses of ionizing radiation do not cause significant changes in the ganglioside and cerebroside contents of nerve cells. T.M. A71-41058 # Participation of butyric acid in 1970, p. 26-32. 20 refs. In Russian. The synthesis of brain glucose and glycogen from organic-acid products of the endogenic metabolism was studied in rats under normal conditions and during functional disturbances of the central nervous system. The dynamics of butyric acid penetration into the cerebral hemispheres was investigated together with the rate of accumulation of carbon-14 (originating from labelled butyrate) in the glucose and glycogen under normal conditions and during stimulation by caffeine and inhibition by chloral hydrate. Under normal conditions, the radioactivity of glucose is much higher than that of glycogen. Narcotic inhibition further increases the radio- activity of glucose and reduces that of glycogen. A still sharper decrease in the overall level of glycogen activity is observed during stimulation by caffeine. T.M. A71-41059 ff Role of orthodromic and antidromic impulsa- tion changes of the functional state of the contralateral cerebrospinal center during prolonged stimulation of a mixed nerve no. p. 41-48. 21 refs. In Russian. The peroneal nerve in frogs was used to study the role of antidromic stimulation of efferent fibers and the role of orthodromic stimulation of afferent fibers in the evocation of changes in the functional state of the contralateral symmetrical center. Prolonged (duration of several tens of minutes) stimulation of the mixed nerve by rectangular pulses of threshold strength at a frequency of 80 to 100 pulses per second causes long-term changes in the excitability of the contralateral symmetrical cerebrospinal center. Stimulation of the afferent fibers may both enhance and depress the reflex excitability of the symmetrical center, depending on the mode of tetanization. Antidromic stimulation of the motor fibers reduces the reflex excitability of the symmetrical center. T.M. A71-41060 ff Study 1970, p. 99-105. 6 refs. In Russian. The state of operational rest denotes a passive condition of heightened readiness in expectation of a stimulus requiring urgent active response. The situation is encountered in many practical situations when an operator awaits an urgent signal on a control panel. The waiting period is usually characterized by the complete absence of sensory stimuli and of muscular activity, which may have a detrimental effect on the response of the subject when the signal -finally presents itself. This possibility was examined by an experi- 575A71-41061 ment in which the waiting period was characterized by the presence of additional non-urgent signals requiring specific functions; in addition, some muscular nerves of the lower extremities were electrically stimulated. Care was taken not to remove the attention from the arrival of the urgent signal. The additional activation of the operator during the waiting period reduced the response time for the urgent signal and improved the functional state of the operator. T.M. A71-41061 # Trace processes as a basis for the change in efficiency during exercise and active rest according to Sechenov no. 11, 1970, p. 105-112. 16 refs. In Russian. The functional state continues to change in a phased manner after the stimulus has been terminated, and the necessity of analyzing these trace reactions when organizing rest and work periods in labor schedules has been demonstrated in previous studies. The present work examines the dynamics of trace processes in the symmetrical nerve centers of hands. The active rest mechanism is related with the trace exaltation phase on the basis of tests in which arbitrary rhythmic bending of fingers was used to determine the stimuli and sensations from exercised muscles. T.M. A71-41062 # Problem of the formation of a motor stereo- type with different muscular loads (K voprosu o stereotipa pri 1970, p. 113-118. 5 refs. In Russian. Training exercises were performed in which the subject was required to pull a lever with his right hand in response to a lamp signal. Completion of the task extinguished the lamp. The entire training period lasted from 50 to 60 min and consisted of 80 tasks in eight stages; each stage involved only one of four different lever loads. Measurements show that the training period is divided into three stages successively characterized by a reduction of the motor period, a stabilization of the motor period, and a reduction of the latent period. The electrical activity of the main working muscle increases for lever motions with small loads and somewhat decreases for motions with large loads. The static tension decreases in the course of the training period. Distal muscles are the first to be activated at the beginning of training, while proximal muscles are the first to be activated at the end of the training period. T.M.A71 -41064 H Investigation of the functional lability p. 140-142. 12 refs. In Russian. The functional lability (rate of nerve processes) of a sensory analyzer can be determined by measuring the minimum interval between two discrete stimuli which are controlled in force, duration, and area of application. An air jet was used as a tactual stimulus, and the critical discreteness interval was measured on the basis of speech responses and unconditioned blinking reflex reactions. The duration of the critical discreteness interval is described as a function of stimulus duration, pressure, and affected area by a first-order equation in a four-dimensional space where the coordinates consist of these four variables.

It is shown that each aventurine spot is perceived as a point light sourcejocated further from the eye pupil than the screen used in the observations. It is concluded that an increase in the degree of spatial coherence of the light flux increases the reaction of the receptor without increasing the stimulus energy. A.B.K.

In Russian. Description of two methods of extracting from the total electroaurogram pattern component relating only to the electrical activity of the heart. The first method consists in maintaining a fixed distance from the probe to the subject's chest, in order to decrease the mechanical vibrations of the latter with respect to the probe. The second method consists in limiting the frequency characteristic of the recording device. The types of information carried by the electrotonic and triboelectric components of the aural electric field are discussed. A.B.K. A71-41063 /' Adequatometry, discretometry, no. 11, 1970. p. 124-131. 11 refs. In Russian. The phenomena of molecular, cellular, systemic, and psychic levels are examined from common biophysical viewpoints. Dif- ferential excitability, reactivity, adequacy, and guidance are observed at all of these levels, and a theory is proposed for the relationship between recovery and creativity. The observed dependence of the depolarization of a single nerve fiber on the duration of the stimulus confirms the proposed definitions of differential excitability and adequacy. The latent period observed for both single and paired stimuli is examined as a possible measure of human biophysical neurodynamics. Curves of stimulus magnitude vs response duration were constructed for the blinking reflex, and the influence of nerve and brain adjustment processes on the blinking reflex was examined. The critical discreteness interval of the human tactual analyzer was measured, T.M.A71-41067 Ij An analog method of no. 11, 1970, p. 152-157. 15 refs. In Russian. Description of a scheme for constructing an analog statistical analyzer for measuring one-dimensional EEG amplitude distribution functions. The proposed scheme is based on the use of an analog computer to achieve transformation of tau sub i intervals into a sequence of square pulses with a standard amplitude and with lengths equal to the lengths of the tau sub i intervals. The use of the method is illustrated in an experiment to determine the reaction of a subject to a weak (threshold) acoustic stimulus. A.B.K. A71-41068 /\" Certain 1970, p. 158-161. 8 refs. In Russian. Description of a method of EEC analysis involving the use of an analog computer to construct a certain function characterizing the changes in the difference between the lengths of EEC wavefronts. The proposed method employs a scale amplifier, a signal differen- tiator, an amplifier limiter, a low-frequency filter, and two pulse- counting integrators. It is shown that a change in the nature of an EEC is reflected in a change in the above-mentioned function. The use of this method of EEC analysis is illustrated by considering the detection of a reaction in the human EEC to a fairly weak (threshold! acoustic stimulus. It is concluded that the asymmetry level is not only a fine indicator of a change in the functional state of the organism but also apparently has a certain physiological meaning. A.B.K.koronarorasshiriaiushchikh soedinenii 6, 1970, p. 157-160. 7 refs. In Russian. Coronary-dilating substances of low molecular weight, separated from their protein carriers through dialysis, are studied. After dialysis, these proteins exhibit no coronary-dilating effect, but, following their hydrolysis with trypsin, some coronary-dilating substances of low molecular weight are formed. The latter have been separated by paper chromatography. These results suggest that some specific proteins separated from the hypothalamus represent probably not only carriers but also sources of these active substances. M.V.E. A71-41069 ft Participation of thyroxine in the interaction of the isoenzymes of brain glutaminase, vol. 6, 1970, p. 5-13. 10 refs. In Russian. Investigation results on the role of thyroxine in brain bio- chemistry are discussed. It is shown that thyroxine enhances the deamidation of glutamine in brain mitochondria! fractions much more strongly than sodium phosphate, acetylaspartate, bicarbonate and aspartate. It is found that phosphate-dependent and phosphate- independent isoenzymes of brain glutaminase form an enzyme system whose interaction is affected by thyroxine. M.V.E. A71-41070 // Age-dependent changes in the free amino acid content of the cerebral arteries and carotid artery in man and vol. 6, 1970, p. 109-119. 17 refs. In Russian. Comparison of the free amino acid content and composition of the brain arteries with those of the aorta and carotid artery in young and old human subjects and dogs. The vessels of humans spanning the ages of 12 to 91 were studied 16 to 20 h after death due to various causes. It is shown that brain arteries have the larger free amino acid content and that, in contrast to other arteries, they contain considerable amounts of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The free amino acid content of all arteries decreases with age and reaches a minimum in old age. Findings pertaining to dog arteries parallel those concerning humans. M.V.E.

In Russian. A study of the loss of serotonin from rat midbrain slices incubated in media of various ionic composition showed that in a medium of low Na(+) the loss of serotonin was significantly blocked. Conversely, the most pronounced loss of serotonin was observed in the presence of ouabain. Whereas the loss of serotonin from slices increased in a K-strengthened medium, it was markedly impeded after incubation in a high K(+)-low Na(+) medium. The loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid from slices was not significantly affected by the omission of Ca(++), was slightly reduced in the absence of K(+), and was very markedly enhanced in a low Na(+) medium. Gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibited the release of serotonin from slices in a medium of balanced ionic composition. M.V.E.

The results of white matter composition studies indicate that the amount of lipids and phospholipids increases from the cerebral white matter to the thoracic section of the spinal cord after which it decreases. The lipids of the spinal cord and especially of the sciatic nerve are richer in phospholipids than the brain. The phosphatides of the white matter of the brain and of the various parts of the spinal cord and sciatic nerve are mainly ethanol-amine phosphatide, sphingomyelin, lecithin, and in lesser amounts serinephosphatide, monophosphoinositide, polyglycerophosphatide. The content of total lipids and most phosphatides in the white matter of the cervical and thoracic sections of the spinal cord is higher than in the lumbosacral section. But the relative percentage of phosphatides is very stable in the white matter of the various parts of the spinal cord. M.V.E. A71-41075 # Effects of gangliosides on active Ca(++) Yerevan, 6, 1970, p. 213-218. 17 refs. In Russian. The results are discussed of a study of ganglioside effects on the activation of respiration in rat brain mitochondria, using succinate (added both before and after the introduction of gangliosides) as the 577A71-41198 respiratory substrate. The results obtained indicate that Ca(++) activates mitochondrial respiration by 44 per cent while gangliosides inhibit this process. The inhibitory effect of gangliosides is markedly reduced when they are added after the succinate. The reduction of Ca(++) transport in mitochondria seems to be due to reduction in oxidative phosphorylation. M.V.E. A71-41198 The effect of a peripheral stimulus on accom- modation. Robert T. Hennessy and H. W. Leibowitz (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa.). Perception and Psycho- physics, vol. 10, Sept. 1971, p. 129-132. 13 refs. PHS Grant No. MH-08061. Accommodation was measured by the laser scintillation tech- nique while the S viewed a stationary fixation spot through a series of apertures in a screen located at various distances. The magnitude of accommodation was a compromise between the distance of the fixation spot and the screen. Accommodation was affected signifi- cantly by the interaction of the distance of the screen with aperture sizes of 1 and 4 deg and distance of the screen with its order of movement from near to far or far to near. The data are interpreted as implying the importance of the peripheral visual field and/or perceptual factors when conflicting cues to distance coexist in the visual field. (Author) A71-41199 The effect of perceived distance on induced movement. Walter C. Gogel and Michael Koslow (California, Univer- sity, Santa Barbara, Calif.). Perception and Psychophysics, vol. 10, Sept. 1971, p. 142-146. 12 refs. PHS Grant No. MH-15651. The magnitude of induced movement was measured as a function of the perceived depth between the test object and the plane of the induction object, with this perceived depth produced by stereoscopic cues. Predictions of the magnitude of induction as a function of the depth separation of the test and induction object were made from the subject-relative and object-relative hypotheses of induced motion. 'It was expected, however, that neither of these hypotheses would predict the results independently of a factor described in the adjacency principle. This principle states that the effectiveness of whatever cues or processes determine the induced movement will decrease with increased depth between the test and induction object. The data indicate that the adjacency principle must be considered in explaining the results. The subject-relative rather than object-relative hypothesis as modified by the adjacency principle was most successful in predicting the results. M.V.E. A71-41369 # Morphophysiological alterations under the ac- tion of electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies (Experimental Gordon. Moscow, Izdatel'stvo Meditsina, 1971. 136 p. 134 refs. In Russian. The monograph summarizes the results of morphological and physiological studies of the reversible and irreversible effects of radio waves on a total of 646 rabbits, rats and mice, covering chronic and acute exposures at 500 kHz to 1.5 MHz, 14.88, 69.7, 155 and 191 MHz, lasting from several minutes to 15 months. The functional and morphological changes produced by exposures of various lengths and intensities in the cardiovascular and nervous systems, myocardium, reproductive organs, biochemistry, blood, eye. weight, cerebrum, cortex, spinal cord, skin and neurons are discussed. Exposures in the centimeter wavelength range tended to affect the nervous fibers of the skin, internal organs and cortical neurons while exposures in the decimeter range showed no effect on the nervous activity of the skin. The monograph is intended for scientists interested in the subject. V.Z. A71-41374 # Synopses of experimental research on the higher nervous activity of man (from a growth 332 refs. In Russian. Systematic evaluation of long-term experimental research on the physiology and pathophysiology of human higher nervous processes. Attention is given to the forms of nervous activity in normal and pathological states, the interaction of the cerebral cortex with lower substructures of the central nervous system, the behavior and interaction of nervous processes, and the unconditional-reflex ac- tivities. The main features of the reflex-forming function are described, together with the interaction of signal systems and the properties of conditioned and nonconditioned inhibitions. Special attention is given to the development of nervous processes in the course of biological growth. T.M. A71-41418 Comparative study of hyperoxemic convul- sions and crise sa prevention). R.

A71-41476 The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. Symposium sponsored by the National Illumination Committee of Great Britain and the Imperial College of Science and Technology. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971. 424 p. $16.80. This series of papers brings together the knowledge and experience of scientists and engineers, those engaged in studies of perception, designers of signaling equipment, and users of flashing light signals. The sessions cover visual perception of flashing lights, general application of flashing lights, road, rail, and marine applica- tions, aviation applications, and research - recent and future. Discussions are included at the end of every session. Also covered are a study of the apparent flicker rate at subfusional frequencies, the treatment of binocular vision problems with light flashing at 9 Hertz, and a study of the behavioral effects of flashing road pedestrian beacon. Author and subject indexes are provided. G.R. A71-41477 Visual processes involved in seeing flashes. J. J. Vos and A. van Meeteren (Institute for Perception RVO-TNO, Soesterberg, Netherlands). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 3-16. 32 refs. Aspects of flash perception considered include the conspicuous- ness at suprathreshold levels, the unreliability at threshold levels, and the latency effects which may be used with profit to simulate movement. The most important feature of flash perception is the state of unpreparedness of the visual system. All sorts of electro- physiological experiments have revealed so-called, 'center-surround' processes in which the surround partly annihilates the activity of the center. Data on the quantitative importance of these processes have been derived in recent years from the study of spatial contrast sensitivity functions. G.R. 578A71-41486 A71-41478 Subjective brightness of a flashing light stim- ulus within the fovea as a' function of stimulus size. R. McD. Saunders (Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 17-28. 20 refs. It is found in the investigations conducted that the subjective brightness of a flashing light increases in two phases with increasing stimulus area. This is probably due to the integrated action of summation and inhibition in the retina. The transition area (the area at which transition between the two phases of increase in subjective brightness with stimulus area occurs) increases with increasing intensity. Background fields accentuate the shift in transition area with intensity. Edge effects contribute significantly to subjective brightness at suprathreshold levels but are insignificant at threshold levels. G.R. A71-41479 Threshold perception of flashes in relation to and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 29-42. 9 refs. The experiments conducted show a high degree of constancy of the ratio of flicker and flash sensitivities even in cases in which the mean level of intensity is varied over a large range. The product of cut-off frequency and critical duration is also nearly constant. This constancy is explained in a theoretical analysis based on three system properties. The ratio of the sensitivity S, which is defined as the maximum value of the amplitude sensitivity at a certain level, and the sensitivity of flashes F is considered. The numerical experimental value of this ratio is found to be larger (by a factor of 2.5) than theoretically expected. G.R. A71-41480 Absolute thresholds as a function of pulse length and null period. Douglas H. Williams and Terrence M. Allen (Michigan State University, East Lansing, Mich.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 43-54. 14 refs. Absolute foveal thresholds were obtained for a complete range of pulse lengths and null periods. It was found that the data could be described by a relation proposed by Blondel and Rey (1912), if the value of the empirical constant in the relation were variable. The constant is to be equal to the null period for very short null periods, and to approach the Blondel-Rey constant asymptotically for long null periods. A simple equation is suggested to describe the change of the constant with the null period. However, further data are needed to test the adequacy of this equation. G.R. A71-41481 Variability of depth perception under con- ditions of intermittent illumination. A. M. Mayyasi, W. L. Johnston, and W. T. Burkes (Texas A & M University, College Station, Tex.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of thet International Symposium, .Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 55-60. 15 refs. The depth perception scores obtained for the ten subjects tested under the various combinations of the experimental conditions were statistically treated by a specialized analysis of variance routine. Source of illumination was the only statistically significant parameter which affected the depth perception scores. The deta were further analyzed by the Duncan Multiple Range Test. The results indicatethat the average decrement of depth perception under conditions involving a central illumination source was positive (i.e., subjects placed the movable rod in front of the stationary rod). Under the conditions of a peripheral source the average decrement of depth perception was negative (i.e., subjects placed the movable rod behind the stationary rod). G.R. A71-41482 The application of flashing light stimuli to the detection and quantitative assessment of early pathological visual loss. C. H. Bedwell (City University, London, England). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Tech- nology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 61-70. 14 refs. The design of a clinical instrument employing flashed light stimuli is discussed. The instrument, called Visual Field Analyzer, is equipped with a separate external illuminator, which provides an illumination of 10 lux on a black screen. This screen contains the apertures for the stimuli, and has a reflection factor of approxi- mately 10%. A xenon electronic discharge lamp was chosen as the light source. The minimum discernible luminance difference observed as a function of the age of the subject is discussed to obtain a basis for the differentiation between normal and abnormal cases. It is pointed out that the use of the Visual Field Analyzer makes it possible to conduct routine visual field examinations. G.R. A71-41483 The influence of the angular size, adaptation luminance, pulse shape, and light colour on the Blondel-Rey constant a. H. J. Schmidt-Clausen (Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, Netherlands). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 95-111. 5 refs. The tests in the investigation were performed by two observers with good binocular vision. The observations were carried out at super-threshold luminances. The effects of the angular size and of the adaptation luminance were studied for white, blue, green, yellow, and red light signals with a constant pulse shape of the light flashes. With Bloch's law and the form factor relations for arbitrary pulse shapes can be determined. The calculation of the transfer factor of a light signal is discussed. The transfer factor describes the effective intensity of a flashing light in comparison to a steadily burning light under the same conditions of observation. G.R. A71-41484 An investigation of the effective intensity of flashing lights at threshold and supra-threshold levels. Edward J. Rinalducci and Kent E. Higgins (Virginia, University, Charlottesville, Va.(. In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceed- ings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London. England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 113-125. 22 refs. U.S. Department of Transportation Contract No. DOT-CG-83635. The stimuli in the investigation were presented haploscopically in Maxwellian view in order to avoid possible retinal interaction effects that might be obtained with monocular stimulation. A true standard flash of a fixed duration and intensity was employed. The method of co-terminating stimulus presentation was also used. The data obtained show the presence of a Broca-Sulzer effect for point stimuli only when the standard flash illuminance is 1 or 2 log units above the 99% threshold. The backward masking hypothesis sug- gested by Raab and Osman (1962) and Naus (1967) offers a tenable explanation for the results. G.R. A71-41485 A probability approach to visual effectiveness of signal lights. Guy P. Clark (U.S. Coast Guard, Applied Technology 579A71-41486 Div., Washington, D.C.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd. 1971, p. 145-151. 5refs. Data of Blackwell and McCready (1952) regarding the nor- malized standard deviation are considered together with the hypothesis that supra-threshold brightness matching is analogous to maintaining constant levels of the normalized standard deviation above 50% threshold. Data reported by Naus (1968) are used as an example of the use of this hypothesis. A set of curves is produced with the Broca-Sulzer effect clearly shown. The conventionally used real world threshold of 0.2 microlux is the basis of a 0.2 microlux curve presented. A similarity with the Blondel-Rey equation makes the 0.2 microlux curve a useful approximation. G.R. A71-41486 The relative conspicuities of flashing lights by a comparison method. R. A. Edwards (Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England). In: The perception and applica- tion of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 209-216. Research sponsored by the Road Research Laboratory. The possibility of classifying flashing lights of various character- istics in order of conspicuity, or attention-attracting value, is investigated by showing the observer the lights in a series of pairs and asking him to judge which one attracted his attention the more in each comparison. It is shown how the data can be converted into a psychometric scale of conspicuity. Practical precautions which should be taken to achieve the best results are outlined. V.P. A71-41487 Some theoretical aspects of an apparent motion phenomenon associated with certain configurations of flashing lights. David H. Foster (Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22,1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 217-224. 9refs. The sensation of motion that appears under certain conditions between two discrete stationary sources of light flashed on and off with one source lagging the other is analyzed. It is shown that both this apparent motion phenomenon and real motion phenomena may be described by the same functional processes. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the existence of an apparent motion effect associated with stationary flashing light sources is a natural con- sequence of a model designed to describe certain real motion effects, and that the frequency response characteristics of this apparent motion are the same as those of the equivalent real motion effect. V.P. A71-41488 Detection, discrimination and brightness of successively presented flashing lights. Sidney Stecher (Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium/Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971.' London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 225-244. 30 refs'. NIH Grants No. NB-7340; No. EY-00023. Two flashes of equal area were presented to the same foveal location in succession, using a four-channel binocular Maxwellian viewing system. Changes in the field threshold as a function of the interstimulus interval (!SI) were evaluated for various durations of the test flash (in all experiments, the interval separating two flashes was greater than that required to just perceive two flashes). A lack of difference in the relative threshold changes was found in monocular and binocular conditions. This indicates that temporal interactions yielding the threshold effects observed in the successive method are centrally limited, to the degree that binocular presentation reflectscentral involvement. Brightness matches for simultaneously presented spatially adjacent fields (simultaneous contrast) showed that the temporal data reflecting adaptation and backward masking are adequately fitted by the Jameson and Hurvich formulation under successive contrast conditions. V.P. A71-41489 A survey of the use of flashing lights in aviation. C. A. Douglas (National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 251-270. 13 refs. The history and progress of flashing light applications in aviation up to date are surveyed, noting that the flashing characteristics of aviation lights were in most cases developed empirically from flight experience. It is pointed out that the primary purpose of flashing light uses in aviation has been and is conspicuity and identification and that except for high intensity beacons economy of power has been a secondary consideration. The photometric characteristics of most flashing lights in aviation are given in terms of steady burning intensity and minimum flash duration, or in terms of instantaneous intensity during a flash integrated within a certain time limit, often 0.5 sec. V.Z. A71-41490 Colour defective vision and the recognition of aviation colour signal light flashes. Mark F. Lewis and Jo Ann Steen (FAA, Civil Aeromedical Institute, Oklahoma City, Okla.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Tech- nology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 271-280. 9 refs. Subjects with varying types and degree of color deficiency were given various color tests including the American Optical H-R-R plates, the Dvorine plates, the Color Threshold Tester, the Farns- worth Lantern, the Farnsworth Munsell 100-hue, the Farnsworth Panel D-15, the Titmus Color Plate, and an anom- aloscope examination. Correlations are obtained to characterize the ability of subjects to discriminate red, white and green aviation signals. The results generally indicated that the FarnsWorth Lantern was a superior predictor of performance in practical tests. V.Z. A71-41491 Aircraft flashing lights - A summary of Canadian Forces investigations. F. C. Brewer. In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 281-287. 7 refs. Recent work on aircraft warning signals, navigation and anti- collision displays, and the autokinetic phenomenon carried out by the Canadian Forces is reviewed. Covered are two laboratory experiments on warning signals, three operational studies on anti- collision and navigation lights, and one laboratory experiment on autokinetic latency and displacement. The results are summarized as follows: pilots wearing spectacles in flight are not less sensitive to peripheral visual stimulation than others. The tactile warning display studied is not effective in easing the workload of the visual system. Strobe lights of white rotating beacons should not be used on aircraft. Any rotating beacons operating in clouds can cause disorientation. Conventional navigation and anticollision lighting systems fail to indicate aircraft flight path and altitude. Aircrew should be briefed on, but not trained in, autokinetic motion. V.Z. A71-41492 Perception of effective flashes produced by a scintillating xenon arc flash tube. Robert Bates (Rochester, Univer- sity, Rochester, N.Y.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College 580A71-41522 of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 289-301. 8 refs. An experimental procedure similar to the one used by Blackwell (1958) was used to determine the applicability of the Blondel-Rey equation (7911) to xenon arc flash tubes, particularly when the constant a in the equation is 0.21. Adiagnostic scintillator controlled the flashes produced by bursts of xenon arc pulses at a flicker frequency of 100 and a burst length of 0.3 sec to obtain an effective 0.3 sec test flash for perception by human eyes. The constant a was between 0.147 and 0.211 for 30 microsec and 0.01 sec flashes and was consistently smaller for 0.01 sec flash than for 30 microsec flash in the observer's perception. The use of 0.2 as the constant in intensity determinations of xenon tube flashes is suggested. V.2. A71-41493 Strobe lighting - A strengthening factor for the 'see and be seen' backbone of collision avoidance. James G. Golden (Air Line Pilots' Association). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 303-310. The potential of strobe lighting in aviation is discussed as an effective approach to the reduction of the ever increasing midair collision hazards. The Collision Avoidance System (CAS) developed by the Airline Transport Association and the more recent Pilot Warning Indicator (PWI) are assessed, noting the latter as the one which is more promising for the application of strobe lighting 'to assist pilots in sighting approaching aircraft. Arguments are given in favor of a speedy introduction of strobe lighting into aviation. V.Z. A71-41495 Effects of hypoxia on response time to periph- eral visual signals. John L. Kobrick (U.S. Army, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass.). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 323-335. 10 refs. Description of three studies conducted to determine the effects of hypoxia on the detection of flash signals occurring in a number of positions distributed throughout the peripheral visual field. It appears that response time increased markedly and systematically as stimulus position became more peripheral. The data show that in a situation where visual signals occur in unpredictable fashion, operators are progressively slower and more variable in response as signal locations become more peripheral. These changes are heightened by hypoxia, in direct relation to severity and duration of exposure. F.R.L. A71-41496 Approximation of the radiation characteristics of flashing lights and designing photometric apparatus. V. G. Baryshnikov (Vsesoiuznyi Nauchno-lssledovatel'skii Svetotekhni- cheskii Institut, Moscow, USSR). In: The perception and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22,1971. \" London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 343-362.14 refs. Discussion of a method of analyzing the sensitivity and errors of the measuring apparatus, the principle of which is to examine successive stages of measurement of the pulse as it passes through the measuring channel elements, and to compare the output and input signals. The flash photometric apparatus is composed of an optical system, a photoreceiving unit, and an amplifying system with an ..indicating or a registering unit. Three aspects of the problem of passing these pulses through the apparatus measuring channel can be distinguished: spatial, spectral, and temporal, each of which can be matched with the same characteristics of the corresponding elements of the photometric apparatus. F.R.L.A71-41497 A study of the apparent flicker rate at sub-fusional frequencies. S. C. Sharma and H. C. Yorke (Aston, University, Birmingham, England). In: The perception and applica- tion of flashing lights; Proceedings of the International Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 363-368. 19 refs. Results of a pilot study to investigate stimulus variables (test field size, brightness, and retinal location) that may influence an observer's assessment of the rate of flicker of a stimulus. A modified stroboscope was used to produce a constant light output per flash over the frequency range used. Observations were made monocularly, and throughout the study a rigorously applied sequence of instruc- tion and observation was used for every observer. The results obtained tend to support the view that the retinal location of the stimulus is significant in modifying assessments of flicker rates. The tendency for the assessment of frequency to be moved toward 9 Hz leads to the suggestion that this is due to the inherent clock mechanism of the brain. F.R.L. A71-41498 Systematic variations in the absolute threshold for flashing lights. F. J. J. Clarke (Ministry of Technology, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, Middx., England). In: The percep- tion and application of flashing lights; Proceedings of the Interna- tional Symposium, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England, April 19-22, 1971. London, Adam Hilger, Ltd., 1971, p. 375-378. 8 refs. Determination of thresholds by means of a special instrument (the quadrant adaptometer) which makes possible continuous track- ing of fluctuations of sensitivity. The threshold stimulus display consists of four quadrant-shaped panels of opal glass which can be flashed sequentially or simultaneously for 0.1 sec at a controllable repetition period. In use, the luminance of the panels is continuously increasing or decreasing. Systematic statistical analysis of data for several observers indicates that threshold variations are unaffected by varying wavelength or the position of a small stimulus in the retina, showing that rod and cone initiated responses behave similarly and that the origin of the effect is probably not in the receptors. F.R.L. A71-41521 ff Myocardial metabolism in cyanotic congenital Scheuer, J. A. Shaver, F. W. Kroetz, and J. J. Leonard (Pittsburgh, University, Pittsburgh, Pa.). (American College of Cardiology, Annual Meeting, New Orleans, La., Feb. 27, 1970.) Cardiology, vol. 55, no. 4, 1970, p. 193-210. 32 refs. Research supported by the Health Research and Services Foundation; NIH Grant No. FR-56. Eight normal subjects and seven cyanotic patients, five with tetralogy of Fallot, and two with Eisenmenger's syndrome, were studied with coronary sinus catheterization. In the resting state, myocardial lactate balance was similar in the two groups, but coronary sinus lactate/pyruvate ratios were frequently higher than arterial ratios in the cyanotic group. Myocardial oxygen delivery appeared adequate during exercise stress in cyanotic patients, and lactate and pyruvate analysis failed to show evidence of myocardial hypoxia. The results indicate that, although the mechanisms of oxygen delivery to the myocardium may differ in normals and some patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, left ventricular myocardial oxidative metabolism is intact even in the presence of hypoxemia. M.M. A71-41522 H Sympathetic control of right ventricular dynamics. J. B. Pace (Pennsylvania, University. Philadelphia, Pa.). Cardiology, vol. 55, no. 4,1970, p. 218-236. 21 refs. PHS Grant No. HE-07762; Contract No. Nonr-551(54). Pressure-flow dynamics in the right ventricular outflow-tract were analyzed during sequential increases in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in dogs anesthetized with chloralose. The aim of the study was to provide a precise definition of the extrinsic nervous 581A71-41568 control of pressure and flow in the right ventricle. The measurements allowed for the assessment of the magnitude of kinetic pressure and permitted an analysis of the influence of the kinetic component on the formation of outflow-tract pressure differences. The first wave developed in early systole and was independent of flow velocity in the outflow tract; the second wave developed in midsystole and extended into late systole. When the kinetic component was taken into account by recording impact pressure in the conus, the magnitude of the late systolic pressure difference was markedly reduced from values recorded as a function of lateral pressure. Total pressure differences in late systole were attributed to the formation of a dynamic resistance in the infundibular zone. M.M.

Discussion of the effects of hyperventilation, defined as an inappropriate ventilation above that necessary to meet the require- ments of the organism. The syndrome expresses itself by numerous symptoms, dominated by paresthesia and eventually by contractions of the extremities. Among aircrew, the cause is frequently psycho- emotional.

Results of three years of experiment using the swinging armchair to accomplish labyrinth studies among 200 aircrewmen of various ages and degrees of experience. The neurological reflex was studied- by means of the nystagmus induced. The tests showed that there is no exact type of labyrinth reflex, but rather a real but individual adaptation. The reflex is very little perturbed by the profession of flying itself. F.R.L.

Consideration of the various factors involved in air transport of sick or injured persons, with an attempt to determine what pathological or psychological conditions forbid such transport. In general, a patient can be carried provided there is no inconvenience to the crew or other passengers. Among medical contraindications are serious heart conditions, certain respiratory and digestive ailments, glaucoma, otitis, and severe mental disturbance. As a rule, air transport is considered far superior to other means of carriage, and medical incidents in flight have been rare. F.R.L.

F.R.L. A71-41636 Using alternating displays to improve operator performance. Charles Abrams, Donald N. Buckner (Human Factors Research, Inc., Goleta, Calif.), and C. H. Baker (Defence Research Establishment, Toronto, Canada). Instruments and Control Systems, vol. 44, Sept. 1971, p. 113-115. 14 refs. Contract No. Nonr- 4120(00). The alternating display concept was tested using simulated radar and sonar CRT displays in a laboratory environment. Each of the four experimental conditions began with a 3-minute pretest, during which eight signals were presented at random locations. Two consecutive 24-minute duty periods followed. In each period six signals were presented at random intervals and locations. This was followed by a posttest identical to the pretest. Radar monitoring neither benefited nor was impaired by display alternation. Statistical analysis of the sonar data did not disclose a significant interaction between display conditions and time on duty. However, graphic portrayal of the data did suggest the presence of such an effect. G.R. A71-41690 * H The vestibular space experiment OFO-A - Some results and conclusions. T. Gualtierotti and F. Bracchi (Milano, Universita, Milan, Italy). American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Aerospace Medical Association, Weightlessness and Artificial Gravity Meeting, Williamsburg, Va., Aug. 9-11, 1971, Paper. 7 p. 5 refs. Contract No. NASw-2211.The results and the conclusions reached so far on the vestibular space experiment OFO-A are presented here. The various parameters of the life support systems are indicated. The activity at rest and the response to centripetal acceleration obtained by an on-board centrifuge have been studied in four statoreceptors in two bull frogs. Some units were quiescent during the flight, some were at times stimulated slightly by the vibration induced by the water pump belonging to the life support system. The change was observed mostly for the activity at rest that first was slowed down and then increased in frequency to reach normal level at the end of the fifth day in the mission. A feedback control system throughout the efferent network is considered to be responsible for the changes and the following normalization. The impact of the method has a more general use in the physiological field. The vestibular space experi- ment OFO-A is a part of a program to investigate the transfer function of the labyrinth. It studies the long term reaction of the positioning sensors of the vestibule to the disappearance of the effect of a major environmental constant on earth - gravity at the single unit level. This factor, gravity, is particularly important as it corresponds to the proper stimulus of the receptors: the lack of it will provide the input '0' point in the input-output relationship in a close loop situation. (Author) A71-41717 Body composition, aerobic capacity, and den- sity of muscle capillaries in young and old men. J. PaNzkova, E. Eiselt, Karlova Universita, Prague, Czechoslovakia). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 323-325. 19 refs. In the young body height and weight, relative and absolute amount of lean body mass, maximal oxygen uptake, maximal pulse rate, and maximal oxygen pulse were significantly higher than in old men. The number of capillaries per square millimeter was the same in the young and the old. The number of muscle fibers per square millimeter was significantly higher in the old. The capillary-fiber ratio was, therefore, significantly higher in the young. A significant relationship between maximal oxygen uptake and maximal oxygen pulse on one hand and capillary-fiber ratio on the other was found only in the young men. G.R. A71-41718 # Atrial function during volume loading. Robert M. Payne, Hubert L. Stone, and Edward J. Engelken (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 326-331. 34 refs. This study attempts to define atrial function directly in an intact animal, using the Frank-Starling approach to evaluate extent of atrial shortening as atrial load is increased by infusion. From analysis of diameter changes which reflect atrial fiber length, it is possible to define the limits of booster pump and conduit function during volume infusion. As atrial diameter was increased, atrial stroke shortening increased initially; however, as volume was further , increased, the amplitude of atrial shortening decreased. Over the normal range of filling pressures the atrium functions as a conduit to transfer blood when the A-V valves are open, a capacitor or reservoir to accept venous inflow during ventricular ejection, and a booster pump during atrial systole. G.R. A71-41719 Effects of extended hypoxia on retinal vascular state. John L. Kobrick and Budd Appleton (U.S. Army, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass.). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 357-362. 10 refs. Eight subjects were exposed to 15,000-ft equivalent hypobaric elevation for 48 hr in an altitude chamber during which they were periodically measured for near and far visual acuity, stereopsis, binocular depth perception, critical flicker fusion, dark adaptation, and response time to peripheral visual signals. The central retinal fundi were also examined clinically and photographed. Performance 583A71-41720 on all visual tasks showed similar decrements which occurred rapidly and reached their maximum extent within approximately 1 hr of exposure and thereafter gradually recovered over the remaining interval. The impairments noted are apparently due to the effects of hypoxia acting directly on the visual system rather than to the possible influence of subjective feeling states, since they preceded by several hours the onset of subsequent illness symptoms. The retinal Vascular changes observed corroborated former findings of engorge- ment, increased diameter, and tortuosity, but did not immediately abate upon return to normoxia. Signs of retinal hemorrhage or edema previously reported by others during exposure to higher elevations than that of this study were not observed. (Author) A71-41720 Effect of water immersion on renin- aldosterone and renal sodium handling in normal man. Murray Epstein and Takao Saruta (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.; Miami, University; U.S. Veterans Administration Hospital, Miami, Fla.; Texas, University, Dallas, Tex.). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 368-374. 40 refs. Eight normal male subjects were used in the investigations. All subjects were studied on three occasions while in balance on a 10 mEq Na, 88-120 mEq K diet including waist immersion, neck immersion, and control studies. Waist immersion produced a decrease of one-third in plasma renin activity without changing urinary aldosterone excretion. Neck immersion produced a decrease in plasma renin activity exceeding that induced by waist immersion with a two-thirds decrease in urinary aldosterone excretion. Since water immersion to the neck initially results in a redistribution of blood volume with a relative increase in intrathoracic blood volume, the current study lends further support to the concept of intra- thoracic and/or cardiac receptors as important factors in volume regulation in man. G.R. A71-41721 Energy sources during muscular work under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Robert Bason, Charles E. Billings, Edward L. Fox, Ralph J. Gerke, and H. Spencer Turner (Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 392-396. 16 refs. Research supported by the Ohio State University; NIH Grant No. FR-5409. The power derived from the aerobic, lactacid, and alactacid energy sources was measured while eight male subjects performed three intensities of work (30, 60, 80% of maximal sea-level aerobic capacity) on a bicyle ergometer at 223, 2286, and 3810 m. The data suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between the aerobic and anaerobic energy sources, so that the total power input for a given amount of work remains unaffected by hypoxia. The reduction in aerobic power was further shown not to be due to a decrease in Vo sub 2 but rather to a decrease in the duration of the exercise. The lactacid power is greater with altitude because this energy system produces the same or in some cases more lactic acid in less time. The alactacid capacity is unaffected by altitude. Alactacid power likewise increases with altitude because of the same energy release over a shorter period of time. (Author) A71-41722 Availability of substrates and capacity for prolonged heavy exercise Stockholm, Sweden). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 416-422. 19 refs. Research supported by the Greta Jeansson Foundation and the Swedish Medical Research Council. The effects of a reduced availability of free fatty acids (FFA) on the physical working capacity in normal man were investigated. The subjects first depleted their glycogen stores by bicycle exercise to exhaustion. Thereafter only fat and protein were given until the next day, when the exercise was performed under conditions in which the release of FFA from the adipose tissue was blocked by nicotinic acid that had been given to the subjects. Only limited stores of glycogen were then available in the body, facilitating the evaluation of theimportance of a diminished FFA supply to skeletal muscle during exercise. It was found that when the glycogen stores are reduced, prolonged work can still be performed on submaximal levels provided that the supply of FFA is adequate. Elimination of both muscle glycogen and exogenous FFA seriously impairs the ability for prolonged exercise. G.R. A71-41723 Computation of mean body temperature from rectal and skin temperatures. Jean Colin, Jean Timbal, Yvon Houdas, Charles Boutelier, and Jean D. Guieu (Centre d'Essais en Vol. Bretigny-sur-Orge, Essonne, France). Journal of Applied Physiology, vol. 31, Sept. 1971, p. 484-489. 10 refs. The calculation of the heat stored by the human body in a hot environment according to Burton (1935) requires information concerning the mean body temperature. An equation for determining the mean body temperature from rectal and skin temperatures contains a factor x. The possibility that x can have different values in neutral and hot environments is investigated. Ninety-one experiments were made in five hot environments. The best values for x in neutral and in hot environments were calculated by an optimization method using a computer. G.R. A71-41798 The antecedents of myocardial infarction and sudden death in a cohort of actively employed men. Lawrence E. Hinkle, Jr. (Cornell University, New York, N.Y.). (IndustrialMedical Association, Annual Meeting, 56th, Atlanta, Ga.,Apr. 19-22, 1971.1 Journal of Occupational Medicine, vol. 13, Sept. 1971, p. 433-440. 5 refs. PHS Grant No. HE-07796. The health records of 1,152 actively employed, middle-aged American men were analyzed to determine the incidence of coronary heart disease and sudden death, and to ascertain some of the characteristics of those men who die suddenly and unexpectedly. Middle-aged men whose deaths are reported as due to coronary heart disease (including those with sudden and unexplained deaths) are not drawn from the population of apparently healthy men. Coronary deaths occur among a mixed population of men with coronary heart disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, or a combination of these. Men reported as dying from coronary heart disease have detectable abnormalities of cardiac rate, rhythm, and conduction prior to the onset of the final episode. Significant metabolic abnormalities include hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum uric acid, obesity, and alcoholism. T.M. A71-41822 Reflex vestibular control of head movement in man. J. S. Outerbridge and G. Melvill Jones (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971 p. 935-940. 31 refs. Vestibularly driven head movement (the 'vestibulo-collic reflex') was examined in seated human subjects exposed to sinusoidal and stepwise changes in rotational velocity about a vertical axis. In the absence of vision nystagmoid head movements occurred, but not in all subjects. Slow-phase head velocity showed less phase advance during slow sinusoidal stimulation than corresponding vestibulo- ocular response, and made a substantial contribution to ocular stabilization in the period immediately following a step change in rotational velocity. The practical and theoretical significance of these findings is discussed. (Author) A71-41823 Survey of the medical causes of rejection of applicants for the BEA/BOAC sponsored ab-initio pilot training scheme. R. M. Barnes (Air Corporations Joint Medical Service, London Airport, Hounslow, Middx., England). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 941-946. 5 refs. Research supported by the Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defence (Navy). Since 1960 BEA and BOAC have sponsored young men between 18 and 24 years of age for ab-initio pilot training. Applicants may be excluded on medical grounds at three stages of the selection 584A71-41829 procedure. An analysis of the causes of medical rejection at each stage was made. The results have been compared with those obtained by the RAF Aircrew Selection Center and the Royal Naval Officer Candidate Selection Board, the latter representing a group of applicants of similar age not connected with flying. In the Corpora- tions and RAF, ophthalmic, ear, nose and throat and general medical conditions were the major causes of failure, in that order, accounting for some 89% of those rejected. In the Royal Navy, ophthalmic conditions were by far the most important reason for rejection, followed by general medical causes. Ear, nose and throat diseases accounted for only 2%. A follow-up of candidates selected for training by BEA and BOAC shows that out of 625 candidates who could have completed training, 11 have had to give up flying permanently on medical grounds. On these figures it is concluded that there are no reasons to alter the selection procedure at the present time. (Author) A71-41824 Study of simulated airline pilot incapacitation. Phase II - Subtle or partial loss of function. C. R. Harper, G. J. Kidera. and J. F. Cullen (United Air Lines, Inc., Denver, Colo.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 946-948. The risk factor in airline flight operations generated by partial loss of cerebral function of one crew member is discussed with regard to etiology, incidence and detection. Airline flight crews have received little instruction concerning subtle cerebral incapacitation, and no observations existed regarding the reactions of the crew members who remained unimpaired. An original study involving 36 line qualified B-727- flight crews was performed in an aircraft simulator. The pilot-in-command became nonfunctioning, but not unconscious, during approach for landing. Reaction times of the unimpaired crew members and their subsequent conduct are dis- cussed. Educational recommendations are presented.

Talarico (NASA, Ames Research Center, Environ- mental Biology Div., Moffett Field, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 949-956. 14 refs. Male rats, fed ad libitum, were exposed to 100% oxygen at 191, 258, Or 350 mm Hg for periods of time varying from one-half to 4 days. Food consumption decreased as the barometric pressure decreased. After exposure, the in vitro incorporation of acetate-2- C14 into C02 and fatty acids by slices of liver and epididymal adipose tissue was measured. In all hyperoxic exposures, the oxygen-exposed rats converted more acetate into fatty acids in both liver and adipose tissue than did their respective pair-fed controls. At 258 and 350 mm Hg, the oxygen-exposed rats incorporated acetate into liver fatty acids at rates comparable to those of ambient ad libitum controls. At 258 mm Hg, fatty acid synthesis in the adipose tissue of the oxygen-exposed rats was comparable to that of ambient ad libitum controls and at 350 mm Hg, exceeded that of the ambient ad libitum controls by 30%. Placing the oxygen-exposed rats on a restricted diet abolished the increase in fatty acid synthesis. It is concluded that 100% oxygen has a stimulatory effect upon fatty acid synthesis in the liver and adipose tissue of rats exposed to the hypobaric hyperoxic environment of 258 and 350 mm Hg provided that the rats have free access to food. \" (Author) A71-41826 # Relationship of pentathlon sports skills to vestibulo-ocular responses to Coriolis stimulation. P. J. Dowd and R. L. Cramer (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 956-958. 6 refs. A Coriolis test on the USAFSAM biaxial stimulator was administered to pentathlon athletes, advanced Air Force pilots, and airman trainees. The rates of decay and sensitivity coefficients of vertical nystagmic responses were compared for these three groups. A significantly different rate of decay was found between athletes andairman trainees and a significantly different sensitivity coefficient was shown between athletes and the pilots and airman trainees. The pentathlon athletes demonstrated a significantly greater degree of habituation and suppression of responses to Coriolis stimulation than the pilot or airman trainee groups. The possible reasons for these findings are discussed in terms of the physical conditioning require- ments of the pentathlon athlete. (Author) A71-41827 Influence of alcohol on vestibular responses to angular accelerations. David J. Schroeder (FAA, Civil Aeromedical Institute, Oklahoma City, Okla.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 959-970. 27 refs. Although alcohol is known to affect the vestibular system through the development of a positional alcohol nystagmus, informa- tion concerning the effects of alcohol on 'vertigo' and nystagmus from stimulation of the semicircular canals is contradictory. Several investigators have reported that alcohol enhances these responses, while others have reported suppressive effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of alcohol ingestion on both 'vertigo' and nystagmic responses to angular stimulation. Responses were obtained (1) with and without visual fixation, and (2) with the alertness of the subjects controlled. When recorded in total darkness, the nystagmic reaction to rotatory stimulation was suppressed by the alcohol. When visual fixation was allowed, a high-frequency, low- amplitude nystagmus to rotation was obtained following alcohol ingestion; there was little or no response prior to drinking. This apparent enhancement of the response was not due to an increase in vestibular sensitivity but, rather, to the suppressive effect of alcohol on the ability of the subject to maintain adequate visual fixation. 'Vertigo' sensations resulting from the rotatory stimuli evidenced only slight declines following alcohol ingestion. (Author) A71-41828 ft Heart rate response to square wave breathing - One G compared to zero G. Philip C. Richardson, Ashley J. Welch, and Robert Groshner (Texas, University, Austin, Tex.; USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 971-974. 9 refs. Grant No. AF AFOSR 69-1792. A transient change in beat-by-beat heart rate occurs in the human when sudden inspiratory or expiratory efforts are effected. Under conditions of zero G, as produced while flying in a parabolic flight path, the heart rate responses were of a similar shape for ihspiration and for expiration; however, there was a significant baseline shift down of 4.3 beats per minute for inspiration and 3.8 beats per minute for expiration in the zero G environment. We propose that this change in base line is due to hydrostatic pressure changes in the carotid sinus and aortic arch receptors.

Hartman (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 980-986. 10 refs. Six experimental transport missions using a double crew were flown in a C-141 on routes generating various combinations of long and short legs. Crews followed a 4/4 of 16/16 work/rest schedule within operational constraints. On-board crew-rest facilities were provided so that the plane could fly through the airlift system without crew changes or crew delays. The missions required approximately 55-60 hours to complete. The flying time averaged around 43 hours. Crew performance was evaluated by ratings made by an on-board flight examiner. There were no significant differences in flight examiner ratings. Subjective fatigue was measured by a rating scale. There were no significant differences related to work/rest cycles. There were significant differences related to mission profile and crew position. Sleep EEGs were recorded on the two navigators and were supplemented by self-reports from all crewmembers. There was a marked reduction in total sleep as well as stage 1-REM and deep sleep. Findings are discussed in relation to the demands of flying transport missions. (Author) 585A71-41830 A71-41830 Experimental results on time of useful func- tion (TUF) after exposure to mixtures of serious contaminants. J. G. Gaume, P. Bartek, and H. J. Rostami (Douglas Aircraft Co., Long Beach, Calif.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 987-990. 5 refs. Description of experimental data from 53 exposures of mice to single, double, and triple gas mixtures. Contaminants used were CO, CO2, and NH3. The TUF for CO exposure was used as a baseline against which other exposures were compared. It was found that double gas exposures extended the TUF, whereas triple gas exposures extended the TUF even more. A theory is suggested for the mechanism of this extension phenomenon. These results are con- sidered to be preliminary and their validity must be further substantiated from additional experimental studies. This information is applicable to: (1) the selection and development of interior materials which neither burn nor produce dangerous toxic products; and (2) stimulate further investigation in this neglected area of research. M.M. A71-41831 Effect of altitude acclimatisation and cold on cold pressor response in man. C. S. Nair, M. S. Malhotra, 0. P. Tiwari, and P. M. Gopinath (Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Delhi, India). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 991-994. 8 refs. Cold pressor response was elicited on 18 subjects of the age group 21-28 years at sea level and at an altitude of 11,000 ft under hypoxic acclimatization and under simultaneous acclimatization to hypoxia and cold at 10 days' interval for 40 days after which they were retested at sea level. A group of 10 Highlanders were also studied. Results indicate that there is a depression of cold pressor response irrespective of superimposition or withdrawal of cold stress. However, the group of subjects who were exposed to cold and hypoxia simultaneously from the day of arrival at altitude showed a return of the sea-level pattern of response at the end of 40 days of their stay at altitude and on retest at sea-level. The depression of cold pressor response was also noticed in highlanders. (Author) A71-41832 H Ingestive capacity of peritoneal macrophages from mice exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. George W. Irving, III and Jerome P. Schmidt (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 995-998. 15 refs. USAF-supported research. At approximately 6-day intervals peritoneal macrophages were harvested from groups of mice exposed continuously to a simulated altitude of 18,000 ft. These cells were allowed to attach to suitable vessels and exposed to a suspension of Serratia marcescens. After a carefully controlled ingestion period, bacteria were liberated from the phagocytes by freezing and thawing and the ensuing quantitative assays were based on-colony-forming units of the microorganisms in the resulting suspensions. The ingestive efficiency of peritoneal macrophages from mice exposed to altitude was generally less than that of peritoneal macrophages from nonexposed mice. This change in ingestive ability in relation to the time of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia is evidently a physiological reaction to the environmental conditions. The change in functional efficiency of the macrophage may be a factor in the susceptibility to infection of animals subjected to altitude. (Author) A71-41833 i Vertigo due to increased middle ear pressure - Six-year experience of the aeromedical consultation service. Frederic M. Brown (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 999-1001. 6 refs. Vertigo due to increased middle ear pressure appears to be more common than is generally realized. Although it has been known as a syndrome for 75 years, only recently has it received any significant study. In this article 6 years' experience with this entity from the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine Aeromedical Consultation Service is presented. Four new cases are presented and discussed withtwo previously published cases. The facts that two cases occurred during a rapid descent with a forceful Valsalva rather than during climb-out and that two cases experienced vague symptoms which were not classic vertigo but could be duplicated by caloric testing are felt to be significant. Other associated factors are discussed, and a simple preventive approach is suggested. (Author) A71-41834 Investigation of fatal aircraft accidents - 'Physiological incidents.' Laurence R. Simson, Jr. (USAF, Air Training Command, Randolph AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 1002-1006. 5 refs. Incapacitating or distracting physiological phenomena occur with considerable frequency during aerial flight. Only rarely, however, have such 'physiological incidents' been firmly established as cause factors in fatal aircraft accidents. By tradition medical investigation of accidents has largely been restricted to cataloguing mechanical trauma and searching for preexisting organic disease. By definition 'physiological incidents' are transient functional distur- bances and not expected, by the inexperienced investigator, to be amenable to demonstration after the fact. However, it is often possible to reconstruct, with high probability, physiological factors which initiated a sequence of events terminating in a fatal accident. Two cases are presented as illustrations. Attention is drawn to the fact that 'physiological incidents' and psychological factors un- doubtedly underlie many presently obscure aircraft crashes.

O'Connor (RAF, Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, Hants., England). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 1006-1010. 6 refs. Eight trainee pilots retired to sleep under laboratory conditions from 2000 hours to 0300 when they were awakened to spend 8 hours performing 2 behavioral tests (calculation and vigilance). This regime was repeated on alternate nights in a 4 x 2 design. The 4 experimental conditions under which they slept were No Drug, Placebo, Mogadon (5 mgs) and Seconal (100 mgs). Each subject spent 2 nights under each condition and during every alternate 24-hour period they were off-duty and free to sleep as they pleased. Continuous EEG recordings were made on each 'experimental' night arid subjective ratings of mood and quality of sleep were used to complement the behavioral measures. Under both the drug con- ditions there were changes in the .EEG together with a slight decrement in vigilance performance (d') in the later (1100-1500) runs of the day and an improvement in the rated quality of sleep. (Author) A71-41836 # Electroencephalograms of 2,947 United States Air Force Academy cadets (1965-1969). Paul L. Richter, Earl A. Zimmerman, Marcus E. Raichle, and E. Liske (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 1011-1014. 15 refs. Coincident\" with the beginning of the Second World War, attempts were made at the USAF School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph AFB, Texas, and at the Naval Air Station, Pens^cola, Florida, to develop electroencephalographic methods for determining the suitability of candidates for flight training. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, but hope remained that the electroencephalo- graph would be useful in detecting latent epilepsy or other brain disturbances. I n further pursuit of this goal, 2947 senior cadets at the USAF Academy in Colorado, during the period from the beginning of 1965 through the end of 1969, had at least a single electroen- cephalogram which included hyperventilation and photic stimula- tion. Three per cent of the records were abnormal. This percentage is strikingly low when compared with that of 'normal populations,' and may result partially from our practice of considering 'normal' the majority of occipital slow waves encountered in the E.EGs of young adult subjects.

Reinhardt (U.S. Naval Aerospace Medical Center, Aerospace Medical Institute, Pensacola, Fla.). Aerospace Medicine, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 1015-1017. 5 refs. Psychophysiologic and conversion mechanisms as an uncon- scious expression of the student pilot's decreasing motivation for further flight training are discussed. Flight students in this category are characterized by a family life style of excessive use of rationalization, blaming others for their own shortcomings, exagger- ating minor complaints into disabling symptoms and manifesting very little subjective concern about them (la belle indifference). They do not look for disability compensation and they unconsciously force the examiner into removing them from flight status. If this is not swiftly accomplished they are apt to develop new symptoms. Four case histories are used to illustrate how the flight surgeon can interview the failing student by listening with a 'third ear' for such checkpoints as life style, problem-solving techniques, slips of the tongue and metaphores. These data along with health record and flight record information then point to the proper disposition. (Author) A71-41861 * Stereometric measurement of body and limb volume changes during extended space missions - A progress report. R. E. Herron, J. Cuzzi, M. J. Bender, and J. E. Hugg (Baylor University, Houston, Tex.). Societe Francaise de Photogrammetrie, Bulletin, Oct. 1970, p. 45-50. Contract No. NAS 9-10567. Development of a photogrammetric program intended to mea- sure the variations of the volume of the body and the members of astronauts after a prolonged space voyage. During the experimental phase photographs taken with two opposed stereometric cameras recorded the variations of a human body subjected to different conditions of depressurization. Results indicate that it is possible to establish a versatile and practical method of plethysmography which equals or exceeds the accuracy and reliability of current methods. F.R.L. A71-41936 * Diurnal patterns in water and food intake and body weight changes in rats with hypothalamic lesions. Jan W. Kakolewski, Edward Deaux, Janice Christensen, and Barbara Case (Pels Research Institute, Yellow Springs, Ohio). American Journal of Physiology, vol. 221, Sept. 1971, p. 711-718. 25 refs. NSF=NASA- supported research; PHS Grant No. M-4529. Rats with ventromedial hypothalamic (VMM) lesions, after the dynamic phase, displayed a permanent loss of the diurnal rhythm in food intake, a 180 degree reversal of the diurnal rhythm in the pattern of body weight changes, and hypophagia, whereas the water intake and water-to-food ratio remained similar to preoperative levels. Rats with lateral hypothalamic (LH) lesions, after recovery, displayed a decrease in water and food intake and an augmentation of body weight loss exclusively during the light phase of the diurnal cycle. Since, after VMM or LH lesions, the animals continued to regulate the ingestive behavior and controlled their body weight, the concepts regarding the function of these two hypothalamic struc- tures, presumed to be primary regulatory centers, appear to be oversimplified. M.M. A71-41937 Mechanism of norepinephrine-induced stimula- tion of myocardial oxygen consumption. Henry Neal Coleman, Edmund H..Sonnenblick,and Eugene Braunwald (National Institutes of Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Bethesda, Md.; Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minn.). American Journal of Physiology, vol. 221, Sept. 1971, p. 778-783. 23 refs. A polarographic method was used to determine the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on the myocardial oxygen consumption of cat papillary muscles contracting under both afterloaded isotonic and isometric conditions. In order to separate the increased extent ofshortening and external work from the increased velocity of shortening, the effects of NE on myocardial oxygen consumption were evaluated in isometric contractions at equal levels of developed tension. Under these conditions, augmentation of the contractile state, characterized by increased velocity of contraction, was linearly related to the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. The stimulation of myocardial oxygen consumption is attributed to the induced alterations in the intrinsic speed of contraction and may explain the so-called '02 wasting' effect activity, hypo- thermia, and stress.

Research supported by the Scottish Rite Foundation; PHS Grant No. RO MH-16127. Markedly increased activity of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in rat plasma resulted from restraint at 2 C (cold restraint. CR) for as little as 15 min. The mean increase in enzyme activity after 2 hr of CR was 28-fold, but the range was very great. The increase in plasma CPK activity was highly correlated with the extent of hypothermia following CR. Adrenalectomized, adrenal demedullated, thyroidecto- rnized, and control rats had comparable decreases in rectal tempera- ture and increases in plasma CPK activity following CR of 30 min duration. The increase in plasma CPK activity following CR was markedly diminished in some cold-acclimated rats, varying with the extent of cold acclimation. M.M. A71-41939 * Mechanism of antidiuretic action of chlorpro- pamide in the mammalian kidney. S. M. Zweig, Bruce Ettinger, and L. E. Earley (California, University, San Francisco, Calif.}. American Journal of Physiology, vol. 221, Sept. 1971, p. 911-915. 18 refs. NIH Grants No. AM-12753; No. AM-05670; Grant No. NGR-05-025-007, In dogs undergoing water diuresis, the effect of unilateral intrarenal infusions of chlorpropamide on urinary concentration, free water clearance (CH20), GFR (glomerular filtration rate), and sodium excretion was compared with that obtained in another group of similarly water-loaded animals during intravenous infusion of vasopressin. The antidiuretic action of chlorpropamide was demon- strable only in the presence of vasopressin and was not dependent on a fall in GFR. Since blood levels of chlorpropamide equal to those which were antidiuretic in the presence of infused vasopressin were without effect on urinary concentration in the absence of infused vasopressin, it does not appear that the drug increases water reabsorption as a result of the release of endogenous vasopressin. Therefore, the renal effects of chlorpropamide may be attributed to an action in the kidney to potentiate circulating vasopressin. M.M. A71-41940 \u00a7 Apr.-June 1971, p. 49-67. 113 refs. In Russian. Review of recent research on the effect of hypothermia on the nutritive processes and regulator activity of the brain. Changes in the blood supply of the brain, in respiration, and in carbohydrate metabolism are considered, as well as the resistance of the brain to oxygen deficiency at low body temperatures. Data concerning the temperature levels at which unconsciousness occurs in humans and data concerning conditioned reflex activity in animals are presented, as well as data concerning the special features of the electrical activity of the brain cortex. The effect of hypothermia on the excitability of the centers of the diencephalon, the mesencephalon, the pons varolii, the medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord is shown. A.B.K. A71-41941 H Ultrasound and the possibility of using it studies (Ul'trazvuk Apr.-June 1971, p. 105-125. 36 refs. In Russian. Attempt to give the experimental physiologist an idea of the methods of ultrasonic investigation of the human organism and to show the possibility of using this method in physiological and pathophysiological experiments. Information concerning certain physical properties of ultrasonic vibrations and concerning the acoustic properties of living tissue is presented, which not only makes it possible for the reader to comprehend the methods and examples of ultrasonic diagnostics presented, but also to determine himself the range of applicability of this method in physiological studies. A.B.K. A71-41985 * # Medical results of Apollo 14 Implications for longer duration space flights. Charles A. Berry (NASA, Washington, D.C.). International Astronautical Federation, International Astro- nautical Congress, 22nd, Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 20-25, 1971, Paper. 24 p. 6 refs. Review of the information on biomedical effects of space flight obtained from the Apollo 14 mission. Various facets of the process of adaptation to weightlessness ate discussed. The differences found in Apollo 14 results for the command module pilot versus the other two crewmembers suggest certain benefits for 34 hours at one-sixth gravity and for lunar surface exercise. These findings indicate that the extent of the adaptation of astronauts to weightlessness, and any resulting change in subsequent ability to enter and work in new force environments, can be controlled to some degree. On the whole, space flights to date demonstrate that man can live and work productively in the space environment for periods of at least several weeks. M.E.V. A71-41990 ft Advanced systems of extravehicular protection (Systemes avances de protection extravehiculaire). James G. Sutton, Philip F. Heimlich, and Edward H. Tepper. International Astro- nautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress, 22nd, Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 20-25, 1971, Paper. 48 p. In French. Evaluation of various concepts for systems for use in the 1980s to make possible extravehicular activity (EVA) with complete or partial regeneration of resources, with identification of the new regions of technology which will be set in motion. The methodology used is described, as well as the results of studies of systems and subsystems. Schematic configurations proposed for the cases of the Space Station, the Lunar Base, and Martian missions are presented. The new technological developments required to make possible the working out of the concepts of the Advanced Extravehicular Protection System (AEPS) are discussed. F.R.L. A71-42017*# Spacecraft oxygen recovery system. P. D. Quattrone (NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.). International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress, 22nd, Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 20-25, 1971, Paper. 39 p. 20 refs. Contracts No. NAS 2-6118; No. NAS 2-4444. A spacecraft oxygen recovery system using an electrochemical C02 concentrator for C02 removal, a Sabatier reactor for conversion of the C02 to methane and water, and an electrolysis subsystem for recovery of O2 from the H2O is described. Details are given on the recovery system component designs, operation and performance, with a diagram showing the working cycle of the system, and other illustrative diagrams. The concentrator can be used in aircraft rebreather systems and in spacecraft applications. The Sabatier subsystem has a high conversion efficiency in both H2-rich or CO2-rich gas mixtures, dry or humid. The electrolysis subsystem showed long term reliability and is operable at high current densities. V.Z.A71 -42033 * H The astronaut-teleoperator team for space operations. Edwin G. Johnsen (AEC-NASA, Space Nuclear Systems Office, Washington, D.C.). International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress, 22nd, Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 20-25. 1971, Paper. 12 p. 7 refs. Discussion of the use of teleoperators as a means for further cost reduction of space operations and for increasing the productivity of future manned space experiments by augmenting the capabilities of astronauts. Some of the advantages and possible configurations and applications of teleoperators are examined and astronaut- teleoperator capabilities identified. M.V.E.

Investigation of the possibility of organizing posture-spatial human activities amid psychologically trying conditions of the altered posture-motor regime characteristic of astronauts' tasks. The conditions confronted on the limited support area of a parachute jump tower or high diving board (i.e., a stabilographic platform at the edge of the tower top) at heights of 18 and 10m were selected as the experimental model. The results of a series of tests performed with young healthy male subjects on the stabilographic platform are reported and discussed. M.V.E. A71-42043 * # Summary of a 90-day manned test of a regenerative life support system. Albin O. Pearson (NASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.) and John K. Jackson (McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Huntington Beach, Calif.). International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress, 22nd, Brussels, Belgium, Sept. 20-25, 1971, Paper. 32 p. 7 refs. A 90-day manned test of a regenerative life support system was completed on September 11, 1970. The test was performed with a crew of four men and featured closed chamber operation with no resupply. All food, makeup water, spare parts, and tools were stored onboard at the start of the test. This paper presents the test objectives, describes the life support subsystems, outlines some of the operating procedures, and reviews some of the more significant accomplishments of the test. Conclusions and some recommenda- tions for additional future efforts are presented. (Author) A71-42119 * An electrostatic computer model of a biologi- cal membrane. Vincent F. Gallucci (North Carolina State University, Raleigh, N.C.) and I. H. Shames (New York, State University, Buffalo, N.Y.). Computers in Biology and Medicine, vol. 1, Sept. 1971, p. 263-277. 19 refs. Grant No. NsG-501. Description of a model of a biological cell membrane (Danielli- Davson, Robertson). The membrane is simulated by planar arrays of dipoles. Dipoles represent lipid polar end groups and protein C = 0, N-H and R-group components of the membrane. An electrostatic self-consistent field approach is used to solve a set of four simultaneous equations. The four equations describe the forces acting upon each molecule. The solution of the set of equations is a set of angles which specify the orientation of the molecules. Then the electrostatic field from the entire molecular array can be calculated for any point in the neighborhood of the 'membrane'. An empirical 'resisting torque' function is introduced to allow simulation of the gross effects of the many interacting forces which act at the molecular level. The effect of a macromolecule near the membrane is simulated by using an appropriate electron density in a multipole field expansion. M.M. 588A71-42228 A71-42155 Continuous dynamic sampling calorimeter for measurement in man. Allan Short (Cambridge University, Cambridge, England) and John Anderson (King's College Hospital, London, England). In: Joint Conference on Infra-Red Techniques, University of Reading, Reading, Berks., England, September 21-23, 1971, Proceedings. London, Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers, 1971, p. 419-428. 9 refs. The continuous dynamic sampling calorimeter measures separately and continuously the radiative, convective and evaporative heat loss for the whole and different regions of the body. The machine scans the body in the form of a close spiral in 45 seconds. It is possible to warm different areas of the subject by radiant heaters which allows heating to be independent of the measuring devices. This enables the subject to be considered as part of a closed loop control system which can be analyzed by standard control system procedures. (Author) A71-42193 * A preliminary theory of the effects of task and environmental factors on human performance. Warren H. Teichner (New Mexico State University, University Park, N. Mex.) and Diane E. Olson (Massachusetts, University, Amherst, Mass.). Human Factors, vol. 13, Aug. 1971, p. 295-344. 53 refs. Grants No. NGR-22-007-070; No. AF AFOSR 68-1575. An attempt is made to develop a systematic approach to the prediction of human performance as a function of task variables and environmental factors. The approach uses the basic literature of experimental psychology and of physiology in a context in which postulates and assumptions about underlying processes and empirical relationships are made as specific as possible. This paper is a presentation of the postulates, assumptions, and models for handling them. Its aim is toward organization and feasibility rather than toward a final theory of human performance. What is presented is more in the nature of a model of what a general theory might be and the variables of importance rather than a theory as such. (Author) A71-42194 The effect of prior muscle exertions on simple movements. Brian M. Lance and Don B. Chaffin (Michigan, Univer- sity, Ann Arbor, Mich.). Human Factors, vol. 13, Aug. 1971, p. 355-361.8 refs. Results of a study to determine the time for initiation and stabilization of a precision movement both before and after sustained muscle exertion of sufficient duration and level to produce elec- tromyogram (EMG) frequency changes. It was found that fatiguing muscle exertions do not seem to alter the speed of initiation of responses, but do alter movement time, particularly for movement associated with final corrective action. F.R.L. A71-42195 The effects of letter size, case, and generation method on CRT display search time. Allen G. Vartabedian (American Telephone and Telegraph Co., New York-N.Y.). Human Factors, vol. 13, Aug. 1971, p. 363-368. 5 refs. The effects of letter size, case, and generation method were studied in a task of searching for a common five-letter word in a CRT display. Symbol sizes of 0.12, 0.14, and 0.16 in. were evaluated. Words were composed of all uppercase or all lowercase letters. Two symbol generation methods - letters drawn by means of continuous strokes and by means of a seven-wide-by-nine-high pattern of dots in a fixed matrix - were investigated. The results indicated that for both methods of symbol generation, uppercase words were searched 13% faster than lowercase words. No significant differences were found due to symbol generation method or letter size. (Author) A71-42196 // Visual performance with simulated flare light - Effects of flare-ignition altitude. Robert L. Hilgendorf (USAF, Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio). Human Factors, vol. 13, Aug. 1971, p. 379-386. 12 refs.Four groups of ten subjects performed simulated target acquisi- tion (detection and recognition) tasks under simulated Mark 24 flare light (2,000,000 cp). One group performed with six aerial flares dropped 0.25 mi apart (simulated), another group with six flares 0.50 mi apart, another with four flares 0.75 mi apart, and the last group with two flares 1 mi apart. All groups performed at two simulated observer altitudes (2000 and 2500 ft) and with three simulated flare-ignition altitudes (2000, 2500, and 3000 ft). General- ly, more targets were acquired at the 2000-ft flare-ignition altitude. There were no statistically significant differences attributed to flare separation or observer altitude. (Author) A71-42226 * Urease reaction rates at low water activity. J. SkujinS and A. D. McLaren (California, University, Berkeley, Calif.). Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971, p. 3-11. 26 refs. Grants No. NsG-704; No. NGL-05-003-079. Demonstration that hydrolysis of urea by urease takes place in 'dry' urea-urease mixture exposed to discrete water vapor pressures from 100 to 20% relative humidjty and at 2 to 70 C. A discontinuity in enzymatic activities is observed at the transition of urea from a solid to a deliquescent solution. Urease is inactivated more readily at higher relative humidities in saturated urea solution than at lower relative humidities where water for urea hydrolysis is adsorbed on enzyme-protein only. Hydrolysis of urea by urease proceeds at a measurable rate in concentrated solutions of urea and of urea hydrolysis products, ammonium carbonate and bicarbonate, in the absence of ionic strength or pH stabilizing agents. (Author) A71-42227 * Survival of microorganisms in a simulated Martian environment. R. H. Green, D. M. Taylor (Boeing Co., Seattle, Wash.; California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.), E. A. Gustan, S. J. Fraser, and R. L. Olson (Boeing Co., Seattle, Wash.). Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971,p. 12-24.15refs. Mariner 4 data were utilized to establish the environmental test parameters. The test conditions involved maximum temperatures of 25 C, minimum temperatures of -60 C, and an atmosphere consisting of 70% carbon dioxide, 25% nitrogen and 5% argon at an atmospheric pressure of 6 mm Hg. On the basis of the test results it is concluded that survival probabilities for exposed microorganisms ort the Martian surface would be very small. However, if microorganisms were protected from the solar irradiation the probability for survival increases. Microorganisms protected in subsurface environments would be expected to survive for extended periods. G.R. A71-42228 * Behavioral responses to linear accelerations in blind goldfish. I - The gravity reference response. R. J. Von Baumgarten, G. Baldrighi, J. Atema (Michigan, University, Ann Arbor, Mich.), and G. L. Shillinger, Jr. (Michigan, University, Ann Arbor, Mich.; NASA, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.). Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971, p. 25-33. 11 refs. Grant No. NGR-23-005-201. Blind goldfish were subjected to linear accelerations on a motor car and on a parallel swing. Movements of the fish in a tank during the accelerations were recorded with a movie camera. During the horizontal acceleration, the fish aligns his longitudinal axis in a plane perpendicular to the direction of an apparent gravity with the fish's back pointing away from the direction of this apparent gravity vector. This is similar to the manner in which the fish usually aligns himself horizontally in response to the vertically downward terrestrial gravity and can therefore be termed 'gravity reference response.' It is concluded that blind goldfish cannot distinguish between otolith displacements caused by passive tilts and equivalent otolith displacements caused by moderate inertial forces during rectilinear acceleration. With a horizontal jerk of higher magnitude, two additional responses can occur: horizontal 180 deg turns following tailward jerks and straight forward darting following noseward jerks. (Author) 589A71-42229 A71-42229 On the unlikelihood of non-aqueous bio- systems. R. A. Home (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Mass.). Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971, p. 34-41. 24 refs. The properties of water are examined, and the possibility of enzymatic activity in nonaqueous media is considered. It is con- cluded that the unique ability of the solvent liquid water to form polymorphic, 3-dimensional, H-bonded aggregates and solvation envelopes of widely different character (hydrophilic or coulombic hydration and hydrophobic hydration) is a necessary condition for the realization of the levels of order in form and complexity in function required by carbonaceous biotic systems.

Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971, p. 42-45. 7 refs. Research supported by the Long Island University. Conditions on the primordial earth are reviewed and informa- tion on pertinent microfossils and primitive .microorganisms presented. A series of simulated pre-Cambrian environments are set up and 8 strains of blue-green algae are tested under 7 different anaerobic, mildly reducing atmospheres. Of 61 cultures tested, 12 showed growth, 32 survived and 17 died. Growth was measured spectrophotometrically. Microscopic examination failed to show any gross morphological changes in the experimental cultures. It is concluded that certain strains of blue-green algae have retained their ability to survive or grow under a primordial atmosphere. (Author) A71-42231 * Exponential decontamination models for count data. Richard G. Cornell and Ashok K. Bansal (Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla.). Space Life Sciences, vol. 3, Aug. 1971, p. 46-53. 5 refs. Grant No. NGR-10-004-029. Several models are developed for the estimation of the rate of exponential die-off from decontamination data. Calculations with illustrative data are reported which indicate that the estimation of this rate and. its variance are sensitive to changes in modeling assumptions. Since extrapolation using this estimated rate is used in the specification of planetary quarantine standards, special care should be taken in the selection of an appropriate model and corresponding estimation procedure for the analysis of each set of decontamination data to be used for this purpose.

A71-42241 Pulmonary antibacterial defenses with pure oxygen breathing. Paul A. Shurin, Solbert Permutt, and Richard L. Riley (Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Md.). Society for Experi- mental Biology and Medicine, Proceedings, vol. 137, Sept. 1971, p. 1202-1208. 22 refs. NIH Grant No. 5 P01 ES-00454. After exposure to bacterial aerosols, mice were placed in air and in pure oxygen at 1 atm total pressure. Animals breathing pure oxygen showed an inhibition of early intrapulmonary clearance of Staphylococcus aureus and enhanced early clearance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Furthermore, oxygen breathing for 24 hr after infec- tion produced a delay of subsequent mortality due to K. pneumoniae. In vitro bacterial growth studies showed inhibition of growth of S. aureus by high oxygen and no effect on the growth of K. pneumoniae. Exposure to pure oxygen for 24 hr does not appear to have any major effect on the ability of the lung to inactivate inhaled bacteria. M.M. A71-42250 * Ultrasonic imaging of in vivo bubbles in decompression sickness. G. J. Rubissow (California, University, Berkeley, Calif.) and R. S. Mackay (Boston, University, Boston, Mass.). Ultrasonics, vol. 9, Oct. 1971, p. 225-234. 19 refs. PHS Grant No. B-233; Grant No. NsG-500. Scanning ultrasonic imaging is used to monitor, in vivo, the development and location of microscopic bubbles formed in de- compression sickness. Stationary or moving bubbles as small as 5 microns are detected. Methods of comparison of earlier reference images with real time images on an oscilloscope are described. Different image displays are presented, emphasizing the usefulness of combined deflection and brightness scan modulation. Experiments show unmistakable decompression bubble echoes around fatty tissues in guinea pig legs, which disappear almost completely with recompression. Guinea pigs can be safely decompressed by keeping imaged bubble echoes below a threshold. Preliminary results of human studies are discussed. (Author) A71-42341 # Magnetic recordings of the heart's electrical activity with a cryogenic magnetometer. A. Rosen, G. T. Inouye, A. L. Morse (TRW Systems Group, Redondo Beach, Calif.), and D. L. Judge (Southern California, University, Los Angeles, Calif.). Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 42, Sept. 1971, p. 3682-3684. 15 refs. Research supported by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The greatest difficulty in measuring magnetic field generated by the heart's electrical activity is in eliminating noise from other sources. The common mode portion of the noise was rejected by using a magnetometer with a pair of differentially connected superconducting flux transformers. The high sensitivity associated with the two Josephson junction quantum interference device permitted highly resolved magnetocardiograms of quality comparable to the normal electrocardiogram, without the use of shielded enclosures or signal averaging.

The concentrations of Na, K, Mg, and Cl were determined in muscles and liver, various zones of the kidney, plasma, red blood cells, and bladder urine in active and hibernating hedgehogs. Freezing point depression and urea concentration were determined in the kidney, plasma, and urine. Unaltered tissue water concentration and 590A71-42437 15 to 20 percent decreased Cl and Na space suggest a shift of water from the interstitium to the cells during hibernation. Hibernation .tended to alter the partition of electrolytes between tissues and plasma similarly to in vitro cooling of mammalian tissues. The osmolarity and the concentration of urea, Na, and Cl did not increase from cortex to papilla in the kidneys of hibernating hedgehogs. A71-42417 The spectrum of ST segment elevation in the electrocardiograms of healthy adult men. Alfred F. Parisi (USAF, Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Tex.), Charles H. Beckmann (USAF, School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Tex.), and Malcolm C. Lancaster (USAF, Medical Center, Brooks AFB, Tex.). Journal of Electrocardiology, vol. 4, no. 2, 1971, p. 137-144. 17 refs. From 49,512 EKGs filed on USAF flying personnel in 1968, 1188 had ST segment elevation in two or more limb or precordial leads. The prevalence was 2.10% in those less than 35, and 2.65% in those 35 or older. The individual lead most commonly showing ST elevation was V sub 6 (90%). In the limb leads it was noted most frequently in lead II (51%). One hundred EKGs, representative of the entire series, were analyzed in greater detail. ST elevation in excess of 2.0 mm was noted in 3 records. Precordial T waves in excess of 10 mm were seen in 23 instances. Slurring of the the QRS complex into the ST segment was common in both limb and precordial leads, but a terminally notched QRS was not noted in the limb leads. Prior records, available in 87 cases, showed a consistent pattern of ST elevation in 65 instances for an average duration of 8.2 yrs. M.M. A71-42432 The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. Symposium sponsored by the University of the Pacific and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, NIH Grant No. 1 R 13 ET 00512-01A1. Edited by Paul Bach-y-Rita, C. C. Collins, and J. E. Hyde (University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif.). New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971. 560 p. $14.50. The topics treat the anatomical, physiological, pharmacological, psychological, and clinical correlations of eye movements. Models of various parts of the oculomotor system are discussed in a com- prehensive survey of biophysical, mathematical, and engineering aspects of eye movement control. Other topics include the structure of the extraocular muscle fibers of mammals, EEG, evoked potentials, supranuclear disorders of ocular control systems in man, and eye movements and perception. A comprehensive subject index is provided. M.M. A71-42433 Neurophysiology of eye movements. Paul Bach-y-Rifa (University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif.).

PHS Grant No. NB-06038. Discussion of questions fundamental to an understanding of movement in general, as well as movement of the eyes, such as the significance of ocular proprioception, the role played by sensory receptors in oculorotatory muscles, and the type of peripheral innervation which supplies the extraocular muscles (EOMs) so that they can move with the swiftness of a saccade or the slow smoothness of a following movement. Emphasis is placed on the afferent and efferent innervation of the EOMs. Results of studies of stretch receptors and their pathways, types of motor innervation, and muscle fiber types are presented. A few pertinent effects of central nervous system (CNS) control are discussed. M.M. A71-42434 The structure of the extraocular muscle fibers of mammals. Lee Peachey (Pennsylvania, University, Philadelphia, Pa.). In: .The control of eye movements; Proceedings _of theSymposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. ' \" New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 47-66.'34 refs. Brief review of the structural and functional properties of the muscles of the extraocular group, restricted to mammals and to the extrafusal fibers of the six muscles within the orbit, excluding the retractor bulbi. The histological arrangement of fibers in the muscles is discussed, together with the histochemical and ultrastructural aspects of the various fiber types, leading to a classification system including five different types of fibers. Some problems of relating structure to function are discussed, and the motor nerve endings in these muscles are touched upon. M.M. A71-42435 Central oculomotor pathways. Malcolm B. Carpenter (Columbia University, New York, N.Y.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969.J New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 67-103. 99 refs7NIH Grant No. NS-01538-12. Brief review of studies of the nuclei of the extraocular muscles and of afferent pathways to the nuclei of the extraocular muscles. It is pointed out that observational data suggest that relatively discrete unilateral lesions in the interstitial nucleus produce primarily disturbance of head posture. Unilateral lesions involving the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, fibers from the interstitial nucleus which cross in the posterior commissure, and variable amounts of the lateral central gray substance appear to produce bilateral eyelid retraction and impairment of vertical eye movements, particularly those associated with upward gaze. Lesions involving fibers crossing in the ventral part of the posterior commissure produce a similar syndrome in the monkey, and appear to involve the same fiber systems. M.M. A71-42436 Vestibulo-ocular relations. Bernard Cohen (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, N.Y.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. \\ New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 105-148! 323 refs. Brief review of eye movements induced by the vestibular apparatus and some aspects of vestibular nuclei organization. Central pathways which connect the vestibular and oculomotor nuclei, particularly pathways through the pons responsible for horizontal eye movements induced by both visual and vestibular stimuli are described. From the data presented, it seems likely that neural organizations which generate rapid horizontal eye movements lie in the paramedian zone of the pontine reticular formation (PPRF). In addition, pathwa'ys or neural groups important for producing slow eye movements also appear to be located in the PPRF. M.M. A71 -42437 EEG, evoked potentials, and eye and image movements.

Reappraisal, for the benefit of clinicians, of the supranuclear ocular motor syndromes and signs in terms of current physiological concepts. An offer is made to share with colleagues in physiology and bioengineering opportunities for useful collaborative investiga- tions of various defective eye movement control systems exemplified in patients with clinical involvement in the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brain stem. Much of the discussion is speculative, although based on what seems supported by current physiological, anatomical and clinico-pathological correlation. The various types of ocular motor disorders are discussed in terms of horizontal, vertical and vergence movements, with a section on para- and internuclear disorders. Several varieties of nystagmus are discussed. M.M. A71-42439 The pharmacology of extraocular muscle. Kenneth E. Eakins and. Ronald Katz (Columbia University, New York, N.Y.).

A71-42440 Eye movements and perception. Leon Festinger (New School for Social Research, New York, N.Y.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969.. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 259-273. 32 refs. Brief discussion of the manner in which eye movements affect the input to the visual system and how these movements affect the use of visual information. Eye movements serve a variety of functions, such as: (1) acquisition of a source of visual input; (2) maintaining the flow of information input through the visual system; (3) providing information about direction and egocentric localization of objects; and (4) providing the basis for the organization that results in visual perception of contours, shape, and distance.

PHS Grant No. 5 R 01 EY-00498; NIH Grant No. P O1 EY-00299; Contract No. N 0014-70-C-0141. Description of preliminary dynamic studies of isolated oculo- rotatory muscles and globe restraining tissues, primarily carried out on cats but with some observations on humans. The static and dynamic mechanical properties of the orbital elements of the cat under conditions of graded stimulation are treated. These pre- liminary investigations have resulted in a conceptual model of the mechanical part of the oculomotor system on which further investigations of the human oculomotor plant will be based.Measurements of the mechanical characteristics of the human eye .movement control system are discussed. It is pointed out that insights derived from the mechanical measurements and calculations of the oculomotor system of the cat make it possible to guide further research and interpretations of mechanical parameters of the human oculomotor system which may be of clinical significance. M.M. A71-42442 Extraocular muscle forces in strabismus. Alan B. Scott (University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, Univer- sity of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 327-342. 13 refs. PHS Grant No. 5 R 01 EY-00498; NIH Gram No. P O1 EY-00299; Contract No. N 0014-70-C-0141. Description of tests used in studies of the mechanical properties in strabismus which are helpful in understanding, diagnosis, and treatment. Some pertinent data on the passive and active forces giving horizontal alignment are reviewed, and it is shown that a quantitative approach to the forced duction test yields useful information. Ways of assessing the active force which the muscle gives during fixation or while the eye tries to move (force generation tests) are shown. The static forces which balance one another during steady fixation are first dealt with. It is then shown how one can get useful information from the dynamic behavior of the eye as it moves or tries to move with inputs from the various motor systems of the general oculomotor apparatus. M.M. A71-42443 The saccadic system. Albert F. Fuchs (Washington, University, Seattle, Wash.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 343-362. 64 refs. NIH Grant No. FR-00166. Only one model has been proposed which simulates the behavior of the saccadic control system and which, with slight modifications, has survived since its original presentation in 1962. Before this model is described and evaluated, some pertinent saccadic properties which must be satisfied by the model are reviewed. In conclusion, some of the oculomotor pathways and areas believed to be concerned with the saccade are discussed. M.M. A71-42444 The control system for versional eye move- ments. Lawrence Stark (California, University, Berkeley, Calif.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 363-428. 88 refs. NIH Grant No. 7 R01 NB 08546-01; Contract No. N 00014-67-A-0114-0022. Review of the control system for versional eye movements in order to expose the current state of knowledge as the complex situation it really is: two well-formulated models under attack by their very success in generating critical new experiments; a few less refined models encompassing behavior as yet not understood; some quantitative descriptions without adequate underlying formulation; and many qualitative descriptions of complex phenomena, pursuit of which may lead to further crystallizations as new models. Four sections are each devoted to a somewhat separable major physiologi- cal process of the versional system: (1) dual mode control, (2) intermittency, (3) plant dynamics, and (4) prediction and pattern recognition. Each section contains models and quantitative descrip- tions that are related to each one of these four control phenomena. A71-42445 * Pursuit eye tracking movements. Laurence R. Young (MIT, Cambridge, Mass.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press. Inc., 1971, p. 429-443. Grants No. 592A71-42518 NGL-22-009-025; No. NGR-22-009-156; Contract No. AF 33I615I-69-C-1425. Review of features of the pursuit eye movement system which are known at present, and discussion of some system characteristics which are still uncertain. A simplistic view of the human eye tracking system recognizes two major modes of tracking: rapid saccadic eye movements and smooth pursuit movements. The saccadic eye movement system supposedly acts to maintain the image of the object of interest on the fovea by a sequence of discrete high velocity jumps. The smooth pursuit system has been assigned the role of stabilization of retinal images, or more particularly matching the angular velocity of the eye to the velocity of the object. This view has led to the development of several models which treat the saccadic system as a velocity servomechanism. It is shown that the pursuit system is not a simple . linear-velocity servomechanism based on retinal error velocity. M.V.E. A71-42446 Control of vergence eye movements. Bert L. Zuber (Illinois, University, Chicago, III.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 447-471. 31 refs. PHS Grant No. NB-07777. Discussion of the system of vergence - i.e., disjunctive - eye movements that provides the binocular organism of primates and higher animals with a crucial degree of freedom which permits the fixation of points in visual space at various distances from the organism. The vergence system has received less attention from researchers than the versional system. Complexities are met at the input to the vergence system where either fusional or accommodative stimuli may be used to drive the system. Both of these inputs are difficult to generate compared to the relatively simple versional inputs. At the output of the vergence system, the range of eye movement is about one fourth of the range of versional movement. The system interacts in a complex, and as yet incompletely understood, fashion with the accommodative and pupillary systems as an integral part of the so-called near triad. M.V.E. A71-42447 Discussion of the control of eye vergence movements. Gerald Westheimer (California, University, Berkeley, Calif.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press. Inc., 1971, p. 473-482. 12 refs. PHS Grant No. NS-08091. Experimental data are used to define the mechanisms by which the need for an eye vergence movement is recognized and its magnitude and direction become fixed. Target configurations which are effective in producing eye vergence movements are illustrated, together with horizontal and vertical receptive field disparities of binocular units. The influence of barbiturates on the motor component of vergence movements is examined, and it is concluded that there is a central (probably midbrain) site for convergence responses that is affected by barbiturates. T.M. A71-42448 Vestibular and proprioceptive stabilization of eye movements. Jacob L. Meiry (MIT, Cambridge, Mass.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, Univer- sity of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. ~New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 483-496. 25 refs. The input-output characteristics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc and associated neck proprioceptive mechanisms are examined with reference to the generation of a stabilized visual image during head and body movements. Compensatory eye movements for vestibular stimulation with earth-fixed and environmental fixation points are discussed for lateral stabilization. T.M.A71-42449 Organization of neural control in the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc. G. Melvill Jones (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 497-518. 40 refs. Analysis of experimental data for the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc indicates that the hydrodynamic response of the semicircular canal (at least during natural head movements) leads to the generation of an afferent neural signal containing the essential meaning of head angular velocity. This signal is then fed forward through subsequent neural relays to the oculomotor nuclei in a form which is largely unchanged and which hence retains the angular velocity message. This then generates a 'primary' oculomotor response after passing through a first-order lag system, with the special added feature that a 'secondary' saccadically generated signal (also acting through the subsequent first-order lag system) tends to restore correct phase (and presumably amplitude) relations between the response and the original stimulus head movement. T.M. A71 -42450 Models of oculomotor neural organization. David A. Robinson (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md.|. In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 519-538. 30 'efs. PHS Grant No. NB-08633-01. Hypothetical neural arrangements are described which are compatible with the known structure and function of individual organizational elements in the oculomotor system. The vestibular- ocular reflex is represented by a system which stabilizes the visual axes in space over a certain frequency range for head excursions too small to trigger the fast phase of vestibular nystagmus. Speculations are offered on the manner in which this basic reflex system can be overlaid by the more complex visually controlled saccadic and smooth pursuit systems. Sets of brain stem neural networks are proposed as the generator of saccadic eye movements. Attempts at assigning neurological mechanisms to the smooth pursuit system indicate that the available system models are greatly oversimplified and must be modified to make them more compatible with the capabilities of neural networks. T.M. A71-42451 Time delays in the human eye-tracking system. Derek H. Fender (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.). In: The control of eye movements; Proceedings of the Symposium, University of the Pacific, San Francisco, Calif., November 10, 11, 1969. New York, Academic Press, Inc., 1971, p. 539-543. It is argued that the phase lags observed in the human oculomotor system during tracking tasks can be represented accurately by simple time delays whose value is a function of the class of target motion. Experimental evidence indicates that the delay time is the time required by the retinal passage to sweep across enough receptors so that the integrated neural messages can generate the minimum afferent signal necessary to elicit corrective eye movements. T.M. A71-42518 Pulse wave velocity in healthy subjects and in patients with various disease states. Marcel Eliakim, Dan Sapoznikov, and Joseph Weinman (Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel). American Heart Journal, vol. 82, Oct. 1971, p. 448-457. 38 refs. Determination of the pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a large number of healthy subjects and patients suffering from eight different pathological states. A noninvasive photoplethysmographic technique was used, and two time periods were measured - the time period between the 'feet' of the pulse waves of the femoral and the dorsalis pedis arteries and the period between the QRS complex and 593A71-42519 the pulse wave of the dorsalis pedis artery. PWV was found to increase significantly with age. Hypertension was accompanied by increased PWV only in older subjects, while peripheral vascular disease was associated with decreased PWV. No significant change was observed in normotensive subjects suffering from ischemic heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or anemia. The time interval between the feet of the femoralis and dorsalis pedis arteries was not altered significantly by cardiac pacing at fixed and increasing heart rates in eight patients with A-V block. Beat-to-beat measurements in eight cases of chronic atrial fibrillation showed that this interval was constant and independent of the preceding cycle length and, therefore, of variations in blood pressure. Premature beats generated intervals which were equal to or shorter than those generated by sinus or postpremature beats. On the other hand, the interval between the Q wave of the ECG and the foot of the pulse wave of the dorsalis pedis artery was prolonged by cardiac pacing and was inversely related to the preceding cycle length in atrial fibrillation. Likewise, intervals generated by premature beats were longer than those of sinus and postpremature beats. This finding is interpreted as indicating a prolongation of the 'left ventricular tension period,' rather than a change in the propagation time of the pulse wave. A.B.K. A71-42519 Inferior atrial rhythms - Vectorcardiographic American Journal, vol. 82, Oct. 1971, p. 468-476. 10 refs. Results of a Vectorcardiographic analysis of 19 subjects with inferior atrial rhythm as diagnosed by ECG. A predominance of clockwise rotation of the P loop in the frontal plane and counter- clockwise rotation in the horizontal and right sagittal planes is noted. The initial limb of the loop and the greatest vector are directed upward and usually leftward. The spatial voltage of the. greatest vector and the dimensions of the loop are within normal limits. No correlation is observed between the VCG and ECG classifications of nodal and coronary sinus rhythms. An analysis of the horizontal plane makes it possible to identify several types of IAR, probably resulting from different locations of the pacemaker. A.B.K.

A71-42579 ff Comparison of residual and reversed micro- interval maskings by measurement of absolute Leningrad, June 1971, p. 806-817..29 refs. In Russian. The volume of perceived sound intensity information was studied in soundproof chamber experiments on 3 trained subjects with normal hearing. The subjects were instructed to discriminate test signals from masking signals on an electrodynamic TD-6 telephone system when signals of either type were delivered in alternation. The rectangular 1000-Hz 30-microsec 20-to-70-dB test signals and the rectangular 1000-Hz 300-microsec 85-dB masking signals were produced by two ZG-10 acoustic generators and an electronic device designed by Makarov et al. (1963). The perception capacity of the subjects declined when the microintervals between test and masking signals were reduced. V.Z.

Experimental determination of the dose dependence of the influence of cystamine and aminoethylisothiuronium on the resis- tance of rats and mice to lateral accelerations thirty minutes after the administration of the drug. The dose dependence of the drug effects was determined on the basis of the cardiac contraction rate. The resistance of the animals to the accelerations becomes stabilized within four hours after administration of the drugs. The reduction of the depressant effect of the drugs with time is associated with the elimination of the pharmacological (toxic) effect. The reduction of glycogen supplies in the liver is a possible mechanism responsible for the drop in resistance to acceleration under the influence of cystamine.

The bradycardia induced by these drugs is further aggravated by the accelerations and enhances the rate at which the adaptation (to acceleration) reserves are used up. The AET did not affect the cardiac contraction rate, but acute bradycardia also followed when it was combined with acceleration.

An attempt was made to extend the radiation-protective action of cystamine by reinjection of eliminated portions. Cystamine elimination rates were lower when small doses of cystamine were added repeatedly at intervals of one hour, and its toxic action increased after 3rd injection. In general, its radiation-protective action declined faster with time than its toxic action.

Half-elimination times of cystamine toxic effect in gamma- irradiated and control mice are compared in a study of the effect of gamma emission on the elimination of cystamine in the organism. Residual cystamine in the organism is calculated from the shift in LD50 of the protector 3 hr after injections. Gamma doses of 850 r increased T5Q from 1.8 in control mice to 2.3 in irradiated mice when cystamine was used as a prophylactic. The portion of cystamine remaining in the organism was 44.2% in exposed mice and 24.5% in control mice 3 hr after injection. It is theorized that a slower elimination of the toxic effect of cystamine after irradiation is due to a depressive effect of radiation on cystamine metabolism. V.Z.

Experiments on rats exposed to general gamma neutron radia- tion with a neutron component of about 90% showed that the shielding of the head provided a much less effective protection than the shielding of the front section of the belly when the masses of protected tissues in both cases were equal. The shielding of equal head or belly tissue masses was nearly as effective during exposure to fission neutrons of about 1 MeV as it was during exposure to 120-MeV protons but was much less effective during exposure to gamma emission.

Study the effect of cystamine, AET, and 5-methoxytrypt- amine (5-MOT) on rats subjected to total irradiation with 120-MeV protons and Co 60 gamma rays while their abdomen and head regions were protected by shields. It is found that the effectiveness of these preparations is considerably increased, especially in those cases where the substances are administered in suboptimal doses in the presence of 'low-efficiency' shields, under conditions of exposure of the animals to absolutely lethal radiation doses. While in the case of cystamine and AET the increase in specific effectiveness was the same whether the head was shielded or the abdomen tissue, in the case of 5-MOT the increase in its effectiveness is much more pronounced when the abdomen is shielded than when the head is shielded. This difference in the reaction of the animals is attributed to certain differences in the mechanism of action of the preparations. A.B.K.

Study of the effect of shielding of the head and the anterior part of the abdomen on the clinical evolution and outcome of radiation sickness in dogs subjected to lethal doses of total gamma irradiation. The test results confirmed the basic data obtained in experiments on small laboratory animals and showed the great effectiveness 'of shielding parts of the body in the case of dogs. Given a shielding of equal masses of tissue by shields producing an identical degree of radiation attenuation, and given an equal irradiation dose, shielding of portions of the anterior part of the abdomen is found to be considerably more effective than shielding of the head. In order to produce a significant protective effect of shielding in the presence of lethal irradiation doses, it is necessary to protect an abdomen (head) tissue mass equal to 10 to 15% of the body mass and to reduce the irradiation dose on the shielded tissue by a factor of 3 to 4.

Although no differences in chromosome behavior are noted within the first 12 or 24 hr after irradiation, after three days the frequency of chromosome aberrations in the bone marrow of the experimental animals practically returned to the initial level and was statistically reliably lower than in animals irradiated without a physical shield. The level of disruption of the chromosome complex in the experimental animals was also somewhat lower than in animals irradiated with a half-dose of irradiation, thus attesting to a decrease in the radiation effect by a factor of 2 to 2.5.

Hyperfermentemia was observed within 40.to 90 days after exposure. When the animals were subjected to radial accelerations (before the appearance of symptoms of disruption of cardiac activity), an almost equal hyperfermentemia occurs both in intact animals and in those irradiated with the abdomen region shielded, as contrasted with an absence of changes in the activity of CAST and GALT in dogs with head shielded. These differences are attributed to the dynamics of changes in aminotransferase activity, and to the rate and volume of the repair processes under different shielding conditions. A.B.K.

Experiments performed with rats show that the magnitude of the gamma-ray background can be neglected in approximate calculations of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons if the gamma-ray contribution to the total radiation dose is not greater than 15%. For higher levels of the gamma component, the error in determining the RBE factor increases substantially and can significantly distort the experimental results.

The effects of 20-min exposures to 114 to 115 dB and 125 to 126 dB noise on 24 subjects were investigated in a series of 105 experiments. Unfavorable reactions of the auditory and motor analysers to noise of 125 to 126 dB were observed. Exposures to noise of 114 to 116 dB for 20 min are believed to be safely acceptable during space flights. V.Z.

Healthy male subjects were kept at 34 C for 5 days immersed in water containing NaCI in experiments designed to determine the effect of a modified gravitational field on their motor functions. The functional behavior of the segmental apparatus of the spine cord during the execution of voluntary motions was studied during immersion. The results suggest that the functional activity of the supraspinal centers is depressed by the 2nd day of immersion. V.Z.

The variations in the external respiratory function and gas metabolism under transverse accelerations of 9 to 16 g were studied in a series of 77 experiments on 53 subjects kept in a reclined position in a rotating centrifuge. Respiration rates and volume, pulmonary ventilation, oxygen intake, carbon dioxide discharge, and the respiratory coefficient were determined during the experiments. The shifts in respiration and gas metabolism observed under accelerations are linked to an upset oxygen balance which becomes more pronounced with accelerations. Also the pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary gas metabolism were upset markedly at accelerations of 13 g and above. V.Z. 600A71-42804 A71-42796 # Effect of accelerations on the V. E. Potkin, and L.

Light of 0.1, 100, and 260 lux inhibited the function of vestibular nystagmus in two groups of 12 subjects who participated in 220 experiments in a study of interactions between the visual and vestibular analysors. The duration of counterrotation illusion and the amplitude and duration of the postrotation nystagmus were reduced when the subjects were exposed to acoustic stimuli of 100 to 110 dB at 1000 Hz. Muscular stresses on a manual and especially on a stand dynamometer also reduced the duration of counterrotation illusion. V.Z.

Nitrogen and water-salt metabolisms were studied in two subjects confined for 35 days in a small sealed chamber in which the composition of air varied from normal to 110 mm pO2 and 15 mm pC02 according to a certain law over 7-day periods. The negative balance of nitrogen metabolism of the subjects tended to decrease when the hypoxic air in the chamber contained some excess carbon dioxide. The increased activity of respiratory muscles is believed to account for this finding. V.Z.

It is shown that an individual's capacity for sensing changes in the composition of the inspired air can be evaluated in tests involving the selection of a preferred respiratory mixture. The resolution of changes in mixture composition is improved when a constant level of pulmonary ventilation is maintained. Individual peculiarities in the reactions of different people to hypoxic and hypercapnic media are discussed, and it is shown that the sensory differentiation among various mixtures improves with subsequent exposures. This demon- strates that training can improve such capabilities and should be considered in crewmember training programs. T.M.

Survey of orginal and published data on the morphology, infrastructure, and histochemistry of different organs from experi- mental animals subjected to hyperoxia. Emphasis is placed on the effects of pure oxygen at atmospheric pressure. An initial period of 6 hr is characterized by an activated cellular metabolism without apparent morphological changes. Pathological changes observed after 12 hr include cellular adiposis, reduced RNA and protein contents in cells, disrupted infrastructure of the mitochondria, and suppression of oxidizing enzymes. A compensatory increase in the activity of glycolytic enzymes occurs in connection with the occurrence of secondary hypoxia. Reaction features specific to various tissues and organs are described.

A 6-hr exposure to pure oxygen at 1 atm activates the metabolism of connective-tissue cells (accumula- tion of glycogen and increased activity of oxidizing enzymes) without disturbing the infrastructures. Significant pathological changes occur after 12 hr; progressing further, these changes are evidenced by the destruction of cellular organelles, the suppression of the cellular metabolism, and the depression of the activity of oxidizing enzymes. Destructive changes in collagen fibers are observed. Results are also given for 50, 70, and 100% oxygen atmospheres at an equivalent height of 2400 m. T.M.

In Russian. The thermoregulating tonus and the rectal temperature were studied for rats kept for one hour in an atmosphere of air, one hour in a helium-oxygen atmosphere, and again in an atmosphere of air. A distinct increase in electrical activity and the gas exchange level, and a drop in the rectal temperature were observed for animals placed in a helium-oxygen mixture at room temperature. The functions normalized when the animals were made to breathe air; however, heat balance was not completely restored after one hour. V.P.

Experiments with rats are described, showing that substitution of argon for atmospheric nitrogen in hermetically sealed chambers at 22 C does not affect the physiological functions nor the life span of the animals. Since the heat conductivity of argon differs only slightly from that of nitrogen, the result obtained is seen to support the assumption that the higher conductivity of helium is responsible for the increased life span of animals in hermetically sealed chambers with V. Kustov, and V. I. Mikhailov. In: Problems of cosmic biology. Volume 16. Moscow, Izdatel'stvo Nauka, 1971, p. 170-173. In Russian. A phenol derivative was tested to check the evolution of toxic gases from urine stored for 10 days at room temperature in sealed vessels. Acetone, organic acids, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbohydrates, phenols, ammonia and aliphatic amines were deter- mined in air samples and microflora in the urine. Preservative additions reduced the ammonia, ketone, fatty acid and nitrogen oxide contents in air samples without changing carbon monoxide and organic compound contents. V.Z.

Inhalation of indole vapors (concentrations of 9 to 10 mg/cu m) over.a period of 2 to 3 hr does not produce substantial changes in the organism of mice, rats, and rabbits. Direct injection of a 10 mg alcohol solution of indole in rabbits showed that the indole is quickly rendered harmless and removed from the organism. A vapor concentration of 0.45 mg/cu m is the threshold for perception of the 602A71-42820 Unpleasant odor of indole. Inhalation of indole vapors in concentra- tions greater than 1 mg/cu m can produce negative subjective sensations such as headache and nausea. T.M.

Demonstration of the lack of stability in the process of elimination of elements from the human organism during feeding on a constant diet. In experiments lasting up to six months the ratio of minimum to maximum values of eight elements excreted in the urine is found to range from 1:1.3 to 1:2.0. This pattern must be borne in mind when attempting to create, on the basis of human waste products, cultural media for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms constituting components of bioengineering life-support systems.

Study of the effect of the replacement time of the nutrient solution on its regenerative power in the cultivation of higher plants by the hydroponic method with a substrate of keramzit (a porous clay filler). It is shown that to ensure the functioning of a greenhouse with a given productivity it is necessary to change the nutrient solution once every 90 days. Longer use of the solution leads to an increase in the area of the greenhouse. Then the need for frequent regeneration of large quantities of nutrient solution and the high absorptive capacity of the substrate make its use in closed-cycle greenhouses questionable.

Studies were carried out in sealed ampules, in anaerostats, and in a 'photostat' with an atmosphere flowing through it. The Infusoria C. maupasi survived in a dormant cyst state when placed in the 'photostat' in moist sand in the trophon stage with daily variations of temperature from +25 to -30 C (up to two weeks) in a C02 atmosphere at a pressure of 10 mm Hg and with eight hours daily irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light. Daily variable temperatures above 0 C increase the rate of fission of Infusoria in comparison with constant temperature, provided that the temperature sums are the same.

It is concluded that various different methods of protection against UV radiation Can be developed in the course of evolution and, as a consequence, the extent of life is not limited by this radiation. T.M. A71-42829 if Influence of ultraviolet radiation on amino acids and peptides in different gas atmospheres in the presence of salts and P. Bogdanova, and E. M. Lapinskaia. In: Problems of cosmic biology. Volume 16. Moscow, Izdatel'stvo Nauka, 1971, p. 313-324. 18 refs. In Russian. UV irradiation of solutions of amino acids and peptides (sensitized by different cations, metal oxides, and polyphosphoric acid) produces various reactions such as disruption of the carbon chain, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, deamination, formation of organic acids and carbonyl compounds, and production of new amino acids. A proposed hypothesis argues that initially synthesized peptides in the prebiological planetary epoch consisted of amino acids with a shorter chain of carbon atoms. The present results demonstrate that some minerals and cations may have exerted a catalytic influence on the photochemical transformations of abio- genically synthesized amino acids. Low temperatures did not prevent photolysis. T.M. A71-42830 # Influence of a set (Deistvie na Belikova, and I. A. Egorov. In: Problems of cosmic biology. Volume 16.

Experimental study of the combined and individual effects of ultraviolet light, X-ray irradiation, and freezing-thawing cycles on ribonuclease. Ultraviolet light and X-ray radiation lead to inactiva- tion of the ribonuclease through complex mechanisms which are probably caused by chemical modification of thyroxine groups in the molecule. Combined irradiation by both ultraviolet light and X rays produces additive summation of their individual effects. Freezing and thawing produces denaturation changes in the ribonuclease molecule which differ from those observed during photolysis. Irradiation of the enzyme increases its sensitivity to subsequent freezing and thawing.

Moscow, Izdatel'stvo Nauka, 1971, p. 331-335. 9 rets. In Russian. Catalase becomes inactivated after multiple freezing and thawing of its solutions. The effect is dependent on the freezing temperature and on the composition of the gaseous medium. Inactivation does not take place during freezing and thawing in an argon atmosphere. At a freezing temperature of -180 C, other gases stimulate inactiva- tion of the catalase in the following order of decreasing severity of the effect: hydrogen, oxygen, helium, and nitrogen. A gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen exhibits additive summation of the effects of both gases. A 1:1 mixture (by volume) of hydrogen and argon exhibited a much stronger inactivation of the enzyme than expected by simple summation of the individual effects of both gases. T.M.

When a well-learned circle vs ellipse discrimination was made impossibly difficult for the subjects (rhesus monkeys), the con- trolling stimulus-response topographies were replaced by competing topographies. The identification of two training conditions sufficient. to reinstate the original discrimination permitted the following inferences: the original controlling topography had merely decreased in probability of occurrence, whereas the 'strength' of the stimulus- response relation remained unchanged; discriminations along the apparently continuous circle-ellipse dimension actually involved several distinct stimulus-control topographies.

Lever (observing) responses produced either a stimulus in- dicating the availability of food or another stimulus indicating food was not available. Key responses in the presence of the food-available stimulus produced food on a continuous reinforcement schedule. In the absence of food-available stimuli, responding on the key had no scheduled consequences. Observing responses produced food- available stimuli according to three different random-interval schedules with mean interstimulus availability times of 1,2, and 4 min. In the fourth component of the multiple schedule (observing extinction) food-available stimuli never occurred. Each component of the schedule was correlated with a distinctive auditory stimulus. Observing rates decreased with decreasing frequency of the food- available stimulus. M.M. A71-42862 Stimulus control of skin resistance responses on an escape-avoidance schedule. William A.

The efficiency of grinding, as compared to dissolution, for recovery of microorganisms from solids was determined. An adjustment constant of 20 was derived from the data that can be used to equate bacterial spore 607N71-34057 counts obtained by grinding with those obtained by dissolution. The percentage of microorganisms released due to hard impact of Eccobond onto sand was determined. Eccobond was impacted onto sand at velocities of 168. 457. 945 and 1554 m/sec. The results showed that less than 1 percent of the available organisms was released by impact. The percentage of bacterial spores released from methyl methacrylate and Eccobond by aeolian erosion was determined.

NTIS The effects of noise on sleep and post-sleep behavior in two 25, 50, and 70 year-old males is discussed. The subjects were run for 15 consecutive nights, the first five and the fifteenth serving as controls. Following each night's sleep, subjects completed a series of performance and psychological tests. Threshold sound levels for sleep disturbance were obtained for an impulse and a continuous test noise and discussed in terms of type of sleep disturbance, stage of sleep, time of night, adaptation, and age of subjects. The sleep profile results indicated that the pattern of noise-induced sleep disruption was related to age. The 25-year olds showed an increase in stage 1 and movement time. The 70-year olds showed an increase in time awake and a decrease in time spent in stage 3-4. The 50-year old subjects were intermediate with respect to each measure. The daytime performance data revealed no effects of noise-induced sleep disruption on pursuit rotor and reaction time tasks but some decrements were found in time estimation, arithmetic, and memory task measures. In addition, verbal sample scores demonstrated an increase in cognitive impairment and a decrease in human relations. Author N71-34066# Institute for Perception RVO-TNO. Soesterberg (Netherlands).

NEUTRON DEPTH DOSE DISTRIBUTIONS IN HETEROGE- NEOUS PHANTOMS John W. Poston (Ph.D. Thesis - Georgia Inst. of Tech.)

Measured distributions due to fission spectrum and 14-MeV neutrons are presented and discussed. Results from measurements with fission spectrum neutrons indicate that the high voltage electrodes attached to the front of the detectors were too thick to allow the measurement of the changes in dose distributions very near the interface. However, distributions due to 14-MeV neutrons indicate a reduction in the predicted homogeneous depth dose distribution due to the presence of bone. The reduction is about 20% at a distance in bone of about 2 cm. In tissue at the rear of bone, a buildup or increase in the dose deposited was demonstrated which is about 50% more than the interface value at a depth in tissue of 0.8 to 1.0 cm. These results are discussed and compared with available theoretical descriptions. Also included is a discussion of the problems associated with the use of these detectors, the sources of error in the experiment, and a set of recommendations for improvement and further study in this area.

At one facility, a high traffic density tower (HOT), 22 air traffic control specialists (ATCS) were sampled before and after five evening (1500 to 2300) shifts and five night (0000 to 0800) shifts.

In addition, four non-ATC individuals involved in monitoring the MDT ATCSs for other aspects of the general stress study served as controls. It was found that all subjects, both ATCSs and controls, showed a considerable increase in feelings associated with fatigue and tiredness as a function of working an eight-hour shift. These effects were generally more pronounced for night shifts. There were no differences between subject groups on the variables predicted to be most sensitive to variations in stress.

The overpressure levels were 1.0. 2.0 and 4.0 psf (as measured outdoor) with durations of 295 milliseconds. Subjects performed a two-dimensional compensatory tracking task during the exposure period and continuous recordings were obtained of heart rate and skin conductance. No evidence of performance impairment was found for any of the overpressure levels. Rather, performance improved significantly following boom stimulation along with heart-rate deceleration and skin conductance increase. The obtained pattern suggests that the simulated booms may have elicited more of an orienting or alerting response than a startle reflex. The results are discussed in terms of the possible importance of rise time as a determinant of the physiological and performance effects which may be produced by sonic booms.

The forms of discharge patterns are described and emphasis is placed on analyses of adaptation to long term constant stimuli. The great majority of the units will show a discharge increase and then a decline during the first 45 sec of acceleration. Results from longer accelerations, however, lead to the conclusion that a simple model based on a slightly underdamped cupular mechanism does not conform to the responses and neither does an adaptation explanation. It is speculated that a substantial processing of the sensory input takes place at the level of the second-order neuton and what is often seen in these recordings are functions more closely correlated with various response requirements than with one-to-one events at the sense describing small eye movements occurring during steady fixation on a. stationary target is presented. Based on eye movement data for steady gaze, the model has a hierarchical structure: the principal level represents the random motion of the image point within a local area of fixation while the higher level mimics the jump processes involved in transitions from one local area to another. Target image motion within a local area is described by a Langevin-like stochastic differential equation taking into consideration, the microsaccadic jumps pictured as being due to point processes and the high frequency muscle'tremor, represented as a white noise. The transform of the probability density function for local area motion is obtained, leading to explicit expressions for their means and moments. Evaluation of these moments based on the model are comparable with experimental results. A physiolog- ically based criterion for the occurrence of local area changes is assumed and the renewal density of these transitions is obtained. Author N71-34O72*# George Washington Univ..

One of the methods 610N71-34080 presented is an estimated version of Wald sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). The other method is a sequential version of the separating hyperplane approach to pattern classification. The procedures were tested on Gaussian samples and on the EEC responses. Smaller error rates were easier to obtain with the estimated SPRT. In particular, error rates as low as 0.1% were obtained. With sequential tests, it is possible to specify the probability of error decisions before the test is conducted, and the experimental error rates of the procedures agree with the specified error probabilities.

A comparison of biological and analytical methods, including bioisolation of mice and gamma radiation of diets, indicates that Apollo diet is adequate for mice in isolation and that sterilization of the diet shows no adverse effect. A gnotobiological study revealed adverse reactions in mice when they are fed a diet with limited microflora. These reactions are decreases in body weight, growth rate, adult size, white blood count, and hemoglobin. Other studies include evaluation of health and disease status of the astronaut through fecal indices, the effects of fiber in diets of mice, food preparation time, nutrient indicators, markers in nutrition, and astronaut nutritition for 1. 2. or 3 month space flights. N. E. N.control approaches are implemented to provide an automatic controller which responds directly to man's thermoregulatory requirements for cooling during work. The temperature of the wall of the external auditory meatus and four averaged, unweighted skin temperatures are used as input signals to a controller of liquid cooling garment inlet water temperature. The absolute change in derived mean body temperature from a setpoint and its time rate of change are sensed and used to control the temperature of water to an Apollo liquid cooling garment. A crewman metabolic transient thermal computer simulation is conducted to demonstrate feasibility and to supply design parameters for a prototype system. The prototype controller is described and unmanned and manned test data are provided. Author N71-34078/J/ Commissariat a I'Energie Atomique. Saclay (France).

After a brief review of the physical conditions influencing the gain or loss of metabolic heat from human body, the various relations concerning heat convection and absorption are given, as well as those related to sweat removal. The equations are solved by a graphic method that lead to diagrams which, for a given work situation, and as a function of air flow, give the index of thermal stress. This index indicates the thermal environment to which the wearer is exposed. The diagrams are in agreement with published experimental observations. NSA N71-34076*# Missouri Univ.. Columbia.

The techniques of feces sampling, when markers are used, are also discussed. Both external and internal markers are studied. Among the conclusions are the following: The stained particle technique widely used in food studies in ruminants is laborious and questionable. Several dyes have been successfully used to color the feces of ruminants, and a brilliant blue methyl cellulose mixture is recommended for humans. The use of (Cr-51)203. barium sulfate. rare earths, inert metals, soluble markers have been used sucessfully. Of the internal markers, only chromogen and fecal nitrogen seem to be reliable indices to predict digestibility of forage in ruminants it is recommended that the use of glass beads, small seeds, rubber, charcoal, and metal particles in studies of the rate of food passage, and iron oxide, silica, anthraquinone violet, and monastral blue in digestibility studies should cease.

This design concept utilizes prior data relative to the centers of gravity of infants and small children and exhibits excellent self righting. Thermal protection is incorporated through the use of insulative neoprene foam in construction of the submerged porton of the device. Anesthetized adolescent primates exhibiting body weights and metabolic requirements equivalent to that of an infant or small child were used to test and confirm ventilatory capability as induced by air or water motion. An evaluation of the capability of the device to deter shark attack indicated that the infant flotation device, when occupied by anthropomorphic dummies or anesthetized primates, was less attractive to sharks than anthropomorphic dummies wearing a standard yellow color inflatable life vest.

Multiple coding can occur when several information storing molecules share the same cytoplasm. These molecules may code for different construction machinery, that is. for different coding systems. Initially this will reduce the efficiency of the systems but will not be lethal if good proteins are still produced. An alternative coding system is retained if it can lead to the production of one useful protein. Under certain conditions the information in the genetic molecules associated with the alternate coding system will be rectified, and this coding system will become predominant.

It was found that when the moisture level was below 0.5 ml (250 micrograms H20/ml headspace) at 90 C about 1-1/2 logs of inactivation was observed. Between 250 and 500 micrograms H20/ml headspace at 90 C. the moisture value had a profound effect on the number of spore survivors, with the greatest effect at 495 micrograms H20/ml headspace. It is speculated that these conditions encourage the initiation of germination, which in turn renders the organisms sufficiently sensitive to heat so that they are killed almost instantaneously at 90 C.

Avail: NTIS CSCL 06K The space shuttle orbiter environmental control and life support system is presented. The rationale leading to selection of concepts is stressed. Concept trades were based on an anticipated 1977 initial orbiter flight, ten years operation, and a baseline mission support requirement of four men for seven days. The system must provide the following functions: (1) shirtsleeve environment for the crew and passenger compart- ment; (2) food, water, oxygen, storage and disposal of trash and human waste: and (3) where required, provide environmental control of equipment in and outside the crew compartment. The system can be refurbished and maintained using airline maintenance concepts, and state-of-the-art concepts will be used and a system will be provided at costs below previous space vehicle systems.

NTIS CSCL 06K Consideration has been given to equipping the scaled prototype shuttle vehicle with a lightweight energy absorbing seat integrated with a crew extraction rocket. Such a system would provide protection for low velocity vehicle impacts and also offer a means of escape during higher velocity conditions. This system has been developed and fabricated at the Flight Research Center. The energy absorbing seat has been tested in a dynamic impact laboratory with satisfactory results. The escape system has been evaluated by extracting dummies by tractor rockets from a typical cockpit configuration. These tests indicate unsatisfactory performance during high roll rates.

Beasley In its Space Shuttle Technol. Conf., Vol. 2 3 1971 p 67-82 Avail: NTIS CSCL 22C Water immersion simulation techniques were used to determine the limits of manual cargo handling and transfer under weightlessness conditions. Package masses from 3 to 50 slugs, volume of 1.5 to 142 cubic feet, moments of inertia up 900 slug sq ft. and various other aspects such as maneuvering aid, pressure suit effects and one-man versus two-man transfers were considered. Preliminary results obtained indicated that manual cargo transfer, in an IVA mode, can be easily accomplished for packages of 50 slugs or more. This appears to preclude the requirement for automated systems for cargo transfer. However, considerations of practical limitations related to the shuttle configuration and time constraints are necessary before final decision is made.

Vol. 2 3 May 1971 p 83-95 Avail: NTIS CSCL 06K The environmental control and life support (ECLS) subsystem in the orbiter provides a habitable environment for crew and equipment in the hostility of space. The ECLS must provide for the functions of: (1) shirtsleeve environment: (2)water management: (3) atmosphere gas supply; (4) atmosphere revitalization: (5) waste management: and (6) equipment thermal control. The ECLS is active during the mission phases of launch, ascent, on-orbit, entry and landing, and supports two pilots and two cargo handlers. Ground support equipment is utilized during prelaunch, launch, and post landing activity. The four man capacity allows for a wide latitude of mission capability ranging from seven days to thirty days. ECLS extended mission capability is achieved by the addition of modular equipment that is the same as the equipment provided in the orbiter. Provisions for this equipment addition are provided in the initial subsystem design. Author N71-36272*# National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Langley Research Center, Langley Station. Va.

Jul. 1971 13 p refs (FAA-AM-71-34) Avail: NTIS The effects of alcohol on the ability of men to suppress vestibular nestagmus while visually fixating on a cockpit instrument, thus degrading visual tracking performance (eye-hand coordination) during angular acceleration are discussed. Reduced display illumination, independently, has also been shown to degrade tracking performance during vestibular stimulation. The way in which low and moderate dosages of alcohol and two levels of instrument-display illumination combined to affect tracking performance in a static (on motion) environment, and in a dynamic (whole-body motion) environment is presented. Mean blood alcohol levels as low as .027 per cent significantly decreased tracking performance during whole-body motion, yet caused little change in performance in a stationary environment. Impairment was much more pronounced with dim display lighting than with bright lighting. These results suggest that serious problems may be encountered by the pilot who drinks even lightly and who considers flying, especially at night. Author N71-35276# Bureau of Mines. Pittsburgh. Pa.

Treaftis 1971 16 p refs (BM-RI-7545) Avail: NTIS A pulsation damping device designed to smooth pulsating flow in personal respirable dust samplers was evaluated. The effect on the pulsation dampener efficiency of six parameters was investigated, including volume, diaphragm elasticity, diaphragm area, center orifice area, inlet-outlet orifice area, and geometry (L/D ratio). The results indicate that volume predominates in determining snubber efficiency, while the other parameters become important at small volumes. Geometry has no effect on snubber efficiency. Criteria for an efficient pulsation dampener construction were obtained. Author N71-35277# Naval Medical Field Research Lab. Camp Lejeune. N.C. DEVELOPMENT OF THE NMFRL TELEMETRY SYSTEM. VOLUME 21.

AND SIGNAL-TO- NOISE RATIO Charles Abrams, William Doobenen. Salena K. Kerr, and Donald N. Buckner Jun. NTIS CSCL 05/10 A major goal of designers of active sonar systems is to obtain longer target detection ranges. One consequence of longer ranges is longer time intervals between transmissions. Another is lower signal-to-noise ratios and thus fewer transmissions that produce perceptible echoes from a target. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of these variables on operator target detection performance. The results indicated the desirability of history or memory type displays with long-range sonar systems to enhance operator detection performance.

Not only does the gas filter cell offer sensitivity as good as the other systems, but its inherent throughput advantage offers more ultimate sensitivity at the expense of some source power. The most difficult problem in implementing the gas filter cell is making stable reference samples for the two-year lifetime. It is believed that the individual gas cell sensor can be made into a small, compact.' and reliable instrument. However, multiple gas monitoring will probably require parallel optical systems. Based upon present data, the amount of toxic gas required to implement the system will be insufficient to be a significant hazard in the spacecraft. Also, this approach is believed to offer the most convenient changes in gas of interest by simply adding a sensor for the new species without changing any of the existing system.
