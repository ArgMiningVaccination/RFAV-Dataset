ADVERSE REACTIONS The Frequencies of adverse events are defined as follows: Very common (1/10 or 10%); common (1/100 to <1/1,000 or 0.01% to <0.1%). According to the clinical trial conducted in China, Indonesia and Turkey, overall adverse event of CoronaVac reported in these studies were mild and moderate. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of CoronaVac Vaccine was evaluated in participants between 18 to 59 years of age in one phase 1/2 clinical studies conducted in China and 3 clinical studies conducted in Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. Phase 1 Clinical Study in China Phase 1 clinical trial of CoronaVac in China involved 143 participants which included in the safety analysis that consists of 72 in vaccine group received 0-14 day regimen and 71 participants in vaccine group received 0-28 regimen. Total adverse events observed up to 28 days after two injections from all groups were 25.00%, which consists of 29.17% from medium dose group (600 SU), 37.50% from high dose group (1200 SU) and 8.33% from placebo group. The most common adverse events were pain in the site of injection and fatigue. Adverse events appeared more in the high dose group than in the medium dose group. Most of the adverse events reported as mild (grade 1), only 1 case (hypersensitive) was grade 3. No serious adverse event reported in the phase 1 clinical trial. Phase 2 Clinical Study in China Phase 2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in China involved 350 participants. In overall, total subjects reported adverse events in the 0-14 day regimen were 37%. 31.6% of them were related to the intervention (33.33% in the medium-dose group, 35.00% in the high-dose group and 21.67% the placebo group). In the 0-28 day regimen, the overall subjects reported adverse events were 27.67% and 19% of them were related to the intervention (19.00% in the medium-dose group, 19.17% in the high-dose group and 18.33% the placebo group). Table 1. Incidence of AE after vaccination for emergency schedule (0-14 day) in phase II EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 5 Phase 3 Clinical Study in Indonesia Phase 3 clinical study in Indonesia involved 1620 participants in total. Overall 71.5 participants reported adverse events in all group in this study and appeared similar in the vaccine group and in the placebo group (71,6% vs 71,1%). Table 2. Incidence of AE After First and Second Vaccination Local reactions reported after first and second vaccination in both vaccine and placebo groups were local pain, redness, induration and swelling. Systemic events reported after first and second vaccination in both vaccine and placebo groups were myalgia, fatigue and fever. Table 3. Comparison of Adverse Events between Vaccine and Placebo Group Most of all adverse events reported as mild to moderate (grade 1 and 2). Adverse events grade 3 was reported less in vaccine group than in placebo group (7.4% vs 13.3%). Local reactions grade 3 reported in the vaccine group after first and second injections were local pain (1.0%) and swelling (0.3%). Systemic adverse events grade 3 reported in the vaccine group after first and second EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 6 injections were fever (1.5%), myalgia (1.0%) and fatigue (0.7%). Adverse events un-solicited grade 3 were un-common reported in the vaccine group. AE un-solicited grade 3 reported until 7 days after injections were rhinitis (0.3%), pharyngitis (0.2%), (0.3%) and pyrexia (0.3%). No serious adverse events related to the vaccination reported in this study. Clinical Phase 3 Study in Turkey According to the data per 23 December 2020, safety analysis were conducted in 2964 subjects, where among them there were 593 subjects reported 1049 adverse events. Overall, CoronaVac showed good safety profile. Safety analysis for 7 days after first vaccination showed the local adverse events of CoronaVac were similar with placebo (9,45% vs 8,39%) and systemic adverse events less than in placebo (61.86% vs 75.16%). The most frequent systemic AE reported 7 days after first vaccination were fatigue (4.7%) and headache (3.9%). Local adverse events reported after second vaccination were also similar between vaccine group and placebo (0.98% vs 0.60%). The most frequent systemic adverse events after second vaccination were fatigue (2.5%) dan headache (2.3%). Adverse events reported for both local and systemic were mild and moderate (grade 1 and 2). Local AE grade 3 reported after first vaccination were local pain which was reported by 1 subject in vaccine and placebo group. No local AE reported after second vaccination. Systemic adverse events reported after first and second vaccination were headache (2 in vaccine group and 1 in placebo group), myalgia (1 in vaccine group), COVID symptoms (in placebo group), allergic reaction (1 in vaccine group) and hypertension (1 in placebo group). One case of serious adverse event is likely to be related to vaccination, which was allergy and the subject has recovered. Table 4. Comparison of Adverse Events between Vaccine and Placebo Group after First and Second Dose Phase 3 Clinical Study in Brazil Safety report from phase 3 clinical study in Brazil received were from 7913 participants, nevertheless. Safety analysis conducted were overall and no comparison analysis between vaccine and placebo yet provided. Total, there were 6803 (87.9%) participants reported adverse events 7 days after first vaccination, which consisted of 5,200 participants reported solicited local AE (1606; 20.29% 20.7% participants). The most frequent solicited local AE reported after first injection was local pain and for solicited systemic AE EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 7 were headache, fatigue, diarrhe and Un-solicited local oropharyngeal (1%), and Rhinorrhoea (2.4%). The adverse events reported 7 days after first dose mostly as mild to moderate (grade 1 and 2). Totally. there were 2,722 (63.1%) participants who received 2 doses reported AEs after 7 days, in which consists of 2130 (27,25%) participants reported solicited local AE 20.7% participants). The most frequent solicited local AE reported after second injection was local pain (18.6%) and for solicited systemic AE were headache (11.4%), oropharyngeal (0.6%). The adverse events reported 7 days after second dose mostly as mild to moderate (grade 1 and 2). Safety in Elderly Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in China involving total of 421 subjects received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo in the phase I/II clinical trial. According to the observation until 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the combined results of Phase I and Phase II showed that the incidence rates of adverse reactions in low dosage (300 SU) group, medium dosage (600 SU) group, high dosage (1200 SU) group, and placebo group were 20.00%, 20.00%, 21.95% and 20.55%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence rate of the overall adverse events among three group (P=0.8148). The incidence rate of vaccination-related adverse events (adverse reactions) was 20.67% (87/421), in which the low dosage group, medium dosage group, high dosage and placebo group were 20.00% (20/100), 20.00% (25/125), 21.95% (27/123) and 20.55% (15/73), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence rate of the overall adverse reactions among three group (P=0.9810). Table 5. Overall Condition of AEs in Subjects after Vaccination of Phase 1 & 2 Clinical Studies All adverse reactions were mild and moderate. No grade 3 (severe) adverse reactions occurred. Adverse reactions mainly occurred 0-7 days after vaccination. The incidence of adverse reactions after the first and second doses of the low-dose and high-dose groups was similar, and the incidence of adverse reactions after the first dose of the medium-dose group and the placebo group EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 8 were slightly higher than the second dose, there is no obvious trend of increasing or decreasing adverse reactions with the increase of doses. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms, with the incidence rates of 11.00%, 11.20%, 8.94% and 4.11%, respectively. The other adverse reactions by preferred term were reported in less than 5%. The headache and mucocutaneous eruption in high dosage group were slightly higher than that in other three groups. The incidence of hypoesthesia in the placebo group was slightly higher than that of the other three groups, and the differences in other symptoms were not statistically significant. Interm analysis of the Phase 3 clinical study in Brazil (cut-off date 21 December 2020) involving 600 elderly with age of 60 years and above (age between 60 to 84 years) who received 2 doses of CoronaVac showed the vaccine were well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacodynamic properties Mechanism of action SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated developed by Sinovac Life Sciences Co. Ltd., can induce active immunity and prevent diseases caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus by producing neutralizing antibody. Preclinical Studies Acute toxicity studies conducted on mice and rats showed no toxicity reaction was observed at dose of 1200 SU. The maximum tolerable dose is 1200 SU/animal. Sub-acute toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that administration of the vaccine doses at 300 SU/injection and 1200 SU/injection did not cause toxicity. Muscle irritation test studies in rabbits showed that administration of the vaccine doses at 1200 SU/injection did not cause irritation reactions and significant pathophysiological changes at the injection site. Systemic anaphylaxis studies showed that vaccine doses at 120 SU, 240 SU, 1200 SU and 2400 SU did not cause anaphylaxis reactions in guinea pigs. CLINICAL STUDIES Immunogenicity Phase 1 study of adult subjects in China Immunogenicity analysis in Phase 1 clinical studies was carried out for 2 types of regimens, emergency regimen (0-14 days) and the routine regimen (0-28 days), as well as 2 different doses, the medium dose (600 SU-proposed dose) and the High-dose (1200 SU). The results of IgG immunogenicity observations 6 months after administration of the second dose of the emergency regimen (0-14 days) showed a decrease in the percentage of seropositive rate in both the group receiving the medium dose (from 87.50% to 33.33%) and the group receiving the high dose. (from EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 9 100% to 70.83%). The results of IgG immunogenicity observations 6 months after administration of the second dose of routine regimen (0-28 days) showed a decrease in the percentage of seropositive rate in both the group receiving the medium dose (from 100% to 62.50%) and the group receiving the high dose (from 100% to 79.17%). The results of IgM immunogenicity observations 6 months after administration of the second dose of the emergency regimen (0-14 days) showed a decrease in the percentage of seropositive rate in both the group receiving the medium dose (from 12.5% to 0%) and the group receiving the high dose (from 20.83% to 8.33%). IgM data on routine regimens (0-28 days) also showed a reduction profile as in the emergency regimen both at medium dose and high dose, where the seropositive rate fell from 20.83% to 4.17 at 6 months after the second dose. Phase 2 study of adult subjects in China In the emergency regimen (0-14 days), the NAb value after 28 days of both medium dose and high dose were 94.07% and 99.15%, respectively. The seropositive rate for the IgG test after 6 months of the second dose of medium dose was 77.97% and for IgM was 1.69%. Immunogenicity in Elderly Immunogenicity in elderly was evaluated in the phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in China which involving 72 subjects and 350 subjects, respectively. These were conducted in the seronegative subjects. Only one subject of phase 2 was positive for neutralizing antibody before vaccination according the seropositive threshold of 1:8. In phase 1 study, the seroconversion rates (1:8) in medium dosage group, high dosage group and placebo group were 100.00%, 95.65% and 0.00% respectively 28 days after the whole-schedule vaccination. Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) were 54.9, 64.4 and 2.0, and Geometric Mean Increase (GMIs) were 27.5, 32.2 and 1.0, respectively. In phase 2 study, the seroconversion rates (1:8) in low dosage group, medium dosage group, high dosage group and placebo group were 90.72%, 97.96%, 98.98% and 0.00% respectively 28 days after the whole-schedule vaccination. GMTs were 23.4, 42.2, 49.9 and 2.1, and GMIs were 11.7, 20.9, 24.2 and 1.0, respectively. Phase 3 study of adult subjects in Indonesia The study aimed to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of SARS-COV2 vaccine compared to placebo. The study design was a phase 3 clinical, RCT, observer blind, placebo- controlled study. A total of 1620 subjects participated in the study with inclusion criteria of healthy subjects aged 18-59 years. The results of the IgG antibody test at 3 months after the second dose showed seropositive rate was 99.23%. The GMT value at 3 months after the second dose (1605.90), decrease 3.2 times compared to 14 days after the second dose (5181.19). The results of the antibody neutralization (NAb) test at 3 months after the second dose showed the percentage of the seropositive rate from 95.72% to 83.85%. The GMT value at 3 months after the second dose fell 2.2x (from 15.76 to 7.12) compared to 14 days after the second dose. EUA-CoronaVac Health Care Provider Fact Sheet, Approved version date 05/02/2021, BPOM, ID EREG10040912100012 10 Efficacy Efficacy of CoronaVac was evaluated according to the interim analysis of 3 phase 3 clinical studies conducted in Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. The 3 clinical studies are continuing for follow-up. According to interim analysis of the phase 3 clinical study in Indonesia (cut-off date 8 January 2021) which involved 1,620 adult participants with age between 18 -59 years, the assessment of the efficacy of 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection compared to placebo, measured based on symptomatic cases confirmed by RT-PCR testing ranging from 14 days to 6 months after the second dose. The interim analysis of efficacy conducted based on the cut-off date of 8 January 2021 with a total of 25 cases of COVID--19 (as specified in the protocol for the minimum cases target to show VE 60% up to 90 days after the second injection) is 65.3%. The 25 cases consist of 7 cases in the vaccine group and 18 cases in the placebo group. The duration of observation for the calculation of this efficacy analysis is based on observations of up to 90 days (3 months), where in line with the efficacy observation criteria outlined by WHO for COVID-19 vaccines. From the 25 cases occurred, no severe, critical or death cases due to COVID-19 reported. According to the interim analysis of the phase 3 clinical trial in Turkey (cut-off date 23 December 2020) which involved 13,000 adult participants with age between 18 and 59 years, the efficacy of CoronaVac vaccine was evaluated from 29 cases of COVID-19. The phase 3 clinical study in Turkey showed the vaccine efficacy was 91.25% (29 cases: 3 cases from vaccine group and 26 cases from placebo group) in the population aged 18-59 years, calculated based on the cut-off date of December 25, 2020 with a total of 29 cases of COVID19 (out of a target of 40 cases) from 1,322 participants. A phase 3 clinical study conducted in Brazil which involved total approximately 13,060 participants (cut-off 9 January 2021). According to the information received, the vaccine efficacy of 78% (218 cases, 58 cases from vaccine group and 160 cases from placebo group) in a population 18 years. The COVID-19 cases occurred were all reported as mild cases. STORAGE CONDITIONS Do not re-use or save un-used of CoronaVac vaccine. This product contains no preservative.
