Introduction Transforming growth factor-\u00df (TGF) is a cytokine playing multiple roles in organogenesis. [1](#ref-1) These roles are highly context dependent, and TGF therefore appears to induce opposite effects in different situations. [2](#ref-2) In the context of cancer, TGF exerts tumor-suppressive functions in the premalignant stage, by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors or triggering apoptosis. [1 3-5](#ref-1) However, at later stages of carcinogenesis, progressing tumors\u2014melanomas in particular\u2014become resistant to anti-proliferative effects of TGF, which then favors tumor progression by promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasiveness, dissemination and immunosuppression. [5 6](#ref-5) In carcinomas, TGF can trigger epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in invasive tumors prone to metastases. [5](#ref-5) These observations have prompted significant interest in TGF as a drug target for cancer therapy. [7](#ref-7) This interest was further reinforced by the recent success of cancer immunotherapy, and trials are underway to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by blocking the immunosuppressive effects of TGF. [6](#ref-6) Despite concerns related to the tumor-suppressive function of TGF in the premalignant stage, initial clinical trials with TGF-blocking therapy did not show an increased incidence of new tumors in patients with cancer, other than occasional benign skin tumors known as keratoacanthomas. [8 9](#ref-8) More concern was raised, however, by preclinical studies showing severe cardiac valvulopathies in mice, rats and dogs, after small molecule-mediated TGF type I receptor kinase ALK5 inhibition or after blockade of all three isoforms. [2 10 11](#ref-2) and TGF3. [2 7 12](#ref-2) Although they signal through the same receptor, they are encoded by distinct genes and have distinct expression patterns, suggesting different functions depending on the tissue and developmental stage, [13](#ref-13) as confirmed by the different phenotypes of knockout mice. [14-18](#ref-14) While TGF1 knockout mice display a severe inflammatory phenotype, [14 15](#ref-14) TGF2 knockout mice display a range of developmental phenotypes including congenital heart defects, [17](#ref-17) and TGF3 knockout mice show perinatal lethality with severe cleft palate and craniofacial defects. [18](#ref-18) These observations suggested that the cardiac liability of TGF-blocking therapy might be caused by inhibition of TGF2 and TGF3 more than TGF1. This was further supported by observations in humans of loss-of-function TGF2 or TGF3 mutations in patients with cardiovascular aneurysm [24](#ref-24) Because TGF1 is the most prevalent isoform expressed in many human tumors, [12](#ref-12) it appeared that specific blockade of TGF1 might provide the desired anti-tumor effects without the cardiovascular toxicity associated with blockade of TGF2 and TGF3. Because the three isoforms use the same receptor, this cannot be achieved with small molecule inhibitors of the kinase activity of the receptor. However, this is possible with isoform-specific neutralizing antibodies, and a recent report by Martin et al demonstrated in preclinical tumor models the anti-tumor efficacy of a new TGF1-specific mAb administered in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. [12](#ref-12) The report suggested that TGF1 blockade could overcome primary resistance of human tumors to checkpoint inhibitors, which has been associated with a TGF signature. [25 26](#ref-25) Whether TGF1-specific inhibition can also exert anti-tumor effects in association with other forms of immunotherapy or independent from immunotherapy is not known. TGF is produced as a fragment trapped in the latency-associated peptide in a homodimeric product known as latent TGF, which requires activation to release the active dimeric fragment known as mature TGF. [27](#ref-27) This activation involves a dynamic interaction with one of several molecular partners that are either bound to the extracellular matrix (ECM), like LTBP1 and LTBP3, or expressed at the surface of the TGF-producing cell, such as GARP and LRRC33 on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages, respectively. [27-29](#ref-27) The TGF1-selective mAb described by Martin et al recognizes latent, but not mature TGF1 [12](#ref-12). We previously described an autovaccination approach to generate anti-cytokine antibodies in mice. [30](#ref-30) We used this approach to produce monoclonal antibodies recognizing selectively mature TGF1 or TGF3. In this report, we evaluated their efficacy in two different preclinical cancer models. We observed a synergistic effect of the anti-TGF1 with a prophylactic cancer vaccine in the CT26 colon carcinoma model. More importantly, we also observed therapeutic efficacy of the anti-TGF1 antibody as a monotherapy in an autochthonous model of melanoma, in which it prevented tumor progression by blocking EMT induction. Our results support further development of anti-TGF1 antibodies for cancer therapy in various settings. Materials and methods CT26 cancer vaccine model BALB/c mice, female and male, aged 14-16 weeks, were either immunized by injection of 1\u00d7105 irradiated (250 Gy) CT26CL1 (CT26 colon carcinoma clone 1) cells subcutaneously (s.c.) or left unvaccinated. Some mice were treated with 200 \u00b5g of different anti-TGF mouse novel IgG1 mAb specific for TGF3) obtained by the vaccination protocol described in [30](#ref-30) or isotype-matched control IgG1 (MOPC-21, BioXcell) at the time of vaccine and tumor challenge, and continued with 100 \u00b5g three times a week starting at the time of vaccination and continued until the end of the experiment. All mAbs were purified from hybridoma cultures on Protein G columns (GE Healthcare, Belgium) and depleted of detectable lipopolysaccharide contamination by chromatography on Sartobind Q anion exchange cartridges (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). Three weeks after vaccine administration, 1\u00d7106 CT26CL1 tumor cells were injected s.c. Additionally, some mice were treated with 67 \u00b5g or 40 \u00b5g of either 1D11 or 13A1 at the time of vaccine and tumor challenge, and continued with 33 \u00b5g or 20 \u00b5g three times a week starting at the time of vaccination. Every 3 days the mice were monitored and tumor volume was evaluated with formula: volume=length\u00d7width2/2. Mice were killed when the tumor volume reached 1300 mm3, and tumors were harvested for analysis. TiRP autochthonous melanoma model TiRP-10B;Ink4a/ARFflox/flox mice on a previously described. [32 33](#ref-32) Negative TiRP-10B;Ink4a/ARFflox/flox mice (TiRP-10B/) were selected by crossing TiRP-10B;Ink4a/ARFflox/flox mice and selecting pups that were positive for Ink4a/ARFflox/flox and negative for the TiRP transgene. TCRP1A transgenic mice, which express the TCR-recognizing peptide by H-2Ld, were kept on B10.D2.Rag1KO background. [33 34](#ref-33) Mice used were 4-5 weeks old. All mice were produced under specific pathogen-free conditions at the LAF animal facility of the de Duve Institute. Handling of the mice and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with national and institutional guidelines for animal care. All the rules concerning animal welfare were respected according to the 2010/63/EU Directive. 4OH-Tamoxifen tumor induction in TiRP mice A fresh solution of 4OH-Tamoxifen was prepared by dissolving 4OH-Tamoxifen (Sigma Aldrich) in ethanol and mineral oil (Biorad) at the ratio of 1:9 followed by sonication (from a minimum of 30 min to a maximum of 1 hour), and injected two times s.c. (4 mg/200 \u00b5L) in the neck area of anesthetized TiRP mice 2 weeks apart. Tumor volume (in mm3) was calculated by the following formula: volume=length\u00d7width2/2. For occasional mice that developed more than one tumor, we only considered the tumor that appeared first. Mice were euthanized when tumor volume reached 2000 mm3. Tumor dissociation and SmartFlare Mela and Amela tumors (collected at end point) were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated in IMDM containing Collagenase I (100 U/mL) U/mL) and Dispase (100 U/mL), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The reaction was blocked by addition of IMDM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the suspension then filtered with a 70 \u00b5m mesh, spun and washed two times with complete medium. Cell suspension was depleted of CD45+, F4/80+, Gr-1+, CD3+, CD19+, CD31+ and CD45R+ cells by magnetic sorting, and the flow through (enriched in tumor cells) was incubated with a P1A-mRNA-Cy5 SmartFlare probe, which was designed corresponding to position 367-667 of the P1A exon 1 (sequence: AGAAATTCTGCCTTATCTAGGGTGGCTGGTCTTCGCTGTTGTCACAACAAGTTTTCTGGCGCTCCAGATGTTCATAGACGCCCTTTATGAGGAGCAGTATGAAAGGGATGTGGCCTGGATAGCCAGGCAAAGCAAGCGCATGTCCTCTGTCGATGAGGATGAAGACGATGAGGATGATGAGGATGACTACTACGACGACGAGGACGACGACGACGATGCCTTCTATGATGATGAGGATGATGAGGAAGAAGAATTGGAGAACCTGATGGATGATGAATCAGAAGATGAGGCCGAAGAAGAG) (Merck Millipore). Positive (18s-mRNA-Cy5) and (scramble-mRNA-Cy5) control probes were used (Merck Millipore). Then 2\u00d7105 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and 180 pM of reconstituted probe were added to IMDM medium containing 20% FBS and no antibiotics. The cells were incubated for 12 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 followed by FACS analysis. The P1A+ and P1A fractions were purified by sorting on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences), verified by staining with P1A-specific antibody 102B3 (see below) and analyzed by RT-qPCR for the expression of TGF isoforms, EMT-associated genes, ECM and melanocyte differentiation and pigmentation genes. Viruses and vaccine Adeno.Ii.P1At and SFV-P1A viruses were generated and maintained as described. [35](#ref-35) TiRP mice were immunized against P1A tumor antigen by a heterologous prime-boost regimen consisting of a first injection of an Adeno.Ii.P1At (108 PFU/mouse/100 \u00b5L) followed, 15 days later, by SFV.P1A (107 IU/mouse/100 \u00b5L). Both viruses were given intradermally (i.d.). In some experiments, TiRP mice received 0.5 of either control beginning at day 7 post-first injection of 4OH-Tamoxifen and continuing once a week to the end of the study. Flow cytometry Fluorescently to Foxp3-PE (clone 3G3) and dye efluor780 were of Foxp3 (eBioscience, #A25865A) following manufacturer's used to monitor apoptosis. H-2Ld/P1A35-43 tetramers previously described. [36](#ref-36) mAb (clone 102B3) coupled to ovalbumin. Hybridoma clone 102B3 was selected based on the production of an IgG1 that recognized P1A specifically when used for Western blot, flow cytometry and ELISA (see antibody validation on [online supplemental figure S3](#DC1)). Intracellular staining of performed using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) following manufacturer's instructions with minimal changes. Briefly, after fixation and permeabilization, the cells were incubated 1 hour at 4\u00b0C with the antibody to P1A. Data acquisition was performed using FACS Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) flow cytometers and analyzed by using FlowJo (Tree Star). Sorted cells were isolated by FACSAria. Supplemental material Cell lines P511 is an azaguanine-resistant variant of P815 and P1.204 is a P815AB-negative variant, carrying a deletion of gene P1A (official gene name Trap1a). [37](#ref-37) L1210.P1A.B7-1 cells were obtained by transfection of L1210.P1A the murine B7-1 cDNA cloned into plasmid pEFBOS. maintained at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO2. Unless otherwise specified, all culture media 10% FBS supplemented with L-Arginine (0.55 mM, Merck), L-asparagine Merck), Glutamine (1.5 mM, Merck), beta-mercaptoethanol (50 \u00b5M, Sigma), 50 U mL1 penicillin and 50 mg mL1 streptomycin (Life Technologies). Melanoma cells T429.11 were derived from an Amela TiRP tumor. [33](#ref-33) Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. Primary melanoma cell line Xni-5 was established from a Mela TiRP tumor, using -irradiated mouse keratinocytes (XB-2 line obtained from ATCC) as feeder cells, and was grown in culture medium 10% supplemented with nM, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA). Freshly irradiated keratinocytes were added in the co-culture every week up to passage 3 (3 weeks after initial plating). TCRP1A CD8+ T-cell purification and activation P1A-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleens and lymph of TCRP1A mice [34](#ref-34) using anti-CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), and stimulated in vitro by co-culture for 4 days with irradiated (100 Gy) L1210.P1A.B7-1 cells (104 of each cell type per well in 48-well plates) in IMDM 10% FBS. Purification of myeloid-derived suppressor cells After mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of induced TiRP tumors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (as a mix of monocytic and granulocytic cells) were purified by magnetic sorting. Briefly, CD11b+ cells were isolated using magnetic microbeads conjugated with monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD11b antibody. Depending on the experiment, MDSC isolation was carried out by either biotinylated Ly6G and Gr-1 mAbs together or alone, with anti-biotin-coated streptavidin-coated microbeads. All separations were performed using Miltenyi Biotec kits and MidiMacs columns. Purity of cell populations was evaluated by flow cytometry. Assay for MDSC-mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation and killing activity TCRP1A CD8+ T cells activated in vitro for 4 days with irradiated L1210.P1A.B7-1 cells were purified, washed, counted and 100 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7105 viable cells seeded in a 96-well plate in IMDM+10% FBS. MDSCs from induced tumors were isolated and purified as above. TCRP1A CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with MDSCs at a ratio of 3, 6, 9 or 12 for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. TCRP1A T cells were then purified using anti-CD8 microbeads. Their proliferation was assessed in an 18-hour assay. TCRP1A CD8+ T cells co-cultured with MDSC for 3 days as above and purified using anti-CD8 microbeads were tested for cytolytic activity in a standard 4-hour chromium release assay, using P511 cells as P1A-positive target cells and P1A-negative cells P1.204 as cold target competitors. Treg purification and suppressive assay CD4+ CD25+ cells were obtained from TiRP tumors by cell sorting, using a FACSAria. To measure the in vitro suppressive activity, CD8+ T cells isolated from TCRP1A mice were stimulated for 4 days with L1210.P1A.B7-1, as mentioned before. After 4 days, CD4+ CD25+ sorted cells were added at a ratio of 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:18 (1 Treg to 2, 4, 8 or 18 T responder, respectively). For some experiments (CT26 mouse model) the ratio used was 1:3. The culture was then kept for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. 3H-thymidine (1 \u00b5Ci/96 well) was added to cultures in the last 18 hours and cell proliferation was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Western blotting Cells or tissues were lysed in a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher). Proteins were quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher), and 30 \u00b5g of total proteins (cells) or 100 \u00b5g (tissues) were separated on precast NuPage gradient 4%-12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher) in MOPS running buffer. Transfer of the proteins into nitrocellulose membrane was done with the iBlot (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked in tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% dry milk, and then probed with primary antibodies against N-cadherin (Cell non-fat dry milk in TBST. Secondary antibodies were incubated 1 hour at room temperature before revelation with the West Pico SuperSignal (Thermo Fisher). Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked IgG (Cell and goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz, and immunohistochemistry Snap-frozen, optimal cutting temperature medium-embedded were cut (7 \u00b5m) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, then incubated for 1 hour with TBS containing 2.5% normal goat serum+1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) TBST 2% (0.5 \u00b5g/mL in TBST Cell Signaling) 2 hours. After washing, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the slides with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min. Secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated were then added for 1 hour in TBST 1% BSA. AEC chromogen (DAKO) was used and revelation reaction was stopped after 5 min, 10 min and 5 min, respectively. Counterstain with hematoxylin (Sigma) was performed. Slides were scanned using MIRAX digital microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging), and images analyzed with MIRAX Viewer software (Zeiss). RNA extraction and RT-qPCR RNA was extracted from FACS-sorted cell populations using TRIPURE reagent (Roche). One microgram of total RNA was used to generate cDNA using the revertAid (Thermo Fisher). RT-qPCR was performed using Takyon Rox probe core kit were performed using an elongation condition of 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Probe and primers were purchased ELISA on Maxisorb immunoplates (Nunc, Roskild, Denmark), coated overnight \u00b5L human TGF1, TGF2 or TGF3 (R&D Systems) or control BSA (100 ng/mL in 50 mM glycine buffer, pH 9). After saturation (100 \u00b5L BSA 1% for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C) and washing, the antibodies were added at different concentrations and further incubated for 2 hours. Bound antibodies were detected by addition of HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (BD Pharmingen) followed after 1-hour Ultra-TMB substrate. Absorbance was acquired at 450 nm. Transformed mink lung epithelial cell assay TGF activity was measured using TMLEC reporter cells (transformed mink lung epithelial cells), as described by Uyttenhove et al. [30](#ref-30) Briefly, 5 ng/mL human TGF1, or anti-panTGF 1D11 for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. These solutions were then mixed with an equal volume of culture medium (DMEM+10% fetal calf serum), containing 50,000 TMLECs that had been seeded for 4 hours. After a further 24-hour incubation, luciferase activity was measured with the Bio-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Determination of melanin content Xni-5 cells were treated with anti-TGF1 13A1 antibody at the dose of 100 ng/mL, 30 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, or corresponding amount of isotype control (IgG1). The cultured media were replaced every week, at the time of cell passage. To evaluate the melanin content, 106 Xni-5 cells were treated with a solution of 1N NaOH in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 80\u00b0C. Then, 200 \u00b5L of cell supernatant were transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Synthetic melanin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard, starting from 1 mg/mL in DMSO. Results TGF1-specific and TGF3-specific monoclonal antibodies By immunizing mice with human mature TGF1-ovalbumin or TGF3-ovalbumin conjugates, we produced mAb 13A1 and TGF activity assay, and mAb 13A1 was slightly more but not latent TGF1, as the latter was unable to inhibit binding of 13A1 to the former ( [figure 1C](#F1)). We then used two different tumor models to test the therapeutic efficacy of these isoform-specific mAbs in comparison with mAb prophylactic vaccination in the CT26 model We first used the CT26 colon carcinoma model, in which neutralization of all TGF isoforms using mAb 1D11 was previously shown to synergize with immunotherapy based on prophylactic vaccination with irradiated cells. [41](#ref-41) We injected anti-TGF antibodies three times a week and challenged mice with CT26 tumor cells 3 weeks after vaccination ( [figure 2](#F2)). We confirmed the increased survival of mice receiving the vaccine combined with 1D11, as compared with either treatment alone ( [figure 2B](#F2)). [41](#ref-41) Interestingly, this synergistic effect TGF1-specific neutralizing mAb 13A1 ( [figure 2B](#F2)). However, receiving the TGF3-specific mAb 1901 ( [figure 2B](#F2)). The protection was associated with an increased infiltration of tumors with activated CD8 T cells expressing activation and effector memory markers and lacking expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 ( [figure 2C](#F2)). This lack of PD-1 expression was in line with the recent demonstration that TGF1 contributed to the induction of PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. [42](#ref-42) In contrast, TGF3 neutralization reduced infiltration and activation of CD8 T cells in tumors and increased their PD-1 expression ( [figure 2C](#F2)). Tumors from mice receiving 13A1 or 1D11 also contained lower numbers of Tregs, which displayed a reduced suppressive activity ( [online supplemental figure S1A,B](#DC1)), and diminished suppressive activity ( [online supplemental figure S1C,D](#DC1)). These results confirmed the immunosuppressive role of TGF\u00df1 in the CT26 model [43 44](#ref-43) and indicated that neutralization of TGF1, but not TGF3, potentiated immunotherapy in this model in a similar fashion to neutralization of all three TGF isoforms. We then compared the relative efficacy of 13A1 and 1D11 in potentiating immunotherapy in the CT26 model by repeating the above experiment while titrating down the amount of antibody injected into the mice ( [online supplemental figure S2A](#DC1)). We compared a high (100 \u00b5g), medium (33 \u00b5g) and low dose (20 \u00b5g) of antibody. In each case a double dose was given at the first injection. We monitored tumor volume and mouse survival ( [online supplemental figure S2B](#DC1)). The anti-tumor effect of 1D11 was observed at the high dose but was lost at the medium dose. In contrast, 13A1 was still fully effective at the medium dose. Accordingly, increased tumor infiltration with activated effector memory CD8 was observed with the medium dose of 13A1 but not with the medium dose of 1D11 ( [online supplemental figure S2C](#DC1)). These results indicate that the TGF1-specific mAb 13A1 is about three times more potent than the anti-panTGF mAb 1D11 in neutralizing TGF in this model Cellular origin of TGF isoforms in TiRP melanomas We then studied the TiRP model of autochthonous melanoma, which is characterized by a strong TGF signature and primary resistance to all forms of immunotherapy. [32 33](#ref-32) In this model, subcutaneous injection of tamoxifen triggers the development of melanomas that express murine MAGE-type antigen P1A and initially develop as black (Mela) tumors, showing a clear MITF-dependent gene signature with no signs of inflammation and a well-defined melanocyte-like morphology. [45](#ref-45) On further tumor progression, Mela tumors de-differentiate into white (Amela) tumors, in which the decrease of melanocyte-differentiation genes (MITF, Tyr, TRP1, TRP2) is correlated with the acquisition of a de-differentiated state, characterized by pronounced TGF and EMT-like signatures. [46](#ref-46) Amela tumors also show signs of pathological inflammation, with a tumor microenvironment (TME) highly enriched in MDSCs that contribute to a severe immunosuppression. [32 33](#ref-32) Contrary to the CT26 model, the role played by TGF in this model has not been characterized. As a first step, we defined the cellular source of TGF, by separating TiRP tumor cells from stromal cells on the basis of tumor-specific P1A expression, and measuring TGF production. We used a fluorochrome-labeled P1A-mRNA SmartFlare probe, which does not require permeabilization and therefore maintains RNA integrity, to sort cells based on P1A expression ( [figure 3A](#F3)). We validated the sorted cells using a novel P1A-specific mAb that we obtained by immunizing P1AKO mice 102B3, proved specific when tested in Western blot and FACS ( [online supplemental figure S3A-C](#DC1)). We then extracted RNA and compared transcripts of P1A-positive tumor cells and P1A-negative stromal cells. We found high levels of TGF1 transcripts in tumor cells, particularly in those isolated from Amela tumors ( [figure 3B](#F3)). In contrast, TGF3 was expressed at a much higher level in stromal cells. TGF2 expression was weak and confined to stromal cells. As expected, P1A-positive tumor cells from Mela but not Amela tumors expressed high levels of transcripts for pigmentation-related gene products M-MITF, tyrosinase, TRP-1 and TRP-2, while P1A-negative stromal cells ( [figure 3B](#F3)). We also confirmed the presence of an EMT-like signature in Amela tumors, with a higher expression of typical transcripts for Twist, Big-h3, vimentin and N-cadherin and a lower expression versus Mela tumors ( [figure 3B](#F3)). Notably, Zeb2, which is a typical EMT gene in epithelial cells, showed the opposite trend, with a lower expression in Amela. This is in line with the description of Zeb2 as a gene associated with a differentiated phenotype in the melanocyte lineage, being expressed in Zeb1-negative cells in a mutually exclusive fashion. [48](#ref-48) Although detected in both tumor cells and stromal cells, the EMT-like gene signature was more intense in tumor cells, particularly in Amela tumors. We conclude from those data that tumor cells represent the main cellular source of TGF1 in the TiRP model, while TGF3 mostly originates from non-hematopoietic stromal cells. Increased survival of TiRP tumor-bearing mice after TGF1 neutralization To determine the causative role of TGF in tumor progression and the related immunosuppression, we neutralized TGF by injecting TiRP mice weekly with anti-panTGF mAb 1D11, or with the isoform-specific antibodies described above. We observed a reduced tumor size and an increased survival after neutralization of all TGF isoforms or after neutralization of TGF1 but not after neutralization of TGF3 ( [figure 4A](#F4), left and middle panels). Unexpectedly, this anti-tumor effect was not linked to a release of the immunosuppressive effects of TGF, because it was also observed in mice that were depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells ( [figure 4B](#F4), left and middle panels). Likewise, no synergistic effect was observed with a prophylactic immunization of mice against tumor antigen P1A using an efficient vaccine platform [35](#ref-35) ( [figure 4C](#F4), left and middle panels, and [online supplemental figure S4](#DC1)). These results indicated that TGF1 exerted dominant protumoral effects in this model, which were mediated by tumor-intrinsic rather than immunosuppressive mechanisms. In line with this conclusion, TGF1 blockade neither increased the amount of tumor-specific T cells isolated from tumor and spleen ( [online supplemental figure S4A,B](#DC1)) nor their figure S4C](#DC1)). While monocytic MDSC reduced in the spleen, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), which play a prominent role in triggering apoptosis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in this model, [33](#ref-33) were not ( [online supplemental figure S4D](#DC1)). Levels of natural killer cells were also unaffected ( [online supplemental figure S4E](#DC1)). However, Treg numbers were decreased in both tumors and lymph nodes, and their T-cell suppressive activity was dampened, in line with the role of TGF in Treg differentiation and function ( [online supplemental figure [49 50](#ref-49) Despite these effects on M-MDSC and Tregs, the fact that the anti-tumor effects of TGF1 blockade were fully maintained in T-cell depleted mice indicates the presence of other dominant immunosuppressive mechanisms, so that only the tumor-intrinsic effect of TGF1 can affect tumor progression in this model. One possible immunosuppressive mechanism is the induction of TIL apoptosis by PMN-MDSC, [33](#ref-33) which are maintained TGF1 blockade ( [online supplemental figure S4D](#DC1)). Delayed EMT-like transition in tumors of TGF1-neutralized mice To understand the tumor-intrinsic effect of TGF1 in the progression of TiRP tumors, we considered that this progression was invariably linked to the EMT-like transition that converts indolent Mela tumors into aggressive Amela tumors. TGF is known as one of the factors that may trigger EMT. [51](#ref-51) It was therefore possible that the protumoral effect of TGF in this model was linked to the triggering of EMT, and that neutralizing TGF prevented or delayed the onset of EMT. To address this, we compared the kinetics of EMT in our cohorts of TiRP mice treated or not with TGF-neutralizing mAbs. We observed that the increased survival in treated mice correlated with a delayed transition from Mela to Amela tumors: while this transition was observed after 42 days in control mice, it only occurred after more than 112 days in mice neutralized for TGF1 or for all TGF isoforms right Identical effects of mAbs were observed in T-cell depleted or in immunized mice ( [figure 4B,C](#F4), right TGF3 neutralization did not delay transition ( [figure 4A-C](#F4)). We confirmed that the retarded transition from Mela to Amela tumors corresponded to delayed EMT by observing that tumors from mice treated with 13A1 or 1D11 showed reduced expression of EMT-related proteins such as N-cadherin, Twist, Snail1/2, figures S5A and S6](#DC1)). Expression of phospho-SMAD2 was also reduced in treated mice, confirming effective neutralization of TGF signaling ( [figure 5](#F5)). Of note, TGF1 neutralization did not affect the expression of the P1A tumor antigen ( [online supplemental figure S5B](#DC1)). To further explore this tumor-intrinsic effect of TGF, we established a pigmented primary melanoma line from a TiRP Mela tumor, and exposed it to anti-TGF1 mAb 13A1. We observed that this line spontaneously lost pigmentation after several weeks in culture, as measured by a drop in melanin content. Interestingly, this loss of pigmentation was largely prevented by TGF1 neutralization ( [online supplemental figure S7](#DC1)). This result confirmed not only the tumoral source of TGF1 but also its tumor intrinsic effect, whereby tumor cells themselves respond to TGF1 by initiating an EMT-like program entailing their depigmentation. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that TGF1 plays a causative role in EMT-like transition, and that TGF1 neutralization increased survival by preventing this transition and thereby delaying the Mela to Amela transition. Discussion Martin et al recently described a synergistic anti-tumor activity of TGF1-specific antibody with checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1 in preclinical models of bladder carcinoma, breast carcinoma and melanoma. [12](#ref-12) Selective neutralization of TGF1 increased tumor infiltration of T cells and reduced accumulation of tumor-suppressive myeloid cells. These effects recapitulated previous results obtained with anti-panTGF antibody 1D11. [26](#ref-26) Importantly, however, blocking TGF1 did not induce cardiac anomalies in a rat toxicology study, as opposed to blocking all TGF isoforms, suggesting a safer therapeutic index for TGF1-specific inhibitors as compared with panTGF inhibitors, including small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of TGF receptor type I ALK5. [12](#ref-12) Our results confirm and extend the interest of targeting TGF1 specifically for cancer therapy. We have compared anti-TGF1 and anti-TGF3 mAbs in two additional preclinical models, which address different aspects of the TGF role in tumor progression. In both models, we observed anti-tumor activity of anti-TGF1 but not anti-TGF3 mAbs. The first model is the colon carcinoma model CT26, in which TGF1 blockade potentiated the anti-tumor effect of prophylactic vaccination with irradiated cells. Because anti-TGF1 alone showed no effect in this model, the synergy with vaccination appeared immune mediated. In line with this conclusion, we observed increased infiltration of the tumors by CD8 T cells, which expressed more activation markers and less exhaustion markers. The lack of benefit of targeting TGF3 in this setting is in line with the findings of Terabe et al, who showed that blocking only TGF1 and TGF2 in different immunotherapy settings was as efficient as blocking all three TGF isoforms. [52](#ref-52) These results indicate the therapeutic potential of selective TGF1 blockade in combination with immunotherapy approaches beyond checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, our results in the autochthonous TiRP melanoma model highlight the therapeutic potential of TGF1 blockade also as a monotherapy, through a different mechanism of action that is not immune mediated. This melanoma model is characterized by a two-step progression mode, with tumors that are initially highly differentiated and slowly progressive (Mela) turning later into aggressive de-differentiated tumors (Amela). This transition is akin to EMT transition in epithelial tumors, and is associated with the appearance of abnormal inflammation and the accumulation of immunosuppressive MDSC in the TME. [33 46](#ref-33) Aggressive Amela tumors also feature a gene signature with a strong TGF component and several features of the IPRES signature, which was observed in human melanomas that resist to immunotherapy or targeted therapy. [25](#ref-25) Although the TGF signature of Amela TiRP tumors was described, [45 46](#ref-45) the cellular origin of TGF in this model and its pathogenic role have not been studied, particularly with regard to the different isoforms. By separating tumor cells from stromal cells of TiRP melanomas, we defined the cellular source of TGF1 as the tumor cells themselves, while TGF3 was produced by stromal cells. TGF2 was produced only in small amounts, mostly by stromal cells. We then observed that in vivo neutralization of all TGF isoforms increased survival of melanoma-bearing TiRP mice. Selective blockade of TGF1 similarly increased survival, while blockade of TGF3 did not. These results highlight the key role of TGF1 in this model. As mentioned above, Amela TiRP tumors are highly immunosuppressed. [33 45](#ref-33) Surprisingly however, the anti-tumor effect the TGF1 blockade was not immune mediated, because it was also observed in mice that were T-cell depleted, and it was not synergistic with specific cancer vaccination. This indicated that TGF1 blockade did not increase survival by releasing the immunosuppressive effects of TGF1, but rather in a tumor-intrinsic fashion. Of note, this does not mean that TGF1 has no immunosuppressive function in this model, but rather suggests the presence of other immunosuppressive mechanisms that are dominant, so that only the tumor-intrinsic effect of TGF1 blockade can be detected in these conditions. A likely dominant immunosuppressive mechanism is the apoptosis of TILs, which is induced by Fas-ligand-expressing MDSC, as we described previously in this model. [33](#ref-33) The tumor-intrinsic effect appears related to the EMT-like transition. Indeed, we observed a significant delay in the transition from Mela to Amela tumors in mice that received anti-TGF1 mAb. Because Amela tumors are highly invasive and responsible for the fatal outcome, this delay in appearance of the phenotype switch suffices to explain the increased survival of treated mice. These results indicate that the EMT-like transition is triggered by TGF1. The fact that it can be prevented by blocking TGF1 might be of great therapeutic interest, particularly in melanoma, where it could have anti-tumor effects as a monotherapy. Human melanomas produce high levels of TGF, and elevated TGF1 serum levels were found to be poor prognostic factors. [1 3-5 53](#ref-1) EMT-related genes contribute to the of the metastatic phenotype in human primary cutaneous melanomas, by supporting adhesive, invasive and migratory properties. [54](#ref-54) Moreover, human melanomas that resist targeted therapy or immunotherapy express the IPRES signature, which encompasses an EMT-like signature similar to the one we observed in the TiRP model. [25](#ref-25) Patients with melanoma could therefore benefit from TGF1-targeted therapy to prevent this EMT-like transition. It will be interesting to investigate whether carcinomas, including breast, pancreatic, lung, colorectal, hepatocellular and bladder carcinomas, which often depend on EMT for progression or metastasis could also benefit from selective neutralization of TGF1. [55](#ref-55) As discussed above, the TiRP model allowed us to identify the tumor-intrinsic effect of TGF1 blockade, because the immune-mediated effect of TGF1 blockade is blunted in this model by other dominant immunosuppressive mechanisms. In other tumors that are less immunosuppressed, including some human cancers, it is likely that the two different mechanisms of actions of TGF1 blockade, the tumor-intrinsic effect and the immune-mediated effect, could synergize to achieve even better therapeutic benefit. Among the various TGF-targeting therapies, our results, together with those of Martin et al, highlight the interest of strategies blocking specifically the TGF1 isoform, which plays a dominant role in both immunosuppressive and tumor-intrinsic protumoral mechanisms. Since all the therapeutic effect could be ascribed to blocking TGF1, the use of a TGF1-specific neutralizing mAb might limit the potential toxicity, particularly cardiac, as compared with panTGF neutralizing antibodies, such as fresolimumab, which is one of the most advanced anti-TGF mAbs in clinical development, [8](#ref-8) or with small molecules targeting the kinase activity of the ALK5 receptor, which is shared by all TGF isoforms. [56](#ref-56) Mice treated with mAb 13A1 did not show obvious toxicity. We did not perform histopathological examination searching for cardiac valvulopathy in these mice. Such toxicities are better detected in rats, and Martin et al demonstrated the absence of cardiac lesions in rats treated with their selective TGF1-neutralizing mAb, while cardiac valvulopathies were observed in all TGF highly selective for TGF1, mAb 13A1 is therefore expected not to induce cardiac toxicity, although this has not been formally tested. The antibody we used here recognized mature, but not latent TGF1. This is opposite to Martin et al, who developed an antibody that only recognized latent TGF1 and prevented its activation. [12](#ref-12) The only reason Martin et al opted to neutralize latent and not mature TGF1 is that they expected high difficulties in obtaining an isoform-specific mAb against mature TGF, because mature isoforms have high sequence and structural similarity, while the TGF prodomains show more sequence variability between isoforms. [12](#ref-12) We disproved this prediction by describing highly specific mAbs against mature TGF1 or TGF3. We did not try to obtain TGF2-specific mAb, because at the time of initiation of this research program we could not obtain recombinant TGF2 to immunize mice. From a clinical development standpoint, it is unclear which of mature or latent-specific anti-TGF1 mAb holds the most promise. In vitro assays showed similar IC50 for both antibodies, in the nanomolar range. Antibodies to mature TGF1 are expected to be directly active on any source of TGF1, whatever the activation mechanism, as opposed to antibodies to latent TGF1, which require validation in the various molecular contexts of TGF1 activation. This was done by Martin et al regarding four well-known activation pathways, involving LTBP1, LTPB3, GARP and not impossible that other TGF activation pathways remain to be described, which have not been tested. An important difference between latent and mature TGF1 is that the former is immobilized on the ECM or the cell surface through its interaction with LTPBs, GARP or LRRC33, while mature TGF1 is released. Latent TGF1 neutralization is therefore expected to have longer lasting effects as compared with mature TGF1 neutralization, for which removal of the mAb from the circulation allows TGF\u00df1 activation to resume. Although these longer term effects of latent TGF\u00df1 neutralization may be beneficial to maximize therapeutic efficacy, they may also reduce opportunities to quickly reduce TGF1 inhibition to manage potential side effects. A side-by-side comparison of the two types of TGF1-specific neutralizing antibodies could help determine their respective merits. In any case, the availability of TGF1-specific reagents opens new opportunities. In that respect mAb 13A1 represents a promising drug candidate for clinical development in combination with various forms of cancer immunotherapy, but also as a monotherapy in cancer types that rely on EMT for progression, including melanomas.
