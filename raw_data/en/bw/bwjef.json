AMY REYES Wellness Coach 3 Easy Yoga Poses to Calm the Mind & Emotions Feeling overwhelmed? Exercise is one of the best things you can do to bring things back into perspective. How does exercise reduce stress? In addition to boosting your circulation and mood, it also decreases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, while stimulating the production of feel-good chemicals like endorphins. Walking, running, swimming, stretching, hiking, biking, and aerobics are all great ways to get your body moving and stimulate endorphins. Yoga-the sister science of Ayurveda-is also one of the best stress-relieving exercises out there. Studies have shown that yoga is extremely beneficial at calming the mind, promoting relaxation, and improving your overall sense of well-being. Not to mention for toning the body and breath too. Take 5-10 minutes to get back in touch with your body and breath with these three easy Maharishi Yoga sanas.

Suggested foods THAT WILL HELP WITH STRESS As the old saying goes, you are what you eat. And in Ayurveda, certain foods are deemed especially valuable when it comes to managing stress. Generally speaking, it's beneficial to follow a whole foods diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fresh produce, and healthy fats like olive oil and ghee. When you're feeling especially stressed, keep these simple \"food for stress\" suggestions and recipes in mind. Pumpkin Seeds Pumpkin seeds contain tryptophan, which can help you sleep better at night. Try sprinkling some into your salads and saut\u00e9s. Whole Milk Rich in tryptophan and calcium, whole milk helps to regulate natural melatonin, which helps you sleep. Almonds Not only do almonds deliver a great shot of protein, almonds contain calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and other nutrients that support a healthy brain and better sleep. Foods and Stress: What to Avoid Did you know that certain foods can trigger your body's stress response? Just as following a whole foods diet can help you manage stress naturally, eating certain foods can exhaust and deplete your energy stores. You may not be surprised to learn the main culprits: caffeinated beverages and junk foods. Caffeinated Beverages Coffee, black tea, and other caffeinated beverages are okay for some people, but they're best avoided if you're feeling wound up and having trouble sleeping. Junk Food Sugary sweets and overly salted, fried, or processed foods deplete your energy. Instead, reach for healthy, whole-foods snacks and foods that fuel your mind and body. STRESS-BUSTING RECIPES Guest recipe by Laurina Carroll! Avocado on Bread Use homemade gluten-free bread, or store-bought bread or crackers. When I travel, I always have avocados in the car, or I carry them on the plane when I fly. I bring a spoon, some salt, and a lemon. Simple Mills makes great gluten-free almond crackers that I love when I don't have time to bake bread. You can add pesto, sauerkraut, or a pickle. If you prefer a sweeter taste, add sugarless organic jam and tahini or sunflower seed butter with avocado on bread. It's so delicious and nutritious. \u2014Laurina Carroll is a Transcendental Meditation teacher, Ayurveda Wellness Consultant, Speaker/Educator, and the author of Perfect Health for Busy People.

Eating quickly, or while standing or walking, can disrupt your digestion and lead to heartburn, acid indigestion, and other unpleasant issues. Whenever possible, take a mindful approach to eating. Sit comfortably and quietly in a settled environment, free from distractions (like books, TV, and electronic devices), and turn your attention to your meal. It's fine to enjoy some light conversation while you eat but try to avoid stressful topics. Your stomach will thank you!
