Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Canada. Data set: 392 chiropractic, naturopathic, homeopathic and acupuncture clinic websites located in 10 of thelargest metropolitan areas in Canada, as identifiedusing 400 Google search results. Duplicates were notexcluded from data analysis. Main outcome measures: Mention of allergy, sensitivity or asthma, claim of ability to diagnoseallergy, sensitivity or asthma, claim of ability to treatallergy, sensitivity or asthma, and claim of allergy,sensitivity or asthma treatment efficacy. Tests andtreatments promoted were noted as qualitativeexamples. Results: Naturopath clinic websites have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatmentor efficacy for allergy or sensitivity (85%) and asthma(64%), fromVancouver, British Columbia were most likely toadvertise at least one of diagnosis, treatment orefficacy for allergy or sensitivity (72.5%) and asthma(62.5%), and results from London, Ontario were leastlikely (50% and 40%, respectively). Of theinterventions advertised, few are scientificallysupported; the majority lack evidence of efficacy, andsome are potentially harmful. Conclusions: The majority of alternative healthcare clinics studied advertised interventions for allergy andasthma. Many offerings are unproven. A policyresponse may be warranted in order to safeguard thepublic interest. INTRODUCTION Complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) is popular in Canada. Governmentdata from 2008 indicate that over 70% ofCanadians use some form of CAM. 1In 2006, a study found that the most popular CAM providers in Canada were chiropractors (40% of Canadians use and homeopaths that in 2012 Americans spent $30.2 billion on CAM, with adults spending an average of $514 on CAM practitionervisits, supplements and self-care approaches. 3 CAM clinics are abundant in each major Canadian metropolitan centre and many of those clinics engage in advertising online.Strengths and limitations of this study The marketing claims of complementary and alternative medicine practitioners are understud-ied, and given the popularity of such practi-tioners, it is in the public interest to betterunderstand these claims. The public health burden caused by asthma andallergies is significant, and understanding the fre-quency and types of related interventions offeredby alternative practitioners can help to determinewhat public health benefit and/or harm accrues. Owing to the straightforward methods andmanner in which the relevant claims, services andproducts are represented on the studied websites,there was little need for coders to make subjective interpretations of website content; this increases the reliability of the results. Limitations of the study include a regionalrestriction to Canada, an English language bias,a restriction to studying only four types of alter-native practitioners, an inability to search image-based text on websites due to the use of auto-mated domain searches, an approach that doesnot allow more complex comparisons betweenjurisdictions with different regulatory frame-works, and an inability to measure the publicexposure of each website.

Downloaded from CAM practitioners are increasingly being framed as potential primary care providers.45The scope of condi- tions claimed to be treatable by CAM providers can be very broad, and interventions are often presented as sci- entically legitimate.6-8This has resulted in controversy over policy. In Australia, for example, misleading claims by chiropractors have resulted in widespread calls to dis- mantle the Chiropractic Board of Australia for its failure to police its members;9-12here in Canada, the ability of naturopaths to effectively self-regulate has recently been questioned.13 Claims by CAM providers as to the ability to diagnose and treat allergy and asthma are understudied. A 2011study found that allergy testing and treatment were the most common interventions advertised on Canadiannaturopath clinic websites. 7Allergy and asthma present a signi cant public health challenge in Canada.14 Allergies affect over a third of the present adolescentpopulation, 15 16and asthma affects about 10 -15% while being the most common chronic childhood conditionresulting in healthcare usage. 17Indeed, asthma in flicts a heavy economic burden of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per province per year, depending on the pro- vince.14Canadian data on the economic costs of allergy are somewhat lacking, but costs are almost certainly very high. In the USA, a 2013 study estimated the economic cost of childhood food allergy alone at $24.8 billion peryear. 18A similar 2014 study of all allergic diseases in the European Union estimated an annual cost of between\u20ac55 and \u20ac151 billion. 19Given the high public health burden of these conditions, it is important to ensure that effective, evidence-based interventions are systemat- ically offered to the public. The popular press and social media have contributed to widespread beliefs regarding the existence ofcommon sensitivities to foods like gluten, 20 21even though 'sensitivity 'is, from a clinical perspective, an undened and ambiguous term. Given the rising inci- dence and pro le of allergies and asthma,22it is no sur- prise that CAM practitioners have successfully catered to these conditions. Many online advertisements claim that chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists and homeo-paths can diagnose and treat allergy, sensitivity and asthma. Clinic websites present a valuable opportunity to investigate the frequency at which CAM providersengage in such advertisement, as well as the claims they make. In this study, we analysed the advertising content of 392 Canadian CAM clinic websites in order to deter-mine what kinds of claims were made about allergy and asthma and their frequency. METHODS In order to build a sample of CAM practitioners 'web- sites for analysis, the top 10 most populous Canadian metropolitan areas were selected according to 2015 data from Statistics Canada. Quebec City was excluded fromthe study due to an abundance of strictly Frenchlanguage clinic websites that would have caused coding issues. Google searches were then performed using the web tool ISearchFrom.com in order to emulate search-ing from each respective city, and to remove the geo- graphical search biases that would normally arise given the actual location of the searcher (Edmonton,Alberta). This tool also disabled Google' s personalised results functionality, ensuring generalisable ndings. Search terms were of the form (city practitioner), forexample, Toronto chiropractor, Calgary naturopath, Vancouver homeopath, Hamilton acupuncturist, etc. Search result websites were then collected. Given the 10 metropolitan areas, four disciplines and our commit-ment to nding the top 10 clinic results for each search, anal sample of 400 search results was collected between March and April of 2016. Only links to clinicsor practitioner websites were included (colleges and regulatory bodies were excluded). Advertisements wereexcluded. Google presented three Google Maps business results at the top of each search; results from these were included if they included a link to a clinic or practi-tioner website. Websites for practitioners or clinics from countries other than Canada were excluded, but Canadian clinic websites from cities other than thesearch city were included. Duplicate links to the same web domain were excluded in the same search, but were not excluded across different searches; this is becausethe study was designed to focus on what people are actu- ally exposed to when searching. Eight sets of website duplicates were found, meaning there were 392 uniquewebsites. Duplicates were counted twice in data analysis. Once the list of domains was collected, websites were analysed between April and June 2016, usingGoogle domain search to look for instances of the terms sensitivity, allergy and asthma. For example: allergy site: backinbalanceclinic.com. Google stemming technologyautomatically incudes instances of similar words to the search term: for example, allergic, allergen. Owing to the nature of the Google search analysis, unsearchabletext, such as text embedded in image form, was excluded. Results of domain searches were then analysed to determine: (1) whether asthma, allergy or sensitivity wasmentioned; (2) whether claims were made as to the ability to diagnose these conditions; (3) whether claimswere made as to the ability to treat these conditions (eg, \"The naturopaths at our clinic treat allergies \", no expli- cit statement as to the treatment working is required in this instance); and (4) whether statements were made about the ef cacy of the CAM practices in treating these conditions (eg, \"Homeopathy works for asthma \",n o explicit statement as to the clinic actually offering theintervention is required in this instance). Commonly, a single statement would constitute both a claim of treat-ment and a claim of ef cacy (eg, \"We can treat allergies with chiropractic, which has been shown to work \"). Excerpts were copied for the purpose of sharing qualita-tive examples. 2 Murdoch B, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e014028. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014028Open Access on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Coding required limited subjective interpretation, but in order to assess accuracy we had a Health Law Institute associate with no prior connection to the studydesign perform basic quality assurance on ve coding samples, resulting in 100% accuracy. The data were col-lected in Microsoft Excel; no complex statistical analysiswas undertaken, and analysis was limited to conversion to various percentages. RESULTS Our results show that a signi cant portion of CAM clinics studied advertised services relating to the diagno- sis and/or the treatment of allergy and/or asthma. Of the four disciplines studied, naturopath clinic websiteshave the highest rates of advertising at least one of diag- nosis, treatment or ef cacy for allergy or sensitivity and asthma acupuncturists and2 andgures 1 and2show these data. In addition, data were arranged by search city, as shown in tables 3 and 4. Clinic websites derived from Vancouver search results had the highest frequency of claims relating to at least one of diagnosis, treatment or efcacy for both allergy/sensitivity (72.50%) and asthma (62.50%). London, Ontario, had the lowest frequency of the same for both allergy/sensitivity (50%) and asthma (40% \u2014tied with Winnipeg). Diagnosis claims were less frequent than treatment claims for allergy (25.25% and 56.25%, respectively) andasthma (2.5% and 52%), and were more frequent than treatment claims for sensitivity (17.5% and 12%).Efcacy claims were only possible where treatment claims already existed. As such, we can calculate that32% of treatment claims for allergy were accompaniedby additional explicit claims as to treatment ef cacy; this was also true for 20.83% of sensitivity treatment claimsand 25% of allergy treatment claims. Aside from theseexplicit claims of ef cacy, one could logically concludethat advertising a treatment implies that the treatment isefcacious. Table 5 provides a sampling of the tests and treat- ments recommended for allergy, sensitivity and asthmaon the clinic websites studied. Coders noted the pres-ence of disclaimers on some clinic websites, which seemed to acknowledge the lack of scienti c validity underlying the approaches advertised. For example: \"Disclaimer: [Bioenergetic Intolerance Elimination] practitioners are not medical doctors and do not usemedical diagnostic or treatment procedures. The ser-vices performed by BIE practitioners are at all times restricted to consultation on the subject of nutritional matters and the BIB modality [ ...] All services provided are done for experimental or educational purposes only and do not involve the diagnosing, curing, prognosticat- ing, treatment or prescribing of remedies for the treat-ment of disease [ ...]\"(thesageclinic.com). Claims were presented with a variety of wording. Examples of claims of diagnosis include: \"Dr. Muradov may use blood tests, food allergy testing, biofeedback analysis and physical exam to aid in diagnosis and treatment \"(drericmuradov.com), \"Assessment and Diagnostic Services: Food Allergy T esting \"(850heal. com), and \"In her daily practice, Jennifer diagnoses and treats all health condition [sic] from eczema and asthma to MS and cancer \"(otta wanaturopathic.ca).

In addition, although it was outside the scope ofstudy, we noted comments suggesting that accepted medical interventions cause allergies and asthma, forexample, \"Recent research has con rmed that antibiotics and vaccinations are a cause of increased allergies andasthma \"(homeopathic-clinic-lipa.com). DISCUSSIONThe results show that, overall, the majority of the CAMclinics studied claim they can either diagnose or treat both allergy/sensitivity and asthma. Indeed, it is reason- able to assume that the number of CAM providers actu-ally administering such tests and treatments surpasses that which is advertised online, since some websites were very simple and did not expound signi cantly on ser- vices provided. These claims raise ethical issues, because evidence in support of many of the tests and treatments identi ed on the websites studied is lacking. 23For example, food-speci c IgG testing was commonly adver- tised, despite the fact that the Canadian Society ofAllergy and Clinical Immunology has recommended notto use this test due to the absence of a body of research supporting it. 24Live blood analysis, vega/electrodiagnos- tic testing, intravenous vitamin C, probiotics, homeo- pathic allergy remedies and several other tests andTable 3 Findings by search city Calgary (%) Edmonton (%) Hamilton (%) Kitchener (%) London (%) Mention or claim Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No Allergy mention 80.0 17.5 82.5 22.5 77.5 10.0 90.0Sensitivity treatment 22.5 77.5 12.5 87.5 22.5 77.5 5.0 95.0 0.0 100.0Efficacy for sensitivity 5.0 95.0 2.5 97.5 0.0 10.0 90.0 12.5 87.5 Mention or claimMontreal Ottawa Toronto Vancouver Winnipeg Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes No Allergy mention 55.0 45.0 72.5 27.5 72.5 27.5 72.5 15.0 82.5 15.0 85.0 12.5 87.5 Table 4 Percentage of websites claiming at least one of diagnosis, treatment or efficacy for allergy/sensitivity orasthma, by search city City Allergy or sensitivity Asthma 72.5 62.5 doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014028 5Open Access on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from treatments offered all lack substantial scienti c evidence of efcacy.25-33Some of the proposed treatments are so absurd that they lack even the most basic scienti c plausibility, such as ionic foot bath detoxi cation. Very few of the tests and treatments offered are demonstrably clinically effective, and they include immunotherapy(effective in certain applications such as allergic rhin- itis) 34and IgE testing (useful in combination with a clinical evaluation, but not as sometimes used by CAM practitioners in combination with invalid IgG testing).35 36Nevertheless, the presence of the term immunotherapy does not necessarily indicate scienti c- ally legitimate or safe methods, as there are severalunproven and potentially harmful forms of immunother- apy, including neutralisation, end point titration, etc. 37 Perhaps most concerning is the fact that several pro- posed treatments for allergy, sensitivity or asthma arepotentially harmful. These include intravenous hydrogenperoxide, spinal manipulation and possibly others. 38 39 Furthermore, a negative effect of the use of invalid andinaccurate allergy testing is the likelihood that suchtesting will lead to alterations and exclusions in diets, which can subsequently result in malnutrition and other physiological problems. 24These risks are especially serious for growing children whose diets may be con- trolled by concerned parents convinced by their CAM providers that invalid testing is accurate.24Paradoxically, and among young children particularly, prolonged unnecessary avoidance of certain foods can also increase the risk of developing true IgE-mediated food allergy.40 41 Some of this testing and treatment could result in higher healthcare resource usage, whereby, for example,blood analysis laboratories must deal with requests fromnaturopaths to test for clinically irrelevant factors. This would be costly and could hinder public health pro- grammes. 42In these cases, nancial exploitation is of the patient, as well as of the public health system and the taxpayer. This study was not without limitations. First, the sample cannot be said to be entirely representative ofmajor Canadian urban centres, because of the need to exclude Quebec City on the basis of the English searchlanguage. The extent of this English bias is signi cant but not measurable. Second, the approach of this studydid not allow for more complex comparisons betweenjurisdictions, nor did it address related research ques- tions, for example, an analysis of the extent to which advertising on clinic websites was targeted at differentdemographics. The popularity and regulation of these CAM disciplines vary between countries, so the results are not generalisable beyond Canada. Third, the searchmethod excluded any text that was in image form, meaning that the presence of key words and claims may actually be higher than what was reported. Finally, it wasimpossible to measure how many individuals saw the advertisements and/or visited the clinics, and clinics were not assigned a relevance rank based on their loca-tion on the Google results page. CONCLUSION Increased regulation and government endorsement ofCAM disciplines, such as the self-regulation of naturo- paths in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, may have contributed to a growth in the perception of theirlegitimacy and ef cacy as healthcare providers. 43 44 Unfortunately, many of the interventions advertised bynaturopaths, homeopaths, acupuncturists and chiroprac-tors lack evidence of ef cacy, as we found to be the case for allergy and asthma. In our view, the results speak tothe need for a legal and/or policy response in order toprevent potential harm and nancial exploitation. One strategy would be to increase the scope of advertisingregulations and enforcement, and to explore the poten-tial of applying evidence-based standards and restricting practitioners 'ability to offer unproven tests and treat- ments. In addition, since allergy and asthma dispropor- tionately affect younger generations, 18 22policymakers should consider strategies that consider parents andguardians who may forego the public healthcare systemin favour of using questionable CAM providers, poten- tially exposing minor children to harm. 45Ultimately, further research is needed to create and implement aTable 5 Twenty-seven examples of tests and treatments advertised for allergy, sensitivity or asthma on Canadian CAM clinic websites Targeted condition indicated as follows: AL; AS; S Chiropractic adjustment (AL, AS, S) Ionic foot bath detoxification (AL, S) Electro acupuncture according to Voll (AL)Muscle response testing (AL, S) Intravenous hydrogen peroxide (AL, AS, S) Bowen therapy (AL, AS)Acupuncture/acupressure (AL, AS, S) pH testing (AL, AS) Biofeedback analysis (AL, AS)Neuromuscular sensitivity testing (S) Fish oil consumption (AL, S) Ozone therapy (AL, S) Nutritional supplements (AL, AS, S) Electrodermal testing (AL, S) Homeopathic remedies (AL, AS, S) Sublingual immunotherapy (AL, AS) Drinking broths regularly (AL) Regular detoxification (AL, S)Subcutaneous immunotherapy (AL) Neural therapy (AL, AS) Probiotics (AL, AS)Immunoglobulin G testing (AL, S) Vitamin and mineral injection (AL, AS) Adrenal extract (AL, AS)Immunoglobulin E testing (AL) Bioresonance therapy (AL, AS) Intravenous vitamin C (AL) AL,allergies; AS, asthma; CAM, complementary and alternative medicine; S, sensitivity. 6 Murdoch B, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e014028. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014028Open Access on September 17, 2023 by guest.
