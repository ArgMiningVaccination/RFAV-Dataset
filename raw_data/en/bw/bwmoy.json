Here, we performed a longi-tudinal multi-omics study using a two-center cohort of 14 patients. We analyzed the bulk transcriptome, methylome, and of peripheral bloodsamples harvested from up to 5 time points. Validation was performed in two independent cohorts ofCOVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 was characterized by an increase of proliferating, metabolically hyper-active plasmablasts. Coinciding with critical illness, we also identied an expansion of interferon-activated circulating megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis Megakaryo- cyte- and erythroid-cell-derived co-expression modules were predictive of fatal disease outcome. The studydemonstrates broad cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond adaptive immune cells and provides anentry point toward developing biomarkers and targeted treatments of patients with COVID-19.1Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel University and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 2Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 3Institute for Experimental Medicine, Kiel University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 4Institute of Clinical Chemistry, Kiel and 23562 L \u20acubeck, Germany 5Section for Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 6Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne and University Hospital Cologne; German Center for Infection Research, Partner Site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany 7Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931, Germany 8Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), 50937 Cologne, Germany 9L\u20acubeck Institute of Experimental University L \u20acubeck, 23562 L \u20acubeck, Germany 10Genomics & Immunoregulation, Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, 53115 Bonn, Germany 11Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 12Departments of Intensive Care Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, the Netherlands 13Department of Computer Science, Institute for Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics (IBMI), University of T \u20acubingen and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site T \u20acubingen, 72076 T \u20acubingen, Germany 14Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Medicine, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 15Department of Internal Medicine III, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 16Division of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Research Center Borstel and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), TTU-TB, 23845 Borstel, Germany 17Department of Internal Medicine I and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), University of Bonn, 53217 Bonn, Germany 18LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Airway Research Centre North, German Centre for Lung Research, 22927 Grosshansdorf, Germany 19Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany (Afliations continued on next page) 1296 Immunity 53, 1296-1314, December 15, 2020 \u00aa2020 Elsevier Inc.llINTRODUCTION COVID-19 shows a heterogeneous clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic cases to overwhelming inflammatory re- sponses leading to organ failure and death. Severe, and ulti- mately fatal, COVID-19 is associated with a dysfunctional im-mune response. Critically ill COVID-19 patients show higher blood plasma amounts of numerous cytokines and chemo- kines ( Chen et al., 2020 ;Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 ; Huang et al., 2020 ;Ong et al., 2020 ) than do less severe cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit an impaired type I inter- feron (IFN) response with low IFN production and heteroge-neous regulation of IFN-stimulated genes ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 ;Hadjadj et al., 2020 ). Peripheral blood of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibits high frequencies of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-secreting CD14 hiCD16himonocytes as monocytes ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 ;Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ). Hyperinflamma- tory COVID-19 is associated the appearance type-I-IFN-activated CD14 +HLAlosuppressive mono- cytes and neutrophil counts. T cell lymphopenia and exhaustion are sug-gested as hallmarks of severe COVID-19 as well ( Diao et al., 2020 ;Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 ;Guan et al., 2020 ; Huang et al., 2020 ;Zheng et al., 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 infection can elicit specic T cell and B cell responses ( Braun et al., 2020 ;Grifoni et al., 2020 ;Long et al., 2020 ;Ni et al., 2020 ). How these changes in immune cell populations and functions are related to disease outcome lasting immunity are areas ofactive investigation. A signicant disease burden is mounted by thrombotic com- plications associated with COVID-19. Pulmonary embolismand thrombosis are frequent clinical features of critically ill COVID-19 cases ( Deshpande, more prevalent COVID-19 than in influenza autopsies(Lax et al., 2020 ). Patients exhibit elevated D-dimer levels and widespread thrombotic microvascular injury ( De Voeght et al., 2020 ;Rapkiewicz et al., 2020 ). Several studies suggest altered platelet immune cell interactions ( Leppkes et al., 2020 ,Manne et al., 2020 ) and the presence of megakaryocytes (MKs) in affected lungs ( Meyerholz and McCray, 2020 ).Longitudinal analyses on the dynamics of circulating immune cells in COVID-19 so far have mostly investigated one informa-tion layer (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) at atime. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal view of cellular features by using an integrated multi-omics approach. We analyzed up to ve peripheral blood samplesfrom hospitalized COVID-19 patients throughout their disease course by single-cell sequencing as multiplex cytokine ELISA. In addition to complex changes of immune cells, our study linked circulating MKs and responses of erythroid cells to COVID-19 clinical outcome. RESULTS Study Design We applied a multi-omics approach using up to 5 longitudinal pe-ripheral blood samples of 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and1 additional recovery control from 2 University hospitals in Ger- many (Cologne and Kiel). We employed parallel cytokine analysis was performed in a subsetof seven patients ( Figure 1 A). All patients were recruited at admis- sion and samples were taken at days 0, 2, 7, 10, 13 and/or at discharge. Three patients were diagnosed with Acute RespiratoryDistress Syndrome (ARDS), two of which had a fatal disease course. Five patients received remdesivir after inclusion into this study. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics aredescribed in Table S1 . Fourteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls were processed in parallel. To describe the heter- ogenous disease trajectories over time, we used a modied WHO ordinal scale ( WHO, 2020 ), which also ). The score was used to classify patients along their disease course ( Figures 1 B and 1C). scRNA-seq Analysis Identies Cellular Changes along the COVID-19 Disease Trajectory We rst analyzed scRNA-seq data from 358,930 cells with 10,900 cells on average per sample ( Figure 2 and the Deutsche COVID-19 Omics Initiative (DeCOI) 20Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, University of L \u20acubeck, 23562 L \u20acubeck, Germany 21Department for Emergency Medicine, Center Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany 22Section of Pneumology, Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Bonn, , 53127 Bonn, Germany 23Systems Medicine, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), 53127 Bonn, Germany 24German Center for Neurodegenerative (DZNE), PRECISE Platform for Genomics and Epigenomics at DZNE, and University of Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany 25These authors contributed equally 26These authors contributed equally 27Senior author 28Lead Contact *Correspondence: p.rosenstiel@mucosa.de https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.11.017ll Article Immunity 53, 1296-1314, December 15, 2020 1297longitudinal samples were analyzed per patient. Uniform Mani- fold Approximation And Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the structure of cellular populations ( Figures 2 B-2E). Graph- based clustering identied 37 distinct cell clusters in the dataset(Figure S1 A). Cell type classication was performed on the basis of signature genes of each cluster and conrmed by using refer- ence transcriptomes ( Aran et ;Wilk et al., 2020 ;Zheng et al., 2017 )(Figures 2 B, 2C, S1B, and S1C). Cells from individual patients were dispersed evenly in the UMAP representation, with the exception of a higher degree of interindividual heterogeneity in the monocytic subpopulations ( Figure 2 D, 2E, and S2). Enumeration across time points revealed changes of several cell types including monocytes, proliferative lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S1D).

Lymphopenia of +cells was present, but less pronounced than inother datasets. We also noted increased plasmablast (PB) proportions from the in- cremental phase to early convalescence,whereas B cells were depleted during in- cremental and complicated stages ( Wilk et al., 2020 ). Of note, we recognized the increased presence of several bone-marrow-derived precursor cell types in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 pa- tients. Prominently, MK proportionswere elevated throughout the course of the disease ( Figure 2 F). To dene poten- tial cell populations, which might be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we specically interrogated ACE2 mRNA amounts in the dataset, which were below detec- tion limit (<7 reads) in all cell populations (data not shown). A correlation analysis of relative cell proportions with clinical activity parameters and multiplex serum ELISA revealed that PB proportions were correlated with serum amounts of e.g., tu-mor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-10, and IL-21, a factor criticallyinvolved in B cell differentiation to PBs via STAT3 and BLIMP-1 (also known as PRDM1) ( Ozaki et al., 2004 ). Increased bone marrow precursor cells were associated with increased amountsof IL-33, a Th2 cytokine involved in regulating hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ( Kim et al., 2014 ), and elevated MKs were linked to heightened inflammatory parameters, e.g., serumCRP, IL-6, and IFN- a(Figure 2 1296-1314, December 15, 2020C6orf25SPARCGP9GNG11MYL9SDPRHIST1H2ACPF4TUBB1PPBPSMIM24CYTL1CD34EGFL7KIAA0125RP11-620J15.3CDK6SPINK2SOX4PRSS57MZB1IGHV6-1IGLV3-1IGKV4-1IGHG1IGHA1IGKCIGLV3-25JCHAINIGKV3-20RALGPS2HLA-DPA1LINC00926BANK1CD79BHLA-DRAHLA-DQA1CD74MS4A1CD79AAPPCCDC50TCF4SERPINF1LILRA4IRF8IRF7ITM2CPLD4KLRG1IL32GZMACD8BGZMKGZMHCD8ACCL5CD3ERPS12NOSIPLDHBLEF1CCR7TCF7MALIL7RLTBMKI67HMGN2H2AFZHMGB2HIST1H4CRRM2TUBBTYMSTUBA1BSTMN1CLIC3CTSWCST7FGFBP2NKG7PRF1PTGDSGZMBSPON2GNLYSNCAAHSPHBMCA1SLC25A37HBDALAS2HBA1HBA2HBBHIST1H1ESYNE2MACF1RNF213NKTRUTRNMTRNR2L12DDX17RSRP1MALAT1CD14VCANSERPINA1AIF1CST3FCN1S100A12LYZS100A9S100A8 -1012Average expression Percent expressed 02 5 5 0 7 5* ** * ** * ** * * * ** * *** * *** ** * ** * ** ** ** * * * *** * * ***** **** ** ** ** ** ** ****** ** **** ** *** *** ****** ****** B cellsDendritic cells (DC) Plasmablasts (PB) Precursors (HSC, MEP, CMP, GMP) Megakaryocytes (MK) Age Time from onset Ordinal scale Cell population identification Gene 1 Gene 2 Gene 3 Gene 4 Gene 5 Correlation with clinical parameters Disease trajectory comparison Cell type specific signatures C F G358,930 cellsMerged object Monocytes Granulocytes Erythroid cells cellsNK NK MK% PB% B % Precursors % DC% CD4+ T cells % CD8+ Disease Trajectories (A) Schematic workflow.

Principal component analysis showed a separation between healthy con- trols and COVID-19 patients on the rst principal component (PC1) ( Figure 3 B). In total, 5,915 genes were differentially ex- pressed between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients in a pairwise comparison between controls and each of the disease trajectory pseudotimes ( Figures 3 C and S3A). Most of the differ- entially expressed genes (DEGs) were expressed at higher levels in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls ( Figures 3 C and S3A). Notably, early changes comprised increase of immuno- globulin tran- scription factor (TF) and class II HLA transcripts were decreased throughout the disease course. Next, we employed ImpulseDE2 to construct a model of intra- individual variation of DEGs over time ( Sander et al., 2017 ). Given that two of three patients reaching pseudotime 2 were deceasedsoon after reaching this time point and did not experience a convalescent disease course, this category was excluded from this analysis and was only used to contrast identied transcriptspost hoc. We identied 935 DEGs following impulse-like pro- gression patterns across the disease trajectory ( Figures 3 D and S3A). Genes involved in IL-1 band vasodilatory signaling were highly expressed during the incremental trajectory (pseu-dotime 1). A broad decrease in transcripts encoding ribosomal structural proteins was present from the incremental to the late convalescent state (pseudotimes 1, 3, and 4), which might reflecta general suppression of the protein synthetic apparatus by type I IFN ( Jiang et al., 1997 ). Opposingly, there was a strong increase in IFN-related transcripts during the peak of disease activity,which was, however, suppressed in the critical disease category (Figures 3 D and S3B), conrming earlier reports ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 ;Hadjadj et al., 2020 ). Transcripts involved in myeloid-cell-mediated immunity and neutrophil degranulationwere modestly increased during pseudotimes 1, 3, and 4, but were strongly increased in the critical pseudotime 2. Notably, during late convalescence (pseudotimes 5 and 6) a strong signalof (e.g., HBD ,OPTN , and to hypoxia ( Ashra and Schwarz, 2013 ).We used the gene set resource DoRothEA to infer transcrip- tion factor (TF) activity by enriched regulon analysis. TFs in active disease were related to inflammation and IFN signaling (e.g., IRF1 and STAT3) as well as hypoxic signaling (HIF1A) ( Fig- ure S3 C). Supporting the IL-21-PB axis identied in the rst part of the single-cell analysis, PRDM1 (encoded by BLIMP-1) was predicted as signicantly active both at the critical as wellas at convalescent time points. A hypergeometric test of allactive TFs against the REACTOME database showed an enrich- ment of ''cell differentiation pathway'' = 0.03) and ''MK devel- platelet production'' (q = 0.05). Using upstreamnetwork topology of gene expression changes by using signed and directed protein-protein interactions ( Liu et al., 2019 ), we could show that MAPK3 (also known as ERK1) and MAPK1(also known as ERK2) had the highest centralities across all pseudotimes ( Figure S3 D). We further constructed metabolic models of each pseudotime by using the respective DEGs ( Ge- bauer et al., 2016 ) and found that the inflammatory disease states were associated with higher numbers of predicted meta- bolically active pathways than in convalescence and healthy in- dividuals ( Figure S3 E). We also investigated the bulk RNA data- set for presence of viral reads and did not detect relevant amounts (>10) of viral reads in any sample. This nding was also conrmed by negative routine real-time PCR (E gene andS gene amplicon) (data not shown). Longitudinal Co-expression Modules Identify Impaired IFN Response in Critical Disease and Signatures of Increased Thrombo- and Erythropoiesis We next used all DEGs identied from the combination of pair-wise and longitudinal analysis (6,317 genes) for weighted geneco-expression network analysis ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 ; Lee et al., 2004 ). The analysis identied a total of 10 modules, which we refer to as M1-M10, of co-expressed genes followingdistinct expression patterns throughout the COVID-19 disease phases ( Figures 4 A and S3F;Table S3 ). We calculated the eigen- gene values, which represent a single expression prole for allgenes within a module, to assess the individual correlation be- tween the modules and scRNA-seq-derived cellular composition (Figure 4 B) and clinical parameters ( Figure 4 C). Projecting the expression of the hub genes of each module on the scRNA- seq data revealed Figure S4 ). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed biological processes and pathways enriched in each of the mod-ules. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) inference ( Breuer et al., 2013 ) was used to depict putatively involved TFs.

M4 was associ- ated with the presence of MKs in the peripheral blood as well as D-dimers and had two expression peaks, in the critical state(pseudotime 2) and in the early convalescent state (pseudotime 4), respectively. M7 contained transcripts related to hemoglobin biosynthesis and coincided with TFBS motifs for GATA-1 andGATA-2, which are TFs related to erythroid cell differentiation(Figure S3 G). This biphasic pattern is likely related to hypoxia during highly acute inflammation (rst peak) and weaning off supplemental oxygen during convalescence (second peak).Altogether, analysis of temporal gene expression patterns in whole blood of patients clearly depicted pathophysiological con- sequences of a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with Gene Expression Epigenetic changes have been shown to contribute to the path- ophysiology of systemic inflammatory states ( Lorente-Sorolla et al., ). We thus investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) pat- terns along the COVID-19 disease course following the workflow depicted in Figure 4 E in a subset of the same patients (n = 6) ( Ta- ble S1 ) and compared them with a cohort of six healthy age and gender-matched controls. A pairwise comparison with healthy controls and between identied between 46,071and 69,733 differentially and S5B). A preponderance of hypomethylated sites was pre- sent at each time point compared with in healthy controls.Cellular deconvolution analysis ( M\u20aculler et al., 2019 ) identied that major parts of the COVID-19-associated DNAm signatures originated from granulocytes, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Figure S5 ), we observed a signicant overrepresentation of binding sites of the CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Beta (CEBPB) in hypomethy-lated regions ( Figure 4 H), which has a critical role for emergency granulopoiesis ( Hirai et al., 2006 ) and B-lymphocyte-to-granulo- cyte process that has been proposed insevere COVID-19 ( Wilk et al., 2020 ). We employed a hierarchical testing approach ( Pan et al., 2018 ) to identify interactions between transcriptome and DNAm signa- tures in cis (Figure 4 E). To that end, we screened all DEGs (com- bined set) for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) within a 5 kb window up- and downstream of their respective transcrip- tion start site. Of all 3,280 DMP-DEG pairs, 68.3% showedincreased expression with reduced methylation or decreased expression with increased methylation, which is in line with pre- vious studies ( H\u20acasler et al., 2012 ). We next investigated the of DMP-DEG pairs co-expression modules analysis identied DMP-DEG tion S5D). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of DMP-DEG pairs showed an enrich- ment of innate-immunity-related terms in the DEGs with increased expression (e.g., TNF and IL-6 signaling and Toll-likereceptor [TLR] pathway), and also identied gene sets relatedto platelet function and metabolic processes (ATP metabolism and autophagy) ( Figure 4 I). DMP-DEG pair genes, which were either increased in the inflammatory phase (pseudotimes 1-4)or decreased in late convalescence (pseudotimes 5 and 6) were mapped to scRNA-seq data, identifying larger cell-type- specic clusters of DMP-DEG pairs Figures S5 E and S5F). Plasmablast and B Cell Changes across the COVID-19 Disease TrajectoryGiven that our ndings pointed to changes of the B cell compart- ment along the disease trajectory of COVID-19, we next investi- gated the B cell lineage in greater detail ( Figure 5 A). We rst ex- tracted 22,190 cells identied as part of the B cell lineage from scRNA-seq data in cohort 1. UMAP embedding identied two distinct large clusters reflecting bona de B cells, which included11,509 memory B cells, 3,993 naive B cells, 383 transitional B cells, and 6,295 PBs ( Figure 5 B). PBs were largely expanded during COVID-19 with highest levels in the hyperinflammatoryphase ( Figure 5 C). Multicolor flow cytometry conrmed high amounts of circulating CD27 hiCD20/C0cells in the fraction of CD19+cells, which dropped along the disease convalescence. Likewise, the early relative decrease of naive (CD20+CD27/C0) and memory B cell (CD20+CD27+) amounts normalized at later time points ( Figure 5 D). We also identied a large fraction of HLA-DR+CD138+double-positive PBs in the inflammatory phase (pseudotimes 1-4). Whereas CD138+cells were only abundant in the active disease and not in the convalescence phase, 82%- 98% of all CD27hiCD20/C0cells remained HLA-DR+(Figure S6 F). Of note, because PBs are notoriously sensitive to manipulation, we recognized that the handling procedures for scRNA-seq, also for cohort 2, diminished the amounts of intact PBs compared toflow-cytometry data, whereas the longitudinal dynamics ofincreased PB numbers was retained between the two methods. We could distinguish a smaller cluster of PBs, which expressed genes associated with neutrophils (e.g., ELANE , MPO , and CAMP )(Figure 5 E). Unlike in the previous study (Wilk et al., 2020 ), we also found such cells in healthy subjects, albeit at lower frequency ( Figure 5 C). Using monocle3 ( Qiu et al., 2017 ), we highlighted the cellular trajectory of transitional B cells into naive and memory B cells, with a separate memory B cell cluster being most likely CD45RB /C0cells ( Glass et al., (C) Log 2-fold change (y axis) of DEGs between controls and each of the COVID-19 pseudotimes (x axis).

We could retrace the progression of PBs, which did not cluster on the basis of immunoglobulin classes but rather on the basis of disease state, with cells from hyperin- flammatory phases being more distant from the root of the tra-jectory ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Neutrophil-like PB cells were not continuously linked to the PB trajectory ( Figure 5 F). We next analyzed the BCR repertoire in the different B cell compartments by using bulk- all 596,882 unique BCR CDR3 heavy-chain sequences, whereas for scBCR-seq we had information referring to 14,785cells. Diversity analysis showed a heightened clonality, which sharply increased at early time points and then gradually decreased in the convalescent pseudotimes until normalizationin +and IgG+cells ( Figures S5 G and S5I) in both memory B cells and PBs ( Figures S5 H and S5J). Increased IGHA1 andIGHG1 expression was reached earlier in PBs than in memory B cells. Expanded IgA+and IgG+PBs were conrmed in the scBCR-seq data S5P) showed a preponderance of specic V regions in COVID-19 patients compared with in con- trols, e.g., IGHV3-30 andIGHV3-23 were overrepresented in PBs and neutrophil-like cells during disease. In summary, we observed an increase in B cell clonality in COVID-19, and there was an increase of memory B cells and PBs, dominated by theIgA and IgG isotypes and a skewed use of the IGHV gene early during the disease course. We next analyzed the longitudinal gene expression patterns of the 6,295 PBs ( Figure 5 G). The incremental inflammatory phase of COVID-19 patients was characterized by transcripts related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein folding (e.g., XBP1 ) and cell proliferation (e.g., PIM2 and ,IFI6, and IFITM1 ) were present in the PBs until late in the disease (up to pseudotime 5), yet such genes were absent from PBs in critically ill patients (pseudo-time 2). Throughout disease, we also identied an increase in SLC1A4 expression, a potential upstream regulator of metabolic changes ( Figure 5 I). High IL-16 expression, which supportsmigration of CD4 +T cells and circulating blood dendritic cells (DCs) into lymphoid organs during the initiation of a humoral im- mune response ( Kaser et al., 2000 ), was a feature of long-term recovery PBs ( Figure 5 G). GO enrichment analysis identied increased unfolded protein response and mitochondrial ATP synthesis during active disease ( Figure 5 H). These ndings were also corroborated in an independent cohort (cohort 2) ofpatients with mild and severe COVID-19 by using anotherscRNA-seq technology ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ). The 2,263 PBs extracted from this dataset conrmed a strong in- crease of PBs in severe versus mild COVID-19 (30% versus8% of entire B cell lineage) as well as increased expression of CD38 ,PIM2 ,IFI6,XBP1 , and SLC1A4 and similarly enriched GO terms (Fisher test, p = 1.80 310 /C05for unfolded protein response and p = 2.50 310/C08for mitochondrial ATP synthesis). PBs can modulate immune responses by serving as a nutrient sink ( Vijay et al., 2020 ). Thus, we used constraint-based model- ling to reconstruct the metabolic state of individual cells fromscRNA-seq data ( Joshi et al., 2020 ;Pacheco and Sauter, 2018 ). PBs from inflammatory states displayed a high metabolic activity, which was reduced only upon recovery, whereas mem-ory and naive B cells displayed no signicant differences in over- all metabolic activity between disease states ( Figure S7 L). Increased metabolic processes in PBs were oxidative phosphor-ylation, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, NAD synthe- sis, and an increase of various predicted to have a low activity state in inflammatory disease phases, whereas it was highly active at clinical recovery (pseudotime 6) ( Figure 5 J). Altogether, the analysis identied the broad activation of PBs and suggesteda strong immunometabolic shift of the cells toward amino acid metabolism, which might contribute to the immunopathology seen in severe COVID-19. Elevated Megakaryocyte Amounts as a Feature of the Systemic Inflammatory Response to COVID-19Systemic inflammatory responses are known to consume plate- lets, which exert broad immune and inflammatory functions in addition to their well-established hemostatic role ( Semple Figure 4.

Pulmonary and cerebral embolism is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 (Liao et al., 2020 ). Given that we had observed a transient in- crease of circulating MKs, the cellular source of platelets ( Fig- ure 2 B), in the mod- to platelet counts and D-dimer levels, we hypothesized that altered presence and function of MKsmight be a distinct feature of COVID-19. We thus performedsub-clustering of 6,512 cells identied as MKs and MK- (MEPs) by using the k-nearest neighbor method ( Figures 6 A and S7A). The cells clustered into 2 distinct subgroups, 5,870 identied as bona de MKs and another smaller cluster containing all HSCs and MEPs ( Figures 6 B, S7B, and S7C). The relatively low number of cell precursors complicated the comparison between individual pseudotimes (Figures S7 D-S7G). However, we could discern a signicant in- crease of HSCs and MEPs at the convalescence state in com-parison with healthy controls ( Figure S7 J). By focusing exclusively on MKs, we found there was a clear separation between samples belonging to healthy controls andpatients with active COVID-19 ( Figure 6 C), particularly cells from complicated disease phases form distinct subclusters from cells of healthy and long-term recovery disease phases(Figures 6 D and 6E). Strong increase in PKM transcript amounts (PKM2 ), encoding a pyruvate kinase that is involved in ATP for- mation, interacts with HIF1A and promotes its activity, wasobserved in critical patients (pseudotime 2). In this group, high expression of FCER1G , encoding the common FcR g-chain adaptor responsible for integrin (ITGA2-GP6)-mediated plateletadhesion was also present ( Figure 6 E). GO enrichment analysis identied broad terms related to immune responses, type I IFN response, and platelet aggregation to be altered along the dis- ease trajectory ( Figure 6 G). Transiently 6 F).IFITM3 ,IFI27 , andIFITM2 had increased expression in the inflammatory pseu- dotimes 1, 2, 3, and 4, indicating a lasting IFN response throughout the disease trajectory in MKs. Furthermore, we vali-dated our ndings in an independent cohort of mild and severe COVID-19 ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ), which conrmed not only higher numbers of MKs in severe patients ( Figure 6 H), but also conrmed increased expression of IFITM3 ,PKM ,ITGA2B (also known as and IFITM2 , and decreased expression of ODC1 andTGFB1 in severely ill patients ( Figure 6 F, bottom). Metabolic modeling identied an increased metabolic activity of MKs along the disease trajectory compared with that inhealthy controls, albeit at a lower level than in PBs ( Figure 6 I). Notable predicted processes were related to energy metabolism (pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis, and reactive oxygen species[ROS] detoxication) ( J and 6I). The metabolic model in- ferred a pronounced increase of glycolytic flux toward lactate, an induction of the methylglyoxal pathway ( Kalapos, 2008 ) and a decrease of spermidine-polyamine products known to inhibit platelet aggregation ( de la Pen a et al., 2000 ). Association of Co-expression Modules with Clinical Outcome in a Cohort of Severely Ill COVID-19 PatientsLastly, we focused on the potential importance of the obtained signatures in a clinical context in a longitudinal cohort of 40 me- chanically ventilated, critically ill COVID-19 patients from Rad-boud University Medical Center (UMC) in Nijmegen (cohort 3) (Table S4 ). Bulk RNA sequencing data in this cohort were obtained at two time points early upon admission to the ICU. We used matchedsample pairs with similar increasing inflammatory activity changes from survivors (n = 33) and non-survivors (n = 7) and interrogated the change of expression amounts of module genes(M1-M10, as dened in the German longitudinal cohort [cohort 1] initially shown in Figure 4 A) between the two time points ( Fig- ure 7 A). The rst sample was obtained in median 3 days after ICU admission, the median period between the time points was 2 days without systematic differences between surviving and non-surviving patients. The second time point of non-survi-vors varied between 4-35 days before death. Three moduleswere signicantly regulated in this longitudinal comparison. M2 transcripts related to failing type I IFN response were signi- cantly decreased in both survivors and non-survivors, corrobo-rating the association of IFN dysregulation and severe disease (C) B cell compartment pseudotimes represented as a UMAP.

M4, indicative of MKs in the peripheral blood as well as elevated D-dimer levels and M7 transcripts, associated with erythroid differentiation and MKs, were signicantly increased only in COVID-19 non-survivors when comparing the change between sampling at ICU admission and the follow-up time point 2 days later (Figure 7 B). In a reverse approach, we asked which transcripts displayed longitudinally different expression patterns between the two time points in survivors versus non-survivors. We found that whereas in survivors only 3 transcripts were regulated, 182 tran-scripts were signicantly different in non-survivors ( Figure 7 C). Of these transcripts, 130 were contained in the previously dened temporal co-expression modules from cohort 1 with asignicant enrichment of transcripts related to M2, M4, and M7. Cell-type-specic expression patterns of these fatality- associated transcripts (average expression value per cell type,derived from scRNaseq cohort 1) showed that the signature forM2 genes marked a broad array of cell types, such as mono- cytes, mostly specic for mono- cytes, with few highly expressed transcripts attributed to MKs. A large proportion of M7 genes painted the erythroid lineage, a separate cluster was expressed specically in MKs, e.g.,PBX1 ,TRIM58 , and PDZK1IP1 (Figure 7 D). Lastly, we quantied the differential regulation of TFs over time in survivors versus non-survivors via a moderated t test usinglimma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 ). The analysis identied 16 TFs that were differentially regulated in non-survivors only and 7 TFs in survivors ( Figure 7 E). Pathway analysis (REACTOME) revealed signicant enrichment of the terms ''MK in the non-survi- vor TFs. DISCUSSION The clinically heterogeneous disease presentation renders indi- vidual molecular dynamics of the hematopoietic and immune cell compartments system in response to COVID-19 an impor-tant topic with regard to understanding the pivot points of the disease. Our longitudinal analysis provided a chronological rank order to changes observed in prior cross-sectional studies.We observed an early and lasting depletion of NK cells and lym-phopenia of the CD4 +T cell compartment. Our data corrobo-rated a sustained increase and shift of the monocytic compart- ment ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ;Wilk et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, we found in our DNAm data that hypomethylated positions were highly enriched in cis of transcripts with increased expression related to positive regulation of TNF secretion, IL-1 b release, and innate immune signaling. Vice versa, transcripts with decreased expression comprised T cell receptor signalingand negative regulation of ATP metabolism, indicating a poten-tial long-term regulation of the immunological misring ( Lee et al., 2020 ;Lucas et al., 2020 ) by epigenetic processes. We observed a transient increase of PBs and a relative decreaseof memory and naive B cells, which coincides with inflammatory severity and normalizes with convalescence ( De Biasi et al., 2020 ;Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020 ;Stephens and McElrath, 2020 ;Mathew et al., 2020 ). Similar to other studies, the changes were not correlated with levels, but preceded the appearance of SARS-CoV-2-recognizing IgG antibodies ( Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020 ;Woodruff et al., 2020 ). The expression of CD138 on a large fraction of PBs during the disease supports the theory that these cells are non-specically mobilized from the bone marrow or other tissues. Of note, we found that the COVID-19 PBs werepredicted to be highly metabolically active in a systems biology modeling approach ( Joshi et al., 2020 ). The observed changes suggest a role of PBs as a nutrient sink, which was alreadyobserved in extrafollicular PBs as a hallmark of a systemic in- flammatory response in severe malaria ( Vijay et al., 2020 ). The predicted lower energy availability at the peak of COVID-19might indicate excessive shuttling of glucose into antibody glycosylation, which might contribute to metabolic exhaustion of the cells ( Corcoran and Nutt, 2016 ;Lam et al., 2016 ) and/or altered glycosylation patterns of antibodies, which were linkedto severe COVID-19 ( Hoepel et al., 2020 ;Larsen et al., 2020 ). Our longitudinal approach identied two other cellular features induced by COVID-19, which were unrecognized in previousstudies. First, we found a signicant increase of MKs, which car- ried a strong type I IFN signature. The change was associated with two longitudinal co-expression modules from the bulkRNA sequencing correlated with serum levels of D-dimers, suggesting a link to the inflammation-induced pro-coagulative state as apotentially fatal complication in COVID-19 patients. One of thetop transcripts with increased expression in MKs was IFITM3, which confers antiviral activity in MKs and platelets ( Campbell et al., 2019 ). Metabolic modeling suggested that in the hyperin- flammatory states, a shift toward higher rates of pyruvate (D) MKs across COVID-19 disease trajectory. For each UMAP, pseudotime-specic cells were highlighted by color. (E) Dot plot for disease trajectory signature genes in MKs.

Although thrombopenia has been observed as a clinical corre- late of critical COVID-19 (metanalysis in Lippi et al., 2020 ), it is unlikely that direct infection of MKs as seen in Dengue fever is responsible for this alteration. We found no evidence of either ACE2 expression in MKs or any virus-associated reads in the cell population (data not shown). The observed increase of circu-lating precursors including MEPs argues for an influence of COVID-19, which could not only represent a bystander response to increased platelet consumption but might rather reflectinflammation-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis ( Haas et al., 2015 ). We did not observe a direct correlation of MK levels with neither platelet counts nor D-Dimers, which might be limitedby the small number of scRNaseq datasets. A continuous pres- ence of type I IFN signals, as seen in our dataset, might addition- ally increase of the aggregation potential of platelets ( Leppkes et al., 2020 ;Middleton et al., 2020 ). In line with this, the MK-asso- ciated module M4 is strongly correlated with D-Dimer levels in the larger bulk dataset from cohort 1. The second cellular feature was primarily observed in the bulk RNA-seq data and was related to the co-expression module M7. We saw a biphasic upregulation of a transcript group that comprises canonical components of erythropoi-esis, which are most likely related to the presence of reticulo- cytes. GATA-1 TF binding motifs linked to hypoxia-induced Zhang et al., 2012 ) were signicantly en- riched in the module. We thus reasoned that this feature re- flects a canonical response to hypoxia because it is present in critically ill patients and at a later stage when patients areweaned of supplemental oxygen. Post -hypoxia polycythaemia and the presence of different erythroid progenitors in the cir- culation has been studied as a response mechanism of the bone marrow to acute hypoxic insults and critical illness fordecades ( Loeffler et al., Mobiliza- tion of erythroid progenitor cells and their presence in the cir- culation has been linked to augmented immune responses(Serebrovskaya et al., 2011 ). Although we did not directly pro- le erythrocytes in the scRNA-seq data because of red blood cell lysis and size and feature ltering steps in the data pro-cessing, we found evidence fo r the increased presence of committed erythroid-progenitor-like cells in the scRNA-seq data in two of our patients at the stage of oxygen-weaning. From the gene content and the number of cells identied, itis unlikely that these cells represented reticulocytes. Together, the results indicate a profound reaction of the erythroid line- age to COVID-19 at different phases of the disease. Thesefeatures of the computed disease trajectory were linked to clinical outcome in a larger retrospective cohort of 40 me- chanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. We could show that two modules from cohort 1, M4 (related to MK numbers incohort 1) and M7 (indicative of erythropoiesis in cohort 1), were signicantly correlated with a fatal outcome in the inde- pendent cohort. Decrease in expression of the M2 module(associated with hypomorphic type I IFN in cohort 1) in abroad array of cell types including monocytes, NK cells, CD8 +T cells, and PBs was present in both survivors and non-survivors, corroborating the observation of failing type IIFN in severe COVID-19, but questioning its clear relation to fatal outcome. Our results clearly suggest that regulatory events in megakaryocytic and erythroid cells might act aspivotal components of an unfavorable course of COVID-19, which mandates further pr ospective exploration. Limitations of Study Limitations of our study are given by the relatively low samplesize of the initial two-center cohort (cohort 1), which we aimed to compensate by two independent validation cohorts. The initial ndings, which point to functional alterations of cellular features,mandate prospective validation and currently can only be inter-preted in light of mechanistic ndings in other systemic inflam- matory disorders. We saw no evidence for a correlation of PB numbers with delayed development of SARS-CoV-2-recog-nizing antibodies, which is in line with another study ( Kuri-Cer- vantes et al., 2020 ). However, an interference of the broad PB activation with other specic B cell reactions, such as afnitymaturation of neutralizing antibodies or memory formation, as in severe malaria ( Vijay et al., 2020 ) should not be excluded. Metabolic hyperactivation of PBs will have to be conrmed byother methods, yet from the comparison of the models betweensubpopulations of the B cell lineage, the observed pattern in PBs does not appear as a general immunometabolic consequence of COVID-19. Likewise, the presence, altered function, and inferredmetabolic skewing of MKs and other hematopoietic precursors (e.g., granulocytes-macrophage progenitors [GMPs]) has to be conrmed in larger cohorts and by orthogonal methods (e.g.,FACS and proliferation assays). Such studies should denitely also take long-term consequences of microvascular complica- tions (e.g., neurological decits) into account. Our study suggests several cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and GDF-15 [ Myhre et al., 2020 ]) as markers of severe COVID-19 trajectories. Large prospective, longitudinal biomarker trials are mandated to comeup with clinically actionable predictors of severe COVID-19trajectories. Figure 7.

Eligibilitycriteria included age R18 years and admission to the respective hospitals (either normal ward or ICU) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR. Sex, age and additional demographic information, as well as patient comorbidities can be found in Table S1 . This study did not particularly focused on impact of sex on patient outcome due to the limit number of individuals; larger cohorts have been used to study the influence of sex upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five patients were co-enrolled in an ongoing clin-ical trial (remdesivir) at UKSH. Enrolment for longitudinal molecular phenotyping occurred between 1st April 2020 and 6th May 2020 (seven patients at the University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel (UKSH) and seven patients at the University Hos- pital Cologne (UKK), with the last sample taken on 20th May 2020). One patient with a mild disease course was recruited after hisrecovery to serve as an additional recovery control. The patients consented to the sampling of biomaterials, analytic processing of the biomaterials and genetic analysis, the study was approved by the independent ethical review board of Kiel University (ref no /C14: D 466/20) and Cologne (identier: 20-1295). Eight healthy donors were included as controls at a single time point in the frame- work of the DZHK study (ethics vote ref no/C14: D 441/16). While the patients were in inpatient health care, the sampling scheme was day 0 (at admission), day 2, day 7, day 10, and day 13. At each sampling day, blood was collected in PAXgene tubes, CPT tubes, EDTA and serum tubes (except from day 10 1: no CPT tubes were taken). Clinical parameters were retrieved from the electronic patients record systems or from written discharge letters from transferred patients by the COVID-19 clinical consultants (T.B., J.R.) and clin-ical research fellows (F.T. and P.K.). To describe the heterogenous disease trajectories over time, a modied WHO ordinal scale ( WHO, 2020 ), which also considers the behavior of several inflammatory markers (serum CRP, serum IL-6 and ferritin) was used ( Table ) to classify patients along their disease course ( Figures 1 B and 1C) enabling the interrogation of molecular states associated with transition between phases (e.g., complicated to early convalescent). Phases were dened as pseudotimes in accordance with WHO and the LEOSS register (https://leoss.net ) to depict the longitudinal course of the disease: incremental (pseudotime 1, where clinical symptoms and inflam- matory markers were increasing, ICU or non-ICU), critical (pseudotime 2, ICU, mechanically ventilated with signs of ARDS), compli- cated (pseudotime 3, state with severe signs of a systemic inflammatory response, ICU, high-flow oxygen, intubation readiness), moderate or early convalescent (pseudotime 4, supplemental oxygen, signicant signs of systemic inflammation), late convalescent(pseudotime 5, intermittent supplemental oxygen, minor signs of inflammation), recovery/pre-discharge (pseudotime 6, no supple- mental oxygen, absent inflammation markers) and long-term follow-up (pseudotime 7, at least two weeks after hospital discharge) (Table S2 ). Note that pseudotimes 2 and 3 do not directly reflect the chronological order, but can also represent peak levels, i.e., a given patient might have gone from 1 to 3 without intubation/mechanical ventilation. Validation cohorts For validation of cellular ndings from our prospective cohorts, data from two independent cohorts were analyzed: The scRNA-seq data from 18 patients admitted to the University Hospital Bonn ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 ) (cohort 2), and RNA- seq data from 40 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Radboud university medical center in Nijme- gen (cohort 3). Age, sex, and patient outcome information included in Table S4 . COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test in nasopharyngeal and throat swabs and/or by typical chest CT scan ndings. Within cohort 3, seven patients deceased. Blood was collected in PAXgene tubes. The frozen tubes were shipped to Bonn University for mRNA sequencing. Sampling in cohort 3 was carried out in accordance with the applicable rules concerning the review of research ethics committees and informed consent inthe Netherlands. All patients or legal representatives were informed about the study details and could decline to participate. METHOD DETAILS ELISA Serum cytokines were analyzed using a ''Human Magnetic Luminex and TNF. Frozen patient serum samples were thawed and diluted before the experiment with an equal amount of dilution buffer and the experiment was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were measured on a Life- match Fluoroanalyzer (Tepnel Life Science PLC, Wythenshawe, UK) equipped XPonent Software (Luminex Corporation,Austin, Texas, US). Serum TPO was quantied by ELISA Human Thrombopoietin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minne- apolis, Minnesota, US) according to manufacturer's protocol. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 specic antibodies Anti-SARS-CoV-2-specic IgA and IgG was using commercial ELISA kits (EUROIMMUN, L \u20acubeck, Germany). PAXgene Blood RNA Isolation and TruSeq /C210messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing Blood (2.5 mL) was taken from each patient into a PAXgene Blood RNA Tube, containing a patented RNA stabilizer reagent compo- sition. RNA was automated isolated in QIAGEN's Blood miRNA Article e4 Immunity 53, 1296-1314.e1-e9, December 15, prepared resulting libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (2 350 bp, S2 chemistry). DNA isolation and methylation proling Blood (2.7 mL) was taken from each patient into an Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) monovette (Sarstedt) to decelerate blood coagulation. The monovette was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm and the buffy coat was frozen in micronic tubes at /C080/C14C. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocol with a QIACube (QIAGEN). TheInnium \u00aaMethylationEPIC BeadChip was levels. The Innium \u00aaMethylationEPIC BeadChip targets the following regions: CpG islands, CpG sites, open chromatin, transcription factor binding sites, enhancer and mRNA pro- moter regions. The EPIC arrays were processed according to Illumina recommendations. Bulk BCR sequencing Bulk BCR libraries were prepared starting from 100 ng of total RNA isolated from PAXGene tubes. Library construction protocol was performed as previously described ( Bashford-Rogers et al., 2019 ). In brief, primers for the constant (C) regions of the BCR were used during cDNA synthesis. Product was then amplied via PCR using a multiplex primer set for the variable (V) regions using the Real- Time PCR library amplication kit from KAPA Biosystems. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq machine 2 3300 bp. Experimental virus mRNA detection SARS-CoV-2-specic viral RNA from the RNA extracts from the PAXGene tubes was quantied by RT-PCR using the RealStar /C210 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit RUO (altona diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). The two amplicons were in the E gene and in the S glyco- protein in Spike protein 2 gene. Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) Blood (2 38 mL) was collected using venipuncture technique and processed within maximum 30 min. PBMCs were isolated using the BD vacutainer /C210cell preparation tube (CPT) with sodium citrate according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, CPT tubes were centrifuged at 1,650 3g for 20 min at room temperature. PBMCs were collected and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in PBS. Half of the suspension was washed and resuspended in flow cytometry washing buffer(containing fetal bovine serum, EDTA and sodium azide in PBS) and prepared for flow cytometry within 3-5 h. The rest of the suspen- sion was washed once in PBS and the pellet was resuspended in resuspension medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) + 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), followed by freezing medium (30% DMSO in medium containing 40% FCS) according the 10 3Chro- mium Demonstrated Protocol (Fresh Frozen Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells for Single-Cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)Sequencing, Document CG00039 Rev D). PBMCs were stored at /C080 /C14C and thawed when needed also according to the 10 3Chro- mium Demonstrated Protocol (Document CG00039 Rev D). To prevent batch effects, all samples from different time points from one patient were thawed and sequenced together. Flow cytometry After preparation of freshly isolated PBMCs in flow cytometry buffer, PBMCs were stained with fluorescent labeled antibodies 16 Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). B B cells: Immunohistochemistry staining Tissue material was obtained in the autopsy procedure of the deceased patient 002 and from an age- and gender-matched patient (control), who had suffered from pulmonary adenocarcinoma and died from bronchopneumonia. SARS-CoV-2-testing was negativerepeatedly in the control patient. Immunostaining was done on formalin-xed and parafn-embedded tissue sections with the Bond Max Leica immunostainer using the Bond Polymer Rene Detection Kit. Antigen retrieval was carried out with the Leica ER1-Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (IFITM3) sequencing (scRNA-seq) Single-cell libraries were generated using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5 0Library & Gel bead Kit v1.1 according to the man- ufacturer's user guide targeting 20,000 cells per sample. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (2 3100 bp, S4 chemistry) to generate > 500 million reads per library. Additionally, the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit for human B cellswere applied together with the Chromium Single Cell 5 0Library Construction Kit. Those resulting libraries were sequenced on an Il- lumina NovaSeq 6000 (2 3150 bp, S4 chemistry) to generate > 50 million reads per library.ll Article Immunity 53, 1296-1314.e1-e9, December 15, 2020 e5QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Bulk RNA-seq data analysis An in-house RNA-seq pipeline was used to map and align the sequenced data ( https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq ). Adapters and low-quality bases from the RNA-seq reads were removed using Trim Galore (version 0.4.4), which is a wrapper tool for Cutadapt and FastQC. Reads that were shorter than 35 bp after trimming were discarded. The ltered reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38, gencode version 25) using STAR et al., 2013 ). featureCounts (version 1.5.2) was used to estimate the expression counts of the genes. The expression counts were normalized across samples using the DESeqnormalization method. Differential expression analysis Differentially expressed genes between healthy controls and e ach of the COVID pseudotime samp les were identied using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (version 1. 20.0). Genes with FDR adjusted p value of less than 0.05, log fold change greater than 0.5 or less than /C00.5 and average expression counts of more than 100 were regarded as differentially expressed (DEGs). Lon- gitudinal differential expression analysis of the COVID sample s was performed by applying the case-only analysis from the Bio- conductor package ImpulseDE2 (version 1.4.0). Pseudotimes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were used as single time points of a time-course experiment and the patient IDs were regarded as batch effects in order to perform a paired analysis. To identify the transcriptsregulated longitudinally in survivors and non-survivors from the Nijmegen cohort, differentially expressed genes between in thetwo selected time points were identied using DESeq2 for survivo rs and non-survivors separately. To perform a paired analysis, patient ID was used as batch effect. Co-expression analysis Modules of co-expressed genes were identied using the WGCNA package for R (version 1.69). All differentially expressed genes identied from the pairwise and longitudinal analysis (6,318 genes in total) were used to generate the gene co-expression modules.First, pairwise gene correlations were calculated based on the log transformed normalized expression counts across all samples. A signed adjacency matrix was constructed by applying a soft threshold function with a power of 14. The Topology Overlap Matrix (TOM) constructed using the adjacency matrix was used to construct a gene tree by hierarchical clustering. Genes were then splitinto modules based on the gene tree by using the function cutreeDynamic with the minimum module size set to 15. Modules that were closely related were then merged using the function mergeCloseModules with parameter cutHeight set to 0.45. To associate gene co-expression modules with clinical parameters and cell type fractions and to visualize the expression prole of the genes in a module, the module eigengene values for the samples were calculated. Spearman's rank correlation coefcients werecalculated between the module eigengenes and different clinical parameters and cell type fractions. DNA methylation data analysis DNA methylation data were analyzed using the Bioconductor package RnBeads (version 1.12.1). Sites that overlapped with SNPs and had unreliable measurements were ltered resulting in the removal of 17,371 sites and 19,745 probes. 2,977 Context-specic probes, 18,976 probes on the sex chromosomes, and 4 probes with missing values were also removed. In total 41,702 out of866,895 probes were ltered. The signal intensity values were normalized using the dasen method. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between healthy controls and each of the COVID-19 pseudotime samples as well as between sequential COVID-19 pseu- dotime samples were identied using the automatically selected rank cutoff of RnBeads. Functional enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted for the co-expression modules using GSEA desktop application (version 4.0.3). Pre-ranked analyses against Hallmark, KEGG and GO (Biological Processes) genes sets were conducted for each of the modules byranking all genes by the module membership score. FDR of 0.05 was used as the signicance threshold. All gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted using the Bioconductor package topGO (version 2.32.0), with all ex- pressed genes as the universe set. In the topGO analysis, the Fisher.elim p value, calculated using the weight algorithm, of 0.05was used as the signicance threshold. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enriched in the promoter regions of the co-expression module genes were identied by conducting enrichment analysis using the Bioconductor package LOLA (version 1.14.0). Promoter regions were dened as the regionbetween 1,500 bp upstream to 500 bp downstream of the transcription start site. Predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enriched in DMPs were identied by conducting enrichment analysis using the Bioconductor package LOLA (version 1.14.0). DNA methylation-transcriptome integrated analysis For the integrated analysis of gene expression with DNA methylation, we rst identied DMPs located 5,000 bp upstream and down- stream of the transcription start sites of DEGs. Spearman's rank correlation coefcient between the normalized expression count ofeach DEG and the methylation intensity ( bvalues) of its corresponding DMPs were calculated. To test the statistical signicance of the correlations, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) using a permutation approach.ll Article e6 Immunity 53, 1296-1314.e1-e9, December 15, 2020Bulk BCR analysis Sequencing reads were aligned to BCR gene reference and clonotypes were identied and grouped using the software MiXCR ( Bo- lotin et al., 2015 ). Relative proportions of IGH classes were calculated. Alpha diversity measures were calculated using the R pack- ages vegan and tcR (versions 1.5-6 and 2.3.2). Computational virus mRNA detection To quantify the amount of virus present in the blood of COVID-19 patients, reads from whole blood RNA-seq data were rst aligned tothe human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR with default parameters. The reads that did not map to the human genome werethen aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) slightly relaxed parameters (-outFilterScoreMi- nOverLread 0.2-outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.2-outFilterMatchNmin 0-outFilterMismatchNmax 4). The reads that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome with at least 40 consecutive matches were then aligned locally to the human genome using the Smith-Waterman algorithm ( Smith and Waterman, 1981 ) in order to lter any reads of human origin. The reads that aligned locally to the human genome or were composed largely of homopolymers were ltered and the remaining reads were considered as viral reads. Data analysis for ELISA Standard curves and cytokine concentrations were calculated using linear regression in Microsoft Excel GraphPad Prism (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, US). Data analysis for Flow cytometry data Analyses were performed using FlowJo v10 (FlowJo LLC, Dickinson, Ashland, Oregon, US) and Graphpad Prism 8 (Graph- Pad Software, San Diego, California USA). scRNA-seq data quality control and data analysis The sequences were processed using cell ranger v3.1.0 (10 3Genomics). Each sample was mapped to GRCh38 Homo sapiens reference genome, in order to produce their respective count matrices. Raw feature-barcode matrixes were ltered using Seurat package (version 3.1.5) in R environment ( Butler et al., 2018 ;Stuart et al., 2019 ); low quality cells that were potentially disrupted or doublets cells were removed from the analysis using number of features (number of reads mapping to gene between[200;5000]) or percentage of mitochondria (lower than 25%) ( Figure S1 E). We used a broad threshold in order to encompass cells from a variety of cell-types. Each ltered sample matrix was then merged into a single object containing 358,930 cells with overall reads mapping to 22,519 human genes. The merge object was normalized and scaled using LogNormalized() and ScaleData() functions respectively. Principalcomponent analysis was performed utilizing the top 2,000 variable genes. We identied the clusters using the standard k-nearest neighbor method based on 80 dimensions with a 0.2 resolution. In total 37 clusters were displayed as a Uniform Manifold Approx- imation and Projection (UMAP). scRNA-seq signature genes Cluster cell types were identied by their corresponding gene signatures using the Wilcoxon rank sum, with a cut-off based on genesexpressed in more than 25% of the cluster cells and exhibiting a 0.25-fold difference between clusters. Clusters of interest were iden- tied based on marker genes ( (version 1.0.6) Bioconductor package that as-signs each individual cell to a known cell type based on transcriptome reference datasets (NovershternHematopoieticData and BlueprintEncodeData reference datasets) ( al., 2019 ). Cell type proportions were quantied per sample and grouped based on pseudotimes. We compared cell type proportions of healthy controls against patients using a Mann-Whitney non-parametric testand measured cell proportion changes between pseudotimes by comparing a linearlinear mixed model with pseudotime (proportion of cell type /C24pseudotime +[1 jpatientID]) and compared it against a reduce model without pseudotime (proportion of cell type +[1- jpatientID]) by the means of an ANOVA ( Figure 2 F). We found most cell types to be impacted by disease trajectory, with only prolif- erative lymphocytes and cell precursors not having a signicant difference between pseudotimes. Furthermore, we correlated cell type proportion with the clinical parameters available for each sample using spearman correlation ( Figure 2 G). Cell type specic analysis The clusters identied as cell types of interest\u2014B cell compartment, megakaryocytes, and cell precursors were pulled from the merged object. Each cell type of interest was re-clustered and analyzed separately. B cell compartment and cell precursors were re-clustered using 80 PCs, while megakaryocytes and their respective precursors (HSCs and MEPs) were re-cluster using 60PCs. B cell compartment clusters were assigned based on expression of marker genes, with memory B cell expressing CD73/ NT5E , naive B cells expressing IGHD B cells expressing CD9 , plasmablasts expressing Article Immunity 53, 1296-1314.e1-e9, e7andCD38 ) and neutrophil-like cell expressing ELANE, MPO andCAMP (Glass et al., 2020 ). We presented the B cell compartment as a cell trajectory analysis using monocle3 ( Qiu et al., 2017 ). Trajectories were calculated and the cells displayed based on monocle3 pseudotime approach rooted on the previously identied transitional B cells. Plasmablasts (with neutrophil-like cells included), megakaryocytes and cell precursors signature genes for the individual disease groups were selected based on genes expressedin more than 25% and 0.25-fold difference between pseudotimes. Differentially expressed genes between healthy controls and each of the COVID pseudotimes was identied using MAST ( Finak et al., 2015 ) and GO enrichment analysis was performed with TopGO package for R (version 2.38.1) ( Alexa et al., 2006 ) and GO terms of interest selected based on sher classic test statistic (p value < 0.05). To validate our ndings, we performed a parallel analysis from an independent cohort (cohort 2) of mild and severe COVID-19 pa- tients using another scRNA-seq technology (Rhapsody BD) we identied plasmablasts and megakaryocytes, identied differences in cell proportions and tested if genes of interest were expressed differently based ontheir disease classication (control, mild COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 patients). single cell BCRseq (scBCR-seq) analysis BCR sequences were processed using cellranger v3.0.1 vdj function. Relative proportions of IGHclasses were calculated. Alpha di- versity measures were calculated using the R packages vegan and tcR (versions 1.5-6 and 2.3.2). scBCR-seq information was merged with B cell compartment containing both B cells and plasmablasts using barcode information. BCR information was mergedwith scRNA-seq expression, thus, we were able to discern IG class information per cell type and displayed it in the form of a UMAP ormonocle3 cell trajectory. Metabolic modeling Blood Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) ( Wishart et al., 2018 ); specically, an advanced search of blood metabolites from healthy adults was initially conducted in March 2019. In the same time period, a list of all human metab- olites ( Brunk et al., 2018 ) Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH) database ( Noronha et al., 2019 ). The latter contains the HMDB indices of the compounds, which enabled the merging of the two databases into one (Spring 2020). Compounds were removed from the database (e.g., drug-related ones or without FooDB IDs [ https://foodb.ca/ ]) and the metabolites nomenclature was altered to be compatible with an adapted version of the model Recon 2.2 ( Swainston et al., 2016 ). All values were transformed to mM to correspond with mean values of the HMDB database (cut-off of values > 10 /C06). Water was set to 55,000 mM, and pH was set to 7.4. All calculations were conducted with the R packages sybil (version 2.1.5) ( Gelius-Dietrich et al., 2013 ) Gelius-Dietrich et al., along with their dependencies. Reconstruction of tissue-specic metabolic models from bulk sequencing data For the reconstruction of metabolic models from bulk sequencing data we used a previously described two-step approach that rst discretizes gene expression based on differential gene expression analysis and subsequently reconstructs metabolic models basedon gene expression states ( Gebauer et al., 2016 ;Yang et al., 2019 ). Differentially expressed genes between each pairwise set of COVID pseudotimes were determined via the DESeq2 algorithm with pseudotime as the main independent variable. Wherever possible, i.e., when models reached full rank, we included the donor identier as a covariable to control for paired samples withsimilar genetic background in the data. The signicance cut-off used for optimizing independent ltering was adjusted to a= 0.05 before differentially expressed genes were extracted from the tests. For each gene, based on the directionality of changes in gene expression activity between conditions and the signicance of changes, we determined a binary activity ( onoroff) if a gene had at least one case of signicant change in activity (adjusted p value < 0.05) between any pair of conditions. Subsequently, we used the binary gene activity as an input into the iMAT approach ( Zur et al., 2010 ) on a generic metabolic model of humans (Recon 2.2) ( Swainston et al., 2016 ) constrained with the serum metabolic environment. In order to test method-inherent uncertainties in the reconstructed context-specic metabolic network, the model reconstruction procedure was repeated fty timeswhile leaving out gene activity data for 5% of the genes each time. Reconstruction of cell-specic metabolic models from single- cell sequencing data Reconstructions of cell-specic metabolic models were created by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with a human genome- scale metabolic network ( et al., 2016 ) conditioned with the serum metabolic environment. We employed a two-step approach, in which StanDep (Joshi et al., 2020 ) rst identies a core reaction list across cell types. Second, the FASTCORE algorithm (Pacheco and Sauter, 2018 ) in ( Heirendt et al., 2019 ) then builds context-specic models dened by sets of active core reactions in the extracted model. scRNA counts from patient, megakaryocytes, plasmablasts, memory B cells and naive B cells were used as input for StanDep. Normalized counts were converted into TPM-values, and ENSEMBL gene names were map-ped to Recon 2.2 ( Cunningham et al., 2019 ;Swainston et al., 2016 ). For StanDep, expression data from identied core genes across cell types were used to calculate enzyme type and expression within the model. Enzyme expressions were log 10transformed and counted as a binary matrix (rows representing enzymes and columns as bins) to identify the minimum and maximum enzyme expres- sion values. A complete linkage metric for hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance was used to cluster (number of clusters =40) genes based on gene expression. Assembled core reaction matrices were dened and input into FASTCORE to reconstruct context-specic metabolic models. Based on an updated version of Recon 2.2 simulated in the serum metabolic environment, all Article e8 Immunity 53, 1296-1314.e1-e9, December 15, 2020consistent model was generated using FASTCORE's FASTcc algorithm in MATLAB. With this consistent model, the assembled core reaction matrices, and additional optional core reactions, such as the biomass objective function from Recon 2.2, an input le was generated for every cell-specic model comprising at least 30 core reactions. FASTCORE processed these input les, together with the consistent Recon 2.2 model, and the default value 10/C04forto generate a list of all required reactions for each cell-specic meta- bolic model. With these lists, new metabolic models were curated and optimized for the biomass objective function and/or the viral biomass objective function. Identication of disease-specic metabolic pathways Tissue- by cell type (megakaryocytes, plasmablasts, memory B cells, and naive B cells) and annotated with clinical metadata (COVID-19 pseudotime) according to donor and sampling time points. Reactions per pathway and cell were counted for a total of 82 metabolic pathways that were identied in the models. For each of the four model types, pathwayswere ltered out if reaction counts were zero across all models of that type. Differential pathway activity was determined for each pathway by comparing reaction counts across all eight pseudotimes via Kruskal-Wallis test as implemented in the R-package coin (parameters: two-sided test, unpaired, average-scores for ties, and without continuity correction). Resulting probability valueswere corrected for multiple testing via the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Signicantly differential active pathways across disease states (pseudotimes) were determined via this method for all four model types separately with an FDR cut-off of <0.05. For the heat- map representation of B cell subtypes, the top 20 pathways that were identied as signicantly differential active in all three modeltypes were selected and clustered by the mean reaction counts of plasmablast models. Transcription factor activity analysis Putative transcription factor activity from RNA-seq data were assessed per pseudotime against healthy controls using the humangene set resource DoRothEA v1, which provides a curated collection of transcription factor and target genes interactions (the reg- ulon) from different sources ( Garcia-Alonso et al., 2019 ). Only interactions with high, likely, and medium condence (levels A, B, and C) were considered. Regulons were statistically evaluated using the R package viper (v1.22.0; row-wise t tests) and regulons havingat least 15 expressed gene targets were considered ( Alvarez et al., 2016 ). Identication of upstream regulatory signaling pathways from downstream gene expression was performed on t-statistic values from viper against the Omnipath interaction database (R package OmnipathR version 1.2.1) applying CARNIVAL (version 1.0.1 with IBM Cplex solver as network optimizer) ( Liu et al., 2019 ). For the resulting network, only edges with an inferred weight > 50 (on a scale from 1 to 100) were considered. The similarity between the transcription factor activity of cohort 1 and cohort 3 was accessed using Pearson correlation. The signicance of the correlation was conrmed by a bootstrapping approach. We permuted gene names row wise 1,000 times and correlated eachtime the inferred TF activity between the original and permuted gene expression. The resulting distribution of correlation valueswas tted to a skewed Gaussian normal distribution, nding a standard deviation of 0.08.The signicance in the differential regulation of transcription factors over time in the non-survivor versus the survivor groups of cohort 3 was quantied via a moderated t test using limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 ), while accounting for patient correlation using a block design and limma's duplicateCorrelation function.ll Article Immunity "}
