This study addresses the availability of a methodology that documents the removal of BTEX related compounds and optimizes the ferric-based coagulant system in alkaline media. The Box-Behnken design with Response Surface Methodology enabled the optimization of the conditions for the removal (%) of the model compounds for the coagulation process. Three independent variables were considered: coagulant dosage (10-100 mg/L PNP and 30-100 mg/L naphthalene), lime dosage (50-200%), and initial pollutant concentration (1-35 mg/L PNP and 1-25 mg/L naphthalene). The response optimization showed a 28% removal of PNP at optimal conditions: 74.5 mg/L ferric sulfate, 136% lime dosage, and initial PNP concentration of 2 mg/L. The optimal conditions for naphthalene removal were 42 mg/L ferric sulfate, 50% lime dosage, and an initial concentration of naphthalene (16.3 mg/L) to obtain a 90% removal efficiency. The coagulation process was modeled by adsorption isotherms (Langmuir for PNP; Freundlich for Naphthalene). The surface properties of flocs were investigated with pHpzc, solid-state UV absorbance spectra, and optical microscopy to gain insight into the role of adsorption in the ferric coagulation process.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-09-22", "cleaned_text": "Removal of Model Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Aqueous Media with a Ferric Introduction [1](#B1-surfaces-05-00030), [2](#B2-surfaces-05-00030)]. Crude oil spill disasters are a serious environmental hazard that cause widespread negative environmental and economic impacts. The accidental leakage of crude oil from transport tanks, pipelines, drilling platforms and rigs, and oil wells are known to occur during the extraction and transportation of oil through waterways [ [3](#B3-surfaces-05-00030)]. Petroleum is a complex mixture containing hundreds of organic compounds whose composition depend on the source materials, formation conditions, and migration to and accumulation in reservoirs [ [4](#B4-surfaces-05-00030), [5](#B5-surfaces-05-00030)]. Serious physical and mental health effects [ [6](#B6-surfaces-05-00030), [7](#B7-surfaces-05-00030)] can be caused by [ [14](#B14-surfaces-05-00030), [15](#B15-surfaces-05-00030)], and other combustible products in petroleum. Polar substituted arenes (e.g., halogen and nitro groups) also have variable persistence, toxicity, and solubility in water [ [16](#B16-surfaces-05-00030), [17](#B17-surfaces-05-00030), [18](#B18-surfaces-05-00030)]. [19](#B19-surfaces-05-00030), [20](#B20-surfaces-05-00030)]. Currently, various methods have been developed for highly polluted oilfield wastewaters or petroleum refinery wastewaters, such as demulsification, coagulation, adsorption, biodegradation, electrochemistry, and oxidation, as well as their combined processes [ [21](#B21-surfaces-05-00030)]. Among these, coagulation processes offer an economical method that has been extensively applied due to its low infrastructure requirements, facile operation, and pollutant removal efficiency [ [22](#B22-surfaces-05-00030)]. Metal salts such as ferric chloride [ [23](#B23-surfaces-05-00030)], and polyaluminium chloride [ [26](#B26-surfaces-05-00030)] are widely used coagulants that display a good efficiency for removal of hydrocabon pollutants [ [27](#B27-surfaces-05-00030)]. The metal salt hydrates and hydrolysis products (monomer/polymer species and solid precipitates) can act on the pollutant species with three main mechanisms: charge neutralization, sweep flocculation, and adsorption bridging. Generally, the mechanisms of coagulation that employ metal-based coagulants are strongly dependent on the hydrolysis products of coagulants [ [28](#B28-surfaces-05-00030)]. [29](#B29-surfaces-05-00030)], where such water softening is conceived for reducing the levels of calcium and magnesium ions. Coagulation along with lime-softening has been proven to be an effective combination during water treatment processes for the removal of colloidal particles [ [30](#B30-surfaces-05-00030)]. [31](#B31-surfaces-05-00030)]. To mitigate the risks associated with crude oil spills, WTPs wish to develop mitigation strategies to protect source water. The main objective of this study serves to address a key knowledge gap related to the development of a ferric sulfate coagulation methodology under alkaline conditions for the removal of model hydrocarbon pollutants. This research will contribute toward the optimization of an effective ferric coagulant-based water treatment technology under alkaline conditions. The results from this study will contribute to the design of a multi-barrier approach that will allow WTPs to implement a coagulation-based treatment process that will safeguard drinking water from accidental crude oil spillage into source water supplies. This study will address the existing knowledge gap concerning oil removal through the development of a method that employs ferric sulfate as a coagulant system under alkaline conditions. In cooperation with the City of Saskatoon WTP, this study will address the removal of model pollutants from water. We envisage that the results of this study will contribute to a future mitigation strategy to address the potential occurrence of accidental oil spills (crude oil) into source water that can be adopted by other WTPs globally. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials 2.2. Model Selection [32](#B32-surfaces-05-00030)] that estimated the total residual hydrocarbon level expected in the source water after an oil spill (ca. 10-20 mg/L). Based on the residual oil estimated from this report, the maximum concentration range within the water column was estimated to be 10% (1-2 mg/L) of the oil concentration (ca. 10-20 mg/L). Thus, the range of concentration for the calibration curves and the coagulation trial experiments varied between 0.5 to 55 mg/L. [Table 1](#surfaces-05-00030-t001)shows some selected properties for the model compounds examined in this study, which include selected physicochemical properties, as described above, including the wavelength for the maximum absorbance (max) for analytical detection. 2.3. Coagulation Process [33](#B33-surfaces-05-00030)]. In brief, a predetermined amount of lime solution was added to the solution, which was mixed for 20 min, where the coagulant was then added, followed by rapid stirring for 3 min at 295 rpm. Thereafter, the stirring rate was reduced to 25 rpm for 20 min. The stirring was stopped to allow the sample to settle overnight, where a 10 mL sample was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was analyzed through the measurement of the Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrum at variable wavelengths. PNP was buffered in order to estimate the concentration at pH 7. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and the average values were reported. The removal efficiency (RE; %) and the adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g1) were calculated by Equations (1) and (2), respectively. 2.4. Box-Behnken Experimental Design [34](#B34-surfaces-05-00030)]. Preliminary experiments indicate that three important operating parameters play a key role in pollutant removal in the coagulation process: coagulant dosage (ferric sulfate; A), lime dosage (B), and the initial pollutant concentration (C). These variables were chosen as the independent variables and were designated as A (1-100 mg/L), B (50-200% relative to the ferric sulfate concentration), and C (1-35 mg/L), respectively. [Table 2](#surfaces-05-00030-t002)shows the levels for each of the factors for this experiment. The complete BBD description is presented in [Table S1 (Supplementary Materials)](#app1-surfaces-05-00030). Preliminary results indicate that the water hardness could have a significant effect on the removal of the model pollutants. Thus, the content of carbonate in all of the model systems was adjusted to 125 mg/L capacities according to Equation (2). 2.6. pH at Point-of-Zero-Charge [38](#B38-surfaces-05-00030)]. A stock solution of NaCl (0.01 M) was prepared and 20 mL portions were transferred into eight vials (8-dram). The solution pH conditions of the samples were adjusted between pH 3 to 10 using aqueous NaOH or HCl solutions. The sorbent materials (45 mg) were added to each solution and were allowed to equilibrate for 48 h before the final pH was recorded. The pHpzc was estimated by plotting the final pH against the initial pH, and the point of intersection of the resulting null pH refers to the point zero charge, pHpzc. 2.7. Solid State UV-VIS Spectroscopy 2.8. Optical Microscopy 3. Results [Table 1](#surfaces-05-00030-t001)) that were used to select suitable model hydrocarbon oils, PNP and naphthalene were chosen as the model compounds for this study. Key factors include the reliability of calibration curves, molar absorptivity, solubility in water, and minimal vapor pressure to avoid evaporative losses during the coagulation treatment process. The removal efficiency for the model hydrocarbon systems was studied in the laboratory at optimized conditions through the Box-Behnken experimental design. Optical microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and pHpzc and used to characterize the surface properties of the isolated flocs, where the results are outlined in the sections below. 3.1. Model Selection [Figure 1](#surfaces-05-00030-f001)a presents the spectra (200 nm to 230 nm) where the UV absorption band of naphthalene is visible. Naphthalene (0.5-10 mg/L) showed a maximum absorption at 220 nm. Toluene covers a wider concentration range from 0.5 to 50 mg/L. The spectrum for toluene is presented in [Figure 1](#surfaces-05-00030-f001)b (230 nm to 280 nm), where the absorption bands are visible with a maximum absorption at 262 nm. The spectra for benzene (230 nm to 280 nm) is presented in [Figure 1](#surfaces-05-00030-f001)c. Characteristic absorption bands for benzene (1-35 mg/L) within this spectral range are clearly visible, with a maximum absorbance at = 254 nm. The chlorobenzene concentration was wide-ranging from 0.1 to 55 mg/L, where the spectrum for chlorobenzene is shown in [Figure 1](#surfaces-05-00030-f001)d ( = 230 nm to 280 nm), which shows a maximum absorption at = 264 nm. 4-nitrophenol shows an absorption maximum at = 400 nm to enable the construction of a calibration curve ( [Figure 1](#surfaces-05-00030-f001)e). The R-adj coefficients a good linear correlation. 3.2. Box-Behnken Analysis (BBD) [32](#B32-surfaces-05-00030)] indicated low absorbance values (below 0.08 absorbance units). As these values are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) [ [39](#B39-surfaces-05-00030)], BBD was carried out only for naphthalene and PNP, in line with their favorable water solubility and lower vapor pressure (cf. [Table 1](#surfaces-05-00030-t001)). [Table 3](#surfaces-05-00030-t003)shows p-values for each factor and coefficients for the model pollutant removal. Equation (3) can be used for modelling the pollutant removal within the range established for each factor. For PNP, ferric sulfate, initial PNP concentration, and lime dosage are significant factors over PNP removal due to the lower p-value (<0.05). Furthermore, the squared interaction for each of the factors showed significant effects. The initial naphthalene concentration and lime dosage were significant factors over naphthalene removal due to the p-value lower than 0.05. Furthermore, the squared interaction for naphthalene revealed a significant effect. ANOVA analysis is presented in The of PNP decreases as the initial concentration of PNP increases from 1 to 35 mg/L. Increasing the ferric sulfate concentration from 1 to 70 mg/L led to an increase in the removal to a maximum (18%) at 75 mg/L of ferric sulfate. Then, the removal underwent a decrease as the ferric sulfate concentration increased up to 100 mg/L. Lime dosage presented the highest removal (18%) when added at 136% relative to the ferric sulfate concentration, whereas the PNP removal decreased as the lime dosage increased up to 200% ( [Figure 2](#surfaces-05-00030-f002)a). The response optimization showed achieved at optimal conditions: mg/L), lime dosage (136%) based on ferric sulfate concentration, and an initial concentration of PNP (2 mg/L). The effect of the main factors for naphthalene removal are presented in [Figure 2](#surfaces-05-00030-f002)b. For an initial concentration of naphthalene, its removal decreased as its concentration increased, where a maximum removal (90%) occurred at 16.3 mg/L naphthalene. Increasing the ferric sulfate concentration from 30 to 100 mg/L yielded a decreased removal with a maximum (88%) that occurred at 42 mg/L of ferric sulfate. Then, the removal decreased as the ferric sulfate level increased up to 100 mg/L. The lime dosage presented the highest removal (88%) when it was added at 50% (relative to the ferric sulfate concentration), while naphthalene removal decreased as the lime dosage increased up to 200%. The response optimization showed a naphthalene removal of 90% that could be achieved at optimal conditions: ferric sulfate (42 mg/L), lime dosage (50%) based on ferric sulfate concentration, and an initial concentration of naphthalene (16.3 mg/L). [Figure 3](#surfaces-05-00030-f003)a, show the combinations for an initial PNP concentration and ferric sulfate concentration, with the lime dosage set at a middle value (125%) for the removal of PNP. [Figure 3](#surfaces-05-00030-f003)b. In [Figure 3](#surfaces-05-00030-f003)c, the removal of PNP is shown for variable lime and ferric sulfate dosage, where the initial concentration of PNP was fixed at 18 mg/L. [Figure 4](#surfaces-05-00030-f004)a. Naphthalene removal for lime dosage and the naphthalene initial concentration with ferric sulfate was set at the middle value (55 mg/L), as shown in [Figure 4](#surfaces-05-00030-f004)b. The removal of naphthalene that considers lime and ferric sulfate dosage with the initial naphthalene concentration at 13 mg/L is presented sulfate-lime process. The fitted lines through the data represent the goodness-of-fit of the isotherm models employed herein, where the variables are listed in [Table 4](#surfaces-05-00030-t004). Based on the tabular results, the removal of PNP and naphthalene by the ferric sulfate-lime system is well-described by the Langmuir (R2 = and Freundlich (R2 = 0.977) models, [Table best-fit results for the adsorption isotherms of naphthalene are described by the Freundlich model, which is often used to describe the adsorption at heterogeneous surface sites and multilayer adsorption that may occur between naphthalene and ferric species. The value (1/n = 0.87), presented in [Table 4](#surfaces-05-00030-t004), indicate a favorable adsorption and heterogeneous surface sites, which concurs with the adsorption of naphthalene onto the floc surface in a coplanar to an orthogonal modality. In the present study, as lies between 1 and 10, which indicates the physical adsorption of naphthalene onto the ferric sulfate-lime floc system. A number of studies support that the adsorption process for naphthalene onto various adsorbents is favored by the Freundlich model, as compared with other isotherm models [ [40](#B40-surfaces-05-00030)]. 3.4. Floc Surface Study [Figure 6](#surfaces-05-00030-f006)a shows the pHpzc plot for the flocs formed by this system. The pHpzc parameter indicates the pH where the net charge of a material is zero (pH = 9.56). The surface charge of the adsorbents is positive at a pH below the pHpzc, where the adsorption of OH ions and other carbonate anion species may occur because the -potential of the sorbent is positive overall. Meanwhile, the -potential of the floc is negative when the solution pH lies above pHpzc, where adsorption of the cation species mainly occurs due to favorable surface charge on the floc surface. [Figure 6](#surfaces-05-00030-f006)b shows the UV spectra for pure PNP (black) that present absorption bands at 317 and 400 nm, characteristic features for the non-ionized and ionized forms of PNP, respectively. These two states can co-exist when the pH is near to the pKa (7.16) of PNP [ [41](#B41-surfaces-05-00030)]. The slightly greater adsorption band at 400 nm for PNP flocs (red) shows that PNP is present in ionized form in the flocs. This trend confirms the ion binding mechanism between the anionic PNP with the negatively charged ferric species and cations. The presence of naphthalene ( [Figure 6](#surfaces-05-00030-f006)c) on the surface of the flocs is also supported by the observed adsorption band at 220 nm (red). [Figure 7](#surfaces-05-00030-f007)presents the optical images of the flocs with a magnified (5\u00d7) view. [Figure 7](#surfaces-05-00030-f007)a shows the flocs for PNP where some general morphological features include their large size and irregular shape. The microscopy image for the naphthalene flocs ( [Figure 7](#surfaces-05-00030-f007)b) present variable floc sizes with a denser appearance, in comparison with the flocs noted for PNP. 4. Conclusions [Table 1](#surfaces-05-00030-t001)). A Box-Behnken statistical design was used to determine the experimental effects of coagulant dosage, lime dosage, and initial pollutant concentration for PNP and naphthalene removal efficiency. The coagulation removal efficiency (RE; %) of the ferric sulfate-lime softening system was investigated using variable pollutant levels from 1 to 35 mg/L, based on their water solubility. The Box-Behnken Design and statistical experiment with the response surface methodology were effective for determining the optimal conditions for the removal of PNP (74.5 mg/L) and naphthalene (42 mg/L) through the ferric sulfate coagulation process. The optimum lime dosage for maximum PNP and naphthalene removal were found to be 136% and 50%, based on the ferric sulfate concentration, in that order. The initial PNP concentration was 2 mg/L at the optimized level, whereas the concentration for naphthalene was 16.3 mg/L, which concurs with their relative charge state and water solubility profiles (cf. [Table 1](#surfaces-05-00030-t001)), especially at alkaline conditions.
