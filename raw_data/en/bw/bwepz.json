All animals, including humans, can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) ubiquinones, hence, coenzyme Q10 is not considered a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(1)](#references). The name ubiquinone refers to the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in living organisms and their chemical structure, which contains a functional group known as a benzoquinone. Ubiquinones are fat-soluble molecules with anywhere from 1 to 12 isoprene (5-carbon) units. The ubiquinone found in humans, ubidecaquinone or coenzyme Q10, has a \"tail\" of 10 isoprene units (a total of 50 carbon atoms) attached to its benzoquinone \"head\" (Figure 1) [(1).](#references) [[Figure 1 - Click Biological Activities Coenzyme Q10 is [soluble](../glossary#soluble) in [lipids](../glossary#lipid) (fats) and is found in virtually all [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), including [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membranes. The ability of the benzoquinone head group of coenzyme Q10 to accept and donate [electrons](../glossary#electron) is a critical feature to its function. Coenzyme Q10 can exist in three [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) states (Figure 1): (i) the fully [reduced](../glossary#reduction) ubiquinol form, CoQ10H2; (ii) the radical semiquinone intermediate, CoQ10H\u00b7; and (iii) the fully oxidized ubiquinone form, CoQ10. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis The conversion of energy from [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and fats to [ATP](../glossary#ATP), the form of energy used by cells, requires the presence of coenzyme Q10 in the inner [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) membrane. As part mitochondrial [electron transport chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), coenzyme Q10 accepts during [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and then transfers them to electron acceptors. At the same time, coenzyme Q10 contributes to transfer [protons](../glossary#proton) (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released when the protons flow back into the mitochondrial interior is used to form ATP (Figure 2) [(1)](#references). In addition to its role in ATP synthesis, mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 mediates the oxidation of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. [[Figure 2 - Click to Enlarge]](/sites/lpi.oregonstate.edu/files/coenzyme-q10-figure-2-1200.png) Lysosomal function [Lysosomes](../glossary#lysosome) are [organelles](../glossary#organelle) within cells that are specialized for the digestion of cellular debris. The digestive [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) within lysosomes function optimally at an [acidic](../glossary#acidic) [pH](../glossary#pH), meaning they require a permanent supply of [protons](../glossary#proton). The lysosomal membranes that separate those digestive enzymes from the rest of the cell contain relatively high concentrations of coenzyme Q10. Research suggests that coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in the transport of protons across lysosomal membranes to maintain the optimal membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane) and [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) from [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation). The presence of a significant amount of CoQ10H2 in cell membranes, along with [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) capable of reducing oxidized CoQ10 back to CoQ10H2 (i.e., NAD(P)H oxidoreductases), supports the idea that CoQ10H2 is an important cellular antioxidant [(4)](#reference4). CoQ10H2 has been found to inhibit [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) when cell membranes and [low-density lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) are exposed to oxidizing conditions. When LDL is oxidized, CoQ10H2 is the first antioxidant consumed. In isolated [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria), coenzyme Q10 can protect membrane [proteins](../glossary#protein) and mitochondrial the oxidative damage that accompanies lipid peroxidation [(5)](#reference5). Moreover, when present, CoQ10H2 was found to limit the formation of oxidized [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and the consumption of -tocopherol (a form of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) with antioxidant properties) in addition coenzyme Q10 as an antioxidant is also exemplified by recent evidence showing that mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 deficiency causes an increased production of mitochondrial superoxide radical anion (O2-) which might be driving insulin resistance in adipose and muscle tissues [(7)](#reference7). Nutrient -tocopherol radical](../glossary#free-radical), as a lipid peroxyl radical (LOO\u00b7), it becomes [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) itself, forming -TO\u00b7, which can in turn promote the oxidation of lipoproteins under certain conditions in the test tube, thus propagating a chain reaction. However, when the [reduced](../glossary#reduction) form Q10 radical (CoQ10H\u00b7) is formed. It is possible for CoQ10H\u00b7 to react with oxygen (O2) to produce superoxide anion radical (O2\u00b7-), which is a less reactive [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) than LOO\u00b7. However, CoQ10H\u00b7 can also reduce -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH, resulting in the formation of fully oxidized coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which does not react with O2 to form O2\u00b7- (Figure 3) [(6, 8)](#reference6). [[Figure 3 - Click to Enlarge]](/sites/lpi.oregonstate.edu/files/coenzyme-q10-figure-3-1200.png) Deficiency Coenzyme Q10 deficiency has not been described in the general population, so it is generally assumed that normal [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis), with or without a varied diet, provides sufficient coenzyme Q10 to sustain energy production in healthy individuals [(9)](#reference9). Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. To date, mutations in at least nine of these genes have been identified [(1)](#references). As a result, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a clinically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) disorder that includes five major phenotypes: (i) severe infantile multi-systemic disease, (ii) encephalomyopathy, (iii) cerebellar [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), (iv) isolated (v) nephrotic syndrome. Whereas most [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) disorders are hardly amenable to treatments, oral coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been shown to improve muscular symptoms in some (yet not all) patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(10)](#reference10). [Neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in patients with [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency results from mutations or deletions in genes that are not directly related to coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway. Evidence of secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has been reported in several mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial [DNA](../glossary#DNA) depletion syndrome, Kearns-Sayre (MADD) [(10)](#reference10). Secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency has also been identified in non-mitochondrial disorders, such as cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Niemann-Pick-type C disease [(11)](#reference11). Because the therapeutic potential of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 is limited to its capacity to restore [electron](../glossary#electron) transfer in a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain and/or to increase [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) defense, patients with secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency may fail to respond to supplementation (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Coenzyme Q10 concentrations have been found to decline gradually with age in a number of different tissues [(5](#reference5), [12)](#reference12), but it is unclear whether this age-associated decline constitutes a deficiency (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(13)](#reference13). Decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of coenzyme individuals [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (see activity 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (statins), inhibitors [statins]](#statins)), although it remains unproven that this has any clinical implications. Disease Prevention Aging According to the [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) theories of aging, [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of cell structures by [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) plays an important role in the functional declines that accompany aging [(14)](#reference14). ROS are generated by mitochondria as a byproduct of [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production. If not neutralized by [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), ROS may damage mitochondria over time, causing them to function less efficiently and to generate more damaging ROS in a self-perpetuating cycle. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in mitochondrial ATP synthesis and functions as an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes (see [Biological Activities](#biological-activities)). One of the hallmarks of aging is a decline in energy metabolism in many tissues, especially liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Tissue concentrations of coenzyme Q10 have been found to decline with age, thereby accompanying age-related declines in energy metabolism [(12)](#reference12). Early animal studies have not been able to demonstrate an effect of lifelong dietary [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 on the lifespan of rats or mice [(15-17)](#reference15). Nonetheless, more recent studies have suggested that supplemental coenzyme Q10 could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and delay senescence in transgenic mice [(19)](#reference19). Presently, there is limited scientific evidence to suggest that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prolongs life or prevents age-related functional declines in humans. In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), elderly individuals (>70 years) who received a combination of selenium (100 \u00b5g/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) for four years reported an improvement in vitality, physical performance, and quality of life [(20)](#reference20). Further, a 12-year follow-up of these participants showed a reduction in [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) mortality with supplemental selenium and coenzyme lipoproteins](../glossary#LDL) (LDL) in arterial walls is thought to represent an early event leading to the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). Reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) inhibits the oxidation of LDL in the test tube ( [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro)) and works together with -tocopherol (-TOH) LDL oxidation by regenerating -TO\u00b7 back to -TOH. In the absence of a co- [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant), such as CoQ10H2 or vitamin C, -TO\u00b7 can, under certain conditions, promote the oxidation of LDL in vitro [(6)](#reference6). [Supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 increases the concentration of CoQ10H2 in human LDL [(22)](#reference22). Studies in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, an animal model found lipoprotein oxidation in the blood vessel wall and the formation of atherosclerotic lesions [(23)](#reference23). Interestingly, co-supplementation of these mice with -TOH and coenzyme Q10 was more effective in inhibiting atherosclerosis supplementation with either -TOH or coenzyme Q10 alone [(24)](#reference24). Another important step in the development of atherosclerosis is the recruitment of immune cells known as [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte) into the blood vessel walls. This recruitment is dependent in part on monocyte expression of cell adhesion molecules (integrins). Supplementation of 10 healthy men and women with 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 10 weeks resulted in significant decreases in monocyte expression of integrins, suggesting another potential mechanism for the coenzyme Q10 inhibitor of LDL oxidation and atherosclerosis, more research is needed to determine whether coenzyme Q10 supplementation can inhibit the development or progression of atherosclerosis in humans. Disease Treatment Primary and secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiencies Inherited coenzyme Q10 deficiencies are rare diseases that are clinically and genetically [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In individuals with primary coenzyme in adults) may improve the [pathological](../glossary#pathology) phenotype, yet the effectiveness depends on the type of [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic coenzyme Q10 essential to limit irreversible organ damage in coenzyme Q10-responsive deficiencies [(1)](#references). It is not clear to what extent coenzyme Q10 supplementation might have therapeutic benefit in patients with inherited secondary Q10 deficiencies. For example, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), caused by mutations in [genes](../glossary#gene) that impair the activity of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron) from acyl-CoA to coenzyme Q10, is usually responsive to [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin) [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) yet patients with low coenzyme Q10 concentrations might benefit from co-supplementation with coenzyme Q10 and riboflavin [(27)](#reference27). Another study suggested clinical improvements in secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency with supplemental coenzyme Q10 in patients presenting with [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia) [(28)](#reference28). Because the cause of secondary coenzyme Q10 in inherited conditions is generally unknown, it is difficult to predict whether improving coenzyme Q10 status with supplemental coenzyme Q10 would lead to clinical benefits for the patients. Finally, coenzyme Q10 deficiency can be secondary to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statin drugs (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six small, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no reduction in statin-induced muscle pain with 100 to 400 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for one to three months [(29)](#reference29). The trials failed to establish a diagnosis of relative coenzyme Q10 deficiency before the [intervention](../glossary#intervention-trial) started, hence limiting the conclusion of the meta-analysis. While statin therapy may not necessary lead to a reduction in circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations, further research needs to examine whether secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency might be predisposing patients to statin-induced [myalgia](../glossary#myalgia) [(30)](#reference30). Cardiovascular disease Congestive heart failure Impairment of the heart's ability to pump enough blood for all of the body's needs is known as [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure). In [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), accumulation of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaque in the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-arteries) may prevent parts of the cardiac muscle from getting adequate blood supply, ultimately resulting in heart damage and impaired pumping ability. Heart failure can also be caused by [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure), diseases of the heart valves, [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), and [congenital](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) heart diseases. Because physical exercise increases the demand on the weakened heart, measures of exercise tolerance are frequently used to monitor the severity of heart failure. [Echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography) is also used to determine the left [ventricular](../glossary#ventricles) ejection fraction, an objective measure of the heart's pumping ability [(31)](#reference31). A study of 1,191 heart failure patients found that low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration was a good [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of advanced heart disease [(32)](#reference32). A number of small [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) that administered [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 to congestive heart failure patients have been conducted. A 2014 literature review identified seven small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation (60-200 mg/day for 3 months in most trials) in heart failure patients [(33)](#reference33). Pooling data from some of the trials showed an increase in [serum](../glossary#serum) coenzyme Q10 concentrations (three studies) but no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (two studies) or exercise capacity (two studies) [(33)](#reference33). However, a recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in 2,149 participants with heart failure found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (30-300 mg/day) resulted in a 39% reduction in mortality (seven studies), improved exercise capacity (four studies), but had no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (nine studies) compared to placebo [(34)](#reference34). A trial is presently being conducted to assess the value of supplemental coenzyme Q10 and/or D-ribose in the treatment of congestive heart failure in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction [(35)](#reference35). Ischemia-reperfusion injury The heart muscle may become oxygen-deprived ( [ischemic](../glossary#ischemia)) as the result of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or during cardiac surgery. Increased generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) when the heart muscle's oxygen supply is restored (reperfusion) might be an important contributor to myocardial damage occurring during ischemia-reperfusion [(36)](#reference36). Pretreatment of animals with coenzyme Q10 has been found to preserve myocardial function following ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing [ATP](../glossary#ATP) concentration, enhancing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage), regulating [autophagy](../glossary#autophagy), and reducing cardiomyocyte [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(37)](#reference37). Another potential source of ischemia-reperfusion injury is aortic clamping during some types of cardiac surgery, such as [coronary artery bypass graft](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) (CABG) surgery. (60-300 mg/day for 7-14 days prior to surgery) provided some benefit in short-term outcome measures after CABG surgery [(38, 39)](#reference38). In a small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 30 patients, oral administration of coenzyme Q10 for 7 to 10 days before CABG surgery reduced the need for mediastinal drainage, [platelet](../glossary#platelet) transfusion, and positive inotropic drugs (e.g. dopamine) and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia) within 24 hours post-surgery [(40)](#reference40). In one trial that did not find preoperative coenzyme Q10 supplementation to be of benefit, patients were treated with 600 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours prior to surgery [(41)](#reference41), suggesting that preoperative coenzyme Q10 treatment may need to commence at least one week prior to CABG surgery to improve surgical outcomes. The combined two weeks before CABG surgery and four weeks after was examined in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 117 patients with heart failure [(42)](#reference42). The treatment resulted in lower concentration of troponin-I (a marker of cardiac injury), shorter length of hospital stay, and reduced risk of postoperative transient cardiac dysfunction compared to placebo [(42)](#reference42). Although trials have included relatively few people and examined mostly short-term, post-surgical outcomes, the results are promising [(43)](#reference43). Periprocedural myocardial injury [Coronary angioplasty](../glossary#angiography) (also called percutaneous coronary intervention) is a nonsurgical procedure for treating obstructive [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), including unstable [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris), acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and multivessel coronary heart disease. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to help restore the blood flow to the heart. Periprocedural myocardial injury that occurs in up to one-third of patients undergoing otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty increases the risk of morbidity and mortality at follow-up. A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) followed 55 patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack characterized by the death of some myocardial tissue) who underwent angioplasty [(44)](#reference44). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration month correlated with less [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and predicted favorable left ventricular end-systolic volume remodeling at six months [(44)](#reference44). One [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) has examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on periprocedural myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [(45)](#reference45). The administration of 300 mg of coenzyme Q10 12 hours before the angioplasty to 50 patients reduced the concentration of [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) ([CRP]; a marker of inflammation) within 24 hours following the procedure compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo). However, there was no difference in concentrations of two markers of myocardial injury (creatine kinase and troponin-I) or in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events one month after angioplasty between active treatment and placebo [(45)](#reference45). Additional trials are needed to examine whether coenzyme Q10 therapy can improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Angina pectoris Myocardial [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia) may also lead to known as [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris). People with angina pectoris often experience symptoms when the demand for oxygen exceeds the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver it to the heart muscle, e.g., during exercise. Five small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have examined the effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (60-600 mg/day) in addition to conventional medical therapy in patients with chronic stable angina [(46)](#reference46). In most of the studies, coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved exercise tolerance and reduced or delayed [electrocardiographic](../glossary#electrocardiogram) changes associated with myocardial ischemia compared to placebo. However, only two of the studies found significant decreases in symptom frequency and use of nitroglycerin with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Presently, there is only limited evidence suggesting that coenzyme Q10 supplementation would be a useful [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional angina therapy. Hypertension Very few high-quality trials have examined the potential therapeutic benefit of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in the treatment of primary review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that found little evidence of a reduction in [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) or [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) following the administration of coenzyme Q10 (100-200 mg/day) for three months [(47)](#reference47). In contrast, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that used less stringent selection criteria included 17 small trials and found evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in patients with [cardiovascular metabolic disorders [(48)](#reference48). The effect of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure needs to be examined in large, well-designed [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). Cardiovascular risk factors Endothelial dysfunction: endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) promotes blood vessel relaxation ( [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation)) when needed (for example, during exercise) and inhibits the formation of blood clots. [Atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) is associated with impairment of vascular endothelial function, thereby compromising vasodilation and normal blood flow. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in individuals with elevated serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations, as well as in patients with [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). A 2012 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) examining the results of five small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 194 subjects in total found that supplemental coenzyme Q10 (150-300 mg/day for 4 to 12 weeks) resulted in a clinically significant, 1.7% increase in flow-dependent endothelial-mediated dilation [(49)](#reference49). Evidence from larger studies is needed to further establish the effect of coenzyme Q10 on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Inflammation: Several in patients at increased [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) risk or with established cardiovascular disease have examined the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 for 3 months on circulating [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) markers i.e., [CRP](../glossary#c-reactive-protein), interleukin-6, and/or tumor necrosis factor-. Recently published pooled analyses of these trials have given mixed results [(50-52)](#reference50). Larger studies are needed to examine the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on low-grade inflammation. Blood lipids: Elevated an independent [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six controlled trials (of which five were randomized) in 409 participants found a reduction in plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration with coenzyme Q10 supplementation Q10 on blood lipids have not been reported [(51, 53, 54)](#reference51). A therapeutic approach combining coenzyme Q10 with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) might prove to be more effective to target co-existing metabolic disorders in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease [(55)](#reference55). Diabetes mellitus [Diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) is a condition of increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of reduced coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) have been found to be lower in diabetic patients than healthy controls after normalization to plasma [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) concentrations [(56, 57)](#reference56). [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that examined the effect of coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) found little evidence of benefits on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of six trials in participants with type 2 diabetes and one trial in participants with type 1 diabetes found that 100 to 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for three to six months lowered neither fasting plasma [glucose](../glossary#glucose) nor levels of [glycated hemoglobin](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) ([HbA1c]; a measure of glycemic control). Maternally inherited diabetes mellitus-deafness syndrome (MIDD) is caused by a [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [DNA](../glossary#DNA), which is inherited exclusively from one's mother. MIDD accounts for less than 1% of all cases of diabetes. Some early evidence suggested that long-term coenzyme Q10 supplementation (150 mg/day) may improve [insulin](../glossary#insulin) secretion and prevent progressive hearing loss in these patients [(58, 59)](#reference58). Of note, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves the early onset of [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and hyperinsulinemia associated with the progressive loss of tissue responsiveness to insulin. Recent experimental studies tied [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) to a decrease in coenzyme Q10 expression and supplementation might thus be a more useful tool for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes rather than for its management. Neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson's disease [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) is a degenerative [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) disorder characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow movements. It is estimated to affect approximately 1% of Americans over the age of 65. [Mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra may play a role in the development of the disease [(60)](#reference60). Decreased ratios of [reduced](../glossary#reduction)-to- [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) coenzyme Q10 have been in [platelets](../glossary#platelet) of individuals with Parkinson's disease [(61, 62)](#reference61). One study also found higher concentrations of oxidized coenzyme Q10 in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with untreated Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a study in postmortem Parkinson's disease patients found lower concentrations of total coenzyme Q10 in the cortex region of the brain compared to age-matched controls, but no differences were seen in other brain areas, including the striatum, clinical trial](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) evaluated the safety and efficacy of 300, 600, or 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 in 80 people with early Parkinson's disease [(65)](#reference65). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was well tolerated at all doses and resulted in a slower deterioration of function in Parkinson's disease patients in the group taking 1,200 mg/day. A [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) was then designed to further examine the effect of motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. This trial was prematurely terminated because it was unlikely that such a treatment was effective in treating Parkinson's disease [(66)](#reference66). A smaller placebo-controlled trial showed that oral administration of 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for 48 to 96 months moderately improved motor symptoms in treated patients (with Levodopa) with re-emerging symptoms but not in patients at an early stage of the disease [(67)](#reference67). Two recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of randomized, placebo-controlled trials found no evidence that coenzyme Q10 improved motor-related symptoms or delayed the progression of the disease when compared to placebo [(68, 69)](#reference68). Huntington's disease [Huntington's disease](../glossary#huntington-disease) is an inherited [neurodegenerative disorder](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by selective degeneration of nerve cells known as striatal spiny neurons. Symptoms, such as movement disorders and impaired [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, typically develop in the fourth decade of life and progressively deteriorate over time. Animal models indicate that impaired [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) function and [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate)-mediated neurotoxicity may be involved in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of Huntington's disease. Some, but not all, studies in mouse models of Huntington's disease have suggested that coenzyme Q10 supplementation could improve motor performance, overall survival, and various hallmarks of Huntington's disease, antagonist), the antibiotic minocycline, or creatine led to greater improvements in most biochemical and behavioral parameters [(70-72)](#reference70). To date, only two [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have examined whether coenzyme Q10 might be efficacious in human patients with Huntington's disease. A 30-month, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial of coenzyme Q10 (600 mg/day), remacemide, or both in 347 patients with early Huntington's disease found that neither coenzyme Q10 nor remacemide significantly altered the decline in total functional capacity, although coenzyme Q10 supplementation (with or without remacemide) resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward a slower decline [(73)](#reference73). A 20-week [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study) examined the safety and tolerability increasing dosages of coenzyme Q10 (1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day, and 3,600 mg/day) in eight healthy subjects and in 20 patients with Huntington's disease; 22 of the subjects completed the study [(74)](#reference74). All dosages were generally well tolerated, with [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms being the most frequently reported adverse effect. Blood concentrations of coenzyme Q10 at the end of the study were maximized with the daily dose of 2,400 mg [(74)](#reference74). This dose was tested in a multicenter [phase III clinical trial](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial) in 609 participants with early-stage Huntington's disease. Participants were randomized to receive either 2,400 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or placebo for five years [(75)](#reference75). The trial was prematurely halted because it appeared unlikely to demonstrate any health benefit in supplemented patients \u2014 about one-third of participants completed the trial at the time of study termination [(75)](#reference75). Although coenzyme Q10 is generally well tolerated, there is no evidence that supplementation can improve functional and cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease patients. Inherited the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) frataxin. Frataxin for the making of [iron](../minerals/iron)-sulfur clusters (ISC). ISC-containing subunits are especially important for the mitochondrial [respiratory for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing proteins [(76)](#reference76). Frataxin deficiency is associated with imbalances in iron-sulfur containing proteins, mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and lower [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production, and accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, which increases [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to macromolecules of the respiratory chain [(77)](#reference77). Clinically, FRDA is a progressive disease characterized by [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), [areflexia](../glossary#areflexia), speech disturbance (dysarthria), sensory loss, to 10 FDRA patients found that energy [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of cardiac and skeletal muscle was improved after only three months of therapy [(78)](#reference78). Follow-up assessments at 47 months indicated that cardiac and skeletal muscle improvements were maintained and that FRDA patients showed significant increases in fractional shortening, a measure of cardiac function. Moreover, the therapy was effective at preventing the progressive decline of [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) function [(79)](#reference79). Another study reported both coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E deficiencies among FRDA patients and suggested that co-supplementation with both compounds, at doses as low as 30 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 and 4 IU/day of vitamin E, might improve disease symptoms [(80)](#reference80). Large-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are necessary to determine whether coenzyme Q10, in conjunction with vitamin E, has therapeutic benefit in FRDA. At present, about one-half of patients use coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) despite the lack of proven therapeutic benefit [(77)](#reference77). Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs): SCAs are a group of rare [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) dominant [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by gait difficulty, loss of hand dexterity, dysarthria, and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline. SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 most common SCAs [(81)](#reference81). [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) coenzyme Q10 treatment of forearm skin [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) isolated from patients with SCA2 was found to reduce [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and normalize complex I and II-III [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) [(82)](#reference82). A cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 319 patients with SCAs (15 years) found no difference in the rate of disease progression over two years between those taking [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) coenzyme Q10 (median dose, 600 mg/day) and nonusers [(81)](#reference81). Cancer Early interest in coenzyme Q10 as a potential therapeutic agent in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) was stimulated by an [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) that found that individuals with lung, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and especially breast cancer were more likely to have low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentrations than healthy controls [(83)](#reference83). Two [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have explored the effect of coenzyme Q10 as an [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) to conventional therapy for breast cancer. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 failed to improve measures of fatigue and quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer [(84)](#reference84) and in patients receiving [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) [(85)](#reference85). Performance Athletic performance There is little evidence that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with coenzyme Q10 improves athletic performance in healthy individuals. A few [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined the effects of 100 to 150 mg/day of supplemental coenzyme Q10 for three to eight weeks on physical performance in trained and untrained men. Most did not find significant differences between the group taking coenzyme Q10 and the group taking placebo with respect to measures of aerobic exercise performance, such as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and exercise time to exhaustion [(86-90)](#reference86). One study found the maximal cycling workload to be slightly (4%) increased after eight weeks of coenzyme Q10 supplementation compared to placebo, although measures of aerobic power were not increased [(91)](#reference91). Two studies actually found significantly greater improvement in measures of anaerobic [(87)](#reference87) and aerobic [(86)](#reference86) exercise performance with a placebo than with supplemental coenzyme Q10. More recent studies have suggested that coenzyme Q10 could help reduce both muscle damage-associated [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and low-grade [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) induced by strenuous exercise [(92-95)](#reference92). Studies on the effect of supplementation on physical performance in women are lacking, but there is little reason to suspect a gender difference in the response to coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Sources Biosynthesis Coenzyme Q10 The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 involves three major steps: (1) synthesis of the benzoquinone structure from 4-hydroxybenzoate derived from either tyrosine or phenylalanine, two amino acids; (2) synthesis of the polyisoprenoid side chain from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) via the mevalonate pathway; and (3) the joining (condensation) of these two structures to form coenzyme Q10. In the mevalonate pathway, biosynthetic pathways of both coenzyme and pyridoxine ( [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)), in the form of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, is required for the conversion of tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid that constitutes the first step in the biosynthesis of the benzoquinone structure of coenzyme Q10. It is not known to what extent the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway may be affected by inadequate pantothenic acid and/or vitamin B6 nutritional [status](../glossary#status). Food sources It has been estimated that dietary consumption contributes to about 25% of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10, but there are currently no specific dietary intake recommendations for coenzyme Q10 from the US National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) or other agencies [(96)](#reference96). The extent to which dietary consumption contributes to tissue coenzyme Q10 concentrations is not clear. Based on studies employing [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire), the average dietary intake of coenzyme Q10 is about 3 to 6 mg/day [(97)](#reference97). Rich sources of dietary coenzyme Q10 include mainly meat, poultry, and fish. Other good sources include soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils; nuts; and seeds. Fruit, vegetables, eggs, and dairy products are moderate sources of coenzyme Q10 [(97)](#reference97). Some dietary sources are listed in Table 1. Table 1.

Doses in supplements for adults range from 30 to 100 mg/day, which are considerably higher than typically estimated dietary coenzyme Q10 intakes. Coenzyme Q10 is fat-soluble and is best absorbed with fat in a meal. Doses higher than 100 mg/day are generally divided into two or three doses throughout the day [(101)](#reference101). Less than 5% of orally administered coenzyme Q10 is thought to reach the circulation [(102)](#reference102). Therefore, [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of coenzyme Q10 as high as 1,200 to 3,000 mg/day for adults and 30 mg/kg/day for children are usually needed to relieve symptoms in patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency [(26)](#reference26). Does oral Oral supplementation with coenzyme Q10 is known to increase blood and to reach a supplementation with a dose of 2,400 mg/day [(103, 104)](#reference103). Yet, under normal circumstances, uptake of supplemental coenzyme Q10 from peripheral tissues/organs is likely limited because is ubiquitously [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) [(105)](#reference105). Nonetheless, under aging) or in [pathologies](../glossary#pathology), coenzyme Q10 [status](../glossary#status) might be compromised and it is then presumed that supplementation might increase coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues that are deficient [(106)](#reference106). For example, a study in 24 older adults supplemented with 300 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for at least seven days prior to cardiac surgery found that the coenzyme Q10 content of atrial tissue was significantly increased in those taking coenzyme Q10, especially in patients greater than 70 years of age [(38)](#reference38). In another study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction, supplementation with 150 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 for four weeks before cardiac surgery increased coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the heart but not in skeletal muscle [(107)](#reference107). Finally, a 2007 review of the literature highlighted that plasma coenzyme Q10 concentrations higher than 'normal' were likely needed to promote coenzyme Q10 uptake by peripheral tissues and different tissues may indeed require different plasma thresholds for the uptake of coenzyme Q10 [(102)](#reference102). Safety Toxicity There have been no reports of significant adverse side effects of oral coenzyme Q10 [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) at doses as high as 3,000 mg/day for up to eight months [(103)](#reference103), 1,200 mg/day for up to 16 months [(65)](#reference65), and 600 mg/day for up to 30 months [(73)](#reference73). According to the observed safe level (OSL) risk assessment method, evidence of safety is strong with doses up to 1,200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 [(108)](#reference108). Some people have experienced [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, appetite suppression, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort, especially with daily doses 200 mg [(109)](#reference109). These adverse effects may be minimized if daily doses >100 mg are divided into two or three daily doses [(101)](#reference101). During pregnancy, the use of coenzyme Q10 supplements (100 mg twice daily) from 20 weeks' [gestation](../glossary#gestation) was found to be safe [(110)](#reference110). Because reliable data in lactating women are not available, supplementation should be avoided during breast-feeding [(110)](#reference110). Drug interactions use of warfarin (Coumadin) and coenzyme Q10 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been reported to decrease the [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of warfarin in a few cases [(111)](#reference111). An individual on warfarin should not begin taking coenzyme Q10 supplements without consulting the health care provider who is managing his or her anticoagulant therapy. If warfarin and coenzyme Q10 are to be used concomitantly, blood tests to assess clotting time (prothrombin time; PT/INR) should be monitored frequently, especially in the first two weeks. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) HMG-CoA reductase is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that a biochemical common are widely used as cholesterol-lowering medications. Statins can thus also reduce the [endogenous](../glossary#endogenous) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) coenzyme Q10 [plasma](../glossary#plasma) coenzyme Q10 concentration by the concentration of circulating lipids [(122, 123)](#reference122). It is likely that circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations are decreased because statins reduce circulating lipids rather than because they inhibit coenzyme Q10 synthesis [(124)](#reference124). In addition, very few studies have examined coenzyme Q10 concentrations in tissues other than blood such that the extent to which statin therapy affects coenzyme Q10 concentrations in the body's tissues is unknown [(118](#reference118), [120](#reference120), [125)](#reference125). Finally, there is currently little evidence to suggest that secondary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is responsible for statin-associated muscle symptoms in treated patients. In addition, supplementation with coenzyme Q10 failed to (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)) [(126, 127)](#reference126).
