In the last year we have all been through an experiment with our reality like no other in human history and it is global. I have spent my spare time learning from such luminaries as Joe Dispensa and Larry Dossey who have helped to me understand the unified field of consciousness that is within us and all around us. Their books Becoming Supernatural and One Mind both show how we are part of a unified field of intelligence that creates and maintains our bodies and our minds. Greg Braden and Bruce Lipton have taught me how important our beliefs are in creating our physiology through their books The Science of Self Empowerment and Spontaneous Evolution and The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles have taught me how important our beliefs are in creating our biology. Here is a quote from Bruce Lipton, \"It is not gene-directed hormones and neurotransmitters that control our bodies and our minds; our beliefs control our bodies, our minds, and thus our lives ... Oh ye of little belief!\" I know of no other belief that needs to be upgraded as our current cultural understanding of what a virus is. We have been taught that viruses cause disease and need to be controlled with vaccines. What is a virus? Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as, \"any of a large group of submicroscopic infectious agents that are usually regarded as nonliving extremely complex molecules, that typically contain a protein coat surrounding an RNA or DNA core of genetic material but no semipermeable membrane, that are capable of growth and multiplication only in living cells, and that cause various important diseases in humans, animals, and plants\" Yes; this is the story that we have been told to believe about virus. They are infectious agents that cause diseases in living beings on planet earth. In other words, fear them! The latest science shows us they are so much more. They are created by living organisms as a result of stress from the environment. Bacteria, fungus and multi-cellular organisms all create virus as a means of communication and adaption to our surroundings. The science is showing that the air around us has 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 viruses in it that we are breathing all the time. The water has the same amount and the soil 10 with one less 0 at the end. The virus, bacteria, and fungus were here long before humans arrived 200,000 years ago. In and on our body, they are known as the human microbiota. We actually have as many microbiota as we have human cells. We also have 10,000,000,000,000,000 viruses in our blood stream. Science is learning that our connection and relationship with these organisms help create health or disease and adaption or illness. Anywhere from 8% to 52% of the human genome (our genetic makeup) is from viral insertion into our DNA. This idea is a profound difference from what Merriam-Webster has to say about virus. This new theory posits that virus are created by living organisms to communicate with other organisms to help adapt and evolve based on the epigenetic challenges of the environment. The CDC defines epigenetics as, \"Your genes play an important role in your health, but so do your behaviors and environment, such as what you eat and how physically active you are. Epigenetics is the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence\". We have been led to believe that we are victims of our genes and that they dictate our biology and behavior. It is now known that epigenetics (environment and lifestyle) is much more important than genetics (DNA blueprints) in over 95% of disease. To learn more about this whole topic I recommend going to: [https://zachbushmd.com/knowledge-virome/](https://zachbushmd.com/knowledge-virome/) The genetic material in the virus must make it passed our first line of defense known as the innate immune system. This was the topic of my last email and it consists of many biological barriers (structural components) and immune cells (biochemical components) in order to get into the cell that they target. These barriers include the skin, the mucus membranes of the nasal passages, sinuses, trachea, bronchi, lungs, mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines and the blood brain barrier. These barriers are under attack by products like roundup (GLYPHOSATE) which not only kill weeds in your yard but also kill probiotic organisms in and on your body. These beneficial bacteria help protect these barriers. If the virus gets through these epithelial barriers and reach a target cell then they have to try to cross the barrier of the cell membrane. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 the protein spikes on the outside of the virus are the keys that open the door known as the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 receptor, which is the lock, is located in the cell membrane of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. Thus, these are the areas where we see symptoms in the covid19 disease. A natural way to prevent the virus from unlocking the door and entering the cell is to eat a diet high in polyphenols. Polyphenols are most common in fruits and vegetables and give them their characteristic colors. Here is link to an article on polyphenols: https://simplyhealth.today/14-foods-rich-in-polyphenols/ So, eat a diet rich in rainbow-colored foods which are high in polyphenols. If you want to use supplements there is early-stage research that quercetin, a polyphenol, works well in lowering the SARS-CoV-2 viruses' ability to attach to the ACE2 receptor. Polyphenols have also been shown to lower the ability of the virus to replicate once it enters the cell. For those who want to read a scientific journal report here is the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799320300679 Once the virus genetic material gets into the cell the innate immune system will regulate whether this genetic material will be replicated by the cell or not. In the last email sent to patients of Back to Health Wellness Center we discussed the innate immune system and I called it the elephant in the room concerning this pandemic. Recently; I was glad to see someone agreeing with me. Go to: https://zachbushmd.com/innate-immune-system/ and learn more details about what the innate immune system is and why it is so important today! I suggest to not click on the link at the top of the page that says under it, watch the replay. This link takes you to a 2-hour video that would be worth it after you have read and watched what is on your arrival page. Watch the 20-minute video entitled, Zach Bush MD: Knowledge - Innate Immune System by scrolling down the page. The relationship between the innate immune and the viral genetic material is very complex. The process has many steps before the viral RNA or DNA will be used to create new proteins by the cell as discussed in the above link. It is the job of the innate immunity to decide if the virus is going to be beneficial to homeostasis and should be allowed to replicate and possibly even enter our DNA by reverse transcription. Or does the system stop the virus by degrading it via the various cellular defenders like neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, dendritic cells, basophils, natural killer cells and mast cells. Back in March I recommended a number of natural products that support the innate immunity. One of them is zinc. What I learned recently is that zinc is very important to have in our cells because it is used as cofactor in stopping viruses from replicating once they enter a cell. In fact, recent studies show that both hydroxychloroquine and quinine help get zinc across the cell membrane and into the cell. This is an action that helps prevent serious complications from the virus. These studies are showing that people who were zinc deficient to begin with did not respond to the hydroxychloroquine treatment. So, take your zinc, 15mg/ day and you should drink Fever Tree Tonic WaterLight which contains quinine and less sugar then the other tonic waters. Sugar causes inflammation which predisposes you to increased symptoms. Another interesting paper on natural treatments for covid19 is entitled, Endogenous Deficiency of Glutathione as the Most Likely Cause of Serious Manifestations and Death in COVID-19 Patients. Here is link to the Pub Med abstract: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463221/ If you contract covid19 please let us know right away as I can prescribe nebulized glutathione as part of my APC license. We have had only one patient who has had covid19. She then recovered and later came into the office for nutritional evaluation. I was appalled that her medical advice was to go home and rest and if symptoms get worse and you can't breathe go to the emergency room. This patient has numerous conditions that make her high-risk for complications including diabetes and Hashimoto's disease and her age. Fortunately, she had been following my recommendations from the first email I sent out back in March 2020. So even with her comorbidities she recovered from the illness. The world we live in today is very different from any other time in history on an environmental, healthcare, food production, economic and political level. There are unprecedented levels of toxicity that we are all living with and that are actually creating the viruses that are designed to upgrade our biology to evolve in way to live with this stress. I know this concept is foreign to most of us. The places that were most hard hit by covid19 are the places with the worst air pollution effecting the lungs of the populace. They are also where the advent of 5th generation cellular microwave phone transmission started. For example, Wuhan China where 5th generation started in October 2019 and the virus started in December 2019. Northern Italy launched its first 5th generation cellular in June of 2019. New York City launched its first 5th generation cellular in August 2019. I know this is controversial but the science behind this concept is quite compelling. Please refer to The Invisible Rainbow by Arthur Fistenberg or the research of Martin Pall, PhD. Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Sciences Washington State University. If you would like more details on this please email me at chazdoc@gmail.com and I will send you his publication 5G Risk: The Scientific Perspective Compelling Evidence for Eight Distinct Types of Great Harm Caused by Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Exposures and the So, once again I'm recommending to boost your innate immune system. When this system is stressed by nutrient deficiencies, air, water, food and electromagnetic pollution, other comorbidities, and inflammation it cannot stop the entry of the virus into the body and then into the cell. 80% of the people who contract the virus have few or no symptoms. Their innate immune system is working. Then, they create humoral immunity through the acquired immune system which makes antibodies to stop further challenges from this virus. This takes about a month to happen. This is the system that vaccines work on. It is outrageous to me that our medical system and media only cover and recommend an approach that is a secondary system to the interaction of the body to viruses. We are also seeing that the United States has the worst fatality statistics of all the developed countries. What this really means is that we have the worst innate immune systems due to our diet, pollution and our healthcare system. Even so the latest results show that fatalities rates are below 1% for all age groups. Young people have very little potential for death from covid19. It is less then 1 in 100.000. Our bodies are amazingly complex and this blog is to help you to understand that all this miraculous immunity happens by our subconscious autonomic nerve, endocrine and immune systems. Our subconscious is 1,000,000 times greater at processing sensory data then our conscious mind is. It is connected to the unified field of consciousness that is outside time and space and holds all possible potential. This universal intelligence is within you and all around you. Think about that and what your body is doing this very second in response to its environment. Has this helped you to have a better understanding of what a virus is and what our relationship to it is? Do you still believe that an inert, non-living genetic substance is out to get us and we need to be fearful? Or do you now understand that viruses make up a large % of our DNA and are found in all aspects of nature and are really here to help us adapt and evolve with our environment. We should not be at war with them we should create a symbiotic relationship with their wisdom. "}
