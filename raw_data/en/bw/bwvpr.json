With these vaccinations come several drawbacks which may be of concern to some. The main issue with negative effects of vaccinations comes from the inclusion of heavy metals aluminum and mercury as preservatives in the vaccines. The potential for these heavy metals to harm the body is very real. In addition to the toxic metals present in vaccines, most of them also contain formaldehyde, which causes damage to multiple body systems. In this newsletter we will explore some of ways one may detoxify the body from the heavy metals and other deleterious compounds in vaccines. Detoxification & Liver Proper liver function is critical to the body's detoxification processes, of course, but even more so with heavy metal removal. Basic liver function needs to be carried out effectively as the liver uses bile to get rid of mercury and other toxic metals. The amino acid [taurine](search?noheadings=1&keywords=taurine&under_cat_id=1) is a major constituent of bile, and may be helpful here as it is also a sulfur-containing amino acid. Sulfur is a powerful detoxifying agent and is depleted by heavy metals. The supplement [MSM](search?noheadings=1&keywords=MSM&under_cat_id=1) is biological, available sulfur and is an inexpensive and easy way to boost the body's detoxification pathways. Many of the nutrients which assist heavy metal detoxification unfortunately are depleted by the very heavy metals themselves, so it is important to obtain these critical compounds to help the body's removal of the toxic load. The mineral selenium is a constituent of antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, detoxifying compound. Look for [selenomethionine](search?noheadings=1&keywords=selenomethionine&under_cat_id=1) or yeast-bound selenium, both excellent forms. Heavy metals such as mercury, aluminum, cadmium, and even unbound copper all decrease the body's master detoxifying compound, [glutathione](search?noheadings=1&keywords=glutathione&under_cat_id=1), causing a vicious cycle of destruction and overload as toxins build and build with no protection or removal. There are glutathione supplements readily available, and another way to increase this antioxidant is by taking the amino acid [N-acetyl-cysteine](search?noheadings=1&keywords=NAC&under_cat_id=1) (NAC). NAC and glutathione directly support the liver, helping to protect the body from harmful substances. (See our [newsletter](get-the-nac-n-acetyl-cysteine) on NAC.) Another liver detox pathway impaired by heavy metals is the glucuronidation pathway. [Calcium d-glucarate](search?noheadings=1&keywords=calcium+d-glucarate&under_cat_id=1) supplements support this elimination process and prevent the cessation of toxin removal. Herbal Allies In addition to certain amino acids and minerals involved in detoxification, many plants possess phytochemicals and properties to assist in mobilization and removal of toxic metals. [Turmeric](search?noheadings=1&keywords=turmeric&under_cat_id=1), [milk thistle](search?noheadings=1&keywords=milk+thistle&under_cat_id=1), [schisandra](schisandra-ripe-berry), and [artichoke](artichoke-standardized-extract) all benefit the liver in one capacity or another. Artichoke helps the flow of bile, and thus the excretion of toxins. The green micro-algae [chlorella](search?noheadings=1&keywords=chlorella&under_cat_id=1) is justly famous for its ability to bind to heavy metals such as mercury and facilitate their removal from body tissues. Certain compounds found in seaweeds such as [kelp](search?noheadings=1&keywords=kelp&under_cat_id=1) and bladderwrack also bind to heavy metals and speed removal. [Cilantro](cilantro-heavy-metal-detox) is a powerful agent for transporting toxic metals out of areas such as the brain where they have lodged. It is particularly effective when combined with chlorella. Some other nutrients which are depleted by heavy metal accumulation and may assist in removal are vitamin C and the B vitamins, particularly the [coenzymated (methylated) forms](search?noheadings=1&keywords=coenzymate&under_cat_id=1). The methylation pathway dealing with detoxification is also impaired by heavy metals. A good [multivitamin](search?noheadings=1&keywords=multivitamin&under_cat_id=1) is definitely prudent as well if one is dealing with heavy metals.
