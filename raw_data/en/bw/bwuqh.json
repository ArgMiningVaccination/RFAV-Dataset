The energies of the mineral are transferred to water using the sun by the scientific property of pyroelectricity. Pyroelectricity is an electrified or polarized state in a mineral that results from a change in temperature, in this case through warming by the sun. This electrified state facilitates the transfer of the stone's energy into the water.", "sitename": "Pur Crystal", "date": "2020-11-22", "cleaned_text": "Great healing traditions around the world, such as the Chinese Daoists, have used stone elixirs for thousands of years. This is based on putting specific stones / crystals into water so that the vibration of the stone goes into the water to drink. The great Rosicrucian teacher Rudolf Steiner worked with medical doctor Ita Wegman to create Anthroposophic Medicine, an advanced form of esoteric healing which is practiced by specially trained Medical Doctors around the world; there are even Anthroposophical Medical Hospitals in Germany. Many Anthroposophic Medicine remedies are based on a special form of homeopathic potentization to create powerful energetic remedies. These special potentized remedies are considered in Rosicrucian circles to \"liberate\" and amplify the vital force / spirit locked into the physical matter of the stone. They go beyond simple mineral elixirs which do not apply the Rosicrucian potentization (rhythmic dilutation / succusion) process. Steiner indicated that certain minerals formed on the Earth from the same formative forces which gave rise to organs and functions in the human body, leading to the use of these minerals in potentized form in Anthroposophic Medicine. For example, Steiner indicated the use of Amethyst for all types of Cognitive issues, whether based on physical or psychological damage. The Vesica Institute has worked with a leading Anthroposophic Medicine pharmacy in the United States to create new Homeopathic Mineral Remedies, which have never before been made using Steiner's Potentization method. These are \"Pentas\" Remedies, which combine multiple potentization levels together \u2014 a 'multichord' remedy \u2014 to create an expanded series of energetic effects. These remedies are a limited special run, how long they will remain available is uncertain. Our Potentized Mineral Remedies currently available for a limited time are: - Amethyst Pentas: this is made from the special South African form of Amethyst \"Spirit Quartz\" which has points all over itssurface (seen to the left). The energy projections from all of these terminated points, streaming in every direction, are understood in esoteric circles to support what classical Theosophical texts call the \"Health Aura\" (seen to the right), the rays of energy which radiate in every direction from the healthy human body. This creates a natural \"energy shield\" protecting a person, which is related to the \"Wei Chi\" (Protective Energy) layer of the body described in Daoist Chinese Medicine. Amethyst was described by Rudolf Steiner as being related to healing cognitive issues. This would indicate the possibility of the projections from the Amethyst Spirit Quartz being especially potent in supporting the energy radiations / health aura around the human head, empowering the clarity and strength of thinking forces. - Phenakite Pentas: Phenakite is a very special form of Beryl stone, as described in the \"Phenakite\" section of this document. It is revealed by energetic testing to hold a special vibratory power, of the White Band of the spectrum (White Light) at the Divine Plane level. This Rosicrucian potentized elixir of Phenakite Pentas activates Phenakite power. - Sugilite Pentas: Sugilite is a very important and powerful stone in esoteric healing and in Daoist Chinese Medicine. Its vital essence is freed and amplified further in this special potentized preparation. For all of these Elixirs, they can be used: - In the standard manner, with drops under the tongue. - Dropped onto energy centers on the body. - Placed into a spray bottle and sprayed over areas of the body or energy field.
