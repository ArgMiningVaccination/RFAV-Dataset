While it is only fitting for us to celebrate our achievements throughout this golden anniversary year, it is also critical that we examine current challenges and capital-ize on opportunities that will ensure a bright future for NJMS. We have much to celebrate. As the state's oldest academic medical institution, we have grown from our first entering class of 80 medical students to become acompetitive medical school that receives nearly 4,000 applications annually. Thisyear, three-quarters of our applicants were from out-of-state. Our success is the result of a strong foundation. Throughout the years, we have built upon this foundation to create a rich tradition of quality education,innovative research, compassionate patient care and community outreach. Many of our alumni have gone on to enjoy successful and meaningful careers in patient care, public health, medical research and academic medicine (see fea-ture article on page 12). Their efforts and those of so many of our faculty mem-bers have positively impacted healthcare in New Jersey and beyond. We continue to reassess our role as a leading medical school. With this in mind, the launch this fall of our new Jubilee Curriculum will widen the scope ofour students' education to include more problem-based learning modules,increased clinical experiences and a renewed focus on humanistic medicine. Inpreparing for a reaccreditation visit from the Liaison Committee on MedicalEducation in March 2005, we have had the opportunity to evaluate all of theeducational offerings and services that we provide. It was former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk who once said, \"Unless we can find some way to keep our sights on tomorrow, we cannot expect to be intouch with today.\" This, too, is true for New Jersey Medical School. By lookingahead to the future, we are ensuring that we are making meaningful contribu-tions today. Join us as we celebrate our success.Message from the DeanRussell T.

This state-of-the-art core facility in theMedical Science Building operates equipment valued at morethan $2 million, including the QTOF and the MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometers which search for answers toscientific questions about changes in protein expression in dis-eases. Requests come from all over UMDNJ, outside industryand other institutions, including Johnson & Johnson, MountSinai School of Medicine and Princeton University. \"Ourinvolvement in collaborative research has allowed CAPR toexpand, which has facilitated the understanding of theunknowns in the world of proteins,\" says Hong Li, PhD,NJMS assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biol-ogy, and CAPR director. In order to find therapies and cures and to diagnose diseases, Li says that a better understanding ofthe proteins expressed by the 30,000 genes in the humangenome is critical. \"Proteins, not genes, are what carry out cellular functions,\" Li explains. The word proteome refers to all the functionalproteins produced by the cells under very specific conditions.The MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer can examine2,000 proteins a day. When something goes wrong physically,\"you need to understand the changes in protein expressionfrom genes in order to correct the problem. Have they abnor-mally increased or decreased?\" he asks. Li believes that pro-teins are the future targets for the development of new drugs. Earlier diagnosis for diseases like multiple sclerosis, for instance, will depend upon advances in proteomics. To detectMS now, physicians and patients must simply wait for symp-toms to appear before a diagnosis can be made. However,changes in protein levels could have preceded signs of the dis-ease. Diagnostic kits could be developed based upon particularprotein changes detected by proteomics. From 2001 to 2002, CAPR received approximately $2.3 million in state and federal funding to buy newproteomics equipment. Additional financialsupport now includes a five year, $3.8 milliongrant from the National Institute ofNeurological Diseases and Stroke. \"We'll beproviding a collaborative platform for neurosci-entists to determine protein alterations whenthey focus on diseases like multiple sclerosis,Parkinson's and spinal cord injury. We can also help investigators generate preliminary resultsfor grant applications in those areas,\" says Li. The center is directed by Li with a staff of five researchers. \"Now, we have the capabili-ty of analyzing smaller concentrations of pro-teins and solving more difficult problems.Most of the proteins are in public databases.By comparing just a partial sequence\u2014a snap-shot of a protein\u2014we can identify it.\" A vari-ety services\u2014from protein identifi-cation to large scale proteomics projects\u2014 caneven be ordered easily online at the CAPR Website, http://www.umdnj.edu/proweb.

In November, The University Hospital(UH) became the fourth institution inthe world to use a new technologywhich utilizes a patient's own cells forcuring paralysis. In Israel and Belgium,14 people who were paralyzed took partin the Phase I clinical trial. The prelimi-nary results of that initial trial wereextremely encouraging. UH is now participating in the Phase II, multi-center, clinical trial, accordingto neurosurgeon Robert F . Heary, MD,NJMS associate professor of neurologi-cal surgery, director of The Spine Center at the Neurological Institute of NewJersey in Newark, and one of the princi-pal investigators. He will be workingwith Karen Kepler, MD, assistant pro-fessor of physical medicine and rehabili-tation and medical director of the spinalcord injury program at NJMS. Hearyexplains, \"We'll be taking skin, or der-mis, from inside the upper arm, as wellas blood to produce activatedmacrophages which will then be re-injected into the spinal cord just belowthe lesion. Yes, these are stem cells butnot from a fetus. We are using thepatient's own body to produce the acti-vated macrophages in a method thattakes about 36 hours at a designated,independent cell center in New Jersey.\" Macrophages or white blood cells, according to Proneuron Biotechnolo-gies, developer of ProCord, are thehuman body's first line of defenseagainst injury and illness, secretinggrowth factors that promote a controlledinflammatory reaction. The centralnervous system, which includes thespinal cord, ordinarily has low levels ofthese macrophages, because it is isolatedfrom the bloodstream. Results leading up to this stage demonstrated that patients with littlechance of improvement using traditionalmethods \"showed substantially bettergains than what would have beenexpected. I've been in academic andclinical pursuit of this unique, revolu-tionary treatment for years. I've put allof my energies into spines and spinalcord injury since becoming a physician19 years ago. Now, we're ready to enroll spinal cord injured patients from allacross the country,\" Heary says. This trial is open only to individuals between ages 16 and 65 who have suf-fered what is known as a \"complete\" or\"ASIA-A\" injury, resulting in the fullloss of motor and sensory nerve func-tion below a certain level (motor levelC5 to T11). Not all paralyzed patientsare included because of the risk of fur-ther impairment. Heary explains thatwhen respiratory function is involvedand the patient requires a ventilator forbreathing, or when the injury is abovelevel C5 on the spinal cord, the chanceof causing additional harm is too great.In this trial, the window of time is alsolimited. Candidates for the proceduremust be enrolled and have the ProCordadministered between five and 14 daysafter the initial injury. Waiting five days is key because some patients begin torecover on their own by then. Amongindividuals who experience no change insensory and motor function five daysafter an accident and who are still inthis immediate, or acute, phase, \"theoverwhelming majority rarely improve. \"What makes spinal cord injury so tragic is that these are people who arestruck down at their most productive,dynamic time of life,\" Heary says.\"Current conventional treatment offersthem little improvement. When toldthey might have a chance to do some-thing or to become part of a veryunique and exciting study of a revolu-tionary treatment, every one of themwould say, 'Yes.' I know it. I've heardthem wish it.\" Referring physicians can contact the UH study coordinator, 24 hours aday, at 973-641-0600.

It's the future New Jersey Medical School-University Hospital(NJMS-UH) Cancer Center. \"Walk over but take a hard hat to wear,\" warns Harvey L. Ozer, MD, the director and a driving force behind this nine-story, 211,615 square-foot, high-tech facility. \"Barring major delays, we're talking about opening at the end of 2005 or earlyin 2006.\" The Cancer Center is an affiliate of the UMDNJCancer Institute of New Jersey. It is being constructed as partof the UMDNJ Capital Facilities initiative on the Newarkcampus as a joint effort of NJMS and UH. In addition, therehave been two construction grants from the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) for $3 million and $3.7 million.The state of New Jersey is providing $9 million. Physically connected to UH, the first three floors will be devoted to ambulatory clinical care and are designed to fillwith natural sunlight for cancer patients and families understress. Meanwhile, three upper floors are slated for state-of-the-art laboratories. With a monumental staircase connectingthree floors inside, scenic views of downtown Newark every-where, a terrace, a healing garden, wellness center, a library,support facilities for community outreach as well as everythingfrom the Breast Center to the Dean and Betty Gallo ProstateCenter, this building will stand out. The construction crew, tower cranes, Komatsu excavators and \"Sidewalk Closed\" signs are obvious. What you can't easi-ly see about this project\u2014the creation of a major, comprehen-sive cancer center which will deliver high quality clinical care,conduct cutting edge research and reach out to a local com-munity stung by high rates of late-stage, often undetected can-cers\u2014 is the painstaking, collaborative challenge of buildingthe organization of people who will work there. \"In most hospital cancer centers, patients are seen at a med- ical oncologist's office, at a radiation oncologist's office and ata surgeon's office while everyone tries to coordinate theirefforts,\" explains Lawrence Harrison, MD, the associate direc-tor of clinical services for the Cancer Center. Also director ofsurgical oncology at UH, Harrison points out what makes this\"people\" part of the building phase so interesting. \"We'regoing to be unique because medical, radiation oncology andsurgical oncology are all going to be under the same roof. Ourconcept is to treat cancer on a site specific, or type of cancer,basis. Someone with lung cancer, for instance, will have theopportunity to see all their specialists within the same clinicaloffice space and possibly at the same visit. This concept of anintegrated program is going to be unique here in New Jersey,if not around the country.\" The Cancer Center Community (CCC), established last fall, and their Web site (http://njmsresearch.umdnj.edu/cancercenter/c3) were among the first steps taken towardshelping experts in cancer-related fields cross traditional lines.Within three hours after posting this Web site, which wasdesigned for Newark-based investigators who want to sharetheir research expertise and network, more than 30 people hadsigned on to become part of CCC. The community is now 77 members strong and still growing. Research is changing the care of cancer, according to Ozer: \"Though there are still a lot of very fundamental, unansweredquestions about cancer, there are a number of questions whichhave been answered. We can now talk realistically about trans-ferring this information to clinical care.\" The new NJMS-UHCancer Center will accommodate up to 30 investigators andtheir associates. They may not all be there when the doorsopen in 2006 but both Ozer and Harrison believe that by put-ting this translational research in the same building with clini-cal programs, \"you can have the interaction that will get theresearch to the patient.\" inside information 4 PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05Cancer Care in Newark: A Tale of TwoBuilding Efforts Y TED AXELROD 02-11njmsR1 11:33 PM Page 4TOP: WALTER FRIHART; BOTTOM: WHITNEY SHERMAN/GETTY IMAGES NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 5Pain Center Opens T ANY GIVEN TIME, some 25 million Americans are suffering from acute pain, which is typically relieved in less than three months. Another 50 mil- lion people in this country endure chronic painthat lasts longer than three months \u2014often,for years. The Comprehensive Pain Management Center at University Hospital, whichopened its doors in January 2004, treats alltypes of chronic pain, including back, neu-ropathic, cancer, musculoskeletal/rheuma-tologic, post-injury and surgical pain. Medication is one of the chief avenues to provide pain relief. T raditional painmedications may be incorporated into thepatient's treatment plan. This may includeany of the following categories of medica-tions: NSAIDs such as sulphateor Duragesic patch. For treatment of lower back pain, physical therapy is often prescribed. Nerve blocks, such as epidural steroid or facet joint injections, are also a mainstay treatment for many lower back problems, says Kaufman, who is board certified in pain management. Other non-invasive treatments include T ranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, or TENS, and radiofrequency ablation. With TENS, a mild electrical current is deliveredthrough the skin to specified nerves, blocking pain messages or releasing endorphins. Radiofrequency ablation uses radio waves to heat, or burn, a problematic nerve, destroying the nerve and interrupting pain signals.

A lifelong resident of New Jersey, he has been married to hiswife, Sharon McDonnell Muscarelle, for 45 years. \"We have so many talented students in our state. It is important for our medic al schools to keep the best and brightest right here.\" To qualify for the scholarship funds generated by this gift\u2014estimated to be about $100,000 annually\u2014students will have to demonstrate academic excellence and financial need. Recipients will also promiseto practice medicine in New Jersey after completing their educations. \"It is my hope that this endowed deanship will allow NewJersey Medical School to compete favorably with other medical schools outside of the state when it comes to being able to offerattractive financial incentives to its students.\" Muscarelle has been supporting scholarships at the medical school for more than adecade and he is currently chair of the scholarship committee for the Foundation Board. George F. Heinrich, MD, vice-chair and CEO of the Foundation of UMDNJ, stated, \"Joseph Muscarelle is a wonderful example of a person dedicated to making New Jersey the best place it can be.

Patients who are not responsiveto the traditional drugs for heart failure,or who lose responsiveness over time, as the condition worsens, are oftenreferred to him for therapies not yetgenerally available. He recently participated in a major clinical trial to determine the value of adrug specifically aimedto treat heart failure inblack patients.

The drug is going for FDAapproval, which may be granted in2005. There are an estimated 750,000 blacks with heart failure and many arenot being helped by the standard med-ications. Blacks are more likely thanwhites to die of the disease. BiDil worksby enhancing the level of nitric oxide, agas that is released from the lining ofarteries and which may be more com-monly deficient in black patients withheart failure. \"However,\" Klapholz cautions, \"the differences in terms oftreating heart failure have to do withgenetics, not skin color.\" (See pharmaco-genetics article on page 30.)

NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 7Book Reviews 02-11njms 6/7/05 11:33 PM Page 7DEBRA SPINA DIXON/GETTY IMAGES 8 ESEARCHERS AT NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL have found that hand-held video games are as effective in treating severe anxiety in children about to undergo elective surgery as the usual approach of administering ananti-anxiety drug. This conclusion is based on a study involv-ing children between the ages of 4 and 12 who were about toundergo general anesthesia for surgery at UMDNJ-TheUniversity Hospital. The study was presented by Anuradha Patel, MD, assistant professor of pediatric anesthesiology and principal investigator,at the Postgraduate Assembly of the New York State Society of Anesthesiologists in December. \"Going into the operating room can be a very anxious time for children even though they are with their parents,\" saysPatel. \"Over the years, we have tried a number of activitiesfrom watching television to reading stories to using coloringbooks to help alleviate their stress, but none of theseapproaches provided enough distraction to lessen the anxiety.\" If the children get so anxious they act out, the only option has been to administer an oral dose of midazolam, says HenryL. Bennett, MD, associate professor of anesthesiology atNJMS and a member of the study team, \"but the problem isthat this drug can produce a 'drug hangover' which lastslonger than the effect of the anesthesia itself and makes someparents uncomfortable.\" The idea of using a Game Boy as a new approach for treat- ing anxiety came from Patel after she had seen how absorbedher friend's 7-year-old son was when he played with his GameBoy. Collecting the needed Game Boys and games became thecommunity service project of Christopher Walsh ofAllenwood, as part of his requirements for an Eagle ScoutAward. He collected more than 30 Game Boys and 60 games. The randomized controlled study, which took place between February and October, 2004, involved 78 children. Theresearchers used the modified Yale Pre-Operative Anxiety Scale,an observational instrument that quantifies children's anxiety,to determine when to intervene with a pediatric patient. The children who needed help were randomly assigned toone of three groups. Each child had parents with them up tothe point that the child lost consciousness from anesthesiabeing administered in the operating room. One group had only their parents with them to help cope with their anxiety; one group was also given an oral dose ofmidazolam about 30 minutes before anesthesia; and each childin the third group was given a Game Boy about 30 minutesprior to anesthesia. \"The results of this study showed that the most dramatic dif- ference in anxiety was observed in the group that had the GameBoy right up until the anesthesia took effect,\" Bennett says. The median change in anxiety for the Game Boy group was zero while for the midazolam group the increase was 7.5, inaccordance with the anxiety scale. For the group who only hadparental presence as a calming factor, the increase was 17.5. \"We would like to introduce the use of Game Boys in the pre-anesthesia waiting areas and allow the children to stayabsorbed in the Game Boy right up until they are receivingthe anesthesia in the operating room,\" he says. Other members of the study team were Melissa Davidson, MD, and Thomas Schieble, MD, also faculty members in theDepartment of Anesthesiology at the medical school. inside information PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05Game Boy RelaxesPediatric SurgeryPatients R The idea of using Game Boy to treat anxietycame when Patel noticed how absorbed a friend's child was when he played with it.02-11njmsR1 6/7/05 11:34 PM Page 8NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 9 HERE'S A PLAYWRIGHT IN OUR MIDST. He is Solomon Caudle, program administrator in the Department of NeurologicalSurgery at NJMS. Caudle is co-authorof an African-American musical aboutlife, love, and HIV. The play, entitledWhen a Man Loves a Woman, was pre- sented in June at the Crossroads Theaterin New Brunswick to excellent reviews. \"The play is a love story with an AIDS twist,\" says Caudle. \"It's about the consequences of poor choices and prejudice against people who are HIVpositive. Ultimately, it's about the powerof love.\" Caudle, who was raised in Newark, has been profoundly affected by theAIDS epidemic, losing many friends tothe disease. His co-author, Kabu Okai-Davies, is a native of Ghana who hasalso seen first-hand the devastationcaused by the HIV virus. Ghana is partof sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimat-ed 25 million adults and children areliving with HIV, and where an estimat-ed twelve million children have beenorphaned by AIDS. The play tells the story of a woman wholeaves the man she iswith for another man.Recognizing she'smade a mistake, shereturns to the and latershe learns hasAIDS. Caudledescribes it asurban theater. new genre oftheater that is not traditional,\" he says.\"It's colorful, musical, and uses gutsylanguage to address issues that are rele-vant to the inner city and the peoplewho live there.\" Caudle's early experiences and educa- tion greatly influenced his writing.Growing up, he was exposed to poverty,drug abuse, HIV/AIDS and domesticviolence. Among his first memories ofNewark are listening to the chaotic sounds of the riots outside his apart-ment window. A living theater course he took at Rutgers University in 1981 was his firstintroduction to the art of drama. \"Wewent to see plays on Broadway and ana-lyzed them, looking at their format andstructure,\" he says. \"Then we put onthree plays during the semester. I direct-ed Arsenic and Old Lace. After that, I was hooked.\" He came to NJMS in 1988, first working in accounts payable, and joinedthe Department of Neurological Surgerya year later. Along the way, he startedwriting short stories, but his heart still belonged to the theater. Caudle directed his first professional produc- tion in 1994. While doing volunteer work for a drug rehabilitation organization, he was asked to write a drama about the damaging effects of drug abuse on families. The play, called Three Faces, caught the attention of the director of the African Globe Theater, the resident theater company at Newark Symphony Hall.\"He thought it was very good, andasked if I would direct it for the AfricanGlobe Theater,\" he says. \"At first I said,'No way! I do it.' But I took adirector's workshop beforehand andlearned what I needed to know.\" Caudle's plays have received great support from the UMDNJ community,particularly the Department of Neuro-logical Surgery. Peter Carmel, MD, professor and department chair, has per-sonally funded the set of every playCaudle has produced. That list includesThree Faces, a revival of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Fences, and his newest play, When a Man Loves a Woman. In February 2005, Caudle and his creative team will travel to Australia tomount a production of When a Man Loves a Woman for the International Multicultural Arts Festival. \"It's veryexciting to be a part of this festival fea-turing plays from all over the world,\" hesays. \"Our play is about AIDS.

Diagnostic nuclear medicine proce- dures, including FDG PET scans, bonescans and cardiac scans, can have a simi-lar effect, although for shorter periods. \"The nuclear medicine community has been aware that patients set offdetectors, but now we expect it tobecome a more common occurrencewith the increasing number of extremelysensitive Homeland Securityradiation detectors deployed amongsecurity personnel,\" says Zuckier, thestudy's author and director of nuclearmedicine and PET at The UniversityHospital. \"Our study helps estimate theamount of time following a procedurethat these detectors can be triggered.\" The amount of radiation a patient receives in a typical nuclear medicineimaging procedure is comparable to thatreceived from an X-ray and poses nodanger to the public. Radiopharmaceu-ticals are radioactively labeled drugs thatinteract with specific organs or tissuesand can be imaged using specializedcameras and computers. In therapeuticprocedures, greater amounts of radioac-tivity are directed to specific tissues, andpatients may be sequestered from thepublic for several days. In their study, Zuckier and colleagues estimated the maximum length of timethat diagnostic and therapeutic radio-pharmaceuticals could set off radiationdetectors such as those used for Home-land Security purposes, specifically: FDG PET scan \u2014less than 24 hours; Bone and thyroid scans\u2014 3 days; Cardiac exams with thallium\u2014 up to 30 days; Iodine therapy\u2014up to 95 days. Zuckier supports the recommenda- tions made by the Society of NuclearMedicine (SNM) and the U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission that hospitalsdevelop an official letter or card indicat-ing what type of nuclear medicine pro-cedure a patient received, the date ofservice and whom to call at the hospitalfor verification. \"Physicians should make patients aware of the need to carry proper docu-mentation following a nuclear medicineprocedure,\" Zuckier said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that 10,000 portableradiation detectors have been procuredby state, local and federal officials atborders and ports of entry. Co-authors are Gary S.

M 2004 Arts Festival THE NJMS ARTS FESTIVAL, held in September 2004, featured a gallery of artwork created by medical school faculty and staff. Pictured at right is a quilt by Debra Heller, MD, that was part of the exhibit. Heller, who is asso- ciate director of the Division of Anatomic Pathology at UMDNJ-The UniversityHospital and NJMS professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, began quilt-ing six years ago. She says she does it because she loves creating things. Hellerhas completed so many quilts that she's lost count, but estimates the number ataround 40 to 50. To learn new techniques, she takes classes, joins quiltinggroups on the Internet, and travels all around the state in search of great quilt-ing shops. \"Quilting is a great way to reduce stress, too,\" she says.

Chiaravalloti, PhD, an assis-tant professor in the Department ofPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation,has received two grants to study newlearning and memory development inmultiple sclerosis (MS). The first grant for $1,370,000 is for \"T reating New Learning in MultipleSclerosis (MS).\" It is funded for fiveyears by the NIH/National Institute ofChild Health and Human Develop-ment. Chiaravalloti notes that individu-als with MS who have documentedmemory impairment show a significantimprovement in memory following atreatment protocol utilizing imagery andcontext. Her current proposal is designed to: (1) replicate the finding and furtherevaluate the impact of treatment oneveryday functioning, (2) observe theeffects of non-treatment after sixmonths, and (3) examine the usefulnessof once-a-month \"booster\" sessions. The second grant for $428,000 is for \"Working Memory in MS: Using fMRIto Identify the Deficit.\" It is funded bythe National Multiple Sclerosis Societyfor three years. Many MS patientsreport difficulties with attention, con-centration and memory. Research hasshown that these deficits in their \"work-ing memory\" may in fact be the sourceof some of these cognitive difficulties. Working memory can be broken down into two processes: holding infor-mation in the mind and manipulatingthis information.Which of these two processes aredisturbed in MS is undetermined. Thisstudy seeks to identify where thesepatients are having difficulty.

The study's focus is to recognize and characterize the roles of serotonin andcytokines in the medial hypothalamus inregulating these forms of aggression.The hypothesis is that differentialcytokine effects upon defensive rage andpredatory attack are mediated principal-ly through distinct neurotransmitterreceptors of which serotonin and possi-bly GABA are primary candidates. The discovery that cytokines in the brain play a significant role in defensiverage represents a most significant obser-vation, providing an entirely new direc-tion of research with a focus that willaddress how cytokines and related sub-stances in the brain may play criticalroles in the expression and control ofaggression and rage. The Genetics of Retinopathy in African Americans Monique S. Roy, MD, professor of oph-thalmology and director of the Divisionof Medical Retina at The Institute ofOphthalmology & Visual Science, hasbeen awarded a three-year, $1,419,770grant, entitled \"Genetics of Retinopathyin African Americans with Type 1Diabetes\" from the Juvenile DiabetesResearch Foundation. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major public health problem, particularly forAfrican-American diabetics, who are dis-proportionately affected. Roy studied 725 African Americans with type 1 diabetes for risk factors asso-ciated with severity of disease (mild,moderate or severe) and observed thatnot only duration of disease but alsothree clinical factors\u2014poor sugar con-trol, high blood pressure and kidney dis-ease\u2014are associated with progression toincreasingly severe forms of DR. Thethree clinical risk factors, however,account for only 32 percent of the vari-ability in severity of DR. Roy reasonedthat other forces must be responsible. Since complications due to diabetes tend to cluster in families as well as vary across ethnic groups, she says it isimportant to study genetic andgenetic/environmental factors toaccount for the severity of the disease. 11 Research News A look at some ongoing studies at New Jersey Medical School02-11njms 6/7/05 11:35 PM Page 11HISTORICAL PHOTOGRAPHS COURTESY UMDNJ-UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES SPECIAL COLLECTIONS PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 12new jersey medical school Fifty years old, New Jersey Medical School has firmly estab-lished its place on the map of thestate\u2014and the country. The first medical school to be founded in New Jersey, its launching was heralded throughout thestate, which had long needed a program to educatephysicians with strong ties to New Jersey who wouldlikely stay in the Garden State to practice. Among itsfounders were leaders at the Jersey City Medical Center,Seton Hall University and the Archdiocese of Newark. Established in 1954 as Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry, located in Jersey City, theschool opened its doors to its first class of 80 studentsin 1956. There was a top-notch pool of excellent NewJersey applicants who vied to be among that charterclass; and faculty were reputed to be exceptionally ded-icated to the tough undertaking of launching a first-ratemedical school where none had existed before. On June4, 1960, the charter class graduated, becoming the veryfirst MDs to earn their degrees in New Jersey, wheremost remained to practice. A decade later, the state purchased the school for $4 million. In May 1965, it was renamed the New JerseyCollege of Medicine and Dentistry (NJCMD). In1968, when state officials were considering relocatingthe school to Newark, federal, state and local govern-ment leaders and representatives of the Newark com-munity met to work out the historic social contractcalled the Newark Agreements, which spelled out thecollege's responsibilities to the city. One result was theestablishment of the Board of Concerned Citizens, anadvisory group that remains active to this day. On July1, 1968, the move to Newark was begun. That month, the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry assumed operation of Newark CityHospital and renamed it Harrison S. MartlandHospital, after the Newark native who served as thehospital's pathologist for 45 years and the Essex CountyMedical Examiner. Martland, a renowned scientist,made several remarkable discoveries. He determinedthat minute traces of radioactivity contained in lumi-nous paint had caused the deaths of watch dial paintersemployed at U.S. Radium Corporation in Orange, NJ. Martland Hospital became the school's principal teaching facility. The school also established strong tieswith the 950-bed East Orange Veterans AdministrationMedical Center. According to an article celebrating the40th anniversary of the medical school, published 10years ago in New Jersey Medicine, President Lyndon B. Johnson facilitated this relationship by instructing thatthe facility be placed at the complete disposal of themedical school. In September 1969, the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry completed its move toNewark; and on June 16, 1970, the state passed the50THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS by Robert A.

The new entity merged the previous New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, which includ-ed New Jersey Medical School, New Jersey DentalSchool and the Graduate School of BiomedicalSciences, with Rutgers Medical School. July 6, 1971 marked the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Newark campus. The first class to begin itsstudies in Newark was composed of 113 students\u201428of them minorities. Construction of the MedicalSciences Building (MSB) began in June 1973, and inSeptember 1977, NJMS moved into its new quarters,featuring 606,000 square feet of classrooms, researchlaboratories and faculty space. In January 1979, CollegeHospital (now called UMDNJ-The UniversityHospital) opened, replacing Martland Hospital. Since that time, NJMS has made rapid progress. Though young in comparison with most Americanmedical schools, it is quickly moving forward in thearea of research funding. Federal awards have increasedbetween FY'03 and FY'04 by more than $15 million.The Newark campus is in the midst of an enormouscapital building construction program, and will soonfeature a major cancer center and the first UMDNJhousing for students. Since its inception, New Jersey Medical School has graduated more than 4,500 physicians. Most haveremained in the state. The school and its alumni havevastly improved health care accessibility and quality inNew Jersey, particularly in Newark and surroundingEssex County. Along the way, New Jersey Medical School has achieved national recognition for some of its manyaccomplishments. High on the list is winning theAAMC's first award for community service in 1994.Among the others: the 1984 founding of an internationally recognized liver center by Carroll Leevy, MD, world-renowned liver disease expert and the school's only survivingfounding father; the invention by NJMS alumnus Frederick Buechel, an orthopedic surgeon and faculty member ofthe school, and NJIT professor Michael Pappas, of thefirst prosthetic knee joint to receive FDA approval; the research of longtime faculty member Oscar Auerbach, which formed the basis of the surgeon general's report in the 1960s on smoking and healthand led to the 1965 warning on cigarette packages:\"Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health;\" the identification of the first case of pediatric AIDS in the world by 1971 alumnus and professor of pedi-atrics James Oleske in the early 1980s; and 19 NJMS faculty members earned spots on Castle Connolly's \"2004 America's Top Doctors\" list, signify- ing their stellar reputations among other physicians.

She once used a Slinky during a commencement address to Robert Wood Johnson Internal Medicine resident graduates inJune 2002 to emphasize the importance of creating a balancein life. Her topic's title: An Excellent Adventure Awaits You. \"Itwas pretty effective,\" she recalls. \"Life is not always predictableand when there is a real imbalance between your personal andyour professional fulfillment, with one end pulling the otherdown, the impact on your life is considerable and you've got tomake a change.\" As one of only three women students in her medical school class from 1965 to 1969\u2014but the student with the highestcumulative average\u2014Herald established herself as an academ-ic colleague and a force by tutoring male classmates. \"They hadbeen asking, 'Hey, how are you scoring so high?' You get bet-ter when you teach and reinforce your own learning,\" sheexplains. The boys became her buddies. T wenty years ago, the American College of Physicians (ACP) asked her for advice about recruiting more womenphysicians. Their female membership numbers were pitiful.This past year, she served as Chair of the ACP Board ofRegents, leading the largest medical specialty organization inthe country. Herald, who has actively worked to create a more supportive environment for all under-represented groups inmedicine, is the first woman to hold this position. \"The glassceiling has been broken. I've encountered a lot of prejudice inmy career and it's often the Mars-Venus stuff. Men don'talways understand how they are alienating women and womencan misread situations due to our cultural differences. Respect,trust and good communication can resolve most issues.\"Herald also points out that more than 50 percent of individu-als coming into medicine now are women. Holding that topspot at ACP was \"sweet after a long professional journey.\" Early in her career, this creative mother of six had to coor- dinate her labor and delivery to overlap with assigned vaca-tions. \"There was no such thing as maternity leave back then.My oldest was born on October 9 and my vacation started onOctober 1. Needless to say, I wentback to work really early,\" sheremembers. She and her husband,a professor of bio-ethics and pub-lic health, raised a combined family inSummit, NJ. \"We have a 'Brady Bunch,'\" she laughs. \"Mythree boys joined three teenagers (two boys and a girl). We hadsome wild years with juggling two careers and the needs of sixdeveloping adults. You have to be very organized and a goodcommunicator. You also need a spouse who respects you and isnot threatened or jealous of your work. I grew up in an erawhen women were not supposed to make a lot of waves. Wewere never supposed to do anything that would make a man feel diminished.\" In reality, Herald explains, when womenoffer men that kind of fake environment, never asking them togrow or understand, \"men never learn how to be more thanthey already are. They are diminished.\" \"I think challenges make you stronger and better,\" she says. In fact, if it's true that heroes are made, not born, then her 36years as a female physician in a predominantly male medicalworld have offered her enough hurdles, high jumps and thelong marathon needed to achieve superwoman status. Heraldis currently a member of the Board of Commissioners ofJCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of HealthcareOrganizations); immediate past chair of the ACP Board of Regents; a delegate to the American Medical Association; asso-ciate clinical professor of medicine at Columbia UniversityCollege of Physicians and Surgeons; and an internist/endocri-nologist in Westfield, NJ. Herald speaks often on what she calls the \"gender Olympics for women in medicine\" and has loved \"the national visibilityand traveling all over the country.\" She believes that those hur-dles she first described in Yankton, North Dakota in 1993 atan ACP conference, are the obstacles women must go throughjust to get into medical school, a residency program and thena career. The high jumps are the extraordinary achievementslike an academic advancement, a break in research or a posi-tion in a national society. Meanwhile, \"the marathon is whatwomen physicians run all the time,\" she says, \"balancing thepatient care, teaching, research, and responsibilities with day to What better way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of NJMS than focusing on a few of its many outstanding alumni?

They feel part of it.\" Once upon a time, Herald was simply grateful that she had a job. \"That was dumb,\" she says. Having accepted a medicaleducation position because it offered predictable hours andweekends off so she could have time to parent, she never nego-tiated a contract. \"I was undervaluing myself.\" She believesthat women in medicine are still often \"clueless. We are not assophisticated as men are in the rules of the game for promo-tion and in recognizing who is really supportive or exploita-tive.\" As more women learn the rules of leadership and power,\"we can mentor and share experiences.\" Her own excellent adventure in medicine has not just been in the political arena. \"The joy of medicine itself, or theapplied science, is what drew me to it,\" Herald says. Friendsused to tease her about loving the Krebs cycle and the organicchemistry part of physiology. \"You want the chance to do a lotof different things in your career, to go into a subspecialty later,to take additional coursework or mini-fellowships and to makenew career decisions. We can constantly refocus our energies ifthe basic foundation of medicine is good.\" Endocrinology has given her the intellectual room to move through the whole spectrum of complex metabolic diseasesfrom infancy to old age. \"We hold the ability to make a differ-ence in someone's life. We don't cure everything but we canalways provide comfort and ease the burden of an illness. Thisis what has driven me.\" What you hear in every word of recollection spoken by Mary Herald is the creative, nurturing underpinning of her personality. Nowhere is this aspect more acute than when shedescribes the sacred space between a doctor and a patient.\"The incredibly intimate relationship a doctor has with apatient can be closer than this person has with anyone else inlife. This is an inviolate space because you are seeing thispatient at his or her most vulnerable time. You provide themwith a rudder, a support or a lifeline.\" Teaching young clini-cians to recognize and respect this sacred space has also beenher mission.

He pours himself a cupof coffee, takes his jacket off and puts it on the back of hischair, and makes himself comfortable at the head of the table. \"Would anyone like to start off by asking me a question?\" he asks. One student pipes up, saying he is curious about therole Levey played in securing the $200 million endowmentthat gives UCLA's medical school its name. Several studentslaugh and nod their heads\u2014David Geffen's reputation is big!Levey, an NJMS class of '61 alum (it was called Seton HallCollege of Medicine back then), smiles. It's probably a ques-tion he is asked often and a story he never really tires ofretelling\u2014a shining moment for a former Jersey City boy ofhumble origins. Actually, Levey and Geffen have much in common. They were both born to working class, immigrant parents, wholanded and stayed in the New York metropolitan area.(Geffen is from Borough Park, Brooklyn.) Both familiesstruggled to give their sons a decent start and both men arethe epitome of the American dream. Perhaps when they firstmet over lunch in Los Angeles in 2002, and Levey took thebold step of asking for $150 million to endow and name theschool, a current of recognition passed between them. MaybeGeffen just admired the UCLA dean's \"chutzpah.\" According to Levey: \"Mr. Geffen asked how I arrived at the figure of $150 million and I told him that we are number 7in NIH support for research in the entire country and num-ber 4 in overall research and our hospital is always ranked inthe top 5 in the nation.\" Eventhough UCLA's medical schoolhas a reputation to be proudof, Levey was aiming high.(The Cornell Medical Collegewas named by Joan and Sanford I.Weill for $100 million and the Keck School of Medicineof the University of Southern California for $110 million.)But Geffen did not say no\u2014he wanted to think about it. When they met again, Geffen said he wanted this gift to be the biggest ever given to a medical school\u2014he would like itto serve as an example for other would-be benefactors\u2014andhe offered $200 million. Levey asked that the endowment beunrestricted. The deal was made. Levey says that as a dean, this gift has given him a lot of flexibility. Scholarships are very high on his list of prioritiesand he uses interest from the endowment to provide fundingfor many students who would otherwise have to struggle, orwould not be able to attend. \"A state school should try to bediverse\u2014it should represent the demography of the state inwhich it is located as much as possible,\" he says. \"Half of ourstudents are first generation Americans and many of our stu-dents don't have much money.\" Of Geffen, he says admiringly, \"He is amazingly philan- thropic and has been extraordinarily successful in business.\" Levey may not have Geffen's Midas touch (sources report the entrepreneur to be worth $2.6 billion), nor his flamboyantways, but he is a confident man with a grand mission and he isnowhere near calling it a day professionally. \"I was in theschool's second graduating class, but I don't feel old,\" he says tothe students, after asking each one to tell a little bit about him-self to the group. \"I had a great education here. I'm grateful tothe school\u2014they gave me a chance. It's impressive to see thebuildings going up and to see the school so firmly established.\" The UCLA dean says he decided on his life's work at age 4 because he so loved his pediatrician, who was \"calm and wiseand had wonderful personal and technical skills, and came tothe house and took care of us on the kitchen table.\" Lookingat his own merits to follow suit, Levey says he was a good stu-dent, graduating from Cornell in 1957, but didn't really \"catch fire\" until he came to NJMS. For those who know little about the history of medicine in the state, Levey recounts the difficulties encountered by New Jersey residents wanting to pursue a career in medicine. \"There was much discrimination on many fronts in the '50s. Also, since we had no medical school in the state, other them how to respect the people they are touching and to beconfident and caring without being arrogant, I can set thecourse for their whole professional lives.\" Thank goodness Mary Herald didn't listen to the person who once threatened to ruin her career if she made any trou-ble. Her hurdles and high jumps have set precedents none ofthe 215,004 female physicians now in the U.S. would want tohave missed. \u2014 Maryann Brinley12-29njms 6/7/05 11:37 PM Page 16the first fifty years NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 17states were reluctant to accept New Jersey students,\" heexplains. \"There was so much excitement about coming tomedical school here. We knew that without this school, we would not have had the opportunity to become physicians.We were grateful.\" Even so, not everyone in his class made it. Levey says it was a tough school. Just 80 students were accepted into eachclass and only 69 from his class made it through. Of his medical school teachers, he says: \"The faculty was small in number and very committed to teaching.\" Many left an indelible mark on his life. Harold Jeghers, MD, professor and director of the Department of Medicine from 1956 to 1966 and a renownededucator and clinician, was an \"American legend. He guidedme into academic medicine,\" states the UCLA dean. \"And Carroll Leevy\u2014I love that man. He was brilliant, charismatic, the quintessential investigator, an amazingattending, always pushing you, always wanting you to do bet-ter,\" he says. \"I have both of their pictures in my office.\"He fondly mentions several other faculty members, includ- ing Jim McAnulty, who he describes as \"very demanding\u2014helived at the hospital night and day. He was concerned aboutthe students' devotion to patients and was obsessed withdetails. He was like a drill sergeant. You hated him when youwere there, but you recognized his commitment to excellencelater on. And Philip Henneman, the chief of endocrinology,taught me that science and medicine are one and that you can'tdivorce them, and that you have to keep learning\u2014read, read,read.\" Henneman helped Levey obtain a position at Harvard. \"All of these faculty members were willing to mentor me. I don't think there are many schools where people can saythat,\" he comments. \"If you're going to succeed, you need to have a mentor,\" he continues. \"Otherwise it's a very hard climb up the ladder.And when it's your turn, you have to give people a hand, help them out. I've had so much help in my life. I really don'tknow why, but some people thought I was worth it.\" Levey completed an internship and one year of residency training in internal medicine at Jersey City Medical Center,where his wife, Barbara, also an MD, came to join him. Hedid a fellowship in biological chemistry at Harvard MedicalSchool and a senior residency at Massachusetts GeneralHospital. His research has largely focused on thyroid diseaseand the heart. His career has included stints as a HowardHughes Medical Institute Investigator, senior vice presidentfor medical and scientific affairs at Merck & Co, and chair ofthe Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh'sSchool of Medicine, before taking on his current post in1994. He has published more that 200 articles in peerreviewed journals. Of his medical school alma mater, Levey says: \"This has been a highly successful school, graduating more than 4,000well-trained physicians, with the majority choosing to remainand practice in the state of New Jersey. Its researchers haveadded to the body of scientific knowledge. The school wonthe AAMC's first award for community service in 1994; andit has undoubtedly improved health care in New Jersey, aswell as being one of the region's largest employers.\" To students, Levey says: \"Don't get discouraged. Everyone has a bad day or month, or even a bad year. You picked a fab-ulous career. What's going to happen in the future of medi-cine will be absolutely amazing. You'll be part of it and yourpatients will benefit from the medical advances in genetics,robotic and minimally invasive surgery, organ transplantationand stem cell research, to name just a few.\" \u2014 Eve Jacobs 12-29njmsR1 6/7/05 11:37 PM Page 17COURTESY OF DONALD ARTHUR PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 18the first fifty years Motorcycle Memories DONALD ARTHUR '78 There are some people who simply defy stereotypes. ViceAdmiral Donald C. Arthur, MD, PhD, JD\u2014United StatesNavy Medical Corps, Surgeon General, Chief, Bureau ofMedicine and Surgery\u2014is one of them. A military career medical officer and the 35th Surgeon General of the Navy as of August, 2004, he's a gifted speaker, former commander of the National Naval Medical Center atBethesda, a healthcare leader who preaches the careful pre-ventive road to well-being, and the father of three daughters.This is the type of man who considered leaving the Navy sev-eral years ago to enter the ministry so he could go to Ethiopiato be a missionary. \"I had been offered the job of heading a Baptist mission service. My daughters weren't so happyabout it.\" If Donald Arthur sounds like someone who always follows the dutiful, straight and narrow course, think again.Throughout his life, he has mixed and matched his dedicat-ed, rational side with a penchant for the wild and crazy. How else can you explain the motorcycle mania? Fellow students from the New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) classof 1978 may even remember him as the young man whospent all four NJMS years on crutches as a result of severelyshattering one leg in a motorcycle accident just before first-year classes started. \"I had five operations but continued towork for Harley Davidson as a mechanic to pay my waythrough medical school,\" he recalls. His areas of military and medical expertise also tell a story of pushing past what others would consider prudent physicaland mental boundaries. He completed a surgical internship aswell as two residencies in emergency and preventive medi-cine. In the Navy, he received operational qualifications inflight surgery and undersea medicine, surface warfare medi-cine, saturation diving, hyperbaric (recompression) trainingand radiation health, and also qualified for submarines.A Navy-Marine parachutist and jumpmaster, he was head ofspecial products at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute andwas deployed to Southwest Asia with the Marine Corps 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:37 PM Page 18NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 19the first fifty years Second Battalion during the DesertShield/Storm conflict. Just before hisrecent appointment to the top post in themedical office of the Navy, he commandedthe Naval Medical Center in Bethesda\u2014 thehospital known widely for treating U.S.presidents. In the Navy, Arthur found what he calls \"a community of service\" that allowed him togrow and a place to use his knowledge, skillsand experience for unselfish purposes. As physicians, \"we allhave a fundamental decision to make early in our careers: Isour medical degree a commodity to be bought and sold or isit a call to service?\" As a doctor, he adds, \"You hold life inyour hands and can have a profound influence on others.\"Arthur believes that a medical degree is one of the most pow-erful tools of mankind and can't be underestimated. \"Youhave the chance to impact thousands of lives.\" He's been pleased by \"the brightness of people entering the medical pro-fession: young physicians and medical students who are ide-alistic. When I ask them, 'Why are you coming into medi-cine?' all their answers boil down to: 'This is all I've ever wanted to do.'\" Having such a driving force is importantbecause as Arthur sees it, \"You may be able to handle medicalschool because of the pull of prestige or money, but you can'tbe a real healer unless it's all you've ever wanted to do.\" His own impact on others is significant. He tells one story in particular to point out how the role of a good doctor canhave a rippling effect. Many years ago, during a tour of dutyin the Philippines, he used to take a helicopter once a monthfrom his base in Manila to a camp in Luzon where he'd treat refugees. A decade later, when dining alone at a Japaneserestaurant in Chicago\u2014the night before taking his boards foremergency medicine\u2014the hidden effect of those monthlyvisitations became clear. \"Excuse me,\" Arthur says while re-telling the tale, \"but this gives me the chills. I've only told this story twice before toaudiences of young physicians.\" The restaurant was one of those where food is prepared and cooked at the table and Arthur soon found himself chat-ting with the chef. There were only a few people dining. \"Pardon me, but you don't look Japanese. What nationali- ty are you?\" the Vice Admiral asked. The man replied, \"I'm not Japanese. I'm Vietnamese.\" Then he said, \"And you are the white-haired was flabbergasted,\" Arthur says. This NJMS alum doeshave white hair. It was nearly white when he was a young doctor in the Philippines. \"There in the middle of the United States of America, this man proceeded to tell me how I had impacted his life back in the Philippines.\" As it turns out, his fam- ily had been in that Luzon camp. The man had grown up in Vietnam, married and had a fami- ly but he couldn't tolerate the political oppres- sion and all the killing in his native country. \"I packed all of our possessions, my children and our parents into a boat and, at sea, we lost everything. Wewere finally picked up off the Philippine coast and brought tothe refugee camp at Luzon you used to visit. Other doctorswould come and go, but my family always waited for you.You would treat not just our illnesses. When you came, youtalked to us. You cared for our souls, our minds, and ourhearts,\" the chef said. This ability to see patients from all perspectives is still evi- dent in Arthur's life as Surgeon General during American warefforts around the globe. \"About 15 percent of everybody intheater (a war zone) suffers from some kind of combat stress,\"he believes. \"We treat the minds of the wounded and the fam-ilies, instead of just injuries. I think one of the benefits of ourmilitary system is that many of our healthcare providers\u2014our nurses, our corpsmen and our doctors\u2014have been overin the theater, either on the ground or on the hospital ship.They understand where these marines and sailors are comingfrom. They understand that these marines and sailors are stillin combat even though they are in our wards. They are stillthinking about and reliving some of their experiences.\" Speaking from a personal platform which includes the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, four Legions of Merit,three Meritorious Service Medals, three Navy Commen-dation Medals and a Navy and Marine Corps AchievementMedal in addition to unit, service and campaign awards,Arthur certainly understands his military patients inside andout. His intellectual approach to patient care and administra-tive life is far-reaching. Yet, even today, stereotypes refuse to fit him. To get out from under the weight of his world, he still gives himself per-mission to roam free. The last time we spoke, he had justreturned from a cross-country motorcycle trip. \"I have greasynails right now from working on my bike last night,\" helaughs. After all this time, you can still glimpse that medicalstudent on crutches\u2014the one who was paying for schoolwith Harley Davidson paychecks. \u2014 Maryann Brinley 12-29njms 6/7/05 '04 WINTER '05 20the first fifty years To Keep Up With This Surgeon: Sprint DAVID DINES'74 Like the superstar athletes he treats, world-renownedorthopaedic shoulder specialist and medical inventor DavidM. Dines, MD, moves so fast that he sometimes leaves lis-teners racing to catch up intellectually. Even the hours in hisday can add up to more than 24. Dines laughs about thismathematical conundrum. \"I guess there are only so manyhours in the day but....\" Dines' curriculum vitae highlights his many roles in teach- ing, clinical care, administrative duties and research. This1974 graduate of New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) devel-oped one of the first modular prosthetic shoulder implants in1989. Former team physician for the New York Mets and thecurrent doctor for the U.S. Open tennis tournament and theDavis Cup team, he's the guy who gets injured major leaguebaseball stars and tennis pros back out to their fields, not justto play, but to points where theywin comeback player of the yearand the U.S. Open. \"I've treatedmany famous athletes and with-out mentioning any names, it'sbeen unbelievably gratifying.\"Not only have baseball and tennis players ben-efited from his expertise but boxers and soccer teams areamong his professional sports affiliations, as well. \"I've been blessed,\" he says. \"These are all labors of love.\" In fact, this veteran surgeon says, \"I've been very fortunate. I'm in a subspecialty where I get to take care of people\u2014notjust athletic stars but patients who are my neighbors, my col-leagues and my friends\u2014and bring them back to productivelives. I don't necessarily have to deal with life and death med-ical concepts. I think what we do in orthopaedics is difficult;however, being able to help someone play tennis or golf oreven to function, is not the same as keeping that person alive.I truly give credit to my colleagues who are in the trenchestaking care of problems like heart disease and cancer. I'mpracticing a very happy type of medicine.\" Happy is a word which comes up often in conversation with Dines, especially when he describes events of this pastyear. In October, he became president of the AmericanShoulder and Elbow Society. Last March, he and a team ofresearchers at North Shore - Long Island Jewish (LIJ) MedicalCenter won the prestigious Charles S. Neer, II, MD, Award,which recognizes outstanding investigation that contributesto the understanding, care or prevention of injuries to theshoulder or elbow. An annual prize established in honor ofthe first shoulder expert (Charles S. Neer, II), \"This is likewinning an Academy Award or an Olympic event but forshoulder surgeons,\" Dines explains. His team won for theirwork growing tendon cells in the laboratory, injecting thesecells with genes for growth factors and then implanting themto heal soft tissue injuries. In their laboratory model, healingbegan to occur within 24 hours. Dines believes that the distant future of orthopaedics lies in technologies that minimize the amount of insult to thebody. \"In the next 50 years, not just in orthopaedics, but inmany medical subspecialties, we will work at the micro-cellu-lar level. A lot of conditions treated surgically will have non-interventional, gene-modulated approaches. Way down theroad, instead of doing hip or shoulder replacements, we maybe able to take a tissue sample from the patient, grow a newhip or shoulder outside the body, and then put it back in.\" 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:38 PM Page 20NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 21the first fifty years For the near future, Dines foresees smaller and smallerimplants and even less extensive arthroscopic procedures. \"Aswith all surgery, and specifically orthopaedics, the concept is:do more with less invasion.\" His Biomodular Total Shoulder implant (Biomet, Inc., Warsaw, Indiana) was developed more than 10 years ago withRussell F . Warren, MD, and continues to be the standard for every new shoulder prosthesis in development by otherresearchers. \"We're revamping ours,\" Dines says, \"but it is stillone of the most popular ones.\" This invention propelled himto center stage in 1996 when he was asked to deliver the pres-tigious annual Sir John Charnley Memorial Lecture inLiverpool, England. \"Charnley invented total hip replace-ment,\" Dines explains. The Liverpool lecture \"is the biggesthonor in orthopaedics and I was the first shoulder replace-ment expert to be invited.\" An athlete in his own right, Dines played football as an undergraduate at Lehigh University, joined the first rugbyteam while at NJMS and enjoys a lot of tennis and golf. As asurgical patient, he has experienced the revolution inorthopaedics personally. \"I have had two back operations,laminectomies, performed 10 years apart. You used to go intothe hospital for five days. Now it's a minimally invasive pro-cedure and you can leave an hour later.\" Chairman of orthopaedic surgery and program director for the medical residents at LIJ, he is also clinical professor oforthopaedic surgery at The Albert Einstein College ofMedicine, assistant clinical professor at Cornell UniversityMedical College, and assistant attending in orthopaedicsports and shoulder service at the Hospital for Special Surgeryin New York. \"I've done so many neat things,\" he recalls.\"Orthopaedics is a great specialty because you have themechanical side, the academic side and you also have patientinteraction with all different age groups.\" With more than 100 articles, 20 book chapters and approximately 500 presentations to his credit, he's also mar-ried and the father of two children: a daughter, Allison Kate,who has a career in Florida, and a son, Joshua, who surprisedDines and his wife, Judy, with a senior year decision atDartmouth College to go into medicine. \"I never pushed mybeliefs on him in any way, shape or form,\" Dines says.\"Suddenly, he just wanted this for himself, not because wewanted him to go into medicine. He was lucky enough to beable to make the change academically. He went to Cornell Medical School and is now a fourth year resident inorthopaedics at the Hospital for Special Surgery.\" Requests for Dines to speak have taken him around the world three times\u2014to Denmark, Italy, France, and Spain\u2014but perhaps one of his most memorable presentations tookplace at the University of Tokyo in Japan. He doesn't speakJapanese. \"I have a tendency to talk fast and my translatorand I had trouble getting into sync,\" he admits. \"I realized atone point in my presentation that the audience had no clueabout what I was saying. They were looking at my slidesbeing projected but the translation, it turned out, left a lot tobe desired because the translator couldn't keep up. He wastwo sentences behind and losing ground.\" The truth is: if youare going to keep up with this superstar shoulder specialistand not get lost in translation, you need to be able to sprint.\u2014Maryann Brinley Author, ather home computer steadily tapping at her keyboard. Withfive published books to her name, and a day-job that demands60-hour-minimum weeks and gives her the ultimate responsi-bility for professional preparation of 115 residents in theDepartment of Medicine, as well as 175 third year studentswho rotate in batches through her medical clerkship programin the department each year (all of whom she knows byname), her plate is rather full. Add to that her love for reading medical history books and literature, and her hobby of search-ing out antique medical instruments and first editions of med-ical texts for her collection, and you might agree that you'remeeting a modern day \"renaissance\" physician. Just put her name into your Google search engine and you'll find that her titles pop up on every bookseller's Web site. Her second published work, Mastering the OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) and the CSA (Clinical Skills Assessment), published by McGraw-Hill/Appleton & Lange in 2001 with co-author and formerresident Beverly Cornel-Avendano, MD, is number 16 onAmazon.com's top sellers in the \"Medicine/Physician andPatient\" category. That's quite a feat! Eight reviews posted on the site rate the \"bestseller\" an average of four-and-a half starsout of five. This is actually the second edition of her very first book, Mastering the OSCE/CSA: Objective Structured Clinical12-29njms 6/7/05 11:38 BYRON FALL '04 WINTER '05 22the first fifty years Examination/Clinical Skills Assessment, which was published by McGraw-Hill in 1999. The author recounts her initialexperience with the publishing world and, oddly, it was a verygood one. She decided to market her own book rather thanpitch it through an agent. After completing five chapters, shesent her manuscript to three publishers and all three made heroffers. She chose to go with the only one willing to meet withher in Newark. \"I liked the personal touch,\" she says. Just in case you were wondering, eight months is the amount of time it took her to write that first book\u2014that'seight months of nights and weekends\u2014and she edits her ownwriting again and again along the way. The book was the firstcomprehensive study guide for the standardized patient exams(a required \"pass\" for all third year students) and includesmore than 50 simulated practice cases in all specialties. How did the 1983 alum of New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) become a published author, University MasterEducator, eight-time winner of the student-nominatedGolden Apple award for teaching excellence and Vice Chairof Education of the NJMS Department of Medicine, all inless than two decades after completing her residency? Herquiet, determined passion for what she does, her dedicationto the task at hand and her respect for students and for theeducational process are just a few of the qualities that she brings tothe table. Reteguiz set her sights on med- icine at the age of 5, adopting asher model a \"country-type\" doc-tor in her native Brooklyn, whoworked seven days a week in a smalloffice in a poor neighborhood. She worked her way throughSt. Peter's College in Jersey City, where she majored in biolo-gy but \"took as many writing and literature courses as Icould,\" and also through her first two years of medical school.Looking back, she says, \"It was a struggle, but well worth it.\"After completing her residency in internal medicine atNJMS, and staying on an additional year to serve as chief res-ident at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in EastOrange, she was certain that medicine and teaching would beher life's work; and her alma mater recognized an up-and-coming talent and gave her the opportunity to show her stuff. The rest, as they say, is history. In 1995, Reteguiz became coordinator for the medicine clerkship, the course, she says,that had the greatest influence on her professional life andthat, as a student, she hoped one day to teach. She countsamong the top achievements of her career her overhaul of thecurriculum for this course, which is now entirely case-based,no lectures and no slides. Its goal is to provide third-year stu-dents with the clinical skills for solving problems and makingdecisions related to patient care. Why has she sparked such enthusiasm among her stu- dents? \"I get students to listen, reflect and respond,\" she says.\"I don't allow belittlement or humiliation in the classroom. Every point of view is heard. I believe in leading students tothe right answer\u2014they will get there. And it is mandatorythat we laugh along the way.\" Her books are actually gifts to her students. Perhaps there is a novel or a collection of short stories in her future, but sofar, she has concentrated on enhancing her students' prepara-tion for their careers. Her first effort was launched because\"third year students would ask me how to study\u2014there wereno books on the market\u2014for the standardized patient exam.\"Book number two was written specifically for second yearstudents and is an introduction to the clinical sciences.\"Knowing your target audience and knowing how they'reexamined\" are the crucial factors for this kind of writing, shesays. She is now focusing her efforts on a textbook for thirdyear medical students in the medicine clerkship which is read- 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:39 PM Page 22NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 23the first fifty years able in 12 weeks, the length of their rotation. Existing text-books are far too long for most students to find useful for thisrotation, she explains. The third edition of her first book, now renamed Mastering the USMLE, Step 2, CS Examination, was pub- lished in November. \"This is a new title and it's for a newexam,\" she explains. It required her to rewrite 50 percent of the text. Not a problem, she says, because \"I enjoy the processof writing.\" Reteguiz undoubtedly has her finger on the pulse of med- ical students' academic needs and she has discovered a win-ning formula to meet those needs. She receives emails fromstudents from all over the world, offering criticisms (notmany), praise and suggestions. She answers all emails andincorporates many of the students' suggested changes into herrevisions of the volumes. Ultimately, her goals as a writer aremuch the same as her goals as an educator: \"to give medicalstudents and residents all of the tools they need to be amongthe best doctors in the world.\" At NJMS, she accomplishesthis in an environment that's optimistic, positive and caring.At the end of the day, what she wants to know is that \"some-how I contributed to bettering the health of New Jersey byeducating a couple of generations of physicians whose train-ing was superb.\" \u2014 Eve Jacobs Philosopher at Work BENJAMIN WILFOND '85 Chatting by telephone from his office at the NIH'sDepartment of Clinical Bioethics, Benjamin Wilfond, MD,sounds like a man who is happily in the right place at theright time. He would certainly catch a glimpse of himself inthe Oxford American Dictionary's third definition of theword philosophical: \"searching, by logical reasoning, for an understanding of the basic truths and principles of the universe, life and morals, and of human perception and understanding of these.\" The New Jersey Medical School (NJMS '85) alum wrestles on a daily basis with \"the basic truths and principles\" of medicine and \"human perception and understanding of these,\" and feels very lucky to be able to do so.An equal love for biology and philosophy fueled Wilfond's undergraduate years. He knew he wanted to become a physi- cian, but how to marry these two, seemingly divergent inter-ests in a future profession was his \"dangling\" question. Whileat NJMS, he became active in the American MedicalStudents Association, serving as co-president of the localchapter and then holding a spot on the National Board ofT rustees. The organization, which he says encourages studentactivism and tries to fill in the gaps in medical education,gave him the nod when he introduced the idea of forming anational committee on bioethics and developing a videotapeon the ethical issues facing medical students. He spent tworotations in his fourth year\u2014one at the Hastings Center RIGHT: JOHN CONSOLI12-29njms Page 23PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 24the first fifty years writing scripts and one at Stanford University working with amedical student who was also getting a graduate degree infilm\u2014to produce the video. It includes short vignettes basedon ethical dilemmas he faced as a student: what to tell apatient when doing the first lumbar puncture; how torespond to a patient who wanted more information about ascheduled liver biopsy that would not affect clinical manage-ment; how to advocate for a patient with terminal cancer whowanted to go home, but whose family wanted the patient tostay in a phase I clinical trial. He says that, 19 years later, he still shows the tape to students and mulls over the same hardquestions. Wilfond completed a pediatrics residency and a pediatric pulmonology fellowship at the University of Wisconsin. Heinitially set his sights on practicing primary care pediatricswhere \"kids almost always get better,\" but during residency,found himself more and more attracted to dealing with\"chronic and complicated\" scenarios \"where families are inmessy situations that don't always get better,\" he says. In1989, at the beginning of his fellowship, he was advised by amentor to focus on the ethics of molecular biology. \"He said,'The cystic fibrosis gene will soon be identified and you needto think about that,'\" recalls Wilfond. Just one year later, thebudding bioethicist turned a failed grant application into awinning paper in JAMA . In the paper, he argued for clinical studies to assess the benefits and risks of screening beforewidespread introduction of carrier testing during pregnancy. That was the real beginning of his active involvement in cystic fibrosis genetics and the field of bioethics. On the fac-ulty of the University of Arizona in T ucson for six years, hebecame steeped in the world of academic medicine, happilycombining teaching, research and patient care. But in 1998,a position at the new Department of Clinical Bioethics withthe National Genome Research Institute of the NIH caughthis eye and held out the promise of spending more of his timeand energy doing what he loves best. This job, he says, is \"80percent research\u2014thinking and writing about conceptualissues.\" Life at the NIH has been good for Wilfond. \"Every day I pinch myself because I can't believe it's happening to me,\" hesays. \"It's incredible\u2014I'm paid to think about whether whatwe are doing is right, and if there are better ways.\" He developed an interest in newborn screening that began during his fellowship because the University of Wisconsinwas conducting a study of CF newborn screening. He hascontinued to ask questions about the scientific and ethicalissues in deciding what tests to add to newborn screeningpanels. With technological advances, commercial interests,professional enthusiasm, and patient advocacy, the list couldbecome endless. He say that this will be an emerging dilem-ma as public heath and genetics converge. He calls much of his work \"descriptive,\" which \"involves collecting and organizing quantities of information.\" He hasrecently completed a survey of 12 states doing cystic fibrosisnewborn screening and has documented the range of vari-ability in the different approaches. \"Good ethics begin withgood facts,\" he says, quoting one of his mentors, Dr. NormanFost from the University of Wisconsin. He has been interested in the commercialization of genet- ics and recently published a paper in JAMA on limitations of the direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic testing. He alsopublished a survey of internet sites that allow the public tobuy genetic tests directly. Another current project is lookingat the variations in the genetic screening panels that labs areoffering Ashkenazi Jews. He has found that these panelsinclude anywhere from two to nine tests and that there aregenerally price disincentives for choosing to exclude any par-ticular test from the panel. His question: Is pricing structureconducive to people deciding what's best for them or ismoney driving the decision? Since coming to the NIH, he has been looking at issues of involving children in research. For example: Under what cir-cumstances are placebo-controlled clinical trials involvingchildren with asthma ethical? This project showed that chil-dren in placebo arms (who were not given standard therapy)were twice as likely to have an asthma exacerbation, and hequestioned the withholding of standard therapy when thebenefits are clear. However, he points out that when the ben-efits of new or even standard therapy are not clearly estab-lished, controlled trials are both scientifically and ethicallyjustified. He is also interested in understanding what information people want to know before participating in a clinical trial.Wilfond says that consent forms are growing longer anddenser as medicine becomes more complex and less easy tocomprehend. \"What information is relevant?\" he asks. As the NJMS alum looks back, he \"philosophizes\" about his education: \"Certainly the medical school had an impacton the direction of my career.\" He fondly recalls several fac-ulty members who encouraged him to forge his own path: 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:39 PM Page 24the first fifty years David Price, PhD, whose \"Ethics for Lunch\" series inspiredthe young student; Jacob Lindenthal, PhD, the \"coolest guy,so smart and so serious about his interest in the social sci-ences;\" Adele Brodkin, PhD, a child development specialist,who supported his interest in making the videotape; StevenSimring, MD, who helped to make psychiatry \"my mostintellectually interesting subject;\" and Franklin Desposito,MD, a pediatric geneticist who was his attending on his firstrotation of his third year and a \"really good guy\u2014he left animpression. Our paths have continued to evolve and cross.\" Wilfond has returned to his alma mater to receive the alumni achievement award in 2003 and as featured speaker atthe AOA medical honor society induction ceremony in 2004.After a long hiatus of not having much involvement with theschool, \"I can look back and see that it helped me move in thedirection I wanted to move,\" he muses. Philosophicallyspeaking, he is beginning to \"perceive and understand\" theplace of those four hard years in the unfolding story that is hislife. \u2014 Eve JacobsJersey Girl Makes Good BARBARA-ANN BRITTEN '97 Barbara-Ann Britten, MD, does things her own way. In heroffice, no one is ever rushed. \"I don't see patients in five min- utes,\" she says. \"I spend an hour on a physical, and 20 min-utes for follow up visits. I'll never be a rich doctor, but I'm ahappy one.\" Britten specializes in internal medicine, which in itself is not unusual. What makes her unique is her background as ascientist and teacher, and the tenacity with which she pursuedher dream of becoming a physician. The Newark native grad-uated from Rutgers-Newark in 1970, but didn't go to med-ical school until two decades later. What happened along theway? \"Let's just say I hit a few road blocks,\" she says with alaugh. \"But it doesn't matter, because I'm here now.\" Here is Hackettstown, where she has built a successful solo practice in onlyfour years. \"I love my patients, and I NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL PETER BYRON 25 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:39 PM Page 25PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 26the first fifty years have a great rapport with them,\" she says. The feeling ismutual. In 2003, she received the Physician of the Year Award at Hackettstown Community Hospital. Medical school was always in Britten's plans. As an under- graduate at Rutgers-Newark, she considered majoring in oneof the life sciences, but switched to mathematics when fellowstudents said how difficult the sciences were. \"I was afraid Iwouldn't be able to keep up,\" she says. In college she was required to do community service, so she volunteered in the lab at St. Elizabeth Hospital inElizabeth. \"I loved being in the lab,\" she says, \"so when theyoffered me a part-time job, I accepted it.\" She realized chang-ing majors was a mistake, so she switched to zoology/premed.Now she had to take the most difficult courses\u2014organicchemistry, physics, and physiology\u2014all in the same semester.\"My grades were not spectacular,\" she says. Following her graduation, she applied to medical schools, and was accepted at only one, in the Philippines. Her familyhad limited funds, but a generous gift of $1,000 from herfamily physician, Dr. Joseph Peyser, enabled her to enroll. Hersister purchased her a \"fly now, pay later\" ticket and she tookoff, landing many hours later \"in the middle of a monsoon.\" Unfortunately, Britten and her family did not fully under- stand the exchange rate in the Philippines. T wo months intothe semester, she ran out of money and had to return home.\"I was disappointed, but realized it would have been veryhard to learn there,\" she says. \"The labs had no runningwater, and some of the classrooms had no lighting other thanlight shining through the windows.\" She returned to St. Elizabeth Hospital and was offered a job as supervisor of the hematology lab. She also enrolled atSeton Hall University, studying for her master's in biology atnight. It was here that she met her husband, Tom, a fellowscientist who was doing research on autoimmune diseases.The two married in 1973. Britten had two children and stayed home with them. She completed her master's in 1983. Her husband did further work on his PhD, then started his own research and diagnos-tic company, Scimedx, which he owns and runs today. In her 30s, a wife and mother, Britten felt that medical school was out of her reach. She enrolled in a PhD programin physiology at Rutgers and initiated her own research proj-ects. In 1985 she became a research teaching specialist atUMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, teachinggross anatomy and histology to first year students. That year,she also presented her research in Bell's palsy and antigan-glioside antibodies at the American Association of Anato-mists' annual meeting. She finished her PhD course work in 1987 and continued to teach. \"Teaching was very rewarding, but something was miss-ing,\" she says. \"I still had this dream of becoming a physician.\" In 1990, as her daughter was getting ready to go to college, Britten felt the tug of medical school even more strongly. Shemet with Dr. Joseph Tassoni, then the director of admissionsat NJMS. \"He asked me, 'Do you have enough energy forthis? You're 40 years old.' I said I did. He told me to prepare for the MCATs, and if I got all 12s, he'd take my application.\" Getting 12s\u2014the maximum score\u2014was an unattainable goal, but she studied hard. \"I didn't get 12s, but I did prettydarn well,\" she laughs. \"So I applied anyway.\" That year, she made the waiting list, but unfortunately, was not accepted. So she applied again the following year, and waswait-listed once again. \"I was convinced they thought I wastoo old, or maybe having a mid-life crisis,\" she said. \"But Ihad good grades, good test scores. I decided to give it onemore shot.\" She was wait-listed again, but refused to give up hope. She'd started wearing a pager just in case the admissions officetried to get in touch with her. \"They call you if a spotbecomes available,\" she explains. \"If you're not there, they callthe next person on the list.\" One day she was home and the phone rang. She didn't get to it in time. Immediately afterward, her pager went off. \"Myheart started to pound,\" she says. \"Sure enough, it was amember of the admissions committee, offering me a spot.Did I still want it? I said, 'Definitely!'\" Her husband had bought a special bottle of wine in France, saying they would only open it when she got intomedical school. She put the wine in a shopping bag, drove toher husband's office, and they toasted her acceptance. Britten held the distinction of being the oldest student in the class of 1997. \"On Mother's Day, many of my fellowclassmates sent me cards!\" she says. \"I was perfectly fine withbeing the oldest. The students treated me like I was one ofthem.\" She and her husband enjoyed having parties for thestudents at their home in Long Valley, setting up tents andserving food. \"We had a lot of things to celebrate along theway,\" she says. She was also one of the most outstanding. She consistent- ly made the dean's list, was elected into the Alpha OmegaAlpha Medical Honor Society, and was president of theStudent Council. She received several other awards as well,12-29njms 6/7/05 11:40 PM Page 26the first fifty years NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 27including the Drs. Milton and Rose Prystowsky Award foroverall excellence in patient care, and the Dean CharlesBrown Award for her significant contributions to NJMS. Shedid her residency in internal medicine at The UniversityHospital and received the Resident Achievement Award forexcellence in patient care, teaching and leadership. Britten has continued to stay involved with her alma mater. She is assistant clinical professor of medicine at NJMSand serves as Vice President of Post Graduate Affairs for theNJMS Alumni Association. She says, \"I'm a lucky woman\u2014I get to do what I love. I attribute my success to my husband and my parents, whotaught me that you can do anything if you want it badlyenough, and work hard enough to get it.\" \u2014 Mary Ann Littell NJMS Has Presence in Iraq JEFFREY UPPERMAN '91 When he's not doctoring, Jeffrey Upperman, MD, is servinghis country. In his professional life, he is a pediatric surgeonat Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. He's also a major in theU.S. Army Reserve, and recently finished a stint in Iraq. A Reservist since 1992, Upperman says New Jersey Medical School faculty member Kenneth Swan, MD, wasinstrumental in motivating him to join. Swan, who was pro-filed in the last issue of NJMS Pulse, is a long-time member of the Reserve, and has inspired many students (by someaccounts, more than 100) to join too. \"I'm indebted to himfor his guidance and help, and for his sense of patriotismwhich he also instilled in me,\" says the surgeon. Upperman served in Iraq for four months, from April to July 2004. It was his first deployment, but probably not hislast, since he has committed to serve until the year 2011. Hewas part of a medical team that performed major sur-gery under very harsh conditions. Hewas stationed at Abu Ghraib prison, thesite of the much-publicized abusesagainst Iraqi prisoners of war.\"Unfortunately, those isolated incidentshave overshadowed the good work beingdone by many wonderful young peoplewho are defending their country,\" he says. The physician, who hails from Plainfield, received his undergraduatedegree at Stanford University. He returned to his roots toattend medical school, and also did his general surgery resi-dency at The University Hospital. Along the way, he com-pleted all of his course work toward a PhD in anatomy, cellbiology and injury sciences at UMDNJ-Graduate School ofBiomedical Sciences. From June 1999 to June 2001 he did a fellowship in pedi- atric surgery at Children's Hospital. What drew him toPittsburgh was a chance meeting with Dr. Henri Ford, chiefof the division of pediatric surgery at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine. \"He has an outstanding track record in training physicans who are also researchers and scientists,\" he states. \"That's what I wanted to do.\" After finishing the fellowship, Upperman became part of the attending staff at Children's Hospital. He is involved in research, and has a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to study necrotiz- ing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease affecting some 5 to 7 percent of all premature babies. In babies with NEC, the intestinal tract becomes inflamed, often leading to gut barrier failure. Up to half of those affected will die. \"We can keep tiny infants alive at 12-29njmsR1 6/7/05 11:40 PM Page 27PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 28the first fifty years 23 or 24 weeks, but unfortunately, more and more of themare at risk for NEC,\" says Upperman. \"The challenge is find-ing out who is susceptible, and why.\" The researcher is nowcollecting DNA samples to see if there is a genetic link. Upperman is also something of a consumer advocate. As a pediatric surgeon treating trauma patients, he is troubled bythe increasing incidence of young people injured on all ter-rain vehicles, or ATVs. So he's working with the ConsumerFederation of America to prevent these injuries. \"Since 1998, the number of children who have been injured in ATV accidents has more than tripled, and theinjuries are more severe and often lead to death,\" he says.\"Children and adolescents should not be riding ATVs.\" The surgeon's special memories of his years at NJMS include the camaraderie and community spirit of the SNMA,or Student National Medical Association, an organization hejoined. He also says he is thankful for the support andencouragement he received from his mentor, Robert L.Johnson, MD, professor and chair of the department of pedi-atrics at NJMS (see page 40). Upperman's wife, Bevanne Bean Mayberry, MD, is also an NJMS alum (class of 1996). She is an assistant professor atthe University of Pittsburgh and a staff physician at the VAPittsburgh Healthcare System. The couple has three sons ages2, 4, and 7. Of his possible return to Iraq, Upperman admits that it's very hard to leave his family and work behind and head intodanger. \"But if I'm needed,\" he says, \"I'll go back and do whatI signed on to do.\" \u2014 Mary Ann Littell The Ballad of David Lunt DAVID LUNT '01 Heroes in traditional folk songs and epic poems oftenencounter obstacles on the way to achieving goals. The abili-ty to endure trials, rejections, nearly endless journeys and tospend decades searching intellectually for life's answers iswhat makes the character so compelling. Listeners want tohear about the adventures and, at long last, the happy ending. David Lunt, MD, NJMS '01, could easily be a hero in one of the ballads he likes to sing while playing his guitar. A musi-cian and the oldest graduate in the 50 year history of themedical school, Lunt was 54 when he achieved his happyending of becoming a doctor. Looking back over his life froma seat in a western New Jersey medical practice called \"TheDoctor Is In,\" Lunt laughs, \"I'm more than happy that thisturned out to be what I was meant to do.\" His medical group,with offices in Clinton, Phillipsburg and Flemington, is acombination of urgent care and traditional family practicemedicine. \"We see lots and lots of trauma, sniffles and sneezesbecause we're open when typical docs' offices are closed.\" Lunt loves what he is doing and therein lies the surprising denouement to his remarkable tale. His life now \"never ceas-es to amaze\" him. As a pre-med undergraduate at Cornell University in the late 1960s, \"I took the music route,\" he admits, earning onlyB minuses and C pluses. \"I thought those grades weren't badfor someone not even going to class,\" he says. \"I never reallygave up on the idea of medicine. I just discovered entertain-ing.\" With college friends, he formed a group, \"TheLaughing Stock,\" that was even good enough to land a con-tract with ABC Paramount Records. After graduation, theytoured the east coast of the U.S. for several years. \"We neveractually had any records produced because we were young, arrogant and had artistic differences with the recording com-pany,\" he chuckles. Lunt laughs so often you begin to see whythey called themselves \"The Laughing Stock.\" In his 30s, he returned to thoughts of medicine only to be told that he was already too old to apply. \"I never really gaveup, though,\" he admits. \"The idea just faded for awhile.\" By1973, after following his musical inclinations for severalyears, Lunt took a job with the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) in Washington, DC. \"Performing hadbecome harder to do and I needed a steady income with ben-efits because I was getting married. I thought I'd spend just afew years there.\" The SSA, in fact,turned into a 23 year, long-term\"gig,\" he says. Approaching his mid-40s and going through an amicabledivorce with no childreninvolved, Lunt looked at medi-cine once again. He went back to school to see if he could stilldo organic chemistry andstarted studying for a Mastersin Public Health, a route intomedicine that had been suggested to him.As an older student, he was gratified to know that his brainstill performed under pressure. \"You probably have to work a 12-29njms 6/7/05 11:40 PM Page 28NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL PETER BYRON 29the first fifty years little harder to nail the knowledge down but not so much sothat your age makes it an impassable obstacle.\" Then, he began applying to medical schools throughout the country, only to be turned down six times. The year NJMSfinally accepted his application, he had actually anticipatedrejection. \"I assumed that another cycle had passed me becauseI didn't get a call until a month before classes began. A spothad opened up. I was watching 'Cheers' on television whenthe phone rang.\" He was so happy that he \"danced around inthe middle of the room and called everyone I knew.\" As a medical student, Lunt says, \"I had a great time. I enjoyed my classmates and didn't find much of an age barri-er between us.\" In fact, along with three other students\u2014Ethan Nash, Gautam Malhotra, and Jondavid Jabush\u2014Lunt,a baritone, formed a quartet known as the Lymph Notes,which performed at campus functions and in local spots. Now that his long hours as a resident in family practice at the Hunterdon Medical Center are over, he almost hasenough time for a regular music gig. \"I'm looking for oneright now. I still play every St. Patrick's Day at a bar, singingIrish music, country and folk ballads.\" Yet, what motivateshim more than music is the fact that being a doctor lives upto what he always hoped it would be. \"That was one of mygreatest fears going into medicine. I was making this hugecommitment at a point in my life that made me worry: Whathappens if, when I get there, I don't like it?\" Lunt laughs about some of the crazier experiences as a physician. Not so long ago, he received a telephone call froma hunter who was in a vehicle two hours away in Pennsylvaniadriving on Route 380. \"This guy had a hunting knife stuckin his chest. He was with a friend and they wanted directions to our office.\" There had been an accident and they assumedthat an urgent care center could handle anything. \"We're notan ER,\" Lunt points out. \"I told them to pull over, call 911and get to the nearest hospital.\" In The Ballad of David Lunt, rescuing a wounded hunter from poor thinking is certainly not an episode that wouldhave appeared early in the song. But that makes this music inthe sixth decade of life even sweeter. Says Lunt, \"The closestthing I can compare this feeling to is a calling, and while Iknow that's a word which is used a lot, for me, it's the truth.\" is simply defined: the study of how an individual's genetic inheritance affects the body's response todrugs. It was birthed by the massive undertaking called theHuman Genome Project, which gave us two \"great surprise dis-coveries,\" according to Marvin Schwalb, PhD, director of theNJMS Center for Human and Molecular Genetics. \"There areonly about 30,000 human genes, not 100,000 as was previous-ly thought,\" he says, and \"the degree of variation between unre-lated humans is greater than was previously assumed, betweentwo and three million base pair differences.\" He explains that most of these differences have no medical consequence and that those considered medically significantoften do not cause disease, but may bring about what has beentermed a \"predisposition syndrome.\" The best example of this,the geneticist says, is a polymorphism\u2014or sequence variation\u2014in the blood-clotting factor gene called Factor V. This polymor- phism has been named Factor V Leiden and is present in 5 to 7percent of the population. People who have this autosomaldominant trait have a substantially increased risk of clottingproblems, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonaryembolism. \"But some additional stress, such as surgery, preg-nancy or flying to Australia, is needed to set off the problem.This is a very different concept from our traditional thinkingabout disease,\" Schwalb points out. There are a host of other predisposition syndromes, accord-ing to the geneticist, only some of which have been identified sofar. \"This is just the tip of a giant iceberg,\" he comments.\"Many others will be found soon.\" He says that in the not-too-distant future, scientists will be able to identify who is at highrisk during their life spans for such major health concerns as dia-betes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Since anotherenvironmental event is required to set things off, this knowledgecould prove very useful. Someone could be advised to take spe-cial precautions, for instance, after surgery, or make lifestylechanges, Schwalb suggests, or there might be a medication, tobe taken before someone is symptomatic, that could delay orward off the disease entirely. There is another variant in a blood clotting gene, prothrom- bin, which also affects up to 5 percent of the U.S. population.The polymorphism is called Prothrombin (PT) 20210. Forthose individuals who have the Prothrombin variant in combi-nation with Factor V Leiden the increased risk for deep veinthrombosis or pulmonary emboli are 80 to 100 fold, Schwalbexplains. \"This is as dangerous as breast cancer in terms of mor-tality,\" he points out, \"and in most cases it is now diagnosed onthe autopsy table. If a clot is big enough, and the lungs can'taccept oxygen, it's like being suffocated internally. It happens soquickly\u2014in five minutes someone is dead. The good news is, ifyou know of the genetic risk, there are simple and effective ther-apies to greatly reduce the risk.\" NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL 31THE WORD PHARMACOGENETICS may roll off the tongue as if it were in our every- day lingo. But, in fact, the art and the science of this specialty are so new that mostphysicians who earned their MD more than five years ago never heard of it duringtheir many years in school. And the genetics field that spawned this new arm is mov-ing forward at such enormous speed that even those with some cursory knowledgewill find themselves behind the eight ball in a very short time.WHAT 'S IN A NAME : pharmaco genetics BY EVE JACOBS V. HABBICK VISIONS/PHOTO RESEARCHERS, INC.30-33njms 6/7/05 11:42 PM Page 31Diagnosis and patient management are the two areas where genetic information has and will continue to have a significantimpact on people's lives, Schwalb states. But in the area of diag- nosis, cost is still a major deterrent to offering certain tests tolarge numbers of pre-symptomatic individuals, he explains. Although the technology to analyze genes has dramatically improved over the last few years, \"Big genes with lots of muta-tions can cost thousands of dollars to analyze,\" he says. \"Forinstance, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which can disclose aninherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers, are largeand may have more than 800 mutations between them. To com-pletely sequence one of these genes can cost up to $3,000.\" If a woman has no signs or symptoms but has several close relativeswith breast cancer, should she be tested? Because this inheritedform of breast/ovarian cancer is relatively uncommon, and hav-ing a mutation in these genes can mean an 80 percent chance ofcontracting these cancers in one's lifetime, the benefit seems tooutweigh the large cost. Schwalb thinks that pre-symptomatic genetic testing for familial cardiomyopathies could also be a very beneficial under-taking. With a frequency as high as one in 500, there are poten-tially many people affected. And the benefits of knowing youare genetically susceptible are numerous. \"If an individual testspositive, the rest of his family will probably want to know thatthey may be prone to a life-threatening disorder,\" he explains.\"Siblings and children of affected individuals need this infor-mation. And if the family member finds out that he does nothave the mutation, that's very valuable knowledge, too.\" Thegeneticist recommends concentrating on cardiovascular diseases,such as long QT syndrome, that can cause sudden death. In the area of patient management, Schwalb says that know- ing you are predisposed to a disease may make a huge difference.\"Patients can change their behavior. If you know that you are athigh risk for breast cancer, there are a wide variety of options toreduce your risk,\" he offers. \"Or if you know that your child isat increased risk for Type 2 diabetes if he or she becomes obese,that might change your behavior as a parent.\" Carrier testing\u2014to establish if an individual or couple \"car- ries\" a gene for a particular disorder\u2014is often done when plan-ning a pregnancy. There are many issues surrounding how wide-ly available to make certain diagnostic tests and these issues arebeing hotly debated right now. It's clear that if there is a strongfamily history of a disorder, carrier testing is probably in order.But when you are looking at an entire population, when do thebenefits outweigh the costs? Schwalb explains that most often carrier testing is directed atparticular groups where the risk for a disorder is high (such assickle cell anemia for African Americans and Tay-Sachs disease inthe Ashkenazi Jewish population), but other tests for fairly com-mon diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) are more widely appli-cable. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology rec-ommends the carrier testing for CF be offered to all Caucasiansof reproductive age. Screening was suggested for Caucasiansbecause at the time, three years ago, data only provided for effec-tive testing in that group. \"Now we have the same level of infor- mation for Hispanics and African Americans,\" he says. \"The exact circumstances that make a carrier test a worth- while, cost-effective endeavor have not been defined. However,as technology improves, the cost of testing will become a small- er part of the equation. For example, 15 years ago, it cost about$100 to test for a single CF mutation. We can now test for 60mutations for less than $200,\" he continues. Finally, we come to the new and little understood specialty of pharmacogenetics. Determining reactions to medications basedon genetics is part and parcel of our growing understanding ofthe human genome, but the research, while it is very promising,is still in its infancy. Potentially, this new field could save a lotof lives and a lot of money, since many patients are given med-icines that may be effective in most people, but don't work forthem, or may actually be detrimental and even lethal. There are100,000 deaths in the U.S. each year attributed to adverse reac- PULSE FALL '04 WINTER '05 32 30-33njms 6/7/05 11:42 PM Page 32NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOLtions to drugs. That's just one frightening statistic. There aremore than two million reactions to drugs that while not deadlyare serious enough to require hospitalization. And, of course,there are many situations where medicines just don't work at all. During the next five to 10 years, the customization of drug treatments will be a big headliner in medicine. Because enzymeswhich are encoded for by the cytochrome P450 family of genesare critical in metabolizing more than 30 different classes ofdrugs in use today, the focus of much research is the DNA vari-ations in these genes. Many researchers\u2014in laboratories all overthe world\u2014are working on this right now, says Schwalb. Because these genes are not involved in development or the normal functioning of the body, the effects of such variants are generally not noticed until a patient's reaction to a particulardrug\u2014at a normal dose\u2014is unusual. These variants may affectthe dosage at which a drug works, or whether the drug is safeand/or effective for that individual. If these enzymes are lessactive than normal, or totally inactive, and the drugs are notbroken down and eliminated quickly enough from the body, thepatient can experience an overdose. \"For example, antidepressants such as SSRIs are great for the majority of people, but don't work at all for others. The antico-agulant warfarin (Coumadin) is a lifesaver, but for others, it canactually be dangerous,\" he says. \"Some people with an identifi-able change in the Cytochrome P450 gene are 'poor metaboliz-ers' of warfarin. In these people, the regular dose of the drug actslike an overdose. That is the reason why all patients put on war-farin therapy are carefully monitored for dosage when they starttherapy.\" Of course, the down side of this new knowledge aboutindividual response to medications is that if there are only oneor two drugs on the market to treat a particular condition, andthe patient cannot metabolize those drugs, he may be left withno treatment options. Right now physicians basically prescribe medication and dosages on a trial and error basis, says Schwalb, and if a patienthas a bad reaction or no reaction at all, the physician moves onto try another drug or a lower dose of the same drug. The goalof pharmacogenetics is for physicians to be able to order a per-sonalized genetic profile for each patient that would ensure thatthe best drug is prescribed right from the start. And rather thandetermining dosages by weight and age, the physician could refer to the patient's genetic \"blueprint,\" which would providethe necessary information to determine his ability to metabolizethe drug. The future of genetics looks extraordinarily promising, accordingto the geneticist. But because new information becomes availableon an almost daily basis, many physicians are overwhelmed, anddon't know when a finding has true import for their practice ofmedicine. Schwalb has developed a Web site\u2014which will haveconstantly updated information on genetics, as well as interpre-tations of the practical relevance of the findings\u2014to remedywhat is currently a bewildering situation. The site, which can beaccessed at www.TheUniversityHospital.com/adultgenetics, willalso list all tests currently available at the UMDNJ Center forHuman and Molecular Genetics, which Schwalb directs, as wellas \"bulletins\" as new tests become available. As patients learn about findings in genetics from the media, \"they will want to know: 'Does this help me in any way?'\" hesays, \"and as new diagnostic tests become available, patients willask where and when they can get them.\" He points out that ifonly pharmacogenetics had been a bit more advanced, Vioxxmight not have been recalled. \"Had we been able to identifythose who would be adversely affected ahead of time with a sim-ple test, the millions of people who took this drug and benefit-ed from it would not have been forced to do without it andthose adversely affected would never have been prescribed thedrug in the first place.\" This is the promise of a specialty thatmay very well change the face of \"medicine\" as we know it today. 33Potentially, this new field could save a lot oflives and a lot of money, since many patients are given medicines thatmay be effective in most people,but don't work for them ,or may actually be detrimental and even lethal.

When I was 9 years old my Sunday school teacher asked mewhat I wanted to be when I grew up. I immediately said Iwanted to be a missionary doctor like my hero AlbertSchweitzer. I don't recall how I knew who he was or even why I said it. That desire stuck for many years. Eventually the ideaof doing medical missionary work abroad faded, and wasreplaced by a desire to work domestically with the under-served. The work has proven to be extremely rewarding. 2. Who were your mentors when you were an NJMS student? Franklin Behrle, Mary Mycek, Mike Lyons, Carroll Leevy,Anthony Boccabella, Connie Uy, and Ted Kushnick. 3. What is your fondest memory of being a student at New Jersey Medical School? My class was the last to have basic science classes in JerseyCity. The student lecture hall was on one of the upper floorsof the medical science building and had a fantastic view ofNew York City harbor. Many times, as my mind wanderedduring some of the less inspiring lectures, my eyes would strayto that magnificent view. The most vivid memory I have is a biochemistry lecture given by Dr. Robert Wilson on the daythe QEII sailed into New York Harbor during its inauguralvoyage. However, my fondest memory is the close bond that formed between students and faculty as we moved to Newarkand worked to make a difference in the community with pro-grams such as the Student Family Health Care Center. 4. Can you tell us about your latest book project? My current book, Strength for Their Journey, is a parenting guide for African American parents. It is based largely on the30 years of experience my co-author, Dr. Paulette Stanford,and I have had in our work counseling parents from thegreater Newark area. 5. What do you consider the top three accomplishments of your career? Founding and growing the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine. When I joined the faculty in 1976, pediatrics stopped at 12 years of age. Becoming president of the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners. Becoming professor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics. 6. As chair of pediatrics, what are your goals for your department? Expand the size of the faculty in each of the pediatricdivisions. Expand the departmental research base. Evolve the NJMS Department of Pediatrics into one of the nation's premier children's health enterprises. PETER BYRONRobert L.
