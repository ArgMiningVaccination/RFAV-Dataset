The EEAP focuses o n the ef- fects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality , and materials , as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change . When considering the effects of climate change, it has become c lear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginning s of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa, are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas wi ll likely experi- ence a reduction in UV radiation as ozone - and climate -driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces detailed Quadrennial R eport s every four years ; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 20 15 (Photo- chem . Photobiol . Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP pro- duces less detailed and shorter Update Report s of recent and relevant scientific find- ings. The most recent of these wa s for 201 6 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci ., 2017, 16, 107-145). The present 2017 Update Report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radi- ation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. A full Quadrennial Assessment will be made available in 20 18/2019 . ____ _______________________________ _____________________________ ___ \u00a7 List of alphabetical order: Anthony Andrady, Pieter J .

Apparent increases in the total ozone column (i.e., ozone concentrations integrated over all altitudes) have been observed at most latitudes since 1996. However, these increases are not yet statistically significant because of natural variabili ty and compounding factors, such as the buildup of greenhouse gases. The only exception is Ant- arctica, where a significant positive trend in total ozone has been observed.241 Decreases in UV -B radiation at the Earth's surface in response to the recov- ery of stratospheric ozone have not been detected yet because such changes are still masked by varying attenuation of UV radiation by ozone, clouds, aero- sols, and other factors. This section provi des an update on observed changes in UV radiation and several climate indicators reported during the last year. Effects on UV radiation from factors other than ozone are also discussed. 1.1 Actions resulting from the Montreal Protocol continue to protect the ozone layer by controlling emissions of ozone -depleting substances and are expected to mitigat e global temperature rise in the future through the phase -out of hydrofluorocarbons . Emissions of ozone -depleting sub- stances (ODSs) in the US have been decreasing considerably from 2008 to 2014, but hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are ODS replacements with high global warming potential (e.g., HFC134a), have been increasing.196 Phase -out of HFCs by 2030 in accordance with the Kigali amendment is projected to re- duce the climate impacts of HFCs in the upper troposphere and stratosphere by 90% by the year 2050,200 and to avoid additional warming near the Earth's surface of up to 0.5 \u00b0C.482 1.2 Evidence that ozone over Antarctica has started to recover in both aus- tral spring and summer has been robustly identified in the ozone profile and total column measurements of ozone, demonstrating the effective- ness of the Montreal Protocol. A new study using ozone profile data from nine stations241 has confirmed the first signs of recovery of Antarctic ozone that were reported earlier404 using data from two stations only. Statistically sig- nificant (95% confidence level) positive trends in ozone concentrations for 2001 -2013 were found for austral spring (September, October, and No vem- ber) in the lower stratosphere (about 10 -20 km) ( Figure 1.1A). Trends in total column ozone inside the polar vortex were also analyzed in the new study. These trends were significant at the 95% confidence level for spring and at the 90% confidence level for summer (December, January, and February). Of note, both studies omitted data from 2015, which were probably influenced by the Calbuco volcanic aerosols, leading to a record size ozone hole in that Page 6 of 95 year.210 A third study corroborated these conclusions by showing that down- ward trends of spring -time stratospheri c ozone at the two Antarctic stations, South Pole and Syowa, for 1960 -2000 have turned to upward trends for 2000 -2014.403 De- spite the turnaround of ozone, variability of UV -B radiation in Antarctica re- mains very large, with record high UV index (UVI) observed at the South Pole in spring 2015 and below average UVI in spring 2016 (Fig- ure 1.1 B). 1.3 Observations and mod- els show that Antarctic ozone depletion influ- ences surface climate in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, with effects on wind patterns, precipitation, temperature, and total solar radiation . Analy- sis of observations and models has shown that ozone depletion led to changes in springtime precipitation in the South Pacific Ocean, Australia, and New Zealand over the 1961 -1996 period.57 These changes range from -25% to +40%, de- pending on location. Var- iability among models is large but all models indi- cate a consistent pattern of changes over this re- gion. Qualitative agreement between models and measurements suggests that these effect s on precipitation will likely reverse when ozone recovers in the future. Simulations by a climate model demonstrated that stratospheric ozone deple- tion has led to an increase in extreme precipitation and a decrease in extreme temperature over southeaster n South America in the second half of the twen- tieth century.479 It has been suggested208 that the recently observed climate Figure 1.1 A: Time evolution of October, November, and December average concentrations of ozone in the lower stratosphere (about 10-20 km) over Antarctica derived from ozonesonde measurements at 11 stations (red - dashed line). Average concentrations derived from meas- urements inside the polar vortex are shown separately (green -solid line). Figure redrawn from241.

Measurements between mid -October and mid -De- cember of 2015 and 2016 were, respectively, close to the upper and lower limits of historical observations. The fig- ure is adapted from441 and updated with data from 2016. Page 7 of 95 changes in the Southern Hemisphere in the summer and autumn are associ- ated with ozone depletion, which affects circulation in the lower stratosphere and tropopause regions in the Southern Hemisphere through these seasons . In contrast to these indirect effects, where the ozone 'hole' modifies circulation patterns, a modeling study85 has reported a direct effec t of the Antarctic ozone 'hole' whereby i ncreased UV radiation due to reduced absorption of ozone in the stratos phere contributes to total solar radiation at the surface that has in- creased by up to 3.8 W m-2 (~2%) in October -December. However, most of this excess radiation is redirected upwards by the highly reflecting surface of Antarctica and does not contribute s ignificantly to increases in temperature over Antarctica. 1.4 The recently observed depletion of stratospheric ozone in the Arctic led to increased UV radiation at the Earth's surface and contributed to changes in the surface climate of the Northern Hemisphere . Unprece- dented decreases in stratospheric ozone were observed over the Arctic in winter 2010/11 due to unique meteorological conditions in the region. Less se- vere decreases in ozone occurred again in the winter of 2015/16,278 albeit with different timing. This recent event resulted in an increased UVI at the surface of up to 60% above the long -term avera ge over the areas affected . However, absolute increases remained below 1 UVI unit because the event occurred early in the year when UV radiation is low.43 Analysis of ozone observations in 1979 -2012 revealed a statistically signifi- cant association between low values of Arctic stratospheric ozone in March and changes in climate between 30 and 70\u00b0N in March and A pril.209 The changes in climate include a poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet stream, lower than normal surface temperatures over eastern North America, South- eastern Europe, and Southern Asia, and higher than normal temperatures over Northern and Central Asia. Another study480 suggests that effects from variations in Arctic stratospheric ozone may extend even to the tropics and are associated with El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. 1.5 Water vapour injected into the lower stratosphere during severe storms over the USA Great Plains might lead to chemical destruction of ozone and increased UV radiation at the surface . A model ling study18 shows that water vapour inj ected into the lower stratosphere during severe storms over the USA Great Plains may decrease ozone concentrations by up to 17% at al- titudes between 14 and 18 km. The additional water vapour leads to hygro- scopic growth of sulfate aerosols that are ubiquito usly present in the strato- sphere. Because the chemical reactions that lead to ozone loss are catalyti- cally enhanced by these aerosol particles, the additional aerosol surface area provided by water vapour greatly increases the speed of these reactions, re- sulting in loss of ozone. The magnitude of the effect depends strongly on stratospheric temperatures at the time of the injection and is spatially limited to the area where the storm occurs. However, these effects of water vapour with respect to the total o zone column and su rface UV radiation are small , and there is currently insufficient evidence to assess whether these effects will change over time . This effect on the total ozone column is less than 2% over the area of the storm. Given the small spatial an d temporal extent of these Page 8 of 95 events, changes in UV radiation received at the Earth's surface would be of minimal biological importance. 1.6 As changes in stratospheric ozone outside the Polar regions are small, changes in the attenuation of UV -B radiation under cloud -free skies in populated areas are mainly controlled by the concentrations of aerosols and the wavelength dependence of their optical properties. Carbona- ceous aerosols resulting from combustion include black carbon (BC), which is primarily released at elevated temperatures from burning of fossil fuels, biofu- els, and biomass , and brown carbon (BrC), which is produced by the burning of organic matter at lower temperatures such as by forest fires. The wave- length dependence of the absorption of UV and visi ble radiation by BC is rela- tively small. However, measurements from the ground and space at Santa Cruz, Bolivia, confirmed that the absorption by BrC has a strong wavelength dependence in the UV with the largest absorption observed at UV -B wave- lengths.306 These aeroso l effects are much larger in the UV than in the visible region. By considering the different fractions of BC and BrC, the study con- cluded that absorption by BrC at this site caused an additional 20 -25% reduc- tion at the shortest UV -B wavelengths reaching t he surface (i.e., 305 nm) compared to the BC -only absorption. If confirmed, unaccounted reduction in surface UV -B irradiance by BrC could be important for health risk assess- ments. Aerosols are a more crucial factor in controlling UV -B radiation than thoug ht in the past, but available tools for quantifying their effects are still inadequate. The need for development of methods and instrumentation to quantify the ab- sorption efficiency of aerosols at UV wavelengths already has been discussed in a previous ass essment.34 Data from a multi -filter shadowband radiometer and a sun -photometer have been combined to quantify the absorption effi- ciency of aerosols over Athens, Greece, at selected wavelengths in the UV -A and visible range (332 -1020 nm). The largest absorbing efficiency has been found for organic and dust aerosols.222 A new sun -photometer (UVPFR) de- veloped at PMOD/WRC Davos, Switzerland has been extensively evaluated during two campaigns in Iza\u00f1a -Tenerife, S pain, in 2015 and 2016, and com- pared with a Brewer spectrophotometer. It was found that both instruments can measure the aerosol optical depth (AOD) with 0.01 precision at UV -B wavelengths between 305 and 320 nm.74 Furthermore, a new method has been proposed to enable more accurate calibration of AOD sun -photometers at locations with high and variable aerosol load.490 Such improvements will help towards clearer separation of the effe cts on UV -B radiation from ozone and aerosols. Page 9 of 95 1.7 When the sun is unobscured during partly cloudy conditions, UV irradi- ances can be higher than under clear -sky conditions . Such enhance- ments of UV irradiance by clouds rarely exceed 20% of clear -sky values a nd are smaller for UV -B than for visible or UV -A irradiance . There has been con- fusion in the recent literature about the magnitude and wavelength -depend- ence of the effects of clouds on UV radiation. High -quality spectral measure- ments obtained from instrume nts at several sites covering a wide range of alti- tudes (up to 3.4 km at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii) have demonstrated that the attenuation of UV -B radiation by clouds is, typically, slightly smaller than for UV -A radiation (cloud modification factor (CMF) < 1 in Figure 1.2). However, during partly cloudy conditions when the sun is not obscured, radia- tion at all wave- lengths can be signifi- cantly higher than for clear -sky conditions because of light scat- tering from clouds that are brighter than the blue sky. At such times (CMF > 1 in Figure 1.2), cloud en- hancements tend to be smaller in the UV - B than in the UV -A or visible regions com- pared with clear skies. Enhancements of UV -B radiation greater than 20% are rare, and in snow -free conditions, enhance- ments of UV -A radia- tion by clouds are less than 40%.31, 293 Enhancements by clouds can be larger in the visible re gion, but they rarely ex- ceed 50%.31, 293 These results are consistent with earlier studies.101, 347 \"Cloud enhancement\" events can substantially increase expo- sure to UV radiation for short periods, so can be importan t for human expo- sure. However, over longer periods (e.g., over the course of a day), the pres- ence of clouds usually reduces the total dose of UV radiation. 1.8 Changes in UV radiation since the onset of stratospheric ozone deple- tion in the mid -1960s over north ern mid -latitudes have been caused mainly by changes in aerosols and clouds while decreasing strato- spheric ozone had a role only up to the mid -1990s . Long -term datasets of Figure 1.2 Spectral dependence of effect s of clouds on solar UV radiation in terms of the cloud modification factor (CMF, defined as the ratio of measured irradiance to calculated clear -sky irradiance ). The figure shows the relationship be- tween CMF in the UV -B and UV -B region s derived from many measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. Events of attenuation by clouds correspond to CMF < 1 (lower left), while events of enhancement by clouds corre- spond to CMF >1 (upper right). Updated from.293 Page 10 of 95 surface UV radiation from ground -based instruments are sparse and only a few adequat ely cover the period since the onset of the ozone depletion. Therefore, models and ancillary data have been used to reconstruct the UV irradiance data for the past. These are often limited by the availability of ozone data derived by satellites , which sta rted operating only in the late 1970s. One of the longest UVI series (1964 -2014) was reconstructed for Belsk, Po- land, from a statistical model using aerosol extinction and total ozone data.354 Increasing aerosols caused a decline in clea r-sky UVI of up to 6% between 1964 and the mid -1970s, while increases in the UVI of about 5 -6% per dec- ade in 1974 -1996 were caused in equal parts by decreasing aerosol s and ozone depletion . Since 1996, UVI is no longer changing , as aerosol and ozone have b een stable. Measurements and model estimates for the Polish Polar Station, Hornsund (77\u00b0N), revealed small and non -significant positive trends ( < 1% per year) of daily erythemal doses for 1983 -2016.240 A statistically significant trend of de- creasing doses of ca 1% per year was found for 1996 -2016 in April, May, and June. This trend could not be attributed to observed increases in t otal ozone and was due mainly to effects of clouds. The dominant effect on total solar radiation, resulting from decreasing cloudi- ness over Europe (1983 -2010), has been reconfirmed from satellite data.377 The annually averaged solar irradiance was found to have increased by ca 2 W m-2 per decade over Central and Eastern Europe. This repres ents an in- crease of less than 1% per decade, which may not be important for impacts of UV radiation, but may be important for global warming. Statistically significant decreases in daily surface UV radiation from 1961 to 2015 were reported over most regio ns of China, ranging between 0.27 and 0.63 kJ m-2 per year (0.15 and 0.37 % per year).264 These trends were derived from reconstructed data based on a model and proxy data from 724 weather stations, and are caused mainly by changes in aerosols, clouds, and wa ter vapour. Trends for UV -B radiation for these stations are not available but are expected to be of similar magnitude because changes in total ozone over this time frame were comparatively small. 1.9 Accurate and consistent measurements of UV radiation from g round - and space -based systems are required for the detection of changes due to variations in ozone, aerosols, and clouds, as well as for public infor- mation . Radiometers operating unattended in harsh environments may occa- sionally report faulty data. Withou t proper quality control, such data can lead to false conclusions, as for example the extremely high UVI of 43.3 at the tropical Andes reported by Cabrol et al.66 A recent study where the data and methods were critically reviewed and incorrect data discarded, suggests that the maximum UVI at this location was in the range of 25 \u00b1 5.295 Satellite UV data are often provided at spatial resolution of tens of kilometers . A method has been proposed to scale the UVI data provided by the space - Page 11 of 95 borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) down to 1 x 1 km grid. This downscaling was achieved by interpolation of satellite data and other meas- urements (e.g., surface albedo, aerosol o ptical depth, cloud cover, dew point, ozone, surface incoming shortwave flux, and sulfur dioxide).451 Such higher resolution data can be more useful in exposure studies where UV radiati on data at specific locations are needed. Images from smartphone cameras have been tested as UV monitoring de- vices for improved personalisation and public awareness of exposure to UV radiation. Currently the accuracy of these devices is much lower than sc ien- tific-grade UV sensors in use, either due to poor technical characteristics and calibration,205 or due to inappropriate measurement principles.299 Data from such devices should be used with caution for information on actual sun -burn- ing radiation levels, but may be helpful in public health campaigns pending further evaluation. 2 Ultravio let radiation and human health in a changing climate Robyn Lucas, Rachel Neale, Seyhan Yazar, Antony Young, Frank de Gruijl, Mary Norval, and Yukio Takizawa The main adverse health effects of higher exposure to UV -B radiation, which is, in part, a consequ ence of depletion of stratospheric ozone, are increased risks of skin cancers, immune suppression, and disorders of the eye, including cataract. Here we assess recent evidence regarding these adverse effects, consider factors related to sun protection, and evaluate new evidence of the beneficial effects of sun exposure. Expected recovery of stratospheric ozone because of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, and lower solar radia- tion in some regions due to increased cloud cover, will reduce ambient UV -B radiation in the future. It is thus important to understand both the risks and benefits of exposure to solar radiation. 2.1 The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma continues to increase in many countries but is highly variable within and between countri es due to differences in ambient UV radiation, skin type, and behaviour in relation to exposure to the sun. The incidence of cutaneous malignant mel- anoma (CMM) is continuing to increase in many countries but the rate of in- crease is variable. For example, incidence of CMM increased by ca 4% per year in Estonia (1995 to 2013)334 but increased by only ca 0.6% per year over a recent 7 -year period in the USA (2009 -2016) .163 In Estonia, the rapid in- crease in incidence of CMM began following the country's transition to an open market economy in the 1990s, and may have been driven by i ncreased use of tanning beds and holidays in sunny locations.334 New data from the Global Burden of Disease Study159 show the overall bur- den to health systems of new cases of CMM ( Figure 2.1). Data for overall in- cidence, and trends in incidence, conceal variation according to age, sex and Page 12 of 95 ethnicity. For ex ample, the increase in i ncidence of CMM in Estonia was par- ticularly high in younger women ( < 50 years): an increase of 6% per year from 1995 -2013 compared to 2% per year for women aged 50 -64 years, 3% per year for women 65 years, and 4.4% for men of all ages.334 Of note, in younger men, there was a 12% per year increase in incidence of CMM during 2005 -2013, compared to an increase of 0.6% per year from 1995 -2005. In the USA, the inci- dence of CMM was considerably lower in Hispanics (4.2 per 100,000) than non -Hispanic whites (22.6 per 100,000) in 2012; the incidence sig- nificantly de- creased in Hispan- ics between 2003 and 2012 (average annual decrease of 1.4%),155 but significantly in- creased in non - Hispanic whites over a similar time period (average annual increase 1.7% from 2002 - 2011).233 Diagnosis is often at a later stage and with greater tumour thickness in Hispanics compared to non -Hispanic whites, resulting in poorer survival.155 Notably, Hispanics who have adopted characteristics of a US lifestyle and US - born Hispanics have a higher risk of sunburn and CMM compared to those who retain their traditional lifestyles.155 CMM is uncommon in African Ameri- cans. When it occurs, it is most often found on the sole of the foot, and by the time medical attention is sought is often deeper and at a more advanced stage and thus more likely to be lethal.274 In South and Central America, the age -standardised incidence rate for CMM (across varying time periods, mainly 2003 -2007) ranged fro m 1 to 5 per 100,000 and tended to be higher further from the Equator.109 European an- cestry was an important risk factor for CMM. Incidence rates were relatively stable from 1985 -2007 except in Chilean males where there was an increase of 10% annually (the equivalent increase was 1.6% in women, suggesting that this is not an artefact of changes in reporting). The strong skin tanning culture in Brazil probably explains the high incidence of CMM (4.9 per 100,000) com- pared to other South or Central American countries (e.g. , 1.9 per 100,000 in Costa Rica).109 Although CMM is uncommon in Japan ( Figure 2.1), the skin was the most fre- Figure 2.1 Estimates of the incidence (new diagnoses) of cuta- neous mali gnant melanoma for selected locations, from the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2016159 (note that these es- timates are not adjusted for the differing age distributions of the populations). Page 13 of 95 quent body site (81%) for melanoma in a recent analysis of a national base, by mucosal melanoma melanoma (1.8%).426 The most common site for CMM was the lower limb (49%), followed by the upper limb (17%), trunk (12%), and head and neck (6%). This compares to the relative proportion s for the USA (1988 -2010) skin sites in the USA (1999 -2006) was lower limb (33%) , upper limb (27%), trunk (26%), and head and neck (14%).53 In Tu- nisia, the incidence of CMM is very low ( ca 0.6 per 100,000 per year) and most of these tumours o ccur on skin surfaces that are not exposed to the sun, such as the sole of the foot.317 A recent economic analysis from Australia that included costs of diagnos is and treatment of CMM, as well as management of lesions subsequently diag- nosed as benign, found the estimated cost of CMM to be AUD$272 million per year.127 The high and increasing incidence of CMM, coupled with increasingly effective but expensive immunotherapies, means that programs promoting personal sun protection, including those with a specific focus on prevention of CMM, are very important. 2.2 Keratinocyte c ancers (previously called non -melanoma skin cancer and comprising squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) cause a substantial health burden, and there is evidence of increasing incidence in many countries. Monitoring the incidence of skin cancer continues to be hampered by lack of adequate registration, exemplified by a recent study from the United Kingdom that found only about two -thirds of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) identified through pathology laboratories were included in the can cer registry.167 Allowing for this under -registration and extrapolating to the wider United Kingdom population, it was estimated that, excluding basal cell carcino ma (BCC), SCC was the 5th most common of the potentially lethal cancers (after bowel, prostate, lung and breast cancers). In many countries, there is evidence that the incidence is increasing. For example, in the eastern region of the United Kingdom betwee n 2003 and 2012 there was a 2.8 -fold in- crease in the incidence of SCC lesions.167 Based on data from this region, it was predicted that, for the whole of the United Kingdom, there would be 298,308 cases of BCC and 81,694 cases of SCC in 2025.168 The estimated costs (in 2025, excluding costs paid by the patient, lost productivity, and premature mortality) of these skin cancers ranged from \u00a3338 to \u00a3465 million. An analysis of data from Girona (Spain) found an average annual increase between 1994 and 2012 of 1.6% for SCC and 1.5 % for BCC, but the pattern differed depending on sex. For SCC, the yearly increase was similar for men and women (1.6% and 1.4%, respectively) whereas, for BCC, the increase in incidence was twice as high in women compared to men (2.0% v s 1.0%).376 In Minnesota, USA there was an increase in incidence of around 1.5 -fold for BCC and 2.6 -fold for SCC between the early 1980s and the first decade of the 2000s.315 These changes most likely reflect an increase in sun -seeking be- haviours rather than higher levels of ambient UV -B radiation. The most recent Global Burden of Disease Study found that cutaneous SCC Page 14 of 95 contributed 0.06% to the total disease burden, as measured in disability -ad- justed life years (DALYs), a measure which incorporates years of healthy life lost to death as well as disability.159 BCC contributed less than 0.01% due to extremely low mortality for this cancer. At a population level, the main impact of KCs relates to the high overall cost of managing the very large numbers of these lesions.171 2.3 The relative proportions of the types of skin cancer in African and Mid- dle Eastern countries differ to that of Western countries. In predomi- nantly fair -skinned populations in Western countries, the most common type of skin cancer is BCC (71% of KC in Australia; 80% of KC in United King- dom).267 Of the other UV -induced skin cancers - SCC, CMM, and Merkel cell carcinoma - SCC is the most common, followed by CMM; Merkel cell carci- noma is rare.381 In contrast to this pattern, in a study from the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, a review of histopathological skin cancer data showed that SCC was the commonest c ancer (45.4%), (with Kaposi's sarcoma contributing the remaining 6.5%).485 Skin cancer was the 9th most common malignancy in Saudi Arabia in 2010 (3.2% of newly diagnosed cancers).8 The commonest tumour was followed by SCC (23%); CMM made up 7% of skin cancers (other skin cancers contributed the remaining 34%). Importantly, there is a lack of high quality population -based data from many countries making it diffi- cult to monitor trends in incidence. 2.4 Skin cancers account for 40 -50% of the cancers that occur following solid organ transplantation and are almost invariably found on sun -ex- posed body sites and have a higher risk of death than in the general population. Medical management following organ transplantation requires maintenance of immune suppression to prevent rejection of the transplant. This immune suppression greatly increases the risk of UV -induced skin can- cers. Risks are particularly high in older people and men, in those who have had a pre -transplant skin cancer, in regions of the world where there is high ambient UV radiation , and on body sites that are frequently exposed to UV ra- diation. The most common tumour is SCC, with an incidence of 65 - to 250 - times higher than in the general population. The incidences of BCC (10 -16- fold) and of CMM (up to 8 -fold) are also increased compared to the general population.305 In a study from the USA, t he mortality rate from skin cancer in organ transplant recipients (35.3 per 100,000 person years) was nearly 10 - times higher than that seen in the general population (4 per 100,000).156 An increased risk of CMM and KC also occurs in people who have impaired im- munity for other reasons, such as during chronic haemodialysis.194, 454 These susceptible populations need carefully targeted advice about prevention and screening 2.5 \"Normal\" sun -exposed skin contains thousands of mutations, including those in genes important to cancer development, but a new study shows that non -mutated cells within the epidermis eliminate mutated cells providing dynamic repair and regeneration. Skin cancers have the highest mutation burden of any cancer.77 We have previously reported that biopsies of aged, sun -exposed (but otherwise normal) skin contained thousands of evolv- ing clones of abnormal cells in which over a quarter of the cells contained Page 15 of 95 cancer -causing mutations.283 A recent study using innovative imaging tech- niques has shown that normal (non -mutated) cells actively eliminate mutated cells in the epidermis, and replace the ab normal clones with normal skin ar- chitecture.59 This work further eluci dates our understanding of the processes involved in the genesis of skin cancers. 2.6 There is little evidence that screening the general population for skin cancer reduces deaths due to skin cancer . A review of the large population screening program in German y shows limited evidence that screening re- duces mortality.199, 412 However, selective screening of patients at high risk of skin cancer by primary care physicians may increase early detection of skin cancers.123 In Belgium, a total body skin examination offered to the gene ral adult population was more cost -effective than lesion -directed screening, but both incurred costs of over USD$20,000 for a gain of one quality adjusted life year (QALY).348 Notably, full skin examination is required to avoid missing a treatable CMM; 1 in 3 CMM would be missed without full skin examination.476 Screening has potential harms such as psychological distress and unneces- sary removal of non -malignant lesions. In a systematic review of the evidence for screening for skin cancer, the US Preventative Services Task Force con- cluded that there was currently insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of skin cancer screening by clinicians using a visual skin examination.436 2.7 Despite awareness of the health risks of sun exposure, there is inade- quate adoption of sun protection behaviours . Although evidence suggests that multi -component community -wide interventions can reduce exposure to UV radiation,378 inadequate adoption of sun protection strategies continues. High-dose exposu re to UV radiation in childhood is a major risk factor for CMM. Nevertheless, in a nationally representative sample of schools in the USA, sun safety practices and policies were uncommon.133 For example, only 12% of high schools, 18% of middle schools and 15% of elementary schools scheduled outdoors activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak inten- sity. In an analysis of the national database of emerg ency room admissions in 2013 in the USA, there were an estimated 33,826 sunburn -associated emer- gency room visits at an estimated cost of USD$11.2 million.176 The most com- monly affected population groups were men younger than 18 years and women aged 18 -29 years. Australian adolescents professed a desire to tan to achieve the perceived social benefits of being considered attractive to their peers, despite being aware of the long -term health risks.423 A study of young adults (18-34 years) showed that people who frequently used sunbeds for in- door tanning were also more likely to report never or seldom using sun protec- tion when outdoors.142 However, a study of global trends for Google search entries from 2004 -2016 showed an increase in \"sunscreen\" coupled with a decline in \"tanning bed\",230 perhaps indicating increased awareness of the risks of sun exposure over this time period. 2.8 Several studies show that comprehensive sun protection programs are cost-effective . A recent update of an earlier economic analysis in Australia showed that an additional investment of AUD$0.16 per capita per year in skin cancer prevention (with a total program cost over 20 ye ars of AUD$62 million) Page 16 of 95 could result in the prevention of 140,000 cases of skin cancer and 6200 prem- ature deaths from 2011 to 2030.393 The projected annual expenditure for 2015 in Australia for KC alone145 (including costs of diagnosis, treatment and pa- thology) was AUD$700 million (with costs for CMM already noted in section 2.1). Analysis of past achievem ent of the SunSmart program in Australia showed that, for an investment of AUD$0.37 per capita per year, 43,000 skin cancers were prevented between 1988 and 2010 at a net cost saving of AUD$94 million (based on costs of treatment averted).394 The cost of skin cance r treatment in public hospitals was 30 times higher than the funding for skin cancer prevention. These studies are consistent with previous work from Belgium,349 which also showed the cost -benefit of prevention programs, and suggest that there should be increased investment in programs that promote sun protection. 2.9 The pathways and effects of modulation of the immune system following exposure to solar radiation continu e to be elucidated . Exposure of the skin and eyes to UV radiation modulates immune function through a range of pathways (reviewed in182). New research suggests that there may be addi- tional pathways. E xposure of the skin to UV radiation may change the skin mi- crobiome - the composition of the populations of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mites that normally reside on or within the skin (e.g., about 100 million bacte- ria are present per cm2 of skin surface) .339 However, any downstre am effects of this on UV -induced immune suppression are not yet clear. Exposure to UV - B radiation alters the expression of immune -related genes, resulting in changes to the levels of cytokines in the blood,63, 352, 355 presumably through epigenetic mechanisms,63, 352, 355 and downregulation of immune pathways.352 It is likely that there is considerable cross -talk between the different pathways that influence immune function.355 There are both risks and benefits of UV -in- duced immune modulation, and the balance of these is an area of active re- search. Clarification of these issues will help to inform the development of evi- dence -based public health strategies regarding exposure to the sun. 2.10 There is new evidence to suggest that exposure to UV radiation in- creases the risk of melanomas of the eye that affect the conjunctiva, but not those affecting the deeper structures of the eye (i.e., uveal melano- mas) . Although rare (e.g., 0.4 per million population per year from 1973 to 2012 in the USA), the incidence of conjunctival melanoma is increasing in par- allel with the increasing incidence of CMM.273 In contrast, the incidence of uveal melanoma remains relatively constant ( ca 5 per million population per year in the USA). Uveal melanomas resemble melanocytic tumours of the central nervous system, whereas conjunctival melanomas show mutation pat- terns similar to those 369 A recent meta -analysis found insuffi- cient studies to assess an association between uveal melanoma and most measures of past sun exposure (such as photokeratitis, outdoor vacationing, blistering sunburns, or lifetime exposure to UV radiation). However, the evi- dence indicated no association between risk of uveal melanoma and outdoor leisure activity, occupational sun exposure, or latitude of birth, but increased risk in association with markers of UV sensitivity such as atypical and com- mon cutaneous naevi (m oles), freckles in the iris, and light eye colour.319 The increased risk of conjunctival melanoma related to exposure to UV radiation Page 17 of 95 emphasises the importance of incorporati ng eye protection messages into public health campaigns. 2.11 UV-induced damage to the superficial structures of the eye may provide useful biomarkers of past sun exposure . Iris freckles are small flecks of pigment on the anterior surface of the iris. Like skin freckles, iris freckles are formed because of accelerated growth of melanocytes containing large gran- ules of melanin. A recent study suggests that iris freckles are a marker of high sun exposure to the eye.386 Evidence includes the usual location of iris freck- les in the parts of the iris that are least protected from overhead solar radia- tion by the eyebrow and upper eyelid, and a greater number of iris freckles in peopl e reporting a history of severe sunburn and greater number of lifetime sunburns. Conjunctival autofluorescence (CUVAF) appears to reflect sun exposure over at least several months and possibly over a lifetime of chronic exposure.183 The area and intensity of CUVAF increases with less frequent use of sun- glasses,224 and larger areas occur in Caucasian children with fairer pigmenta- tion, lighter eye and hair colour, greater number of lifetime sunburns, freckling by the end of the previous summer, and less use of sunhats.419 Further stud- ies are required to assess the value of iris freckles and CUVAF as tools for measuring the exposure of an individual to UV radia tion across a range of dif- ferent environments and timeframes. The availability of objective measures of sun exposure will facilitate research into the risks and benefits of exposure to the sun. 2.12 Any link between sun exposure and age -related macular degenera tion - a leading cause of blindness worldwide - remains unclear . Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is responsible for 5% of blindness worldwide337 and is the leading cause of blindness (accounting for 54% in white Americans) in adults aged 40 years and over in European -derived populations.95 The dis- ease burden of AMD is increasing: the age -standardised disability -adjusted life years per 100,000 population increased from 5.3 to 6.3 between 1990 and 2016.159 It is therefore important to understand the causes of this condition. However, the association (if any) between sun exposure and AMD remains uncle ar. In a recent study, working outdoors was associated with late - but not early -stage AMD.384 In a large cross -sectional European study, there was a modest increased risk of late -stage AMD in association with vitamin D defi- ciency. However, reverse causality - where the impaired vision resulting from AMD caused reduc ed sun exposure and thus vitamin D deficiency - could not be excluded.292 Improved biomarkers of ocular sun exposure may help to elu- cidate the association between sun exposure and AMD in the future. 2.13 New health r isks are linked to exposure to solar radiation . In addition to the UV -induced skin cancers and eye diseases, there is emerging evidence of links between exposure to the sun and an increased risk of several other dis- orders, including diseases of the thyroid , Parkinson's disease, and mania. Re- cent studies support an association between greater number of naevi, past history of melanoma, or higher ambient UV radiation at the latitude of resi- dence, and increased risk of goitre and thyroid cancer.301 Both animal84 and Page 18 of 95 human studies103 show an in creased risk of Parkinson's disease in associa- tion with a past history of melanoma, and vice versa . Genetic variants leading to red hair and fair skin may increase risk of both melanoma and Parkin- son's.84 Seasonal affective disorder is well described; depression occurs dur- ing winter, possibly caused by low visible light (particularly blue light) leading to low serotonin levels. The opposite effect has recently been de scribed for mania, a state of euphoria and/or overactivity. Hospital admissions for mania in Denmark were highest during summer and when levels of UV radiation were higher.298 Further work is required to verif y whether these population - level associations between disease risks and levels of ambient UV radiation translate into alterations in individual risk. 2.14 Sunscreens are effective in reducing the hazards of exposing the skin to UV radiation, although the sun pr otection factor (SPF) of a sunscreen may overestimate the protection from natural solar radiation, giving a false sense of safety . Epidemiological evidence supports the use of sun- screens to inhibit keratinocyte cancers (KC) and CMM (reviewed in486). Simi- larly, laboratory studies show cyclobu- tane pyrimidine in326). CPDs can be regarded as biomarkers of the DNA damage that may lead to skin cancer, at least for KC. In addition, daily use of a broad -spectrum sun- screen (providi ng protection across both UVA and UVB wavelengths) signifi- cantly reduced the clinical signs of photoageing.360 The SPF is an internationally standardised rela tive measure of the ability of sunscreen, applied at a thickness of 2 mg cm-2, to prevent erythema (sunburn) occurring from a single exposure to solar simulated radiation (SSR)a. For ex- ample, unprotected skin receives 100% of the dose of UV radiation to th e skin. Correct application of an SPF 30 sunscreen will reduce that dose of ery- themally weighted UV radiation to 3% (see Fig ure 2.2). An international study of 261 \"dermatology experts\" demonstrated a lack of understanding of the re- lationships between SPF and the percentage of sunburning UV radiation that reaches the skin.188 This lack of knowledge could result in experts giving members of the public misleading advice about photoprotection. The SPF is primarily a measure of protection against UV -B radiation; for any specific SPF, increasing protection from UV -A radiation (i.e. broad spectrum protection) reduces the degree of protection against UV -B radiation.116 Since UV-B is considered to be more carcinogenic than UV -A, this ma y reduce pro- tection against skin cancer, although protection from erythema will be main- tained. The SPF as measured using SSR overestimates protection under nat- ural solar radiation, possibly due to a contribution of visible radiation (not pre- sent in SSR) to erythema.115 These factors, coupled with poor coverage (see a SSR is used in the laboratory to test the effects of UV irradiation. SSR mimics the spectrum of natu- ral UV radiation under ex treme conditions, i.e. a clear cloudless sky at noon at the Equator (zero lati- tude) but does not contain the visible component of sunlight. SSR spectra vary across different labor- atories, which can give rise to different outcomes. Page 19 of 95 section 2.15), mean that the stated SPF may not provide the protection from solar radiation that people expect when they apply sunscreen . 2.15 The use of higher SPF sunscreens has increased in the past several decades, but correct application remains problematic an d high SPF sun- screens do not provide full protection during extended exposure . In studies of beachgoers in Denmark in 2016, the frequency of sunscreen use increased from 45% in 1997 to 78% in women, and from 39% to 49% in men.186 For both men and women the median SPF of the sunscreen used in- creased from SPF 5 in 1997 to SPF 20 in 2016. The estima ted quantity of sunscreen applied increased from 0.48 mg cm-2 in 1992 to 0.57 mg cm-2 in 2016, which is still considerably lower than that used for SPF determination. Poor application of sunscreen is a common problem, as was demonstrated in a study of 52 h ealthy adults (see Figure 2.3);217 on average , 11% of the body surface was not covered at all. A clinical trial in Texas compared sunburn in 81 people randomised to use ei- ther a beach umbrella (that had no measurable UV transmission) or a sun- screen with an SPF of 100, while outdoors for 3.5 hours at peak solar eleva- tion in late summer.331 It was estimated that the sunscreen was applied at the recommended thickness of 2 mg cm-2, through repeated re -application. There was significantly more sunburn in the umbrella group (75% compared to 25% Figure 2.2. The graph shows the effectiveness of sunscreen of different sun protection fac- tors ( SPF) for preventing sun- burn. The dose of UV radiation (X-axis) is presented in unit of the dose that will cause mini- mal e rythema (MED) of t he skin. The Y -axis is the percent- age of a sunburning dose (1 MED) that will be received by the skin, using sunscreens of different SPF. With no sun- screen (SPF = 1) a dose of UV radiation of 1 MED results in 100% of the dose required to cause sunburn. With succes- sively higher SPF sunscreens, the dose of UV radiation re- quired to reach 1 MED (100% of a sunburning dose) in- creases. Adapted from .329 Page 20 of 95 of the sunscreen group , P < 0.001), but participants in both groups were sun- burned, demonstrating that, even with a very high SPF sunscreen, more than one strategy is necessary for optimal photoprotection. 2.16 There is growing understanding of health benefits of sun exposure that are independe nt of production of vita- min D . While the benefits of sun ex- posure to avoid vita- min D deficiency are clear, exposure to the sun appears to have a range of other beneficial ef- fects. UV -B and UV - A radiation are ab- sorbed by many molecules in the skin, causing chemi- cal reactions with a wide range of se- quelae. High blood pressure is the risk factor responsible for the greatest loss of disability -adjusted life years (DALYs) globally. Both observational and inter- vention studies support a benefit of sun exposure fo r high blood pressure, possibly through UV -A-mediated release of nitric oxide stores in the skin that cause arterial vasodilation and reduction in blood pressure.192, 466 Exposure to UV-B radiation might inhibit the development and progression of atherosclero- sis by decreasing inflammation (see section 2.9).379 Several studies suggest that low exposure to the sun or total avoidance of exposure to the sun are as- sociated with higher rates of all -cause mortality, mainly related to increased risk of death from cardiovascular and other non -cancer diseases (reviewed in261). In mice, exposure of skin to UV -B radiation increased the concentra- tions in the brain and plasma of a range of neuroendocrine hormones that have wide -ranging effects on appetite, metabolism, and immune function.395 While there are many plausible pathways whereby exposure to solar radiation may have benefits for health, further research is required to establish whether such benefits truly occur, and to quantify the size of any effects. 2.17 Observational studies and randomised controlled trials testing the asso- ciation between vitamin D and disease -related risks have contradictory findings . Exposure to the sun is the major source of vitamin D for much of the world's population. An individual's vitamin D status is usually assesse d by measuring the concentration in blood (serum or plasma) of a metabolite of vit- Figure 2.3. The figure shows the skin coverage following appli- cation of sunscreen. Body areas covered in sunscreen appear dark, while the red colour shows skin surfaces not covered by sunscreen. The photographs were taken using standardised UV photography (UVP) that is sensitive only to the UV -A part of the spectrum. The sunscreen used absorbs incoming UV -A radia- tion. Therefore, body are as covered with these UV -A filters ap- pear dark in UVP images. (Photograph from reference217; repro- duced with permission) . Page 21 of D, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D , (25(OH)D). Meta -analyses of observational co- hort studies continue to show associations between low concentrations of cir- culating 25(OH)D and incr eased risk of a wide range of health outcomes such as colorectal cancer,126 cardiovascular disease,492 dementia,166, 407 Meta -analyses of supple- mentation trials, however, have mostly failed to show any benefit of supple- mentation,29 with the possible exception of acute respiratory illnesses.284 There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, the results from the observational studies may have arisen due to reverse causality (the disease caused the low level of 25(OH)D rather than the low level of 25(OH)D causing the disease) or differences in other lifestyle factors that alter the dis- ease risk and are also associated with the level of 25(OH)D (confounding). Secondly, it may be that higher concentration of 25(OH )D in blood is a marker of higher exposure to UV radiation, and it is the non -vitamin D effects of sun exposure that confer the benefit. Finally, the trials may be flawed (e.g., recruit- ment of people who do not have vitamin D deficiency, supplementation at the wrong life stage, with too small a dose, or for too short a time). One possible way of disentangling the divergent results is to assess associa- tions between genetic variants associated with 25(OH)D concentration and disease risk, using an approach c alled Mendelian randomisation analysisb. Studies using this approach suggest possible causal associations between low 25(OH)D and ovarian cancer,327 multiple scleros is,161, 365 and Alzheimer's disease.307 No association found for asthma or atopic dermatitis,202, 280 cardiovasc ular disease ,55, 279 Parkinson's disease246 How- ever, due to the assumptions underpinning Mendelian randomisation studies, positive fin dings make an important contribution but do not provide 'proof' of a causal relationship and the null findings may be due to inadequate sample size. 2.18 Considerable variation occurs between individuals in production of vita- min D following exposure to UV radi ation and the half -life of 25(OH)D de- pends on its starting concentration . In one laboratory study of 22 people with similar skin types who were exposed to identical UV irradiation protocols, the maximum concentration of 25(OH)D in serum ranged from 85 -216 nmol L-1.105 Similar variability has been previously described in a group of 120 adults of similar skin type in Manchester, United Kingdom, who received a 6 - week course of UV irradiation. The increase in concentration of 25(OH)D in serum ranged from 5 -80 nmol L-1.366 The half -life of serum 25(OH)D during winter in Denmark has been shown to be dependent on the starting level.104 That is, in the group with the highest starting level (mean 25(OH)D = 132 nmol L-1, n = 22) the half -life was 89 days; in a group where the mean baseline level was 65 nmol L-1 (n = 14) the half-life was 120 days; and in a group with a low baseline 25 (OH)D level (mean 25(OH)D = 43 nmol L-1, n = 92), the half -life wa s 199 days. These half - lives are longer than was previously thought and could be adequate to provide b Mendelian randomisation analysis uses genetic variation in an exposure of interest (e.g., 25(OH)D level) to estimate the association between the exposure and a health outcome that is purportedly not due to confounding or reverse causality. Page 22 of 95 sufficient 25(OH)D for the duration of winter months in some locations. These findings have implications for advice regarding the target concentration of 25(OH)D at the end of summer to avoid vitamin D deficiency during winter . 2.19 In some countries, there is insufficient UV -B radiation for vitamin D pro- duction during certain parts of the year and vitamin D supplementation may be required to avoid deficiency . Severe vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults. Modelling of UV irradiance over Europe shows that there is insufficient UV -B radiation to produce vitamin D for up to 8 months of the year in parts of Norway, and for at least 4 months in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland.325 Thus, attention has turned to avoiding vitamin D deficiency via fortification of food. Widespread food fortification is an alternative to supple- mentation and, in Finland, fortifying liquid milk products resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of deficiency (25(OH)D < 30 nmol L-1) among people not us- ing supplement s from 13% to less than 1%, showing the benefit of this strat- egy.211 The United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recently conclude d that United Kingdom residents should be advised to routinely take 400 IU of supplementary vitamin D per day to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency. 2.20 Evidence is a ccumulating that shows lack of exposure to the sun in teen years increases the risk of myopia ( nearsightedness) . In an elderly Euro- pean population (mean age 72 years), higher exposures to UV -B radiation (measured using self -reported sun exposure information and meteorological data) in adolescence and young adulthood were associated with a reduced risk of being myopic.469 Furthermore, myopic children who wore contact lenses that transmitted radiation at 360 -400nm (UV -A wavelengths) in addi- tion to visible radiation had less progression of myopia over one year than children wearing contact lenses or glasses that blocked the UV -A wave- lengths.428 Experimental studies in chicks suggest that exposure to these longer UV wavelengths suppresses elongation of the axial length of the eye and thus development of myopia.428 There are, however, limitations to these studies, including differences in the transmission of UV radiation through the eyes of chicks compared to those of humans.382 Understanding the wave- length dependence of the induction of myopia is important in view of the known risks of exposure of the eye to UV wavelengths. 2.21 Darker skin pigmentation moderates both the beneficial and deleterious effects of UV radiation, but the magnitude of these effects is unclear. Darker skin pigmentation indicates a greater amount of melanin in the epider- mis. Melanin is a natural sunscreen but quantification of its protection against the acute and long -term adverse effects of solar radiation remains controver- sial.134 There is als o controversy about the inhibitory effect of melanin on pro- duction of vitamin D. A field study of children in India showed a greater in- crease in concentration of 25(OH)D in serum following exposure to the sun in children with lighter skin type (skin type IV) compared to those with darker skin type (skin type V).285 In contrast, in a small study of post -menopausal women (Caucasian, n = 9, skin types II/III; Sout h Asian, n = 8, skin types IV/V) given an identical UV irradiation protocol, there were no skin type or ethnicity - dependent differences in production of 25(OH)D, after accounting for baseline Page 23 of 95 concentrations of 25(OH)D.178 Overall, a lack of research on photoprotection in people with different amounts of skin pigmentation hampers development of evidence -based advice regarding sun exposure. 2.22 Exposure to high intensity solar radiation (such as on holidays) in- creases the concentration of 25(OH)D in serum with considerable con- comitant DNA damage, while regular low dose exposure to UV radiation increases the concentration of 25(OH)D without accumulation of DNA damage . Synthesis of vitamin D in the skin, and subsequent increase in con- centration s of 25(OH)D 3 in serum, is a marker of the benefit of exposure to UV-B radiation. The formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) is a marker of risk and can be evaluated by meas uring the concentration of T <>T dimers (a marker of DNA repair) in urine. Recent studies show that exposure to high doses of solar radiation, as experienced on beach holidays, increases concentrations of 25(OH)D in serum but with concomitant large increase s in CPDs (Table 2.1).346 In contrast, a laboratory study involving people of differ- ent skin types showed that regular low -dose UV irradiation (less than half of the dose that would cause a minimal sunburn in a fair -skinned person (1.3 standard erythema l dose, SED, three times per week) led to increases in con- centration of 25(OH)D 3, with a plateau at 21 days. There were no detectable T<>T dimers in the urine (se e Table 2.1).137 This suggests that public health messages should encourage regular low -dose sun exposure to improve vita- min D status, but avoidance of intermit tent high -dose sun exposure. 2.23 Climate change and strategies for its mitigation will change UV -induced risks to human health . Skin cancer is now recognised in a number of coun- tries as being an occupational health and safety issue.438 Outdoor workers such as agricultural workers may be particularly at risk from the combination of high levels of UV radiation and an increasing number of hot days, occurring as a result of global climate change.180 The most rapidly growing occupation in the USA is for technicians for renewable energy technologies , such as wind turbines.442 Several of the associated occupations are inherently outdoors, in- creasing risks of exp osure to UV radiation. The direct effect of warming temperatures on genesis of skin cancer remains unclear. We have previously reported that animal and epidemiological studies suggest that higher temperatures may increase the risk of UV -induced skin carci nogenesis.324 In a recent large epidemiological study in the USA, the risk of BCC was lowest in the lowest t emperature category for each of the quin- tiles of ambient UV radiation. However, the trend toward higher risk across the (increasing) temperature categories was not statistically significant.303 Not sur- prisingly, temperature and ambient UV radiation were highly correlated (r = 0.65). This correlation makes it difficult to assess independent or interactive effects of UV radiation and temperature in human st udies. A recent study in hairless mice showed that animals that were exposed to a warmer environ- mental temperature (34\u00b0C) prior to UV -B irradiation, compared to those not exposed to heat or exposed to heat following UV -B irradiation, had delayed and reduce d tumour formation, and lower levels of UV -induced mutations.244 If there are similar effects in human skin, these results suggest that warmer temperatures are unli kely to increase the risk of UV -induced BCC.

Robson, Sharon Robinson, Carlos Ballar\u00e9, Steve Flint Recent researc h on the effects of current and future interactions of UV radia- tion and climate on terrestrial ecosystems is assessed. We also evaluate the way in which changing stratospheric ozone is driving climate in the Southern Hemisphere and the implications of this for ecosystems in terms of changes in wind patterns and strength as well as precipitation and drying conditions. Rap- idly changing climatic conditions and associated changes in UV radiation ex- tending to other regions may affect agriculture in a several way s, reducing yield and the quality of some crops. Shifts in plant populations in some cases to higher elevations and higher lati- tudes are also being reported . These shifts may increase or decrease their exposure to UV radiation in novel environments produc ing positive and nega- tive outcomes for acclimation of plants and conservation of plant species, their communities and habitats . UV radiation contributes to global warming through the breakdown of dead plant material, especially in dry areas, causing the re- lease of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems as well as altering the availability of nutrients. Further progress has been made regarding the mechanisms un- derlying plant response to UV radiation, which aids our understanding of cur- rent and future consequence s of the multiple interactive effects of climatic conditions and UV radiation. Finally, in this section we report on some of the improved methodologies for measuring changes in UV radiation, important for increasing the accuracy and reliability of measure ments. 3.1 Large ozone -driven changes in climate in the Southern Hemisphere have occurred over the past 3 -4 decades and these climate changes continue to influence ecosystems in a variety of ways . Ozone depletion has influenced recent temperatures across Antar ctica and been implicated in changes in precipitation patterns across the Southern Hemisphere and into Asia56, 79, 90, 124, 256, 257, 277 (Figure 3-1; see also section 1). This has been linked to a highly positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or Ant- arctic oscillation (AAO ),4 a mode of atmospheric variability that describes the north/south position of the westerly wind belt (i.e., jet stream) around Antarc- tica (see also 51, 371). A trend of the SAM towards its positive phase corre- sponds to a decrease in atmospheric pressure at high latitudes and t o a con- traction of the westerly wind belt towards Antarctica. Since the 1960s, warming and associated drying has resulted in an increase in frequency of forest fires, measured from fire scars of tree rings at mid - and high-latitudes on the west of the And es.193 During the 2016 -2017 fire season, more than 500,000 hectares burned in central and southern Chile (between Page 26 of 95 29\u00b0S and 40\u00b0S) driven by a long -lasting drought that was amplified by con- current positive phases of SAM and ENSO conditions. Given the predi cted continued positive phase of SAM (which is associated with ozone depletion as noted above and in section 1.3), increased wildfire activity in Southern South America is likely to continue through the 21st century.193 Decreased precipita- tion in this reg ion also has negative implications for Chilean streamflow and the health of ecosystems as well as for production of hydroelectric power.314 In contrast, the Eastern side of the Andes has experienced wetter conditions. For example, changes in fauna ( ostracods and chironomids) from lake sedi- ments in El Toro Lake (40S, 70W) indicate that the lake has become fresher (less saline) as a result of increased precipitation since the middle of the 20th century, associated with the positive phase of SAM.99 Ozone depletion and the positive phase of SAM are also associated with more extrem e precipita- tion events in south -eastern South America (a very important area for food production479), and Southwestern Madagascar.361 The rainfall of the southern Amazon basin has been reconstructed from Centrolobium microchaete tree rings268 and suggests that the extreme wet seasons (from droughts to ex- tremely wet) since 1950 may be unmatched since 1799 Along the Antarctic Peninsula and on nearby islands, increasing tempera- tures, consistent with ozone -depletion and increasing greenhouse gases ,91, were associated with increased terrestrial productivity (microbial productivity, plant growth rates and carbon accumulation in moss beds) from the 1950s to the turn of the century.17 There is some evidence that these changes have re- versed since 2000, c onsistent with the recent cooling of this region.17, 434 In the sub -Antarctic islands, a positive phase of S AM is associated with better outcomes for some marine animals. A positive relationship between SAM and survival of juvenile wandering albatross has been found on the Crozet Is- lands.135 The authors speculate that this long -term climatic effect on recruit- ment age may be related to the progressive increase in weight observed in this species through the juvenile stages (see also465). Maternal mass in south- ern elephant seals on Macquarie Island varied by as much as 5 9 kg among years and was positively associated with the SAM and negatively with extent of sea ice.296 Similarly on the continent, modeling studies suggest th at survival of juvenile emperor penguins is positively related to SAM, probably a result of the impacts of SAM on prey availability and sea ice extent (which determines the distance travelled to foraging areas1). These findings indicate pervasive and far -reaching effects of ozone -driven climate change on ecosystems across the Southern Hemisphere.341 Page 27 of 95 Figure 3.1 The Antarctic ozone 'hole' ( A) and its impact on Southern Hemisphere atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Stratospheric ozone depletion and resultant cooling over Antarctica have pulled the polar jet stream towards the South ( B). The speed of the jet has also increased (see371 for details). The polar shift in the jet and its increased strength have changed atmospheric and oceanic circulation througho ut the Southern Hemisphere ( B). These changes are manifest in a mode of variability called the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The a tmosphere can be envisioned as balancing on a seesaw that is shifting up and down between the polar latitudes (south of 60S) and a latitud e band between 40-55S. The seesaw moves up and down with changes in mean sea level pressure (MSLP). As it pivots, th e large cells that drive the winds and precipitation move towards or away from Antarctica. When MSLP around Antarctica falls, the westerlies are strong, and SAM is in its posi- tive mode; when MSLP rises over those same regions , the westerlies weaken, and SA M is in its negative mode. Over the past century, in- creasing greenhouse gases and depletion of ozone have pushed the SAM towards its more positive phase (black arrow in B). The main ef- fects of the ozone 'hole' -induced positive phase of the SAM on the South ern Ocean are shown in ( C). The strengthening of the polar jet en- hances the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the associated overturning circulation (large blue -edged arrows). This drives increased upwelling of deep carbon -rich water and reduces the abilit y of the Southern Ocean to act as a sink for CO 2.248 South of the polar jet stream, temperatures have decreased (blue), while to th e North, temperatures have increased (red). The mean SAM index is now at its highest level for at least 1000 years.4 As a result, precipitation at high latitude s has increased and the mid -latitude dry -zone has moved south (see 51, 371). Clouds indicate areas with increased precipitation (over the equator and at the pole).

Understanding how plants respond to changes in UV radiation against a backdrop of other changing environmental factors is important for managing agricultural systems to maintain crop value and productivity under a changing cli mate. In certain cases, exposure to UV - B radiation can mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stress (e.g., drought).14, 372 In other situations (e.g., supplemental UV -B radiation with in- creased tropospheric ozone14, 281), UV -B radiation tends to accentuate the detrimental effects of concurrent stresses. Complex interactions between climate and UV radiation modify the timing of ripening of crops and the quality of harvest, with warmer temperatures and droughts changin g the timing of ripening to coincide with the seasonal maxi- mum for UV -B radiation.446 Drought and high UV -B radiation often co -occur, which can have positive effects on e.g., berry quality through cha nges in their sugar and antioxidant composition.111, 269 In contrast, warmer temperatures may counteract the tendency for increased flavonoid accumulation with UV -B radiation.413 On the other hand, reducing the shade on fruit can increase their carotenoid, xanthophyll and flavonoid levels in some cases.216, 497 However, flavonoids are generally induced by exposure to UV -A and UV -B radiation and ripening of fruits such as berry crops is hastened.72, 497 The potential benefits are start- ing to be exploited by manipulating the light conditions (via shading, canopy pruning , or supplemental lighting) during grow th and at the time of harvest.328, 338 Based on their origin or provenances, certain crop and tree varieties or populations seem to be adapted to novel UV -B radiation and climate combina- tions. Investigators are now testing how well these crops actually perform un- der various future climate change scenarios.468 There continues to be significant uncertainty about how the combination of multiple environmental factors that change simultaneously, including UV radi- ation, are affecting food crops. 3.3 Plants are migrating to higher latitudes and elevations because of cli- mate change and these shifts in geographic ranges present species with novel combinations of UV radiation and other environmental conditions. Establishment of certain plants at higher latitudes and elevations is occurring in response to climate change.102, 120, 207 These shifts in geographic ranges may alter the exposure of plants to UV -B radiation, since UV -B irradiances generally increase with increasing elevation and decrease with increasing lati- tude.34, 46, 68 In some cases, non -native, i.e., alien or introduced species, show higher migration potentials than native (ind igenous) species.102, 473 As the cli- mate changes, a suite of other environmental conditions (e.g., diurnal and seasonal temperature patterns, moisture and nutrient availability, and associ- ated pests, pathogens and competitors) co -occur with changes in exposure to UV radiation for migrating plants.207, 237 At present, it is uncertain how the ef- fects of these changes from exposure to UV radiation interact with unique combinations of effects of biotic and abiotic factors to inf luence performance Page 29 of 95 of species and migration patterns. Whether native and non -native plants differ in their tolerance to UV -B radiation and acclimation to the changes is unclear. Plants that are native to high elevation environments (i.e., alpine) often sh ow higher levels of UV -screening compounds (e.g., flavonoids) and other UV pro- tective mechanisms than plants occurring at lower elevations.148, 300, 420, 460, 494 These differences are likely the result of the com bined effects of changes in UV radiation with elevation, temperature , and other factors.10 For instance, low temperatures induce the production and accumulation of flavonoids, which increase screening from UV radiation and protect against oxida tive stress.234, 252, 464 Populations of plants from high- and low -elevations may also differ in acclimation to changes in UV radiation.459 In wild potatoes ( Solanum kurtzianum ), populations g rown at low elevation have relatively low constitu- tive (base -line) levels of leaf flavonoids but a high capacity for induction of fla- vonoids when UV radiation increases. In contrast, plants at high elevations have high base -line levels of flavonoids, but d o not necessarily increase their UV-screening in response to supplemental UV -B radiation.204 A study examining UV -screening in pl ants growing in a tropical alpine environ- ment with high UV radiation in Hawaii (Fig ure 3.2 B),39 found no differences in UV-screening between native and non -native species. In this study, produc- tion of UV -screening compounds increased with increasing elevation and UV - B radiation in a non -native species ( Verbascum thaps us (mullein)) but did not with elevation in the native Vaccinium reticulatum ('helo ). Whether these differences in acclimation of native and non -native species to changes in UV -B radiation are widespread is not yet known, although there are studies showing that non -native species acclimate better to environmental change than native species.108 This has consequences for diversity of plant species and composition of ecosystems. For plants expanding thei r distribution into higher latitudes, it is expected that they would experience less UV -B radiation that may then lead to a decline in UV-screening compounds, antioxidants and other metabolites involved in photo -protection.76 The cellular location of UV protective compounds in the same species can also show regional or latitudinal variation.464 A study of the same species of moss from Antarctica and Australia showed that the fast - growing temperate plants maintained high flavonoid concentrations within their cells, whereas the slow growing plants from Antarctica sequestered the same compounds in their cell walls. The latter may be a more beneficial loca- tion for the flavonoid compounds in plants experiencing frequent desiccation and freezing or it could be related to longevity of the leaf. Similar spatial varia- tion in the distribution of UV screening compounds withi n the leaves of plants Page 30 of 95 was observed between Arctic Vaccinium species with evergreen versus de- ciduous leaves.388 Ecosystems, and populations of plant species, including native species , have commonly responded over time to changing environmental conditions. How- ever, with the recent rapid rate of climate change, increasing tem peratures are of concern in terms of the conservation of species and habitats.341 Effects of temperature , may, in turn, be amplified by the often -associated increas ed exposure to UV radiation at high elevations. Thus, shifts in geographical ranges of plants to higher latitudes may result in decreased tolerance be- cause of reduced exposures to UV radiation, as well as posing risks of disrup- tion of species diversity and conservation of natural ecosystems and their ser- vices. 3.4 UV radiation and climate can have positive and negative effects on food quality and yield in agricultural systems. Extremes of temperature and low humidity may alter yields in some plants such as peas , while other changes, e.g., decreased plant growth and flowering, may be more influenced by UV ra- diation but without significant effects on pea pod production.374 Recent work confirms earlier findings that direct effects of UV radiation leading to modifica- tion of agricultural production occur through alterations in physiological and bi- ochemica l processes.13, 269 With regard to direct effects, the prevalence and degree of severity of pathogen an d pest attack on crops and other plants may be reduced by the biochemical reactions of the host plant, mediated through an increase in UV -induced polyphenolic compounds (see section 3.5).117, 421 The way in which food quality can be modified by UV radiation87, 364, 431, 455 has Figure 3.2 Plants growing in high elevation tropical alpine locatio ns, such as Mauna Kea, Hawaii ( A), experience some of the highest natural levels of solar UV radiation at the Earth's surface.47 These environments therefore provide excellent field sites for experi- ments designed to test the effects of extreme UV radiation conditions on plants ( B). Shown here is an experiment using plasti c film to reduce UV radiation to examine how these elevated levels of UV radiation influence plant growth and UV -screening. As plants migrate to higher elevations in response to climate change, they become exposed to higher levels of solar UV radiation as well as changes in several other abiotic and biotic factors . Understanding how plants will respond to UV radiation in the context of multiple environmental changes during migration is critical to assess how UV radiation and climate change will interact to modify the diversity and function of terrestrial ecosystem s.

Some of the potential health -promoting compounds that are enhanced by UV radiation and other environmental conditions include the polyphenolics, flavonoids and an- thocyanins.321, 478 These compounds, found in high amounts in certain fruits, vegetables and grains, have been suggested to afford protection against some diseases, e.g., coronary heart disease and type -2 diabetes, because of their free -radical scavenging capability ( i.e., antioxidant activity).125, 362, 439, 467 Response to UV radiation and other stressors is often cultivar - and genotype - dependent,67, 206, 270, 431, 464, 478 findings that can be effectively exploited for specific crop quality outcomes in stressful environments. Many of these re- sponses result in an increased accumulation of protective compounds such as the polyphenolics, which also are protective against plant pests. UV-B radiation can increase production of seed oil, while decreasing protein, certain carbohydrates an d fatty acids, depending on the amount of radiation. This was shown in a study on soybean seeds using r ealistic levels of biologi- cally effective UV -B radiation (5 -15 kJ m-2 day-1) in growth chambers with near ambient visible light.364 These changes have consequences for food quality. In addition, the effect of UV -B radiation may decrease the amounts of desirable monosaturated oleic acid and increase the less desirable polysatu- rated linoleic and linolenic acids with implications for cardiac disease in hu- mans. However, UV -B radiation also lowered the saturated palmitic fatty acid and stearic acid (the latter acid at higher levels of UV -B radiation ) in the soy- bean seeds.364 These changes in important nutritional attributes of food need to be understood from the perspective of a rapidly changing climate together with potential interactive effects of different levels of UV radiation on the crops. 3.5 Agricultural intensification has increased during this century, resulting in increased planting densities and reduced row spacing, which can nega tively affect quality and yield of crops by reducing plant exposure to the beneficial effects of solar UV radiation. Solar radiation, including the UV-B radiation component, is often a positive modulator of plant defenses against pathogens and pests. This beneficial role of solar radiation is some- times caused by increased activity of hormonal pathways responsible for the activation of plant immunity (reviewed in36). In other cases, resistance is con- ferred by secondary metabolites that the plant accumulates in response to UV radiation, for example, phenolic compounds.36, 130 117, 489 A common strategy to enhance biomass production and yield per unit area of many crops has been the implementation of management practices that in- crease light interception by the canopy, such as higher planting density, re- duced row spacin g, and fertilisation. These practices can reduce the exposure of individual plants to solar radiation and consequently its beneficial effects on defense responses, thereby making the crops more dependent on synthetic pesticides. Pests and diseases can acco unt for a significant fraction (up to 25%) of pre -harvest crop losses in modern agricultural systems, and chemical controls are becoming increasingly regulated due to their potential negative Page 32 of 95 environmental impacts. Manipulation of the molecular links betwe en photore- ceptors (see section 3.8) and plant defense responses, may help plant breed- ers to improve resistance to pests in agricultural and horticultural systems37, 130, 275, 287 3.6 Exposure to solar radiation, including UV radiation, can accelerate the decomposition of plant litter by photochemical mineralisation and by fa- cilitating the activity of microorganisms. The decomposition of dead plant material (i.e., litter) is a critical process controlling nutrient cycling and carbon storage in terrestrial eco systems. Photodegradation occurs when UV radiation and short wavelengths of visible sunlight degrade lignin and other photo -reac- tive constituents of litter (i.e., photochemical mineralisation) and these changes then facilitate subsequent microbial decompos ition. This latter aspect of photodegradation is often called 'photo -priming'.28, 40, 229 Under some condi- tions, UV radiation can also retard decomposition by inhibiting the growth and activity of decomposer microorganisms (bacteria and fungi).40 The balance of these multiple me chanisms is determined by litter quality and environmental conditions that affect microbial activity, and will likely shift as the climate changes. Photodegradation is thought to be particularly important in arid and semi -arid ecosystems (i.e., drylands) where low moisture availability constrains the ac- tivity of decomposing microbes. However, photodegradation varies with spe- cies depending on leaf structure and plant chemistry (leaf mass/area, lignin and ration of carbon:nitrogen, C:N). Previous studies hav e demonstrated that the rate of photodegradation is positively associated with lignin levels.27 While some experimental and modeling studies fail to detect this relationship,6, 259 this discrepancy likely reflects variation among species and litter type (e.g., leaf vs woody litter) in the distribution of lignin with depth in plant tissues that determines the fraction of the total lignin content exposed to UV radiation. In addition, the litter position (standing litter vs ground litter), stage of decompo- sition (i.e., early vs late stages) and level of mixing of soil with litter will influ- ence the degree of photodegradation189, 335, 457,458). Recent studies clarify how variation in environmental conditions and litter quality can mo dify the effects of UV radiation on photochemical mineralisa- tion, photo -priming and microbial activity. For example, a field study con- ducted at several hyper -arid (annual precipitation < 150 mm) locations in the Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert, northern China, showe d that solar UV radiation stimu- lated the decomposition of litter from all three plant species (grass and shrub) examined, and that the positive effect of UV radiation on decomposition in- creased with increasing precipitation in two of the three species.197 In compar- ison, a study conducted at two Mediterranean steppe locations (continental vs maritime climates; annual precip itation = 248 vs 362 mm, respectively) using grass and shrub litter, showed that UV radiation increased rates of decompo- sition in both species in the dry continental site but had no effect or a negative effect on decomposition at the high rainfall maritime site.12 Other studies164 further indicate that night -time moisture (humidity and dew) can influence the short -term, diel (daily) balance between day -time abiotic photodegradation and night -time microbial -driven decomposition in Mediterranean drylands. Page 33 of 95 These findings suggest that , in drylands the direct, abiotic effect of UV radia- tion on litter (i.e., photochemical mineralisation) dominates under the driest conditions, whereas the indirect, facilitative effect on microbial decomposition (photo -facilitation) tends to dominate under slightly moister conditions. How- ever, when moisture lev els and conditions are favourable to support elevated levels of microbial activity, UV radiation can have negative effects on decom- position, presumably because of direct inhibitory effects of the radiation on the decomposing microbes. Whereas much of the research to date has focused on photodegradation in drylands, some studies indicate that this process can also occur in moist (e.g., forested) ecosystems.28 In forested ecosystems, the importance of photodeg- radation has been linked to canopy cover, levels of sun light received by litter, and hence exposure to UV radiation.272 Shifts in vegetation type (e.g., grass- land to shrubland, or loss of woody plant cover due to tree/shrub dieback) re- sulting from changes in land -use and climate change have the potential to al- ter the importance of photodegradation. This is due to the way in which litter is then exposed to UV radiation, e.g., increased shade because of encroach- ment of woody plants into grasslands and changes in soil -litter mixing. Also, alterations in litter chemistry resulting from changes in plant species compo si- tion (e.g., high C:N grass litter to low C:N shrub/tree litter with the conversion of grasslands to desert shrublands) will affect the degree of photodegradation and microbial activity.26, 52, 190 These and other changes suggest that the role that UV radiation plays in regulating litter decomposition and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems will likely change in the future as the ozone layer recov- ers and the climate continues to change.11, 83 3.7 UV radiation and other environmental factors, including climate change, are implicated in the production of several greenhouse gases by plants and plant communities. Methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are present in much lower atmospheric concentrations than carbon dioxide (CO 2), but the global warming potentials of these gases are much greater than CO 2 (28-36- fold for CH 4 and 265-298-fold for N 2O over 100 years128, 207, 316). Plants emit N2O and a small amount of CH 4. Currently anthropogenic sources of CH 4 ex- ceed natural sources, while fo r N2O, natural sources are greater than anthro- pogenic.304 Aerobic production of CH 4 has been reported from a number of plant sources including leaf wax61, and the cell wall compounds, cellulose, lignin448 and pec- tin.225 However, aerobic emissions of CH 4 are small. For example, a modelling study estimates that just < 0.2% of total global CH 4 emissions come from pec- tin.45 A direct effect of UV -B radiation has been found on pectin. Other envi- ronmental factors such as water stress and warmer temperatures can modify UV-B-radiation -driven emissions of methane from certain plants in aerobic en- vironments .2, 3 A temperature of 28\u00b0C compared with 22\u00b0C, at ecologically (5 kJ m-2 day-1 biologically effective UV radiation) und er controlled conditions, resulted in higher emissions of CH 4 from leaves, stems and roots of pea plants, with the highest emission from the stems (65.08 \u00b1 4.12 ng (g dry mass) 1 h 1) and lowest for leaves (18.08 \u00b1 0.96 ng (g dry mass) 1 h 1).3 Emission -enhancing interactive effects were found Page 34 of 95 also for UV radiation and drought stress, and higher temperature and drought stress for different plant organs.3 Levels of emission s of CH 4 are broadly con- sistent with previous studies (see146), but with large variations due to plant type, plant orga n and environment al conditions. Plant leaves and soil bacteria can produce N 2O.60, 129 Field experiments with filtered and u nfiltered solar UV -B radiation showed that grasslands and their soil produced N 2O in the dark, while solar UV radiation increased the N 2O pro- duction.60 Precise data are difficult to obtain, since the N 2O source from plant leaves is often augmented from natural and anthropogenic sources ( e.g., from fertilisers) in addition to production by leaves. Calculations suggest that emis- sions of N 2O from leaves may be 30% higher than previous estimates.60 This is important because these radiation -driven emissions are estimated to com- prise between 7 and 24% of all natural productio n of N 2O.304 Another com- pounding factor for N 2O emissions, is the environmental feedbac k effect of in- creasing temperatures on the emissions from soil.64 Additional sources of N2O have also been reported from mosses and lichens,251, 353 estimated to contrib- ute up to 4-9% globally of the natural terrestrial N 2O emissions.353, 496 Changes in the composition of plant communities resulting from climate change and its interaction with UV radiation may also indirectly affect N 2O and CH 4 emissions at ecos ystem scales. However, while anaerobic emissions of CH 4 from peatlands and rice paddies are well researched,405 there have been few studies outside of wetlands.62, 118 A study in a Holm oak ( Quercus ilex ) forest in Italy estimated CH 4 emissions at the plant -community level based on parallel measurements of gas fluxes from the canopy and soil.380 This study found that the highest emissio ns (37.8 mol m-2 h-1) coincided with solar noon on days when irradiance was highest in summer, but over the whole year the budget was approximately balanced (i.e., no net emission), switching between a CH 4 source in summer and a sink in winter . Estimatin g the contribution to the global CH 4 budget by plants is complicated by many factors including large differences due to species and climate. Re- cent model calculations range between 1.2 to 24%.75, 265, 282 Calculations of N2O emissions from plants are also uncertain and vary in different studies de- pending on wh ether soil and plant contributions are quantified together or sep- arately. N2O and CH 4 are significant greenhouse gases and contribute to the dynamics of the stratospheric ozone layer. Thus, their sources and quantifica- tion are important in our understandin g of interactions between UV radiation fluxes and climate change. 3.8 Recent progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that mediate plant perception of UV radiation can greatly increase our ability to ma- nipulate responses to UV radiation in cultivated s pecies. The functional characterisation of UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8)88, 370, 477 represented a major step forward in UV photobiology, defining the first specific photore- ceptor for UV -B radiation. Studies in recent years have endeavoured to es- tablish the functional roles of the UVR8 protein photoreceptor in the control of plant acclimation to UV -B radiation. Page 35 of 95 The central components of the UVR8 photocycle have been elucidated214, 484 and the mechanism of action of UVR8 appears to be evolutionary conserved, from green algae to flowering plants.140, 408, 425 Many of the genes regulated by UVR8 are associated with protection against UV -B radiation and repair of damage by this radiation. Therefore, it is inferred that U VR8 plays a key role in protection against UV -B radiation. Recent studies have focused on the hormonal signaling pathways that link UVR8 to physiological and biochemical functions in UVR8 modulates hormonal pathways (auxin and gibberellins) and defense responses (jasmonic acid).184, 185, 288 Based on these advances, it has been postulated that UVR8 is important for regulating plant growth and immunity in plant canopies,288 which might have important implic ations for agriculture and crop breeding ( see sectio ns 3.4 and 3.5 ). Under solar radiation, the UVR8 protein occurs in equilibrium as a dimer or two-protein unit /monomer (dissociation into single protein units). This photo e- quilibrium is regulated by UV -B radiation and is also influenced by tempera- ture.141 Changes in the dimer/monomer ratio might be used by plants to \"measure\" UV -B radiation, although UVR8 -independent signaling pathways, e.g., pathways activated by damage to DNA, are likely to play important roles in the perception of UV -B radiation under field conditions.38 Evidence obtained using genetically engineered lines of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with null mutations in the UVR8 locus, is helping to explain the roles of UVR8 in nature. Evidence from a limited number of studies suggests that uvr8 knock - out mutants are somewhat more sensitive to natural levels of solar radiation than wild -type plants92, 312 and more sensitive to certain pathogens.113 How- ever, additional information from field studies, measuring fitness components and using a broad array of experimental conditions and plant species, is needed to establish the adaptive importance of UVR8 -mediated perception of UV-B radiation. Thus, more research is needed to link the mechanisms of ac- tion of the UV -B photor eceptor with plant function under field conditions.38, 214 3.9 Improvements in methods and analytical technique s are reducing the uncertainty associated with reconstructions of solar radiation based on pollen biochemistry that track changes in past UV radiation over geolog- ical timescales. Reconstructions of past solar radiation using pollen from sediments and ice c ores have the potential to help us better understand the evolution of the ozone layer and its interaction with climate change. Spores and pollen grains are coated with a biological polymer, sporopollenin, which is highly resistant to degradation over geolo gical timescales and contains the phenolic compounds, para-coumaric acid and ferulic acid. The concentrations of these UV -absorbing compounds are considered to be proportional to the in- cident solar UV -B radiation flux received by the pollen.147, 212, 375 However, dose -response curves for the accumulation of t hese compounds are yet to be established, and we lack knowledge of the timing of this process during the production and release of pollen.51, 387 Until the mechanism of this response is elucidated, and its relationship to incident UV -B and solar radiation estab- lished, the utility of this proxy for inferring historical changes in stratospheric Page 36 of 95 ozone remains limite d.424 Seasonal environmental variability related to weather patterns and shade from plant canopies also affect incident solar UV - B radiation in ways that are difficult to retrospectively infer, making some re- constructions from proxies difficult to interpret. These potentially confounding factors may explain why changes in solar activity or ozone -depletion -related trends of UV -absorbing compounds in spores and pollen have not always been detected in the past.294 Methodological advances allow ing faster and more precise processing of pollen samples are improving reconstructions.33, 387 For instance, a reconstruction of incident solar radiation at Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana over a 140 thousand -year period, based on the phenolics from grass pollen containe d in sediments, tracked known variations in the Earth's orbit.213 One potential strength of this proxy is that it can be interpreted inde- pendently of paleoecological and paleoclimatological records, in principle al- lowing solar radiation to be decoupled from climate or biotic changes. 3.10 Rapid advances in light -emitting diode technology is enabling more pre- cise replication of the solar spectrum in controlled growth environ- ments . The increasing availability of cost -effective light-emitting diode s (LEDs ) is providing new opportunities to customise the light environment of plants grown commercially in greenhouses and controlled environments. The inclusion of UV-B and UV -A radiation in artificial lighting systems is now being consi dered as a means to improve food plant quality, crop vigour and plant defense.463 While high -power UV -A LEDs are currently available, so far UV-B LEDs have generally not proven useful in lighting systems because of their short life span and limited radiant output. However, new generation UV -B LEDs, including some with outputs over very narrow wavebands, exhibit greater stability and radiant po wer outputs.232, 363 3.11 Continuing refinement of protocols for the use of field -portable ar- ray spectrometers all ows for better measurements of solar UV ra- diation in dynamic light environments with applications in plant science. Improved knowledge of the capacities and limitations of light - weight, field -portable array spectrometers has facilitated their wider use for re- cording dynamic variability in the light environment. These measurements may have wide utility but are particularly useful for measurements under clouds and plant canopies, and in artificial environments for plant growth, situ- ations where the proportio n of UV -B radiation to visible may be very different from that under clear skies. Those models of array spectrometer intended for measurement in both the visible and UV regions can capture this part of the solar spectrum with acceptable resolution for ecol ogical studies provided that certain criteria are fulfilled.21, 23 To obtain reliable measurements, these de- vices must be individually calibrated and specific protocols followed that mini- mise noise of the UV signal caused by stray visible light and limited dynamic range of the instruments.22, 24 These spectrometers are particularly useful for validation of modelled radiative transfer through the canopy layers of forests and crop fields, although measurements in the early morning and evening when the sun is low in the sky should be avoided. Parallel applications for Page 37 of 95 plant production are also envisaged whereby appropriate UV filters and UV - LEDs can be recommended for specific scientific purposes. 3.12 The availability of s mall, lightweight, cost -effective UV -B dosime- ters that can be placed on leav es may improve spatial resolution for measuring the UV radiation received by the leaves of plants in situ. These sensors will give researchers the opportunity to study the effects of fluctuating UV -B irradiances caused by variability in the micro -environme nt. For example, differences in plant architecture could result from changing an- gle-to-the-sun and canopy heterogeneity. Locating sensors on leaves would provide greater certainty in the estimation of doses as well as better charac- terisation of the enviro nment through measurements at multiple locations. Two major handicaps to the adoption of dosimeters have been: (1) that they work for too short a time to be useful for ecological studies, and (2) they are insufficiently accurate to be reliable. Now, improv ed dosimeters are being de- veloped with respect to their longevity453 and wavelength dependence,15 for use with plants as well as for materials and humans. One such new UV -B do- simeter, made from unstabilised manufactured using 8 -methoxypsoralen.453 This pre- sents an opportunity to compare in tandem UV -B and UV -A radiation doses received by leaves at different angles and exposures within a canopy. S uch systems of multiple integrated dosimeters with sensitivity in different regions of the UV radiation regime have already been designed for use as 'wearable tech' on human skin (e.g. , see25). 4 Effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate change on aquatic ecosystems Craig Williamson, Patrick Neale, Samuel Hylander, Kevin Rose, Sten-\u00c5ke W\u00e4ngberg, Donat -P. H\u00e4der, Robert Worrest Climate change is more important than stratospheric ozone depletion in regu- lating exposure of aquatic organisms to UV -B and UV -A radiation with im- portant consequ ences for ecosystem services provided by inland and marine ecosystems. Here we highlight new insights into the effects of changes in ex- posure to solar UV -B and UV -A radiation related to ozone depletion and cli- mate change on aquatic ecosystems, including t he ability of organisms to adapt to these changes. While global changes in exposure to UV -B radiation are largely related to the depletion and more recent recovery from strato- spheric ozone depletion in some regions ( see s ection 1), in aquatic ecosys- tems a variety of other factors including climate change are more important in controlling exposure of underwater organisms to UV -B and UV -A radiation. Some of these include changes in the concentrations of dissolved and particu- late matter in aquatic ecosystems, the proximity and extent of runoff from ter- restrial ecosystems, and the depth and mixing processes in inland, coastal, and open -ocean waters, all of which can compromise critical aquatic ecosys- tem services. Most aquatic organisms that have been tested show susceptibil- ity to damage by solar UV radiation. However, solar UV radiation can also dis- infect surface waters of pathogens, an ecosystem service that is being com- Page 38 of 95 promised by reduced UV transparency of some inland and coastal marine wa- ters. Commercially pr oduced UV -protective compounds that are used exten- sively as skin sunscreens, and in clothing and other industrial products, threaten the survival of corals and other aquatic organisms. Legislation to ban certain commercially -produced sunscreens is being co nsidered in many places. 4.1 Climate change -induced increases in water temperature and associated in- creases in stratification generally intensify the negative effects of UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems. The adverse effects can, however, be reduced or am- plified by the interactive effects of temperature, acidification, and nutrients. In- creasing water temperatures associated with climate change shorten the du- ration of seasonal ice cover and lengthen seasonal exposure of aquatic eco- systems to UV radiation.94 It has been widely assumed that warming of the surface also results in shallower mixing41 potentially exposing organisms, es- pecially free -floating ones (plankton), to higher UV radiation. However, obser- vational evidence for this is lacking and recent a nalyses conclude that depth of mixing is equally (or more) affected by changes in wind strength and the in- teraction of currents239, 406 (see also sections 4.7 and 5.7, Figure 4.1). The poleward shift of many ocean currents is increasing the temperature for some bottom -dwelling (benthic) organisms in environments such as those as- sociated with coral reefs.139, 308 Warmer temperatures and UV radiation inter- act to increase oxygen consumption and reduce rates of g rowth in some or- ganisms such as intertidal fish154 and reduce the ability of corals to form cal- cium carbonate skeletons (through the process of calcification) that make up the structure of coral reefs. Acidification of the oceans impairs calcification in phytoplankton, reducing the thickness, and thus the UV protective effect, of the organism's outer shell (exoskeleton).309 Other effects of acidification may increase the sensitivity of larger attached algae (macroalgae),97 and certain animals to solar UV radiation. However, exposure to high levels of natural so- lar radiation stimulates calcification and thus increase s protection against UV radiation in one species of phytoplankton investigated so far, offsetting the ad- verse impacts of acidification.215 Overall, interactions between increases in temperature and acidification of oceans with UV radiation can inhibit the growth, survival, or reproduction of some species, but benefit others, which has the potential to chan ge the species composition of communities such as has been observed for macroalgae in the Arctic.170, 177 In aquatic ecosystems, global change is also affecting nutrient availability, which is decreasing in some parts of the ocean due to warming -intensified stratification.106, 107 However, nutrients are increasing in many lakes and coastal oceans due to transfer of particulate and dissolved organic matter and Page 39 of 95 agricultural and other nutrients from terrestrial ecosys tems ( Figure 4.1), which can solar UV radiation affects aquatic ecosystems and interacts with other stressors. For example, a series of laboratory experiments found that, when concentrations of nutrients were low and solar radiation was high, increased CO 2 did not enhance, and UV radiation inhibited, growth of a common oce- anic phytoplankton species, the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii .255 However, when concentrations of nutrients were high, increased CO 2 enhanced growth and sensitivity to UV -radiation was reduced, most likely due to more efficient CO 2 utilization and enhanced repair .255 Laboratory experiment s using artificial UV radiation and 400 nm cutoff filters and a freshwater zooplankton found that, at warmer temperatures, exposure to UV radiation lowered levels of a critical enzyme that takes up phosphorus into the body, thus limiting a nutrient necessa ry for zooplankton growth and reproduction.475 As a result of these ef- fects on the lower levels of aquatic food webs, UV radiation and climate Figure 4.1. Diagram to illustrate the processes by which various human activities affect exposure to UV radiation and other related aspects of the structure and function of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Anthropogenic d rivers are leading to a suite of global changes, which in turn alter aquatic ecosystems and their primary producers, consumers, and higher -level predators. While marine systems are generally becoming more acidic due to anthropogenic CO 2 production, freshwa ter systems, on the other hand, are making extensive recoveries from previous anthropogenic acid deposition (acid rain) related to clean air act legislation in North America and Europe initiated in the early 1990s. However, this recovery from acidification is combining with increased precipitation to increase the concentrations of dissolved organic matter in some inland and coastal waters. Increased dissolved organic matter reduces the transparency of water to UV radiation (section 4.2), which , in turn , increases the survival of parasites and pathogens of humans and wildlife.470 Page 40 of 95 warming might interact to limit availability of food and reduce the abundance of recreationally and commercially important fish species. 4.2 A recent meta -analysis extends our previous knowled ge of the adverse effects of UV -B radiation on aquatic organisms across trophic levels ranging from phytoplankton and zooplankton to amphibians and fish. Information on the relative tolerance to UV radiation of organisms at different trophic levels is ess ential if we are to understand the effects of solar UV radia- tion on aquatic ecosystems. Differential tolerance to UV radiation of primary producers, consumers, and top -predators has the potential to fundamentally alter trophic interactions and correspondin g nutrient and energy flow as well as the community structure of aquatic ecosystems. A meta -analysis of UV -studies in more than 100 species of freshwater phyto- plankton, zooplankton, fish and amphibians assessed the effects of UV -B ra- diation on survival, reproduction, development, growth, behaviour, metabo- lism, and molecular -cellular characteristics.342 Overall, UV -B radiation had ad- verse effects from the cellular to the population level on all organism groups. UV-B radiation affected survival and r eproduction more than growth and de- velopment.342 No statistically significant differences in tolerance to UV -B radi- ation were observed among the major groups. However, for some characteris- tics, such as growth and survival, adverse effects of UV -B radiation on pri- mary producers were greater than on consumers, such as zooplankton and fish.342 Other laboratory studies have shown that prior exposure of fish to UV - B radiation may confer benefits to offspring that reduce the adverse impacts of the radiation, but also increase the susceptibility of the offspring to infective diseases .223 These freshwater studies included in the meta -analysis are consistent with the results of an earlier meta -analys is on marine organisms.266 Collectively these studies suggest no consistent differences in the effects of UV -B radiation on higher vs lower trophic levels in freshwater or marine ecosystems. However, these analyses were mostly based on laboratory exposures rather than field studies and they did not consider spectral composition of the artificial UV radi- ation. Accounting for differences in the wavelength composition of artificial vs natural solar UV radiation and the much stronger damaging effects of shorter wavelengths of UV rad iation is essential to accurately assess the effects of UV radiation in nature. As assessments were for individual species, the meta - analysis did not examine community -level processes such as competition, predation, and succession. The lack of use of spect ral data and the fact that laboratory studies, on average, report larger effects from UV -B radiation than field studies, emphasises the need for more realistic field studies to fully as- sess the overall effects of solar UV -B radiation on organisms at multip le trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems. 4.3 Increased input of coloured dissolved organic matter into aquatic sys- tems reduces exposure to UV radiation and thus DNA -damage. Increased terrestrial input of coloured (chromophoric) dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into aquatic systems is a widespread phenomenon in many temperate, boreal and subarctic lakes, and is also projected to increase in Arctic permafrost ar- eas as a result of climate change110, 401, 418 (see section 5.1). CDOM absorbs Page 41 of 95 UV radiation, protecting organisms from direct damage to DNA and other t ar- gets of UV -B radiation.440, 471 However, CDOM acts as a photosensitiser (S in reaction 1, Figure 4.2) absorbing UV radiation (mainly UV -A) with the genera- tion of various types of chemically reactive molecules (reactive oxygen spe- cies (ROS)). These ROS damage DNA and other cellular structures (C in re- action 2, Figure 4.2). This has been demonstrated i n recent laboratory studies on the effects of increased concentrations of CDOM where UV -induced pro- duction of ROS led to DNA damage (strand breaks), partially offsetting the benefit of UV -absorption provided to zooplankton.474, 475 In contrast, field ob- servations show that levels of DNA damage (strand breaks) in the larvae of an aquatic insect were 50 -fold lower in aquatic ecosystems with higher CDOM concentrations.260 This suggests that overall, CDOM absorption of UV radia- tion reduces DNA damage more than indirect chemical reactions increase the damage . However, all types of potential damage by UV radiation, not just DNA strand breaks, need to be considered to make any firm conclusions. Ad- ditional field observations and modeling research are required to improve our understanding of the balance b etween the protective vs damaging effects of CDOM in natural systems and hence the net effect of UV radiation on the growth, reproduction, and survival of aquatic organisms. 4.4 New models of vertical mixing have improved estimates of the inhibition of photo synthesis by UV radiation in Antarctic phytoplankton. These new models highlight the importance of properly representing vertical mixing in assessing effects of UV radiation in surface waters. Vertical mixing is an im- portant process regulating exposure to UV radiation and responses of organ- isms in surface waters, and needs careful consideration especially for time - scales of tens of minutes to hours. This is illustrated in the time -dependent in- hibition by UV radiation of photosynthesis in Antarctic phytopla nkton.399 In this Figure 4.2. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide an important pathway for UV radia- tion to indirectly damage biological systems. Examples of ROS are singlet oxygen, hy- droxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide (listed near the bot- tom of Figure 4.2 , respectively). Their induction by UV radiation occurs when a photosen- sitiser (S in reaction 1), absorbs UV radiation. Some of this absorbed energy puts the molecules into excited states ( S* in diagram), lea ding to reactions with oxygen molecules to produce ROS . These ROS can then oxidise molecules in the environment or in cells in living organisms ( C in reaction 2), hence damaging living cells and tissues and creating oxidised products. Page 42 of 95 context, Smyth et a l.398 modeled mixing and inhibition of photosynthesis by UV radiation in the Ross Sea Polyn ya, Antarctica. The focus of the study was vertical transport by Langmuir Circul ation, a form of deep mixing created by the interaction of wind and waves in most open ocean (and lake) surface wa- ters. The mixing effect resulted from photosynthesis being inhibited as simu- lated cells received exposure to UV radiation near the surface, as well as al- lowing for recovery from effects of UV radiation when transported to greater depth where they were exposed to moderate visible irradiance and no inhibi- tory UV radiation. Other, older approaches to modeling the mixing also resulted in reduced es ti- mates of inhibition (relative to no mixing) . However, the results differed from the more realistic Large Eddy Simulation by as much as 50% (range of mod- eled inhibition 4 -13%). Thus, selection of the appropriate mixing model is an important consideration when estimating inhibition by UV radiation in Antarctic waters. The representation of mixing in surface waters will also be important in assessing the impact of other effects of UV radiation that vary at the critical time scale of minutes to hours, but mi xing effects are less important in re- sponses to UV radiation for processes happening over shorter or longer time periods. 4.5 The interaction of multiple types of environmental change because of human activities creates regional -specific changes in surface mix ed layer depth and thus variable exposure to UV radiation of the ecosystem in the Southern Ocean. Climate change and ozone depletion are modifying prevailing wind patterns, freshwater inputs, and climate warming in oceans (see also sections 1.3 , 3.1, and 4 .1), with particularly strong effects in the Southern Ocean. These climate factors are expected to combine in regional - specific ways to affect the depth to which surface waters mix (see section 4.4). Shallower mixing enhances average exposure to UV radiat ion, while deeper mixing lowers the exposure but also lowers the light needed for photo- synthesis (Fig ure 4.1), which in the polar ocean can reach such a low level that phytoplankton populations are no longer sustained. In the warmest region of the Southern Ocean (to the north, in the Sub -Antarctic Zone) mixed layers are generally expected to become shallower due to warming and increased precipitation. Similarly, in the coldest region near the continent in the south, there will be shallower mixed layers due to warming and increased ice melt. In other regions, mixed layers are expected to deepen due to the increases in wind speed associated with poleward shifts of wind. These changes affect the southern part of the Sub -Antarctic Zone the most. The mechanism o f the wind shift, related to ozone depletion, is discussed in section 1.3. The shifting wind patterns also have regional -specific effects within each zone. For example, there is an increase in flow of warmer air over the Antarctic Peninsula , which is warmi ng much more rapidly than other regions, while stronger winds are deepening the mixed layer in the eastern Indian Oc ean and central Pacific Ocean. These changes in mixing of the ocean suggest that interactions between cli- mate change and ozone depletion wi ll create a mosaic of changing exposures to solar radiation that will vary throughout the Southern Ocean. The eventual Page 43 of 95 recovery of stratospheric ozone may alter these trends. Changes in exposure as well as other concomitant environmental changes such as in creased tem- perature, nutrient availability, and acidification all need to be considered in the selection of experimental conditions to assess organism and community re- sponse to Antarctic climate change, and thus the influence on ecosystem ser- vices provided by the world's oceans (see also section 4.1). 4.6 The ability of aquatic organisms to detect variations in exposure levels and behaviourally avoid solar UV radiation play s a key role in food chain interactions. The ability to perceive and respond behaviourall y to UV radia- tion can markedly influence aquatic food webs. Zooplankton and fish that re- spond behaviourally to UV radiation have photoreceptors in the UV -A wave- lengths. Since UV -A radiation penetrates deeper into waters than the shorter UV-B wavelengths, U V-A receptors in zooplankton provide environmental cues while simultaneously enabling avoidance of the water surface and ex- cess exposure to damaging UV -B radiation. Behavio ural responses to UV -A radiation can , in turn , influence the vertical distribution a nd thus foraging suc- cess of fish on zooplankton or other prey. Recent laboratory studies with mu- tant zebrafish that have far fewer UV -A-sensitive cones than normal zebrafish were used to investigate the importance of UV -A radiation in foraging.143 Non- mutant fish that sensed and respo nded to UV -A radiation exhibited a 24 -90% greater foraging performance compared to the mutant fish. These results sug- gest that fish derive a considerable benefit from sensing and responding to UV-A radiation. However, in other laboratory experiments on co ral reef fish, in which artificial UV radiation was manipulated by excluding wavelengths < 400 nm,445 the presence of UV radiation reduced feeding rates and elevated respiration rates. The contrasting results of these two experiments may be due to different experimental approaches or may point to the effects of UV ra- diation on foraging of fish being species - or habitat -specific. Recent laboratory experiments have tested the behavioural response of zoo- plankton to artificial sources of UV radiation. Short -term (seconds) responses to UV -A radiation (from an LED source with a 375 nm peak), showed that some zooplankton with less pigmentation exhibited stronger avoidance of UV - A radiation than other species with more pigmentation.179 The short -term na- ture of these UV avoidance responses indicates that vertical distr ibution of zo- oplankton in lakes will be shallower with increases in sun angle, column ozone, cloud cover, or other factors that decrease UV irradiance or depth of penetration, such as presence of coloured dissolved organic matter or smoke from wildfires.443, 471 This shallower distribution of zooplankton might increase their availability as food for fish and have important implications for the provi- sion of valuable aquatic ecosystem services ranging from recreational and commercial fisheries to the role of zooplankton in helping clean the water through their feeding on algae and bacteria, including potential pathogens. Page 44 of 95 4.7 Commercial organic and nanoparticle UV -protective compounds fre- quently enter aquatic ecosystems and may pose substantial risks to aquatic organisms . Commercial UV -protective compounds are used exten- sively in sunscreens, plastics, adhesives, and industrial goods (e.g., clothing and construction materials) to protect against damage by UV radiation and adverse health effects (see sections 2 and 7). Some commercial organic and nanoparticle UV -protective compounds (e.g., oxybenzone and TiO 2) reduce growth rates in phytoplankton,151, 390 and cause developmental impairment in corals96, 122, 432 and sea urchins,96, 122, 432 as well as fish.144 These UV -protec- tive compounds also affect the endocrine system and reduce feeding and en- ergy reserves of invertebrates.69, 333 A primary mode of toxicity for both or- ganic and, to a lesser extent, nanoparticle UV -protective compounds, is via production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, Figure 4.1 ).390 Production of H 2O2 is greatly enhanced when these UV -protective compounds are exposed to solar UV radiation.390 Concentrations of commercial UV -protective compounds can be over four-fold higher in wild fish compared with farmed fish, with the high- est concentrations observed in fish near sewage outflows.187 Some commer- cial UV -absorbing compounds accumulate in organisms such as corals432 and might biomagnify in food webs.343, 432 Because species have di fferential sensi- tivities to these commercial UV -absorbing compounds, these compounds may shift the relative composition of species in aquatic ecosystems.390 However, Cyperus alternifolius , a common wetland plant species, has the ability to me- tabolise oxybenzone, which suggests the possibility of remediation of waters contaminated by this compound.82 Because of possible environmen tal impacts, t he European Chemicals Agency has identified eight out of 16 of the most commonly used commercial UV -ab- sorbing compounds in Europe as needing to be thoroughly evaluated over the next several years with consideration of possible future restrict ions.131 The commercial development of natural alternatives to existing UV -absorbing compounds, such as mycosporine -like amino acids, may address the Euro- pean Chemicals Agency concerns. Mycosporine -like amino acids have the advantage of being antioxidants as well as being effective at reducing direct damage from UV radiation.247 5 Interactive effects of solar ultraviolet radiation and cli- mate change on biogeoc hemical cycles Amy Austin, Barbara Sulzberger, Richard Zepp, Nigel Paul , and Rose Cor y Biogeochemical cycles involve the transport and transformation of materials within and between environmental compartments (i.e., land, water, atmos- phere, and cryosphere ). These cycles govern changes in the concentration and chemical form of nutrients and contaminants that affect organisms and ecosystems. For example, carbon and nitrogen cycles involve the transfer of energy between compartments as organic forms of these elements are con- sumed and transformed by biota. UV and visible solar radiation have substan- tial effects on biogeochemical cycles, which are also affected by changes in climate, land use, and air and water pollution. As a result, an understanding of biogeoc hemical cycles is essential for assessing the interactions between the Page 45 of 95 effects of different components of global change, including changes in climate and stratospheric ozone. The following sections assess new findings regard- ing the cycling of carbon ( sections 5.1 - 5.5), nitrogen ( section 5.6), and or- ganic contaminants ( section 5.7). 5.1 Warming of the Arctic and Antarctic is increasing ice -free habitats and thus exposure of organic matter to solar UV radiation . In the Arctic, hu- man-caused warming leads to the loss of sea ice,262, 391 reduction of ice and snow cover on land and in freshwaters, and thawing of permafrost soils.385 In- creased exposure of organic matter to solar UV radiation in freshwaters,100, 396 and in coastal and open ocean waters, leads to gr eater photochemical con- version of organic matter to greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide ; CO 2),411, 444, 461 nutrients (e.g., ammonium and nitrate), and altered organic matter. Or- ganic matter that has been photochemically modified by UV radiation often supports more microbial respiration of CO 2 in both terrestrial and aquatic eco- systems compared to organic matter that has not been altered by UV radia- tion.98, 415, 462 Specifically, Arctic sea ice is shrinking and thinning at a rate of 10% loss of area of sea ice per decade, with over 60% of total volume of ice lost in the last 30 years.262, 391 The Arctic Ocean is predicted to be ice -free during the s um- mer by the end of the century. Loss and thinning of sea -ice allows more UV radiation to reach the water surface, where terrestrially -derived organic matter is the main UV and light -absorbing constituent.98, 191 Loss of sea ice cover in- creases exposure of terrestrially -derived organic matter to UV radiation in the Arctic Ocean and thus increases photochemical conversion of this organic matter to CO 2. Uncertai nties in these estimates include changes in cloud cover under ice -free scenarios. Snowmelt on land and ice -off on lakes are occurring earlier in the spring,100, 396 resulting in greater number of days in which UV radiation can reach land and freshwaters (on avera ge by ca one day per year from 2000 -2013). This earlier ice -off over freshwaters coincides with the period when the angle of the sun is the highest and thus, the UV radiation reaching the surface is most in- tense. This also coincides with the period when co ncentrations of terrestrially - derived organic matter, the main UV radiation -absorbing constituent,98 are at their highest. Thus, earlier ice -off on lakes in the spring and early summer in the Arctic can substantially increase photochemical conversion of this organic matter to CO 2 in freshwaters.98 Increased greenhouse gas emissions from freshwaters are important because , at present, processing of carbon in fresh- waters accounts for 40% of the net exchange of carbon between land and the atmosphere in the Arctic.291 There are at least 1500 billion tons of organic carbon (i.e., organic matter) in permafrost soils, almost twice as much carbon as currently exists in the at- mosphere. Warming in the Arctic is causing permafrost soils t o thaw, result- ing in export of ancient organic matter to freshwaters and to the coastal ocean,409 where it is exposed to UV radiation.98 Based on current rates of warming in the Arctic, an estimated 130 -160 billion tons of permafrost carbon Page 46 of 95 could be available for conversion to CO 2 during this century.385 Currently, pho- tochemical degradation of organic matter may account for ca 30% of the CO 2 emitted from Arctic waters,98 and this estimate will likely increase as perma- frost carb on comprises more and more of the organic matter exported from soils to sunlit surface waters of the Arctic.98, 411, 461 A substantial portion of this photochemical degradation of organic matter may be carried out by photo- chemical -induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS , see section 4.3 and Figure 4.2).452 Like the Arctic, West Antarctica and the Antarctic peninsula are also warming, with West Antarctica one of the most rapidly warming locations on Earth.54 A recent p rojection concluded that warming may cause a 25% increase in total ice-free area on the Antarctic continent by the end of the century.249 Much of the increase in ice -free area is projected to be on the Antarctic Peninsula where reduction in ice cover will likely increase exposure to UV radiation of the underlying land surface (Fig ure 5.1). The potential consequences to plants and animals rem ain highly uncertain.169 Loss of continental ice in Antarctica may shift the location of photochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from surface of glaciers and ice sheets20 to the coastal ocean.

Understanding the role of UV and visible solar radiation affecting carbon cycling in dryland ecosystems is important given that these ecosystems play a significant role as a control on the interannual variability in the global carbon balance.7 Direct effects of pho- todegradation (photochemical degradation of dead plant organic matter [plant litter] from exposure to solar radiation) have been linked to increased biotic turnover of organic compounds in plant litter in terrestrial ecosystems28, 35, 158 (see section 3.6). Direct photodegradation and photochemical changes in quality of litter (photo -facilitation), which increase biological degradation sug- gests that photodegradation can result in increases in emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere, particularly in semi -arid ecosystems .6 The implications of these recent studies suggest that photodegradation may have a larger impact on terrestrial carbon cycling than was previously thought. However, interac- tions with climate change, pa rticularly changes in availability of water resulting from increased drought or increased rainfall may also determine the net effect of photodegradation on emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere. Direct photodeg- radation tends to increase under conditions of dr ought or extreme aridity.11, 12, 198 By comparison, photo -facilitation of biotic decomposition is enhanced un- der high moisture conditions, particularly at night.165, 457 Given this important interplay between exposure to solar radiation and availability of water affect- ing decomposition of aboveground plant litter, future changes in UV radiation from stratospheric ozone recovery, and climate or land -use change could have i mportant consequences for carbon cycling in dryland terrestrial ecosys- tems. Future studies are needed to identify under which conditions these vari- ables may have antagonistic or synergistic effects on rates of decay of plant litter. 5.3 The interactions betwee n solar UV radiation and thermal stratification of lakes and oceans may reduce biological sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The biological carbon pump involves uptake of CO 2 in photo- synthesis by phytoplankton (primary production) and export of d ead particu- late organic matter to the sediment of lakes and oceans. Rates of primary pro- duction depend on various factors including the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the mixed layer, and the abundance and availability of macro - and micro -nutrients, particularly dissolved inorganic nitrogen and iron.112, 373 One factor that may result in limitation of nutrients is reduced upwelling of nutrients due to greater thermal stratification of lakes and oceans.149 This effect of thermal stratificati on could reduce carbon export from the surface ocean by 7 -18% (range of scenarios from Earth system mod- els).149 Furthermore, in some water bodies, stratification causes a decrease in the mixed layer depth (MLD), which, coupled with sunlight -induced decreases in UV -protective coloured dissolved organic matter, increases exposure of phytoplankton to solar UV radiation. However, surface warming of aquatic ecosystems due to climate change does not always increase stratification and result in shallower MLD.367, 406 The MLD also depends on factors other than surface warming, particularly on wind speeds, with MLD increasi ng with stronger wind speeds. The strongest effect of thermal stratification of water bodies due to climate change is expected to be on limitation of nutrients. Re- gionally specific changes in MLD and hence in exposure to solar UV radiation Page 48 of 95 may in addition influence uptake and fixation of CO 2 by phytoplankton (see also sections 4.1 and 4.5) . 5.4 The balance between primary production and respiration in aquatic eco- systems may shift towards more respiration because of the interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change . This shift toward in- creased respiration would result in a decrease in the extent to which aquatic ecosystems are a sink for CO 2. The balance between primary production by phytoplankton (autotrophs, i.e., producers) and respiration by ba cterioplank- ton (mostly heterotrophs, i.e., consumers) is important in determining the sink strength of CO 2 of aquatic ecosystems. In primary production, CO 2 is taken up and oxygen (O 2) is released, whereas in respiration, O 2 is consumed and CO 2 is released . A measure for the balance between primary production and respi- ration is net community production (NCP). Annually integrated rates of NCP vary from 0.5 to 1 5 mol s (8 to 120 g) of O2 m-2 yr-1 in the sunlit zone of the global ocean.253 Hence, the global ocean is presently net autotrophic on aver- age, i.e., the rate of primary production exceeds that of respiration. Th e com- bined effects of solar UV radiation and climate change could, however, shift some aquatic ecosystems towards net heterotrophy (non -producers) given that respiration increases with increasing temperature of aquatic ecosystems and with increasing concen trations of freshwater, coastal, and onments, an important source of DOM is terrestri- ally-derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM). The breakdown of tDOM to CO 2 by bacterioplankton is slow. However, tDOM undergoes UV -induced transfor- mations yielding labile organic carbon compounds that can the n be metabo- lised to CO 2 more efficiently by bacterioplankton.418, 462 In addition, tDOM can also undergo direct photo -oxidation with release of CO 2.461 Enhanced runoff of tDOM is expected because of thawing of permafrost ,450 (also see Section 5.1) and an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, both associ- ated with human -caused climate change65, 332 (see also Fig ure 4.1). Enhanced runoff of tDOM also increases the supply of nutrients to phyto- plankton (see Fig ure 4.1), wh ich, in turn, would enhance fixation of CO 2.231 The availability of nutrients to phytoplankton, particularly of the micronutrien t, iron, is affected by solar UV radiation and by the interactions of solar UV radi- ation with other global changes such as acidification of aquatic ecosys- tems.201, 392, 417 Hence, the overall effect of solar UV radiation and global changes on the balance between primary production and respiration is an on- going question but could shift towards net heterotrophy as a result of the com- bined effects of UV -induced formation of bioavailable carbon compounds from tDOM, and warming of aquatic ecosystems. 5.5 Thawing of permafrost is an important source of methane to the atm os- phere where UV -induced reactions play a key role in controlling atmos- pheric concentrations of methane . Methane (CH 4), a major greenhouse gas, caus es about one -half of the warming (in terms of radiative forcing) of CO 2. In addition to emissions of CH 4 from human activities, particularly from agriculture, thawing of permafrost is an important source of CH 4 to the atmos- phere.449 The rate of emission of CH 4 was found to be directly proportional to the rate of erosion of permafrost soil into lakes across the Arctic impacted by Page 49 of 95 thermokarst failures (destabilised landscapes resulting from loss of perma- frost).449 Hence, the emissions of CH 4 from thawing permafrost soils can fuel a positive feedback pro cess that further reinforces global warming and thaw- ing of permafrost. In addition, wildfires are important causes of loss of perma- frost in the northern boreal forest.58 The extent of loss of permafrost was shown to depend on the thickness of the insulating surface organic layer after a fire.58 Another important source of methane is direct production of methane as well as of carbon monoxide (CO) in wildfires.227 Carbon monoxide affects concentrations of CH 4 in the atmosphere by scavenging the hydroxyl radical (OH) (see Section 6 .4). The occurrence of wildfires is increasing as a conse- quence of long -lasting droughts caused by climate change in some terrestrial ecosystems.332, 471 A decline in concentrations of atmospheric OH, due to various factors including stratospheric ozone recovery,86 and increased emis- sions of CO could potentially result in slower destruction of CH 4 and thus am- plify the positive feedback of CH 4 to warm ing. 5.6 Photochemical transformations of organic nitrogen in aquatic and ter- restrial ecosystems may be altered by changes in solar UV radiation from ozone recovery, climate, or land -use change . When exposed to UV and visible solar radiation, organic nitrogen -containing compounds in aquatic ecosystems can be a source of ammonia and other forms of biologically -avail- able nitrogen.89, 310, 340, 400 In terrestrial ecosystems, modeling83 and empirical studies197, 456 suggest that plant litter on the soil surface that is exposed to so- lar UV radiation may have increased microbial tran sformations (see also sec- tion 3.6) and leaching of nitrogen. Although the mechanisms responsible for transformation of nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are poorly un- derstood, it is likely that they involve coupled photochemical and microbiolo gi- cally-mediated transformation of nitrogenous organic compounds. Global changes that reduce the amount of UV radiation could decrease production of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, other alter- ations from global changes, s uch as land -use or increased runoff of organic nitrogen from soils to aquatic ecosystems due to earlier snowmelt,226 may have the inverse effect, resulting in increased photo -production of inorganic nitrogen that consequently would be available for b iotic uptake (see section 5.3). 5.7 Human -induced changes in stratospheric ozone and runoff of UV -ab- sorbing substances from land continue to alter photoreactions of con- taminants that enter the environment . A wide range of commercially pro- duced chemicals (e.g., contaminants) are intentionally or accidentally re- leased into the environment by human activities. Solar radiation contributes to the degradation of many contaminants, and so plays a significant role in re- ducing their concentration in the environment. Photoreactions of contaminants occur through two general mechanisms. In the first mechanism (direct photo- reaction), solar radiation directly absorbed by the contaminant results in changes in its chemical structure that can affect its persistence and fate in t he environment. In the second mechanism (indirect photoreaction) the contami- nant is transformed by reaction with short -lived reactive molecules that are produced through absorption of sunlight by substances such as coloured dis- solved organic matter (CDOM). These processes usually include reactive oxy- gen species (see Figure 4.2 ). Page 50 of 95 The rates of both direct and indirect photoreactions are determined by how much UV radiation is absorbed. Photoreactions are, therefore, sensitive to changes in solar UV radiation due to changes in stratospheric ozone86 and/or other global c hanges (e.g., cloud cover or aerosols, see sections 1.6 -1.8). Hence, recovery of stratospheric ozone86 could result in lower rates of photo- degradation. In aquatic environments, increased runoff of rain and snow water caused by climate or land use changes (see sections 4.1, 5.4) increases CDOM concentrations, which i n turn can decrease photodegradation of con- taminants by protecting them from exposure to UV radiation in deep freshwa- ters and coastal ocean (see section 4.3). However, in many aquatic environ- ments, the rates of i ndirect photoreactions are proportional to c oncentrations of CDOM. Thus, decreases in rates of photodegradation of contaminants caused by protection from light by CDOM may be partially offset by increased rates of indirect photoreactions resulting from higher concentrations of CDOM. For example, thi s may occur near sewage treatment plants where indirect photoreactions can be accelerated due to the high concentration of CDOM in the effluent.48, 389 Since our last update,441 additional research has confirmed that indirect pho- todegradation is an important mechanism for the breakdown of a wide -range of contaminants, including health -related compounds,121, 271, 356 carbon nano- materials,80, 195, 322, 289, 290 and UV filters.389 Improved evalua- tion of these photodegradation processes is now being achieved with readily accessible models of solar UV radiation470 to improve predictions of degrada- tion of contaminants in the environment.49, 73, 235, 286 These models can be fur- ther developed to inc lude other environmental processes where photoreac- tions play a significant role e.g., the release of nanomaterials from commer- cial plastics (see sections 4.7, and 7.8 ) and the photoinactivation of disease - causing bacteria (see section 4.1), they would aid our ability to manage risks from contaminants in the environment. 6 Interactive effects of changing stratospheric ozone and climate on air quality and composition of the trop- osphere Stephen Wilson, Sasha Madronich, Janice Longstreth, and Keith Solomon. Changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can influence the production and distribution of air pollutants such as ozone ( O3), particulate matter (PM) , nitro- gen dioxide ( NO 2) and oxidised organic compounds. This occurs by several mechanisms: (i) modification of the transport of ozone from the stratosphere (stratosphere - troposphere exchange), (ii) variation of the intensity of UV -B radiation in the troposphere , inducing changes in key reactive compounds that degrade these air -pollutants, such as the hydroxyl radical (OH ), and (iii) changes in meteorology , such as precipitation. In addition, changes in com- position of the troposphere have resulted from actions taken under the Mon- treal Protocol to protect stratospheric O3, such as the use of replacements for ozone depleting substa nces (ODSs). These changes in air quality can impact Page 51 of 95 human health directly and may also indirectly affect human health through compromising food security by damaging agricultural and natural ecosystems . 6.1 Quantifying the amount of ozone t ransported from the stratosphere to the troposphere remains a significant challenge . The transport of air from the stratosphere brings significant amounts of ozone to the troposphere, con- tributing about 10% of the average background concentration.487 Quantifying this remains challenging, and an asse ssment of four alternative \"best esti- mates\" of atmospheric meteorology (combination of observations and meteor- ological models) for 1995 -2011 found significant differences between the esti- mates of ozone transport to the troposphere, with differences in long -term var- iability as well as differences in the latitudes at which the bulk of the transport occurs.50 Ozone -sonde measurements of the variation of ozone with altitude have been used to estimate the amount of ozone transported to the tropo- sphere at individual measurement sites in the Southern Hemisphere . This has then been combined with an atmospheric model to estimate the magnitude of the transport of O 3 from the stratosphere to the troposphere in the Southern Hemisphere, but the estimates have fairly wide bounds (\u00b120%).172 This transpo rt of O 3 is known to be an important contributor to ambient (ground -level) O 3 over large geographic scales. Future changes in strato- spheric O 3 and in climate would be expected to change the magnitude of this important process, but further work is needed t o adequately quantify the amount of stratospheric O 3 being transported to the troposphere and to esti- mate the implications for human and environmental health. 6.2 Better estimates of emissions have improved model predictions of ground -level ozone, although bia ses still exist . Prior atmospheric chemis- try/transport models for the south -eastern USA had predicted concentrations of O 3 much greater than observed.70 Based on detailed measurements of at- mospheric composition , it was concluded that the emissions of nitrogen ox- ides (NO x) attributed to vehicular and industrial sources were too high (30 - 60%). Using the new data for emissions improved the agreement between the model and observations of ozone, but the model was sti ll limited in its ability to reproduce the vertical variation of the concentration of O 3 in the lowest km of the atmosphere.430 The development of mathematical models that can more accurately pre dict concentrations of O 3 in the lower atmosphere is required to test the effectiveness of emission mitigation strategies and to accurately as- sess the role of UV -B radiation in the formation of O 3. 6.3 Concentration maxima fo r ambient ozone have shifted towards the equator in recent decades , changing the importance of global drivers such as climate change and stratosphe ric ozone . From 1980 to 2010, ambient ozone concentrations increased most noticeably in regions close to the equator. This shift is driven by changes in emissions of precursors of O 3, such as anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NO x,493 which are associated with developing economies. These precursors have increased in the tropical regions and decreased in temp erate regions. Compared to mid-latitudes, these tropical regions experience higher UV -B radiation, tem- perature, and humidity; and ambient O 3 will respond differently to strato- Page 52 of 95 spheric O 3 and climate change. When assessing the global impact of strato- spheric ozone depletion and climate on air quality into the future, this shift will need to be considered. Thus, in the future, more attention should be directed to characterising ambient O 3 in tropical regions . 6.4 Several approaches have been used to estimate the trend in the concen- tration of a key atmospheric oxidant (the hydroxyl radical) globally, with estimates ranging from constant to decreases by a factor of two in the last decade . Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are formed via UV-induced reactions involving the NO x-O3-OH cycle in the troposphere and they initiate the re- moval of methane and many other gases from the troposphere. Global con- centrations of CH 4 have been increasing in the past two decades at varying rates, with a levelling off occurring during 1999 -2006 (see Figure 6 .1 and sec- tion 5.5 ). The rate of change during this period was 0.6 ppb yr-1, while prior to 1999 rates were 6 ppb yr-1 and from 2011 -2016 they were 8.7 ppb yr-1.119 Sev- eral explanations for the levelling off have been proposed, mainly involving a reduction in emissio ns associated with fewer wetlands, and an increase in the rate of removal from the troposphere, i.e., because of an increase in the global concentrations of OH, which change in response to factors such as in- creasing emissions of NOx. Year -to-year variati ons in OH of around 1 -5%, determined from global observations of other compounds that are destroyed by OH, such as methyl chloroform, show some negative correlation with the trends in concentrations of CH 4: An increase in concentrations of OH during the CH 4 hiatus,297 and decline after 2007.368 However, other analyses show that the hiatus could equally be explained by assuming constant concentra- tions of OH and modulating CH 4 emissions, or by a simultaneous reduction in formation of OH and emission of CH 4.435 It is also pos- sible to esti- mate global or regional con- centrations of OH by other methods, e.g., from the vari- ability of con- centrations of hydrocarbons in the atmos- phere 350, from long - term trends in concentra- tions of car- bon monox- ide,414 and from concen- trations of organic nitrates in ice cores320. However, because of the large un- Figure 6 .1: Trends in global methane concentrations. (Ed Dlugoken- sky, https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_ch4/ , downloaded 30 Oct. 2017). Page 53 of 95 certainties inherent in these methods, their use does not resolve the ambigui- ties implied by the trends in CH 4. In summary, it is unclear whether concentra- tions of OH really have changed subst antially in the past few decades. Future changes in the lifetime and concentration of CH 4 and many other compounds will depend on the extent to which the concentration of OH is sensitive to changes in future environmental conditions including UV radiation , tempera- ture, and humidity. 6.5 New research shows that the chemical composition of atmospheric par- ticulate matter may alter its impact on human health. The health effects of particulate matter are currently evaluated mainly based on mass concentra- tions of particles smaller than 2.5 m (PM 2.5), without accounting for the com- position. Such particles are typically mixtures (see Figure 6 .2) of primary di- rectly -emitted solid material such as soot, dust, metals and waxes combined with secondary compounds (e.g., o xygenated organics, sulfates, and nitrates). The concentration and chemical nature of these secondary compounds are modified by OH and UV -B radiation. Recent studies have attempted to determine the different health ef- fects associated with specific chem ical constituents of the parti- cles. These studies take ad- vantage of the observation that composition of particles vary by lo- cation and season and that these compositional changes might be associated with variations in ad- verse health effects. A literature review311 identified significant health effects associated with trace metals, mineral dust, inor- ganic water -soluble compounds, and organics, the two latter gr oups being composed in large part of secondary compounds (nitrates, sulfates, secondary organics). Ueda et al.437 showed that daily mortality in Nagoya (Japan) was marginally associated with elevated concen- trations of sulfate, although there was also some association with nitrate, chlo- ride, ammonium, potassium, elemental carbon (soot), and organic carbon. While more work is clearly needed, these early results confirm that particulate matter generated by UV ra diation is a significant cause of health problems. Consideration of chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter should improve our ability to quantify the benefits of strategies for manage- ment of air quality. Figure 6 .2: An aerosol particle collected in the atmosphere of Mexico Cit y. Soot spher- ules, shown in black, are about 20 nm in di- ameter, and are emitted directly from com- bustion sources. The (false) colours show a coating of sulfate (red) and oxygenated or- ganics (blue), produced by UV -initiated, \u00b7OH - oxidation of sulphu r dioxide and hydro- carbons (from5). Page 54 of 95 6.6 Assessments of the health effects fr om air pollutants sensitive to changes in stratospheric ozone (e.g. tropospheric ozone, particulate matter, sulfate and NO 2) have concluded that adverse effects occur fol- lowing increases in short - or long -term exposures to concentrations of these pollutant s. Exposure to outdoor air pollution and particulate matter has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a probable Group -1 human carcinogen and is recognised as an im- portant driver of adverse effects on the health of h umans.203 Effects of changes in tropospheric O 3 are most dir ectly relevant to the purview of the Montreal Protocol, while there are interactions between UV -B radiation with NO x, SO x, and particulates (as mentioned above). Reports of associa- tions between poor air quality and various diseases in humans continue to ac- cumulate in the literature. Many of the recent studies on the effects of air pol- lutants report positive associations of several adverse health effects in addi- tion to cancer, with increased levels of air pollution. This linkage between air pollutants and adverse health outcomes is thought to be mediated through di- rect effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the latter via oxida- tive stress and sustained inflammatory responses. Adverse responses in other internal organs are likely secondary t o the direct effects on the circula- tory and respiratory systems. The following provides an assessment based on several monographs, global studies, and meta -analyses that represent a small but comprehensive sample of the available recent literature. A glo bal analysis of 25 -year trends (1990 -2015) of the burden of disease at- tributable to ambient air pollution showed that PM 2.5 was the fifth most im- portant contributor to disease burden.93 It contributed to 7.6% of total global mortality in 2015. The authors estimated that long -term exposure to PM 2.5 caused 4.2 million deaths and 103 million lost years of healthy life each year. Exposure to O 3 caused an additional 254,000 deaths and 4.1 million lost years of healthy life, primarily due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The global distribution of this estimate of the health impact is shown in Figure 6.3. An economic assessment of health effects of PM 2.5 in 2006 in China re- ported costs of USD151 -177 billion.302 Of this, 90% was attributable to mor- tality estimated to be 1.7 -2 million from all causes. 6.7 Adverse effects of poor air quality on crop plants continue to be docu- mented, especially in less -developed countries. The effects of air pollu- tants in the lower a tmosphere, in particular O 3, have been assessed in previ- ous reports441 and these effects continue to be documented. Particulates, such as PM 10 and PM 2.5, have negligible effect on plants, while O 3 is directly toxic. An economic assessment of the effects of O 3 on production of wheat, rice, maize, and soybean in China, indicated annual losses of the order of USD3.4 billion.302 Losses in these crops for 2006 were estimated at 9, 4.6, 0.44, and 0.34 mil- lion tonnes, respectively. Based on models of concentrations of O 3 and its precursors NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) i n India, losses of yields of wheat and rice from O 3 damage in the major production regions were Page 55 of 95 estimated at 2.2 million tonnes (3.3%) and 2.05 million tonnes (2.5%), respec- tively.160 A similar study published in 2017 provided greater estimated dam- age from O 3 in wheat and rice in India.242 These authors estimated that the total annual loss of yield in India as a whole was 4.0 -14.2 million tonnes (4.2 - 15.0%) for wheat and 0.3 -6.7 million tonnes (0.3 -6.3%) for rice. Also in India, a study on several varieties of potatoes showed that concentra- tions of O 3 above the accumulated exposure over the threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40) resulted in losses of 4.5 -25%, depending on cultiv ar.416 Concentra- tions of O 3 in the troposphere in most regions of Europe have decreased since the 1980s.220 Results of modeling indicate that future concentrations of O3 in the troposphere in Europe will likely continue to decrease in most re- gions to below the target of AOT40 by 2020. However, using the more sensi- tive metric of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD, based on the accumulated ozone flux into the leaves and needles), exceedances of toxic doses might persist in some European forestry regions into the 2050s. Continued monitoring and a Figure 6 .3. Disability -adjusted lost years of life (DALYs) for 2016 from two sources.

Page 56 of 95 better understanding of the processes that result in damage to crops will aid in developing strategies for management or mitigation. 6.8 Trifluoroacetic acid, which is produced through the breakdown of some fluorinated replacements for ozone depleting substanc es, remains an is- sue of concern in the atmosphere . The fate and effects of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the terminal breakdown product of several current -use refriger- ants, were discussed in previous reports,402, 441. Further information on effects of TFA in humans or the environment has not been published since the last Update Report;441 however, several papers have reported in formation about the fate and formation of TFA in the environment. Further experimental evi- dence has confirmed the recalcitrance of TFA to degradation in the environ- ment. TFA was found to be stable to polychromatic radiation (200 to 1000 nm) for up to 16 h in laboratory tests.358 In the atmosphere, most TFA was measured in the vapour phase with less than 5% adsorbed to particles.175 The process of adsorption of TFA to soot particles was physical but is ex- pected to be reversible by dissolution in water. A recent paper383 confirmed that TFA could be formed from several pharmaceuticals when they were ex- posed to conditions lik e those in waste -water treatment plants. TFA is also formed from several pesticides and, because of this, is subjected to the legis- lative criterion in the EU that pesticides (and metabolites) cannot exceed a concentration of 0.1 \u00b5g L-1 in drinking water.132 In some locations in the EU, concentrations of TFA exceed this criterion. Thi s results in a dilemma in that the source of most of this TFA is likely not from pesticides; however, it is im- possible to apportion the measured concentrations to pesticidal and non -pes- ticidal origins. Although TFA has been observed in surface - and drinki ng-wa- ter in Europe and other regions, it remains at concentrations that are well be- low those of toxicological concern. 7 Interactive effects of solar ultraviolet radiation and cli- mate change on damage to material s Anthony Andrady, Krishna Pande y, Anu Heikkil \u00e4, Ayako Torikai, Halim Redhwi Solar UV radiation adversely affects the properties of materials used in out- door construction, such as plastics and wood. The service lifetimes of these materials are influenced by the rates of degradation by solar UV radiat ion as well as other climate factors, especially temperature. Therefore, any change in the stratospheric ozone layer together with other climate factors determin es their outdoor service lifetimes. However, several technologies including the use of UV stabi lisers and surface treatments or coatings have been devel- oped to mitigate these adverse effects. While these technologies can address any realistic UV radiation and climate scenario, they add to the cost of the ma- terial. The focus of this section is on r ecent advances in understanding of the mech- anisms of UV radiation -induced degradation in materials , and on assessing the emerging technologies for stabili sation of materials against degradation mediated by UV radiation and climate. Page 57 of 95 7.1 Naturally -derived UV sta bilisers for wood and plastic materials are being developed from wood extractives . Extractives are coloured secondary me- tabolites present in wood or wood bark that can be extracted with an organic solvent. Antioxidant compounds, particularly the catechol f lavonoids, present in extractives from Acacia confusa act to photostabi- lise sapwood of Cunninghamia lanceolat a.78 In laboratory exposures, the ex- tractives were as effective in controlling discolouration of wood due to lignin breakdown as synthetic UV stabilisers. Tannins (proanthocyanidins) extracted from bark of Pinus radiata also show similar stabilising effects.173, 174 Incorpo- rating either native or modified tannins at typical additive levels of < 0.5% in acrylic coatings controlled the discolouration of timber in outdoor weathering studies, again out -performing conventional synthetic UV stabilisers at similar concentrations. Given the move towards increased sustainability in the wood industry, these natural compounds show promise as alternatives to synthetic UV stabilisers. 7.2 Wood -derived lignins or their depolymerised products can be used as a UV and oxidation stabiliser in commodity plastics . Cellulose and lignin are some of the most abundantly available forms of biomass on Earth. Lignins are thermally stable and can be readily proce ssed with common plastics.483 They contain phenolic and other antioxidant functionalities263 that impart stability to the plastic against damage by UV radiation. At 2% (w/w), lignin imparted very good UV stability to polypropylene (PP) via a free -radical scavenging mecha- nism.81 At similar concentrations, Kraft -processed which binds the cellulose fibres, is diss olved) from Eucalyptus sp . was re- ported to perform even better than a conventional hindered -amine light (HAL) stabiliser as the primary UV stabiliser in PP.150 De-polymerised products of lignin are also effective UV stabilisers in polyethylene and PP.218 This study on the effect of exposure to simulated solar UV radiation on the stiffness of PP found 2.5 wt% depolymerised Kraft lignin to be as (w/w) conven tional stabiliser. Lignins, a by -product of the paper industry, can be a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable class of UV stabilisers for com- modity plastics. 7.3 The use of nano -powders as a protective surface coating is a promising approach to stabi lise wood used outdoors and that is exposed to solar UV radiation . Wood surfaces exposed to solar UV radiation routinely need to be protected from discolouration and other damage.71 Surface protection of wood with coatings that contain fillers is a popular strategy to control discol- ouration of wood exposed outdoors. When used in lesser amounts, nanoscale oxides that absorb solar UV radia- tion can efficiently shield the wood surface from exposure to UV radiation. The effect of treating wood surfaces directly with nanoscale zinc oxide or titanium dioxide410, 433 or with coatings carrying 1 -3 % (w/w) of these nanofillers313 was recently studied. These treatments reduced the discolouration of wood spe- cies by 48 -57% in exposures to natural and/or simulated solar UV radiation, respectively. Arrays of zinc oxide nanorods (typically < 100 nm in length), generated directly on the surface of wood, were particularly effective absorb- ers of UV ra diation, resulting in less than 20% of the discolouration compared Page 58 of 95 to that for untreated wood exposed to simulated solar UV radiation under la- boratory -accelerated conditions.236 7.4 A new model predicting the degradation of wood by exposure to solar UV radiation also considers the effects of moisture content and the tem- perature of exposure . Rates at which wood discolours outdoors depends on the dose of solar UV radiation received as well as the ambient temperature.447 Most published studies only report the rates of discolouration relative to the dose of solar UV radiation. Degradation of thin samples of spruce wood weathered under outdoor - and laboratory -accelerated conditions has been studied using near infrared hyperspectral imaging.397 The regression models for lignin damage under UV exposure also included temperatu re and humidity as additional experimental variables.397 This is a f irst step towards a predictive model that will help estimate damage to timber exposed to solar UV radiation under different climatic conditions, although the model needs further valida- tion. 7.5 Nanofillers are effective for controlling degradation by solar UV radia- tion of some plastics but may accelerate degradation in others . Rein- forcing fillers are commonly used in plastics to increase their mechanical strength.359 However, some of these fillers may act as UV stabilisers as well. Because o f their high surface area per unit mass, nanoscale UV -absorbing fill- ers are particularly efficient UV stabilisers in some plastics136, 344 For instance, incorporating 1 % (w/w) nanoclay42, 221 or rutile titanium dioxide (TiO 2)481 in poly(lactic acid) plastics or 2 % (w/w) TiO 2 in acrylic films323 resulted in marked improvement in their UV stability in terms of loss of tensile proper- ties221, 344, 481 or as of in polystyrene114 or in PP488 unexpectedly accelerated their photodegra dation. The efficacy of nanofillers as UV stabilisers appears to vary with the plastic -filler combination and the amount of filler used. Further studies into their mechanisms of action is required prior to broader application of nanofillers as stabilisers in plastics. 7.6 The release rates of carbon nanotubes through degradation by solar UV radiation of polycaprolactone nanocomposites are lower than expected based on their composition, thus reducing environmental and human health hazards . With an estimated prod uction of 12,800 tonnes in 2016, ca r- bon nanotubes (CNTs) are being used to reinforce plastic products for numer- ous applications. Carbon nanotubes have a diameter of the order of tens of nm and lengths in the 1000s of nm. Upon weathering, these composites r e- lease CNTs (or microplastics containing CNTs) into the environment,181 pos- ing a potential public health hazard181, 238 (see also section 4.7). Mixing up to 20 % (w /w) of CNT fillers in polyolefin plastics electrical conductivity.9 Polycaprolactone nanocomposite s (with CNTs) underwent substantial degradation under accelerated laboratory expo- sure to UV radiation. However, these composites released less C NTs from the weathered surface than expected based on their composition. During deg- radation, a mat of CNT gradually formed on the surface, preventing further re- lease of CNTs or microplastics from the surface undergoing weathering.245 Nano - or microplastic released from w eathering of this class of nanocompo- sites might be less of an environmental concern than expected. Whether or Page 59 of 95 not this phenomenon generally holds for other CNT nanocomposites is not known. 7.7 Self-healing polymers can contribute towards protecting the plastic components in solar photovoltaic panels against solar UV -induced deg- radation . Damage to the active layers of photovoltaic (PV) panels by solar UV radiation250, 351 through micro -cracking and discolouration of components of the panel (especially the encapsulant,30, 228 back ing-sheet,258 and a dhe- sive)30, 258, 276 limits their service lifetimes making the m uneconomical for ex- tended use.330 Among the novel strategies researched to reduce their degradation under UV radiation, a new class of self -healing polymers effectively addresses the cracking of encapsulants in solar cells.32 Power conversion efficiency of the treated units can be maintained with only a ca 15% loss over a 20 -day period of laboratory accelerated exposur e, compared to a 90% loss in an untreated device during the same period. A second promising approach includes the use of inorganic phosphor additives as UV radiation absorbers to control the degradation of plastic components.427 These enhancements contribute to in- creased service lives of solar PV devices. 7.8 Exposure of plastic litter to UV radiation during we athering is specu- lated to be responsible for generating secondary microplastics in the marine environment . Experimental evidence of this process of generating secondary microplastics has been reported for the first time 19, 162. Occurrence of microplastics (particles < 5 \u00b5m) in the ocean environment is widespread and is an emerging environmental concern. Secondary microplastics are fragments of larger pieces of plastic debris generated due to exposure by so- lar UV radiation and th e abrasion of weathered plastic litter with sand or wa- ter.19, 162 The adverse impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems has been reported in several studies152 (and see section 4.7). Experimental stud- ies now provide evidence that micro - and nano -plastics (in the size range of 30 nm to 60 \u00b5m) are generated when plastics in water are irradiated with UV radiation (320 to 400 nm) at 30oC243 under laboratory -accelerated conditions. A study on high -density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics where exposure to sim- ulated solar UV radiation was followed by mil d abrasion with sand also yielded microplastic fragments; 14 -17% of the sample was lost after 5 -6 months of exposure to UV radiation that simulated coastal exposure conditions .219 The study also showed the rates of fragmentation for exposure in water to be slower than that for sand. These recent studies unambiguously demonstrate for the first time the gener- ation of microplastics under marine exposure conditions, thus fac ilitating bet- ter future estimates of microplastic loads in the environment. 7.9 Nanoscale fillers continue to be successfully evaluated as UV stabilisers for textile fibres, although new bio -based dyes also show promise as ef- fective nano -ZnO in cotton fibres153 have been shown to provide good protection from UV radation. However, there is emerging interest in the use of Page 60 of 95 dyes derived from plant sources as stabilisers, with some yielding as high a UV protection factor (UPF) as 50+ in natural fibres such as cotton.157 Where ZnO was use d as a UV radiation protector, Aloe gel extract was added as a natural capping agent for better dispersion of the pigment. At 0.8% (w/w), the stabiliser improved the UPF values of linen fabric from 7 to 61.495 While more work is needed to assess their commercial potential, inexpensive sustainable biodegradable plant dyes, which also act as UV absorbers, are likely to stimu- late considerable market interest.
