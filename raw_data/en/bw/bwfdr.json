The Graduate School stands at the very heart of Yale's mission as a university, and this publication, Programs and Policies , reveals the extraordinary breadth of opportunities for graduate study at Yale. As you peruse it, you likely will discover the intriguing ways in which graduate study diers from the undergraduate experience and the fulllment brought by this intellectual progression. You have undertaken to explore a eld in depth, master an area of inquiry, and learn to disseminate knowledge through classroom teaching. Graduate education culminates in a creative and original contribution in one's eld of study representing the ability to participate in the advancement of human knowledge. Yale's departments and programs constitute the center for most graduate student intellectual and social life at Yale. They comprise vital communities of faculty and students from around the world and with diverse backgrounds who share a common interest in advancing a particular discipline. Graduate students and faculty alike gain immeasurably from their intellectual and disciplinary collaborations. Yale's excellent laboratory facilities, unique museum collections, and tremendous library holdings all enrich the experience of a Yale University graduate education. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has worked to extend and enrich the community life found within these disciplines. Interdisciplinary programs and institutes, as well as the events oered through the McDougal Graduate Student Center, the Oce for Graduate Student Development and Diversity, the Oce of Career Strategy, and the Center for Teaching and Learning, help graduate students prepare for their professional lives. The Graduate School enables students to connect with skilled experts with a shared commitment to careers in teaching, research, and an array of potential leadership opportunities. Use Programs and Policies as a guide throughout your graduate study at Yale. It includes practical information about registration, nancial aid, teaching experiences, University resources available to you, and the full range of assistance provided by the Graduate School. All of us in the Graduate School wish you good fortune as you pursue your advanced degree, and we want you to contact us if we can help you along the way. Graduate study is exhilarating and life-changing. For well over a century Yale has prepared women and men for truly extraordinary careers across many old, new, and evolving disciplines. Lynn Cooley, Ph.D. Dean, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences C.N.H. Long Professor of Genetics and Professor of Cell Biology and of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental BiologyThe Graduate School of Arts and Sciences The Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is one of fourteen schools comprising Yale University and the only one that awards the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Philosophy, Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Advanced Study. The work of the Graduate School is carried on in the divisions of the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Biological and Physical Sciences. Fiy-six departments and programs oer courses of study leading to the Ph.D. degree. There are eighteen programs that terminate with the master's degree. Yale began to oer graduate education in 1847, and in 1861 it conferred the rst Ph.D. degrees in North America. In 1876 Yale became the rst American university to award the Ph.D. to an African American. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was formally established in 1892, when the rst dean was appointed. It was in that same year that women were rst admitted as candidates for the doctorate. The Graduate School community has grown vigorously since the early twentieth century; today it comprises more than 2,800 graduate students and a faculty of nearly 1,000 who are among the world 's most distinguished teachers and scholars. Admission to the Graduate School is highly competitive; currently each entering class is made up of about 650 students. The Graduate School 's purpose is to educate students in research, scholarship, and teaching in the arts and sciences. Under the guidance of the faculty, graduate students engage in advanced study of a discipline and then proceed to generate new knowledge and ideas through research. They learn to disseminate this knowledge in scholarly publications and teaching. Yale 's graduate students have built careers in colleges and universities, research laboratories, government, the nonprot sector, and private industry. Their education equips them for leadership roles in all these callings. Yale's standing as a great international research university is based on the strength and attractiveness of its graduate programs. The pursuit of advanced learning and new knowledge takes place in the departments and programs of the Graduate School. Thus, it is the Graduate School that makes Yale a university. Furthermore, graduate students as scholars in training and apprentice teachers engage with undergraduates and the faculty. A shared sense of common purpose makes Yale a community of scholars, and a place for an unusually intimate exchange of ideas. Mission Statement The mission of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is to seek students of the highest intellectual promise and achievement of all backgrounds, from across the nation and around the world, and to educate them to be scholars, teachers, and leaders for many sectors of society. The larger aim of this enterprise is to prepare and stimulate each new generation to perpetuate and advance human knowledge and to contribute to the health and development of the human community.The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 15 Yale and the World The Yale Graduate School has always comprised an international community, but it recognizes as well that now, more than ever, advanced scholarship must occur on transnational grounds. It is increasingly important that we prepare our students to participate in a global economy of research and knowledge and that we create institutional channels through which such participation can flourish. In addition to formal student exchanges that enable graduate students to perform research and eldwork abroad, individual faculty members, departments, and the School participate in collaborative eorts with international partners. Approximately one-third of full-time graduate students at Yale come from outside the United States. In addition, many international students come to the Graduate School as nondegree students in the Division of Special Registration (DSR). DSR students may undertake course work and/or research for periods of one term or one year. When appropriate the period may extend for a second year. These students are subject to the usual admissions procedure, are admitted to a department, and oen work with a specic faculty member. A Global University Yale continues to evolve as a global university, educating leaders and advancing the frontiers of knowledge across the entire world. The University's engagement beyond the United States dates from its earliest years. Yale has drawn students from abroad for nearly two centuries, and international topics have been represented in its curriculum for the past hundred years and more. This year, Yale welcomed the largest number of international students and scholars in its history. The current enrollment of more than 2,800 international students from 121 countries comprises 22 percent of the student body. Yale is committed to attracting the best and brightest from around the world by oering generous international nancial aid packages, conducting programs that introduce and acclimate international students to Yale, and fostering a vibrant campus community. The number of international scholars (visiting faculty, researchers, and postdoctoral fellows) has also grown to nearly 2,700 each year. Yale's globalization is guided by the vice president for global strategy and deputy provost for international aairs, who is responsible for ensuring that Yale's broader global initiatives serve its academic goals and priorities, and for enhancing Yale's international presence as a leader in liberal arts education and as a world-class research institution. The vice president and deputy provost works closely with academic colleagues in all of the University's schools and provides support and strategic guidance to the many international programs and activities undertaken by Yale faculty, students, and sta. The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies (http:// macmillan.yale.edu) is the University's focal point for teaching and research on international aairs, societies, and cultures.16 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 The Jackson Institute for Global Aairs (http://jackson.yale.edu) seeks to institutionalize the teaching of global aairs throughout the University and to inspire and prepare Yale students for global citizenship and leadership. The Oce of International Aairs (http://world.yale.edu/oia) provides administrative support for the international activities of all schools, departments, centers, and organizations at Yale; promotes Yale and its faculty to international audiences; and works to increase the visibility of Yale's international activities around the globe. The Oce of International Students and Scholars (http://oiss.yale.edu) hosts orientation programs and social activities for the University's international community and is a resource for international students and scholars on immigration matters and other aspects of acclimating to life at Yale. The Yale World Fellows Program (http://worldfellows.yale.edu) hosts een emerging leaders from outside the United States each year for an intensive semester of individualized research, weekly seminars, leadership training, and regular interactions with the Yale community. The Association of Yale Alumni (http://aya.yale.edu) provides a channel for communication between the alumni and the University and supports alumni organizations and programs around the world. Additional information may be found on the \"Yale and the World\" website (http:// world.yale.edu), including resources for those conducting international activities abroad and links to international initiatives across the University.

Center for Language Study Nelleke Van Deusen-Scholl, Director; Associate Dean, Yale Tierney, Director, English Language Program; james.tierney@yale.edu Dow Hall, 370 Temple St. http://cls.yale.edu The Center for Language Study (CLS) supports language teaching and learning across the university. For graduate students in language and literature programs, it oers a Certicate in Second Language Acquisition that includes pedagogy workshops, a capstone course in SLA, and a series of professional development workshops that, taken together, give graduate students grounding in the theory and practice of language teaching. Graduate students have found the SLA Certicate helpful in preparing for the job market, in part because the teaching ePortfolio they prepare as they exit the program is attractive to hiring committees. For international graduate students, the CLS oers the English Language Program (ELP), which includes a Summer Program for incoming students, a series of courses that focus on academic English and teaching in the American classroom, workshops on a range of topics such as pronunciation and public speaking, and a nal assessment that certies graduate students for teaching at Yale. The goal of ELP is to prepare international graduate students for success in their academic and professional lives here at Yale and beyond. For more information, contact James Tierney at james.tierney@yale.edu. Finally, the CLS oers two programs for independent language learning, Directed Independent Language Study (DILS) and Fields, both of which are available to graduate students. DILS matches students who want to study languages not taught at Yale with an educated native speaker of that language. Fields matches advanced students of any language (including those taught at Yale) with a language partner to study a language and a eld together (e.g.,The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 23 Chinese and Economics). Although neither DILS nor Fields carries course credit, graduate students oen use these programs to prepare for eld study and research, and for fellowship applications. For more information, contact Angela Gleason at angela.gleason@yale.edu. Committees Currently ve standing committees are concerned with the policies and procedures of the Graduate School; as with all standing committees, their deliberations are condential.

Additionally, please indicate both departments onAfrican American Studies 27 all supporting documents (personal statement, letters of recommendation, transcripts, etc.). Requirements for Transfer into the African American Studies Combined Ph.D. Program A student currently enrolled in one of the departments or programs participating in the combined Ph.D. in African American Studies who desires to transfer into the combined Ph.D. program may do so aer: 1.Providing the DGS of African American Studies with a written statement of interest detailing the reasons for the transfer; 2.Providing the DGS with a letter of support from an African American Studies faculty member agreeing to serve as the student's adviser; 3.A vote by the African American Studies faculty approving the transfer, with such vote held at a department meeting no earlier than the spring term of the student's rst year as a graduate student at Yale. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students will be subject to the combined Ph.D. supervision of the African American Studies department and the relevant participating department or program. The student's academic program will be decided in consultation with an adviser, the DGS of African American Studies, and the DGS of the participating department or program and must be approved by all three. Students are required to take ve courses in African American Studies, generally at least one course each term. Any variance in scheduling requires DGS approval. Core courses are (1) Theorizing Racial Formations (AFAM 505 /AMST 643 ), which is a required course for all rst-year graduate students in the combined program, and (2) Dissertation Prospectus Workshop (AFAM 895 and AFAM 896 ), a two-term course, which graduate students in their third year of study must satisfactorily complete. This workshop is intended to support preparation of the dissertation proposal; each student will be required to present the dissertation prospectus orally to the faculty and to turn in a written prospectus dra by the end of spring term. Three other graduate-level African American Studies courses are required: (1) a history course, (2) a social science course, and (3) a course in literature or culture. Qualifying examinations and the dissertation proposal will be administered jointly by the African American Studies department and the participating department or program and must be passed within the time required by the participating department or program. A current tenured or ladder faculty member in African American Studies must serve on the dissertation committee, and the dissertation must have an African American Studies component. The total number of courses required will adhere to the requirements of the participating department or program. Each student must complete the minimum number of courses required by the participating department or program; African American Studies courses (excepting the Dissertation Prospectus Workshop) count toward the participating department's or program's total. For details of these requirements, see the special requirements of the combined Ph.D. for the particular department or program in this bulletin. Students will be required to meet the foreign language requirements of the participating department or program (see Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations). Students will not be admitted to candidacy until all requirements, including the dissertation prospectus, have been met28 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 and approved by the Graduate Studies Executive Committee of the African American Studies department and the participating department or program. A student who intends to apply for this combined Ph.D. in African American Studies and another department or program should consult the other department's or program's Ph.D. requirements and courses. The faculty in African American Studies consider teaching to be an essential component of graduate education, and students therefore will teach, under the supervision of departmental professors, in their third and fourth years. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.A. (en route to the combined Ph.D.) Students will be awarded a combined M.A. degree in African American Studies and the relevant participating department or program upon successful completion of all course work except the Dissertation Prospectus Workshop, which is taken in the student's third year of study. See also Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. More information is available on the department's website, http://afamstudies.yale.edu. Courses For course oerings in African languages, see African Studies. AFAM 505b / AMST 643b, Theorizing Racial Formations Kobena Mercer A required course for all rst-year students in the combined Ph.D. program in African American Studies; also open to students in American Studies. This interdisciplinary reading seminar focuses on new work that is challenging the temporal, theoretical, and spatial boundaries of the eld. AFAM 537b / FILM 710b, Contemporary Art, Race, and the Philosophy of Media Rizvana Bradley This course draws from a diverse range of writing in philosophy (especially the philosophy of media), contemporary critical theory (phenomenology, new materialism), contemporary feminist thought, queer theory, and black studies in order to question underlying assumptions about the body and embodied spaces in contemporary art and culture. Drawing from lm, literature, performance, and contemporary art, students think about a range of philosophical and critical themes, including the role of the body, the virtual construction of time and space, questions of aect, and sensation, all of which inform concerns over representation, embodiment, and materiality. AFAM 584b / SOCY 584b, Inequality, Race, and the City Elijah Anderson Urban inequality in America. The racial iconography of the city is explored and represented, and the dominant cultural narrative of civic pluralism is considered. Topics of concern include urban poverty, race relations, ethnicity, class, privilege, education, social networks, social deviance, and crime. AFAM 588b / AMST 710b / ENGL Autobiography in America Robert Stepto A study of autobiographical writings from Mary Rowlandson's Indian captivity narrative (1682) to the present. Classic forms such as immigrant, education, and cause narratives; prevailing autobiographical strategies involving place, work, andAfrican American Studies 29 photographs. Authors include Franklin, Douglass, Jacobs, Antin, Kingston, Uchida, Balakian, Als, and and Its Aermath in French and Francophone Literature Christopher Miller The practices, eects, and culture of both slavery and emancipation in the French empire and the postcolonial francophone world, as seen through literary writings. Readings on New France, the Code Noir, the Encyclop\u00e9die, the Haitian Revolution. Literary authors include Olympe de Gouges, Claire de Duras, Victor Diasporic Intellectuals Hazel Carby This course examines work by artists and writers of Caribbean descent from dierent regions of the transatlantic world. In response to contemporary interest in issues of globalization, the premise of the course is that in the world maps of these black intellectuals we can see the intertwined and interdependent histories and relations of the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Thinking globally is not a new experience for black peoples, and we need to understand that what is represented as \"Caribbeanness\" is a condition of movement. Literature and art are most frequently taught within the boundaries of a particular nation, but this course focuses on the work of writers and artists who shape the Caribbean identities of their characters as traveling black subjects and refuse to restrain their work within the limits of any one national identity. We practice a new and global type of cognitive mapping as we read and explore the meanings of terms like black transnationalism, migrancy, globalization, and empire. Diasporic practice embraces and represents the geopolitical realities of the modern, modernizing, and postmodern worlds in which multiple racialized histories are inscribed on modern bodies. AFAM 706a / HIST 711a / Readings in African American Women's History Crystal Feimster The diversity of African American women's lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social, political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, ction, autobiography, art, religion, lm, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women's activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the identity, family, and work. AFAM 745a / HSAR 786a, Black Atlantic Visual Arts since 1980 Kobena Mercer This seminar surveys black diaspora practices in late-twentieth- and early twenty- rst-century art while questioning the survey genre as such. Examining contributions of black artists to paradigm shis that have interrogated the identity of art over the past thirty years, we review the demands that issues of race and ethnicity place on interpretive models in the historiography of art. Considering thematic categories in which to understand what is distinctive to the diasporic conditions of Black Atlantic practitioners, while consistently relating their concerns to broad patterns in art practice as a whole in an era of globalization, the aim is to identify critical terms that best narrate30 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 the transformations black diaspora artists have introduced to a period characterized by the shi from modern to postmodern to contemporary. AFAM 763a / AMST 731a / HIST 747a, Methods and Practices in U.S. Cultural History Matthew Jacobson This sampling of U.S. cultural history from the early national period to the present is designed to unfold on two distinct planes. The rst is a rendering of U.S. culture itself\u2014a survey, however imperfect, of the major currents, themes, and textures of U.S. culture over time, including its contested ideologies of race and gender, its organization of productivity and pleasure, its media and culture industries, its modes of creating and disseminating \"information\" and \"knowledge ,\" its resilient subcultures, and its reigning nationalist iconographies and narratives. The second is a sampling of scholarly methods and approaches, a meta-history of \"the culture concept\" as it has informed historical scholarship in the past few decades. The cultural turn in historiography since the 1980s has resulted in a dramatic reordering of \"legitimate\" scholarly topics, and hence a markedly dierent scholarly landscape, including some works that seek to narrate the history of the culture in its own right (Kasson 's history of the amusement park, for instance), and others that resort to cultural forms and artifacts to answer questions regarding politics, nationalism, and power relations (Melani McAlister 's Epic Encounters). In addition to providing a background in U.S. culture, then, this seminar seeks to trace these developments within the discipline, to understand their basis, to sample the means and methods of \"the cultural turn ,\" and to assess the strengths and shortcomings of culture-based historiography as it is now constituted. AFAM / HIST 715a, Readings in Nineteenth-Century America David Blight The course explores recent trends and historiography on several problems through the middle of the nineteenth century: sectionalism, expansion; slavery and the Old South; northern society and reform movements; Civil War causation; the meaning of the Confederacy; why the North won the Civil War; the political, constitutional, and social meanings of emancipation and Reconstruction; violence in Reconstruction society; the relationships between social/cultural and military/political history; problems in historical memory; the tension between narrative and analytical history writing; and the ways in which race and gender have reshaped research and interpretive agendas. AFAM 773a / SOCY 630a, Workshop in Urban Ethnography Elijah Anderson The ethnographic interpretation of urban life and culture. Conceptual and methodological issues are discussed. Ongoing projects of participants are presented in a workshop format, thus providing participants with critical feedback as well as the opportunity to learn from and contribute to ethnographic work in progress.

Considerable flexibility and choice of areas of concentration are oered because students entering the program may have diering academic backgrounds and career plans. Enrollment in the M.A. program in African Studies provides students with the opportunity to register for the many African studies courses oered in the various departments of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the professional schools. The Program in African Studies also oers two interdisciplinary seminars to create dialogue and to integrate approaches across disciplines. In addition to the M.A. degree program, the Council on African Studies oers students in the University's doctoral and other professional degree programs the chance to obtain a Graduate Certicate of Concentration in African Studies by fullling a supplementary curriculum. (See Council on African Studies, under Non-Degree Granting Programs, Councils, and Research Institutes.) Joint degrees are possible with the approval of the director of graduate studies (DGS) and the relevant ocials in the schools of Forestry & Environmental Studies, Law, Management, and Public Health. The African collections of the Yale libraries together represent one of the largest holdings on Africa found in North America. The University now possesses more than 220,000 volumes including, but not limited to, government documents, art catalogues, photographs, manuscripts, correspondence, and theses, many published in Africa. Special Admissions Requirement The GRE General Test is required. Special Requirements for the M.A. Degree The Yale University Master of Arts degree program in African Studies was instituted in 1986. The two-year interdisciplinary, graduate-level curriculum is intended for students who will later continue in a Ph.D. program or a professional school, or for those who will enter business, government service, or another career in which a sound knowledge of Africa is essential or valuable. A student may choose one of the following areas of concentration: history; anthropology; political science; sociology; arts linguistics; religion; environmental and development studies; and public health. The program requires sixteen courses: two compulsory introductory interdisciplinary seminars, Research Methods in African Studies (AFST 501) and Topics in African Studies (AFST 764) or an alternate course, as specically designated by the DGS; four courses of instruction in an African language; four courses in one of the foregoing areas of concentration; four other approved courses oered in the Graduate School or professional schools; and two terms of directed reading and research (AFST 590 and AFST 900) during which students will complete the required thesis. A student who is able to demonstrate advanced prociency in an African language may have the language requirement waived and substitute four other approved courses. The choice of courses must be approved by the DGS, with whom students should consult as soon as possible in the rst term.34 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 The Master's Thesis The master's thesis is based on research on a topic approved by the DGS and advised by a faculty member with expertise or specialized competence in the chosen topic. Students must submit their thesis for joint evaluation by the adviser and a second reader, who is chosen by the student in consultation with the DGS. Program in African Languages The language program oers instruction in four major languages from sub-Saharan Africa: Kiswahili (eastern and central Africa), Wolof (west Africa), Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 (west Africa), and isiZulu (southern Africa). Language-related courses and language courses for professionals are also oered. African language courses emphasize communicative competence, and instructors use multimedia materials that focus on the contemporary African context. Course sequences are designed to enable students to achieve advanced competence in all skill areas by the end of the third year, and the African Languages program encourages students to spend one summer or term in Africa during their language study. Noncredited instruction in other African languages is available by application through the Directed Independent Language Study program at the Center for Language Study. Contact the director of the Program in African Languages. More information is available on the program's website, http:// african.macmillan.yale.edu. Courses AFST 567a / PLSC 798a, Bureaucracy in Africa: Revolution, Genocide, and Apartheid Sta A study of three major episodes in modern African history characterized by ambitious projects of bureaucratically driven change\u2014apartheid and its aermath, Rwanda's genocide and post-genocide reconstruction, and Ethiopia's revolution and its long aermath. Examination of Weber's theory bureaucracy, Scott's thesis on high modernism, Bierschenk's attempts to place African states in global bureaucratic history. Overarching theme is the place of bureaucratic ambitions and capacities in shaping African trajectories. AFST 639a / ANTH 639a, Africa, Politics, Anthropology Louisa Lombard A historical-anthropological study of politics in Africa. How have anthropologists made sense of the workings of African politics, both those of state and nonstate actors? This course charts how African states came into being, how they operate, and how state agents and the people they govern negotiate legitimacy, authority, and belonging. AFST 832a / HIST 832a, Methods and Practices in African History Daniel Magaziner This course provides a survey of African historical methods, considering topics from the use of historical linguistics and oral tradition to creative archival and narrative methodologies. We read monographs and other scholarly works, including classics in the discipline and new methodologically innovative studies. Students produce a substantive historiographical essay as well as a detailed analysis of a primary source of their choosing.African Studies 35 AFST 839a / HIST 839a, Environmental History of Africa Robert Harms An examination of the interaction between people and their environment in Africa and the ways in which this interaction has aected or shaped the course of African history.

Special Admissions Requirement A twenty-page writing sample is required with the application. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree During the rst two years of study students are required to take twelve term courses; at least half of these courses must be in American Studies. First-year students are also required to take AMST 600, American Scholars (graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory). The student's program will be decided in consultation with the adviser and the director of graduate studies (DGS). In each of the two years, the student should take at least one seminar devoted to research or requiring a substantial original paper, and must achieve two grades of Honors, with an average overall of High Pass. Students are required to show prociency in a language other than English; they may fulll this requirement by (1) conducting substantial research in the chosen language as part of the course requirements for one of the twelve required seminars, (2) passing a translation test, oered each term by various language departments, or (3) receiving a grade of B or higher in a Yale College intermediate- or advanced-level language course or in a Yale language-for-reading course, such as French for Reading or German for Reading.American Studies 37 Upon completion of course work, students in their third year of study are required to participate in at least one term of a monthly prospectus workshop (AMST 902). Intended to complement the work of the prospectus committee, the workshop is designed as a professionalization experience that culminates in students' presentation of the dissertation prospectus at their prospectus colloquium. Students should schedule the oral qualifying examinations in four elds, in the h term of study. Preparation, submission, and approval of the dissertation prospectus should be completed by the end of the sixth term, with a nal deadline at the end of the seventh term with permission from the DGS. Students are admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus. The faculty in American Studies considers training in teaching to be an important part of the program. Students in American Studies normally teach in years three and four. Combined Ph.D. Programs American Studies and African American Studies The American Studies Program also oers, in conjunction with the Department of African American Studies, a combined Ph.D. in American Studies and African American Studies. This combined degree is most appropriate for students who intend to concentrate in and write a dissertation on any aspect of African American history, literature, or culture in the United States and other parts of the Americas. Applicants to the combined program must indicate on their application that they are applying both to American Studies and to African American Studies. All documentation within the application should include this information. American Studies and Film and Media Studies The American Studies Program also oers, in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in American Studies and Film and Media Studies.

The meal in the rkin; the milk in the pan; the ballad in the street; the news of the boat; the glance of the eye; the form and the gait of the body. The literature of the poor, the feelings of the child, the philosophy of the street, the meaning of household life, are the topics of the time. \" \u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson, The American Scholar, 1837. A half-century ago American studies was a movement; now it is an institution. But it remains an anomaly in the academy, with neither method nor discipline: a modest program, not a department, that immodestly claims the space between disciplines, beyond disciplines, and perhaps encompassing disciplines. In the early days, American studies was imagined as a home for Emerson 's American scholar; these days Emerson 's scholar is apt to be eyed more skeptically. Nevertheless the philosophy of the street and the meaning of household life continue to be the topics of the time, and American studies remains an oddly Emersonian place for nurturing intellectuals. To explore the various kinds of American scholars and American studies, the American Scholars colloquium meets weekly. Each week, we ask a member of the American Studies faculty: What are the key works that shape your intellectual project? What works pose the crucial issues? What works engage what you would really know the meaning of? Each speaks briefly and leads a discussion of the works chosen. There is no writing assignment, and students receive a credit for participating. This course is mandatory for rst-year American Studies graduate students. AMST 622a / CPLT 622a, Working Group on Globalization and Culture Michael Denning A continuing yearlong collective research project, a cultural studies \"laboratory .\" The group, drawing on several disciplines, meets regularly to discuss common readings, develop collective and individual research projects, and present that research publicly. The general theme for the working group is globalization and culture, with three principal aspects: (1) the globalization of cultural industries and goods, and its consequences for patterns of everyday life as well as for forms of ction, lm, broadcasting, and music; (2) the trajectories of social movements and their relation to patterns of migration, the rise of global cities, the transformation of labor processes, and forms of ethnic, class, and gender conflict; (3) the emergence of and debates within transnational social and cultural theory. The specic focus, projects, and directions of the working group are determined by the interests, expertise, and ambitions of the members of the group, and change as its members change. There are a small number of openings for second-year graduate students. Students interested in participating should contact michael.denning@yale.edu.American Studies 39 AMST 623b / CPLT 822b, Working Group on Globalization and Culture Michael Denning A continuing yearlong collective research project, a cultural studies \"laboratory.\" The group, drawing on several disciplines, meets regularly to discuss common readings, develop collective and individual research projects, and present that research publicly.

AMST 643b / AFAM 505b, Theorizing Racial Formations Kobena Mercer A required course for all rst-year students in the combined Ph.D. program in African American Studies; also open to students in American Studies. This interdisciplinary reading seminar focuses on new work that is challenging the temporal, theoretical, and spatial boundaries of the eld. AMST 645b / Diasporic Intellectuals Hazel Carby This course examines work by artists and writers of Caribbean descent from dierent regions of the transatlantic world. In response to contemporary interest in issues of globalization, the premise of the course is that in the world maps of these black intellectuals we can see the intertwined and interdependent histories and relations of the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Thinking globally is not a new experience for black peoples, and we need to understand that what is represented as \"Caribbeanness\" is a condition of movement. Literature and art are most frequently taught within the boundaries of a particular nation, but this course focuses on the work of writers and artists who shape the Caribbean identities of their characters as traveling black subjects and refuse to restrain their work within the limits of any one national identity. We practice a new and global type of cognitive mapping as we read and explore the meanings of terms like black transnationalism, migrancy, globalization, and empire. Diasporic practice embraces and represents the geopolitical realities of the modern, modernizing, and postmodern worlds in which multiple racialized histories are inscribed on modern bodies. AMST 650a / HIST 807a, Resistance, Rebellion, and Survival Strategies in Modern Latin America Gilbert Joseph An interdisciplinary examination of new conceptual and methodological approaches to such phenomena as peasants in revolution, millenarianism, \"banditry,\" refugee movements, and transnational migration. AMST 705b / HIST 582b / RLST in American Society, 1600-2018 Tisa Wenger This seminar explores intersections of religion and society in American history from the colonial period to the present as well as methodological problems important to40 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 their study. It is designed to give graduate students a working knowledge of the eld, ranging from major recent studies to bibliographical tools. In short, the seminar is a broad readings course surveying religion in American history from colonization to the present. It is not a specialized research seminar, but it does require a basic understanding of historiography. AMST Readings in African American Women's History Crystal Feimster The diversity of African American women's lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social, political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, ction, autobiography, art, religion, lm, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women's activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the identity, work. AMST 710b / AFAM 588b / ENGL 948b, Autobiography in America Robert Stepto A study of autobiographical writings from Mary Rowlandson's Indian captivity narrative (1682) to the present. Classic forms such as immigrant, education, and cause narratives; prevailing autobiographical strategies involving place, work, and photographs. Authors include Franklin, Douglass, Jacobs, Antin, Kingston, Uchida, Balakian, Nineteenth-Century America David Blight The course explores recent trends and historiography on several problems through the middle of the nineteenth century: sectionalism, expansion; slavery and the Old South; northern society and reform movements; Civil War causation; the meaning of the Confederacy; why the North won the Civil War; the political, constitutional, and social meanings of emancipation and Reconstruction; violence in Reconstruction society; the relationships between social/cultural and military/political history; problems in historical memory; the tension between narrative and analytical history writing; and the ways in which race and gender have reshaped research and interpretive agendas. AMST 719a / RLST 703a, Interrogating Grewal In ocial and unocial discourses in the United States, diagnoses of Islam's various \"crises\" are ubiquitous, and Muslim \"hearts and minds\" are viewed as the \"other\" front in the War on Terror. Since 9/11, the U.S. State Department has made the reform of Islam an explicit national interest, pouring billions of dollars into USAID projects in Muslim-majority countries, initiating curriculum development programs for madrasas in South Asia, and establishing the Arabic Radio Sawa and the satellite TV station Al- Hurra to propagate the U.S. administration's political views as well as what it terms a \"liberal\" strain of Islam. Muslim Americans are also consumed by debates about the \"crisis\" of Islam, a crisis of religious authority in which the nature and rapidity of change in the measures of authority are felt to be too dicult to assimilate. This course maps out the various and deeply politically charged contemporary debates about the \"crisis of Islam\" and the question of Islamic reform through an examination of ocial U.S. policy, transnational pulp Islamic literature, fatwas and essays authored byAmerican Studies 41 internationally renowned Muslim jurists and scholars, and historical and ethnographic works that take up the category of crisis as an interpretive device. AMST 729b / FILM 810b / WGSS 746b, Visual Kinship, Families, and Photography Laura Wexler Exploration of the history and practice of family photography from an interdisciplinary perspective. Study of family photographs from the analog to the digital era, from snapshots to portraits, and from instrumental images to art exhibitions. Particular attention to the ways in which family photographs have helped establish gendered and racial hierarchies and examination of recent ways of reconceiving these images. AMST 731a / AFAM 763a / HIST 747a, Methods and Practices in U.S. Cultural History Matthew Jacobson This sampling of U.S. cultural history from the early national period to the present is designed to unfold on two distinct planes. The rst is a rendering of U.S. culture itself\u2014a survey, however imperfect, of the major currents, themes, and textures of U.S. culture over time, including its contested ideologies of race and gender, its organization of productivity and pleasure, its media and culture industries, its modes of creating and disseminating \"information\" and \"knowledge,\" its resilient subcultures, and its reigning nationalist iconographies and narratives. The second is a sampling of scholarly methods and approaches, a meta-history of \"the culture concept\" as it has informed historical scholarship in the past few decades. The cultural turn in historiography since the 1980s has resulted in a dramatic reordering of \"legitimate\" scholarly topics, and hence a markedly dierent scholarly landscape, including some works that seek to narrate the history of the culture in its own right (Kasson's history of the amusement park, for instance), and others that resort to cultural forms and artifacts to answer questions regarding politics, nationalism, and power relations (Melani McAlister's Epic Encounters ). In addition to providing a background in U.S. culture, then, this seminar seeks to trace these developments within the discipline, to understand their basis, to sample the means and methods of \"the cultural turn,\" and to assess the strengths and shortcomings of culture-based historiography as it is now constituted. AMST 741b / HIST 752b, Indians and Empires Ned Blackhawk This course explores recent scholarship on Indian-imperial relations throughout North American colonial spheres from roughly 1500 to 1900. It examines indigenous responses to Spanish, Dutch, French, English, and lastly American and Canadian colonialism and interrogates commonplace periodization and geographic and conceptual approaches to American historiography. It concludes with an examination of American Indian political history, contextualizing it within larger assessments of Indian-imperial and Indian-state relations. AMST 752a / PLSC 812a, Progressivism: Theory and Practice Stephen Skowronek The progressive reform tradition in American politics. The tradition's conceptual underpinnings, social supports, practical manifestations in policy and in new governmental arrangements, and conservative critics. Emphasis on the origins of progressivism in the early decades of the twentieth century, with attention to latter-day manifestations and to changes in the progressive impulse over time. AMST 768b / HIST 768b, Asian American History and Historiography Mary Lui This reading and discussion seminar examines Asian American history through a selection of recently published texts and established works that have signicantly42 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 shaped the eld. Major topics include the racial formation of Asian Americans in U.S. culture, politics, and law; U.S. imperialism; U.S. capitalist development and Asian labor migration; and transnational and local ethnic community formations. The class considers both the political and academic roots of the eld as well as its evolving relationship to \"mainstream\" American history. AMST 775b / ENGL 838b, Performing American Literature Wai Chee Dimock A broad selection of short stories, poems, and novels, accompanied by class performances, culminating in a term project with a signicant writing component. \"Performance\" includes a wide range of activities including: staging; making digital lms and videos; building websites; game design; and creative use of social media. Readings include poetry by Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Claudia Rankine; ction / HIST 703a, Research in Early National America Joanne Freeman A research seminar focused on the early national period of American history, broadly dened. Early weeks familiarize students with sources from the period and discuss research and writing strategies. Students produce a publishable article grounded in primary materials. AMST 814a / FILM 603a, Historical Methods in Film Study Charles Musser A range of historiographic issues in lm studies, including the roles of technology, exhibition, and spectatorship. Topics include intermediality and intertextuality. Consideration of a range of methodological approaches through a focus on international early cinema and American race cinema of the silent period. Particular attention to the interaction between scholars and archives. AMST 832a and AMST 833b / FILM 735a and FILM 736b, Documentary Film Workshop Charles Musser This workshop in audiovisual scholarship explores ways to present research through the moving image. Students work within a Public Humanities framework to make a documentary that draws on their disciplinary elds of study. Designed to fulll requirements for the M.A. with a concentration in Public Humanities. AMST 838a / HIST 749a / HSHM 753a, Research in Twentieth-Century United States Environmental History Paul Sabin Students conduct advanced research in primary sources and write original essays over the course of the term. Topics are particularly encouraged in twentieth-century environmental history (broadly dened, no specied geography) as well as in U.S. history, with a focus on politics, law, and economic development. Readings and library activities inform students' research projects. Interested graduate students should contact the instructor with proposed research topics. AMST 840a / ENGL 976a, Asian Inhumanities Sunny Xiang What might it mean to think from a position other to the \"Western humanities\"? This course takes the \"Asian inhumanities\" as neither a direct opposite nor even a direct challenge to the \"Western humanities,\" but as a heuristic device for self-conscious reflection about critical method, racial formation, knowledge production, and political action. The aim is not necessarily to decenter the human or the humanities\u2014I suspect that we will talk a good deal about both. Rather, we juxtapose \"Asia\" to \"human\" with an openness to contemplating the idiosyncrasies that each reveals about the other.American Studies 43 We start by surveying how scholars have posited \"Asia as method\" (to borrow Kuan- Hsing Chen's formulation). From there, we pursue the \"Asian inhumanities\" in two movements. The rst examines historically specic \"inhuman\" typologies (that is, stereotypes) arising from U.S.-Asian encounters: the yellow peril during the era of Asian exclusion, the model minority during the era of Asian inclusion, and the flexible citizen during the era of Asian globalization. The second tracks the relation between \"Asian\" and \"human\" at especially fraught scenes of contact: law, war, gender, biology, and technology. Finally, we approach the \"Asian inhumanities\" as a question of race- based politics, both within and beyond the university. What is at stake in taking the human as a political, ethical, and literary reference point\u2014for example, in desiring well developed and emotionally nuanced characters or even in reading for character at all? How does race gure into alternative critical approaches circulating within the humanities\u2014for example, surface reading, distant reading, new formalism, and weak theory? How does an attention to what is \"Asian\" impact our received critical frameworks for analyzing race? AMST 848b / ENGL 853b, Inventing the Environment in the Anthropocene Michael Warner Although the concept of the Anthropocene can be dated in various ways, two of the most important benchmarks seem to be the beginning of industrial production in the late eighteenth century and the uptick in carbon dioxide emissions from the mid-nineteenth century (petroleum came into use during the Civil War). The period between these two moments is also that in which the modern language of the environment took shape, from Cuvier's discovery of extinction and Humboldt's holistic earth science to the transformative work of Thoreau and George P. Marsh. This course shuttles between the contemporary debate about the signicance and consequences of the Anthropocene and a reexamination of that environmental legacy. We look at the complexity of \"nature,\" beginning with the Bartrams, Jeerson, Cuvier, and the transatlantic literatures of natural history; georgics and other genres of nature writing; natural theology; ambiguities of pastoral in American romantic writing (Bryant, mainly); the impact of Humboldt (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman); westward expansion and Native American writing about land; Hudson School painting and landscape architecture. We also think about the country/city polarity and the development of \"grid\" consciousness in places like New York City. One aim is to assess the formation and legacy of key ideas in environmentalism, some of which may now be a hindrance as much as a foundation. Secondary readings from Leo Marx, Henry Nash Smith, and William Cronon, as well as more recent attempts to reconceive environmental history (Joachim Radkau), ecocriticism (Lawrence Buell), and related elds, as well as science journalism (Elizabeth Kolbert). Students are invited to explore a wide range of research projects; and one assignment is to devise a teaching unit for an undergraduate class on the same topic. AMST 852b / ANTH 852b / WGSS 852b, Reading the Americas, Reading Ethnography Ana Ramos-Zayas The course uses ethnographic approaches to understand \"America\" as a hemispheric formation, while simultaneously examining \"ethnography\" as methodological, epistemological, and representational cra. Complemented by critical readings and seminar discussions about some of the trademarks of ethnographic research\u2014e.g., participant observation, life history, eld notes, and eld sites\u2014the course is designed44 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 to encourage students to interrogate the theoretical and methodological models that have been used in the production of knowledge about the Americas. Emphasizing ethnography's concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a \"how to\" course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of eldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the eld; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. AMST 853a, Archives: Imperial and Non-Imperial Histories, Practices, and Theories Laura Wexler In this seminar we explore theoretical, historical, material, practical, methodological, and curatorial questions related to archives. Students work in archives and experiment with creating archives. We read texts by Achille Mbembe, Okwui Enwezor, Ann Carolyn Kay Steedman, and others.

Joseph Errington, Eduardo Fernandez- Duque, Inderpal Grewal (Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies), Marcia Inhorn (Middle East Studies), William Kelly (Emeritus ), Paul Kockelman, Roderick McIntosh, Catherine Panter-Brick, Douglas Rogers, Eric Sargis, James Scott (Political Science), Helen Siu, Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan, Anne Underhill, Claudia Valeggia, David Watts Associate Professors Oswaldo Chinchilla, Aimee Cox (African American Studies), Erik Harms, William Honeychurch Assistant Professors Louisa Lombard, Lisa Messeri Fields of Study The department covers three subelds: archaeology; sociocultural and linguistic anthropology; and physical anthropology. Archaeology focuses on ritual complexes and writing, ceramic analysis, warfare, ancient civilizations, origins of agriculture, and museum studies. Sociocultural anthropology provides a range of courses: classics in ethnography and social theory, religion, myth and ritual, kinship and descent, historical anthropology, culture and political economy, agrarian studies, ecology, environment and social change, medical anthropology, emotions, public health, sexual meanings and gender, postcolonial development, ethnicity, identity politics and diaspora, urban anthropology, global mass culture, and alternate modernity. Linguistic anthropology includes language, nationalism and ideology, structuralism and semiotics, and feminist discourse. Physical anthropology focuses on paleoanthropology, evolutionary theory, human functional anatomy, race and human biological diversity, and primate ecology. There is strong geographical coverage in Africa, the Caribbean, East Asia (China and Japan), Latin America and South America, Southeast Asia (Indonesia), South Asia and the Indian Ocean, the Near East, Europe, and the United States. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree There are no required courses or seminars for archaeology and biological anthropology graduate students. However, graduate students in these subelds are expected to confer closely with their primary adviser and faculty to develop the most enriching and cogent program of courses. In sociocultural anthropology, more than three-fourths of a student's program consists of electives, including course work in other departments. Sociocultural students must take six required courses, with the remainder being electives among Anthropology courses and other departments' courses. Admission to Ph.D. candidacy requires (1) completion of two years of course work (twelve term courses for students matriculating in fall 2018 and beyond; sixteen term coursesAnthropology 47 for students who matriculated earlier); (2) independent study and research; (3) satisfactory performance on qualifying examinations; and (4) a dissertation research proposal submitted and approved before the end of the third year. For sociocultural anthropology students, the research proposal requirement takes the form of a eld paper of approximately eighty pages in length. Qualifying examinations are normally taken at the end of the second year. For archaeology and biological anthropology subelds, they consist of eight hours written (four hours on one of the subelds, four hours on the student's special interest), and two hours oral. The sociocultural anthropology exam consists of ve hours written and approximately one hour oral and is based on the six required courses. Because of the diversity of our students' training program, the department does not have a general foreign language requirement, either for admission or for admission to Ph.D. candidacy. Rather, each student's advisory committee must determine the necessary level and nature of foreign language prociency (including scholarly languages and languages to be used in eld research) to be met by the student, as well as any required competencies in statistics and other quantitative or qualitative methods. Advisory committees will stipulate such requirements in writing to the director of graduate studies (DGS) at the earliest possible stage of the student's program of study for approval by the DGS and the department faculty. Such committee stipulations should specify exactly when and how it will be determined that the student has or has not met the requirements. Combined Ph.D. Programs The Anthropology department also oers a combined Ph.D. in Anthropology and Forestry & Environmental Studies in conjunction with the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, and a combined Ph.D. in Anthropology and African American Studies in conjunction with the Department of African American Studies. These combined programs are ideal for students who intend to concentrate in, and to write dissertations on, thematic and theoretical issues centrally concerned with anthropology and one of these other areas of study. Students in the combined degree programs will be subject to the combined supervision of faculty members in the Anthropology department and in the respective department or school. Admission into the combined degree program in Anthropology and African American Studies is based on mutual agreement between these two departments. Individual students will develop courses of study in consultation with their academic advisers and with the directors of graduate study for both departments. Students in the program must take core courses in Anthropology and in African American Studies, plus related courses in both departments approved by their advisory committees. In addition, they must successfully complete the African American Studies third-year Dissertation Prospectus Workshop (AFAM 895 and AFAM 896). Oral and written qualifying examinations must include two topics in the eld of African American Studies and two topics in Anthropology. The examination committee must include at least one faculty member from each department. The dissertation prospectus must be submitted to the directors of graduate study of both departments and approved by the faculty of both. The thesis readers committee must also include at least one faculty member from each department, and the faculties of both departments must approve its composition.48 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Master's Degrees M.Phil.

ANTH Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China, and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. ANTH 559b / ARCG 559b, Introduction to Experimental Archaeology Roderick McIntosh and Ellery Frahm Experimental archaeology is one of the most important tools to develop and test models that link human behaviors and natural forces to the archaeological record.

Reserved for rst-year doctoral students in Anthropology. Prerequisite: ANTH 500. ANTH 701b, Foundations of Modern Archaeology Richard Burger How method, theory, and social policy have influenced the development of archaeology as a set of methods, an academic discipline, and a political tool. Prerequisite: a background in the basics of archaeology equivalent to one of the introductory courses. ANTH 716La / ARCG 716La, Introduction to Archaeological Laboratory Sciences Sta Introduction to techniques of archaeological laboratory analysis, with quantitative data styles and statistics appropriate to each. Topics include dating of artifacts, sourcing of ancient materials, remote sensing, and microscopic and biochemical analysis. Specic techniques covered vary from year to year. ANTH 718b / ARCG 718b, Archaeological Study of Cra Specialization Anne Underhill In this seminar we evaluate methods for investigating the nature of cra specialization in antiquity. We consider methods to identify material traces of production activities and insights gained from ethnoarchaeological and ethnohistoric data. Several types of cra production are included. Another component of the course is discussion of the theoretical signicance of the nature of cra specialization. ANTH 735b / WGSS 737b, Gendering the Modern Subject Eda Pepi This seminar familiarizes students with how the analytical categories of sex and gender interrogate \"classic\" philosophical texts and restructure key debates on the nature of the human subject as a locus of unmarked, universal reason and purposeful action as well as embodied perception and passion. From Spinoza and Descartes to Hegel and50 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Merleau-Ponty, we engage an overview of the conceptual and historical development of modern, Western ideas of personhood and the emergence of liberalism as the basis of new technologies of the self. We read these texts alongside feminist, critical race, and postcolonial commentaries that highlight the sexual and racial constitution of a seemingly universal subject of modernity. These commentaries trace how practical theories of \"lower\" or minor selves\u2014the subject people of the colonies, slaves, and others\u2014were integral to the very development of ideas of the modern, autonomous, and acting self in the Western world. ANTH 743a / ARCG 743a, Archaeological Research Design and Proposal Development William Honeychurch An eective proposal requires close consideration of all steps of research design, from statement of the problem to data analysis. The course is designed to provide an introduction to the principles by which archaeological research projects are devised and proposed. Students receive intensive training in the preparation of a research proposal with the expectation that the nal proposal will be submitted to national and international granting agencies for consideration. The course is structured around the creation of research questions; hypothesis development and statement of expectations; and the explicit linking of expectations to material patterning, eld methods, and data analysis. Students review and critique examples of funded and nonfunded research proposals and comment extensively on each other's proposals. In addition to developing one's own research, learning to constructively critique the work of colleagues is imperative for becoming a responsible anthropological archaeologist. ANTH 754a / ARCG 754a, Statistics for Archaeological Analysis William Honeychurch An introduction to quantitative data collection, analysis, and argumentation for archaeologists. Lectures, readings, and exercises emphasize the exploration, visualization, and analysis of specically archaeological data using simple statistical approaches. No prior knowledge of statistics is required. ANTH 755b / ARCG 755b, Inca Culture and Society Richard Burger The history and organization of the Inca empire and its impact on the nations and cultures conquered by it. The role of archaeology in understanding the transformation of Andean lifeways is explored, as is the interplay between ethnohistoric and archaeological approaches to the subject. ANTH 756a / ARCG 756a, The Archaeology of Trade and Exchange Richard Burger This seminar focuses on archaeological approaches to exchange and trade. As background, we review some of the principal theories of exchange from anthropology and sociology, such as those of Mauss, Malinowski, and Polanyi. The role of trade and exchange in dierent kinds of societies is examined by contextualizing these transactions within specic cultural congurations and considering the nature of production and consumption as they relate to movement of goods. We consider methods and models that have been used to analyze regions of interaction at dierent spatial scales and the theoretical arguments about the social impact of inter-regional and intra-regional interactions involving the transfer of goods, including approaches such as world systems, unequal development, and globalization. In addition, we examine the ways that have been utilized in archaeology to identify dierent kinds of exchange systems, oen through analogies to well-documented ethnographic and historic cases. Finally, we consider the range of techniques that have been employedAnthropology 51 in order to track the movement of goods across space. These sourcing techniques are evaluated in terms of their advantages and disadvantages from an archaeological perspective, and in terms of how the best technical analyses may vary according to the nature of natural or cultural materials under consideration (ceramics, volcanic stone, metals, etc. . The theme for this year 's seminar is obsidian; students select some aspect of obsidian research for their nal paper and presentation. ANTH 763b / ARCG 763b / NELC 589b, Archaeologies of Empire Harvey Weiss Comparative study of origins, structures, eciencies, and limitations of imperialism, ancient and modern, in the Old and New World, from Akkad to \"Indochine, \" and from Wari to Aztec.

ANTH 776b / ARCG 776b, GIS and Spatial Analysis for Archaeology William Honeychurch Introduction to the practice of Geographical Information Systems in anthropology with attention to archaeological applications. The growing use of GIS among anthropologists has transformed the way we carry out research and conceive of space. The course draws on research examples from a range of theoretical, analytical, and geographical contexts and introduces students to current soware. Emphasis is placed on understanding how anthropological archaeologists have employed GIS as part of generating evidence to assess their hypotheses. ANTH 779b / ARCG 779b, Anthropology of Mobile Societies William Honeychurch The social and cultural signicance of the ways that hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, maritime traders, and members of our own society traverse space. The impact of mobility and transport technologies on subsistence, trade, interaction, and warfare from the rst horse riders of ve thousand years ago to jet-propulsion tourists of today. ANTH 785a / ARCG 785a, Archaeological Ceramics I Sta Ceramics are a rich source of information about a range of topics including ancient technology, cooking practices, cra specialization, regional trade, and religious beliefs. This course provides a foundation for investigating such topics and gaining practical experience in archaeological analysis of ceramics. Students have opportunities to focus on ceramics of particular interest to them, whether these are low-red earthen wares, or porcelains. We discuss ancient pottery production and use made in diverse contexts ranging from households in villages to workshops in cities. In addition we refer to the abundant ethnoarchaeological data about traditional pottery production. ANTH 797b / ARCG 797b, Archaeology of East Asia Anne Underhill Introduction to the ndings and practice of archaeology in China, Japan, Korea, and southeast Asia.

ANTH 848a, Hormones, Behavior, and Life History Claudia Valeggia and Eduardo Fernandez-Duque This seminar focuses on the interaction between hormones and behavior from an evolutionary and developmental perspective. We begin with an overview of general principles of endocrine physiology. The course then focuses, from a life history perspective, on how hormones aect the brain and body throughout development. We explore human sexuality and reproduction, energy metabolism, parenting, stress, social interactions, and aective disorders. We also cover eld and laboratory endocrinology methods. ANTH 852b / AMST 852b / WGSS 852b, Reading the Americas, Reading Ethnography Ana Ramos-Zayas The course uses ethnographic approaches to understand \"America\" as a hemispheric formation, while simultaneously examining \"ethnography\" as methodological, epistemological, and representational cra. Complemented by critical readings and seminar discussions about some of the trademarks of ethnographic research\u2014e.g., participant observation, life history, eld notes, and eld sites\u2014the course is designed to encourage students to interrogate the theoretical and methodological models that have been used in the production of knowledge about the Americas. Emphasizing ethnography's concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a \"how to\" course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of eldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the eld; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. ANTH 861b, Love and Relationships: An Evolutionary Perspective Eduardo Fernandez-Duque Across the world, relationships between men and women shape the structure and functioning of human societies. Whether as friendship, love, or marriage, a man and a woman develop a relationship between them that is special, dierent from the relationship that they have with other adults in the community. Psychologists, historians, poets, anthropologists, artists, biologists, economists have all testied to this ubiquitous phenomenon. There is a bond, an attachment between them, and there isAnthropology 53 some implicit or explicit commitment to share space, time, resources, ospring, and labor. ANTH 864b / ARCG 864b, Human Osteology Eric Sargis A lecture and laboratory course focusing on the characteristics of the human skeleton and its use in studies of functional morphology, paleodemography, and paleopathology.

See the description under Non-Degree-Granting Programs, Councils, and Research Institutes for course requirements, and http://peb.yale.edu for more information about the benets of this program and application instructions. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree The student plans a course of study in consultation with faculty advisers (the student's advisory committee). There are a minimum of ve core courses, two electives, and58 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 two Special Investigations (APHY 990 ), for a total of nine graded term courses. Core courses will be chosen from four groups: two from the QM group, and one from each of the other groups. Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS 508), Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 608), and Electromagnetic Theory I (PHYS 502) will be default courses from their groups, with place-up option to others in the QM and E&M groups based on passing the Physics department exam. There will be no placing out of the required seven courses, except for incoming students with master's or equivalent degrees, who are allowed to place out of three core courses. The core groups are as follows: Group 1 (QM, two courses required): Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS 508)*; Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 608)*; Quantum Information (APHY 601 ); Quantum (APHY 691 ). Group (E&M, one course required): Electromagnetic Theory I (PHYS 502)*; Principles of Optics with Applications (APHY 675 ); Techniques of Microwave Measurements and FR Design (APHY 816 ). Group 3 (CM Physics, one course required): Solid State Physics I (APHY 548 ); Solid State Physics II (APHY 549 ); Statistical Physics I (PHYS 512); Introduction to Light- Matter Interactions (APHY 676 ). Group 4 (one course required): Mathematical Methods of Physics (PHYS 506); Solid State Physics II (APHY 549 ); Principles of Optics with Appliations (APHY 675 ); Noise, Dissipation, Amplication, and ). *PHYS 508, PHYS 608, and PHYS 502 are default courses requiring place-up exam in order to choose other courses from these groups. Any of the courses from these groups not taken to meet core requirements may be taken as electives. Students who place up from a required course and prefer not to take any of the other courses in that group to satisfy the core requirement may petition the director of graduate studies (DGS) to substitute a dierent elective. Electives may be widely chosen, but will typically come from the following: Mesoscopic Physics I (APHY 634 ); Introduction to Superconductivity (APHY 633 ); Quantum Many-Body Theory (APHY 610 ); Theory of Solids I, II (APHY 650 , APHY 651 ); Statistical Physics II (APHY 628 ); Nonlinear Optics and Lasers (APHY 679 ); Materials Topics (course number TBD); Biological Physics 523); Introduction to Dynamical Systems in Biology (PHYS 561). Students may also petition the DGS to substitute an elective not on the standard list. The required seven courses are just the minimum, and students are strongly encouraged to take additional courses that are centrally related to their Ph.D. research. The DGS will work with students and their advisers to ensure that students are prepared for success in their eld of research. Students must take Responsible Conduct in Research for Physical Scientists (APHY 590 ), which discusses ethics and responsible conduct in scientic research and fullls the requirement stipulated by the National Science Foundation for all students and for all postdoctoral researchers funded by the NSF. Note that APHY 590 may not be used to fulll the nine-course requirement.Applied Physics 59 Each term, the faculty review the overall performance of the student and report their ndings to the director of graduate studies (DGS), who determines whether the student may continue toward the Ph.D. degree. By the end of the second term, it is expected that a faculty member has agreed to accept the student as a research assistant. By December 5 of the third year, an area examination must be passed and a written prospectus submitted before dissertation research is begun. These events result in the student's admission to candidacy. Subsequently, the student will report orally each year to the full advisory committee on progress. When the research is nearing completion, but before the thesis writing has commenced, the full advisory committee will advise the student on the thesis plan. A nal oral presentation of the dissertation research is required to be given during term time. There is no foreign language requirement. Teaching experience is regarded as an integral part of the graduate training program at Yale University, and all Applied Physics graduate students are required to serve as a Teaching Fellow for one term, typically during year two. Teaching duties normally involve assisting in laboratories or discussion sections and grading papers and are not expected to require more than ten hours per week. Students are not permitted to teach during the rst year of study. Students whose advisers experience disruption in funding may require additional support from Yale. In these cases, students will be required to teach for up to an additional two terms, but would not be required to teach more than three terms over their rst ve years. If a student was admitted to the program having earned a score of less than 26 on the Speaking Section of the Internet-based TOEFL, the student will be required to take an English as a Second Language (ESL) course each term at Yale until the Graduate School's Oral English Prociency standard has been met. This must be achieved by the end of the third year in order for the student to remain in good standing. Honors Requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's Honors requirement in at least two term courses (excluding Special Investigations) by the end of the second term of full-time study. An extension of one term may be granted at the discretion of the DGS. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) To qualify for the M.S., the student must pass eight term courses; no more than two may be Special Investigations. An average grade of at least High Pass is required, with at least one grade of Honors. Terminal Master's Degree Program Students may also be admitted directly to a terminal master's degree program. The requirements are the same as for the M.S. en route to the Ph.D., although there are no core course requirements for students in this program. This program is normally completed in one year, but a part-time program may be spread over as many as four years. Some courses are available in the evening, to suit the needs of students from local industry.

Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. ARCG 559b / ANTH 559b, Introduction to Experimental Archaeology Roderick McIntosh and Ellery Frahm Experimental archaeology is one of the most important tools to develop and test models that link human behaviors and natural forces to the archaeological record. This class explores the elements of good experimental design and procedures. ARCG 581a / CLSS 890a / HSAR 581a, Roman Painting: Achievement and Legacy Diana Kleiner Roman mural painting in all its aspects and innovations. Individual scenes and complete ensembles in palaces, villas, and houses in Rome and Pompeii are explored, as are their rediscovery and revival in the Renaissance and neoclassical period. Special attention is paid to the four architectural styles; history and mythological painting; the impact of the theater; the part played by landscape, genre, and still life; the accidental survival of painted portraiture; and the discovery and rejection of trompe l'oeil illusionism and linear perspective. ARCG The Ancient Egyptian Temple as Cosmos: Correlation of Architecture and Decoration Program Christina Geisen The course focuses on the correlation of archaeology, iconography, and philology by analyzing ancient Egyptian temples under the specic consideration of the interplay of architecture and decoration program. The dierent types of temples and their developments over time are discussed. The main focus is the function of each temple type, which can only be understood by analyzing the architecture of the monument, its decoration program, related texts (such as rituals, myths, and festival description, but also historical texts), and its place in the cultic landscape of the specic location. The class also provides an overview of rituals performed and festivals celebrated in the temples, as well as of the administrative sphere of the temple. Optional eld trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to see the Temple of Dendur. No previous64 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture or languages is necessary; all texts are read in translation.

ARCG 716La / ANTH 716La, Introduction to Archaeological Laboratory Sciences Sta Introduction to techniques of archaeological laboratory analysis, with quantitative data styles and statistics appropriate to each. Topics include dating of artifacts, sourcing of ancient materials, remote sensing, and microscopic and biochemical analysis. Specic techniques covered vary from year to year. ARCG 718b / ANTH 718b, Archaeological Study of Cra Specialization Anne Underhill In this seminar we evaluate methods for investigating the nature of cra specialization in antiquity. We consider methods to identify material traces of production activities and insights gained from ethnoarchaeological and ethnohistoric data. Several types of cra production are included. Another component of the course is discussion of the theoretical signicance of the nature of cra specialization. ARCG 743a / ANTH 743a, Archaeological Research Design and Proposal Development William Honeychurch An eective proposal requires close consideration of all steps of research design, from statement of the problem to data analysis. The course is designed to provide an introduction to the principles by which archaeological research projects are devised and proposed. Students receive intensive training in the preparation of a research proposal with the expectation that the nal proposal will be submitted to national and international granting agencies for consideration. The course is structured around the creation of research questions; hypothesis development and statement of expectations; and the explicit linking of expectations to material patterning, eld methods, and data analysis. Students review and critique examples of funded and nonfunded research proposals and comment extensively on each other's proposals. In addition to developing one's own research, learning to constructively critique the work of colleagues is imperative for becoming a responsible anthropological archaeologist. ARCG 744a / NELC 509a, The Age of Akhenaton John Darnell Study of the period of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton (reigned 1353-1336 B.C.E.), oen termed the Amarna Revo lution, from historical, literary, religiou s, artistic, and archaeological perspectives.

The role of archaeology in understanding the transformation of Andean lifeways is explored, as is the interplay between ethnohistoric and archaeological approaches to the subject. ARCG 756a / ANTH 756a, The Archaeology of Trade and Exchange Richard Burger This seminar focuses on archaeological approaches to exchange and trade. As background, we review some of the principal theories of exchange from anthropology and sociology, such as those of Mauss, Malinowski, and Polanyi. The role of trade and exchange in dierent kinds of societies is examined by contextualizing these transactions within specic cultural congurations and considering the nature of production and consumption as they relate to movement of goods. We consider methods and models that have been used to analyze regions of interaction at dierent spatial scales and the theoretical arguments about the social impact of inter-regional and intra-regional interactions involving the transfer of goods, including approaches such as world systems, unequal development, and globalization. In addition, we examine the ways that have been utilized in archaeology to identify dierent kinds of exchange systems, oen through analogies to well-documented ethnographic and historic cases. Finally, we consider the range of techniques that have been employed in order to track the movement of goods across space. These sourcing techniques are evaluated in terms of their advantages and disadvantages from an archaeological perspective, and in terms of how the best technical analyses may vary according to the nature of natural or cultural materials under consideration (ceramics, volcanic stone, metals, etc.). The theme for this year's seminar is obsidian; students select some aspect of obsidian research for their nal paper and presentation. ARCG 762b / EMD 548b / F&ES 726 / G&G 562b, Observing Earth from Space Ronald Smith A practical introduction to satellite image analysis of Earth's surface.

ARCG 776b / ANTH 776b, GIS and Spatial Analysis for Archaeology William Honeychurch Introduction to the practice of Geographical Information Systems in anthropology with attention to archaeological applications. The growing use of GIS among anthropologists has transformed the way we carry out research and conceive of space. The course draws on research examples from a range of theoretical, analytical, and geographical contexts and introduces students to current soware. Emphasis is placed on understanding how anthropological archaeologists have employed GIS as part of generating evidence to assess their hypotheses. ARCG 779b / ANTH 779b, Anthropology of Mobile Societies William Honeychurch The social and cultural signicance of the ways that hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, maritime traders, and members of our own society traverse space. The impact of mobility and transport technologies on subsistence, trade, interaction, and warfare from the rst horse riders of ve thousand years ago to jet-propulsion tourists of today. ARCG 785a / ANTH 785a, Archaeological Ceramics I Sta Ceramics are a rich source of information about a range of topics including ancient technology, cooking practices, cra specialization, regional trade, and religious beliefs. This course provides a foundation for investigating such topics and gaining practical experience in archaeological analysis of ceramics. Students have opportunities to focus on ceramics of particular interest to them, whether these are low-red earthen wares, or porcelains. We discuss ancient pottery production and use made in diverse contexts ranging from households in villages to workshops in cities. In addition we refer to the abundant ethnoarchaeological data about traditional pottery production. ARCG 797b / ANTH 797b, Archaeology of East Asia Anne Underhill Introduction to the ndings and practice of archaeology in China, Japan, Korea, and southeast Asia. Methods used by archaeologists to interpret social organization, economic organization, and ritual life.

It aims chiefly, however, to educate teachers capable of eectively instructing future architects in the history of their own eld and its manifold connections with the culture at large. The program forges a unique combination of professional knowledge with a historical and analytical grasp of key phases in the history of architecture, especially those that have a demonstrable share in the eld's current state and the critical issues it faces. The program secures sound training in historical study and historiography, imparting technical knowledge and awareness of intellectual trends that inform the reception and role of architecture around the world. The history of science and technology (as well as its reception in popular culture and the arts), the history of media, and an understanding of architectural practice are as important as the ne arts and literature. Admission Requirements Applicants must have appropriate academic credentials (a master's degree or equivalent in Architecture, Engineering, Environmental Design, or, exceptionally, in a related eld). Two years of professional work in an architecture oce are recommended. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test taken no more than ve years prior to application is required. All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT), a test that includes a section on spoken English. The TOEFL requirement may be waived only for applicants who, prior to matriculation at Yale, will have received a baccalaureate degree or its international equivalent from a college or university where English is the primary language of instruction. Applicants must have studied in residence at the baccalaureate institution for at least three years to receive the waiver. A68 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 waiver will not be granted on the basis of an advanced degree (such as M.A., M.S., or Ph.D.) from any institution. In addition to meeting qualifying criteria, candidates are required as part of the application to submit a portfolio of their own architectural work, a writing sample in the form of a substantial research paper or publication, and an explanation of their motivation for engaging in this course of study. Qualied applicants may be invited to interview with a member of the doctoral faculty. The portfolio should be a well-edited representation of the applicant's creative work. Portfolios may not contain videos. Anything submitted that is not entirely the applicant's own work must be clearly identied as such. The portfolio is submitted digitally as a single pdf document optimized not to exceed 20mb; it will need to be uploaded to the online application. Pages of the pdf portfolio should be uploaded as spreads. The digital portfolio will be viewed on computer screens, so resolution above 150 dpi is not necessary. The Ph.D. program is administered by the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. For questions regarding admissions, please contact graduate.admissions@yale.edu. School of Architecture Summer Preparation Courses for Incoming Ph.D. Students In the week before the beginning of the School of Architecture fall term, the School of Architecture oers two preparation courses that are required of incoming Ph.D. students. Summer Digital Media Orientation Course. This half-day orientation covers accessing the School's servers, use of the School's equipment, and the School's digital media policies and procedures. Arts Library Research Methodology Course. This course covers research methodologies and tools specic to the Ph.D. curriculum. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Entering students with sound professional preparation engage in a concerted course of study that leads directly to dissertation research and a doctoral degree. Students are required to be full-time and in residence in the New Haven area during the rst three academic years. (See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations.) Students take twelve graduate and Ph.D. seminars for credit, including a Ph.D. seminar taught in each of the rst four terms by a member of the School of Architecture faculty that introduces the student to various methodologies and areas of study. Some seminars encourage primary research on a narrow topic or focus on producing a collective body of work. Others oer a broader survey of historiographies or focus on the close reading of a body of texts. These four required seminars form the methodological core of the program. Students are encouraged to take courses related to their specic areas of interest outside the School of Architecture. For example, a student working on Italian modernism would be encouraged to take a course in Italian history or literature. Typically, at least two of the eight elective seminars would be in related elds. Students can also opt toArchitecture 69 do independent readings with individual faculty members on their specic areas of interest. Not later than the end of their second year, students are also expected to demonstrate competence in at least one foreign language relevant to their eld of study. Language competence is more than a formality and requires some acquaintance with the literature in the chosen language. Competency may be determined by a grade of B or better in a yearlong intermediate-level language course, or through examination. The student's eld of interest is dened by the end of the second year, at which time the director of doctoral studies assigns the student an adviser, who may or may not be from the School of Architecture. At the end of the second year and aer the student has taken the three oral examinations, the director of doctoral studies, in consultation with the student's adviser, appoints a dissertation committee for the student. The dissertation committee consists of the student's adviser plus two additional faculty members. One of the dissertation committee members should be from outside the School of Architecture, with selection based on the student's area of interest. The dissertation committee guides and monitors the student's progress in writing the dissertation and evaluates the dissertation upon completion. By the end of their second year, doctoral students normally complete all course and language requirements. Oral examinations are taken on topics relevant to the student's doctoral research. Examiners question the candidate in the presence of the director of doctoral studies and the thesis adviser. During the third year, candidates present and defend a preliminary proposal for a dissertation topic, consisting of a topic statement, detailed program of research, and an annotated bibliography. By the end of the third year, students begin dissertation research and writing, submitting dras of the dissertation chapters as they are completed. While this is a ve-year program, if the dissertation has not been completed by the end of year ve and, at that time, the program certies that the candidate will complete the dissertation by August of the following academic year, the candidate may be eligible in year six for a teaching position and funding for up to an additional nine months. Graduate Research Assistant and Teaching Fellow Experience The program in Architecture considers teaching to be an important part of graduate training. Students in the Ph.D. program in Architecture, therefore, are expected to teach for four terms, normally in their third and fourth years. During these four terms, it is anticipated that a Ph.D. student teach in two history and theory survey courses in the student's area of study at the School of Architecture or elsewhere in the University and teach in two design studios at the School of Architecture. Each teaching assignment shall be under the direct supervision of senior faculty. Master's Degree M.Phil. The Master of Philosophy degree is awarded en route to the Ph.D. The minimum requirements for this degree are that a student has completed70 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 all requirements for the Ph.D., except the teaching fellow assignments and the dissertation. Required Courses All Ph.D. students are required to take the following courses.

Special Admissions Requirements Applicants are expected to have a strong undergraduate preparation in physics and mathematics. Although some formal training in astronomy is useful, it is by no means a prerequisite for admission. Applicants are required to take the General GRE as well as the subject test in Physics. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree A typical program of study includes twelve courses taken during the rst four terms, and must include the core courses listed below: The Physics of Astrophysics (ASTR 500), Computational Methods in Astrophysics and Geophysics (ASTR 520), Observational Astronomy (ASTR 555), Interstellar Matter and Star Formation (ASTR 560), either Stellar Populations (ASTR 510) or Stellar Astrophysics (ASTR 550), and either Galaxies (ASTR 530) or The Evolving Universe (ASTR 565). ASTR 620 or PHYS 678 may be substituted for ASTR 520 with the permission of the director of graduate studies (DGS). Students require the permission of the instructor and the DGS to skip a core class if they think that they have sucient knowledge of the eld. Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge of the eld before they are allowed to skip any core class. Two of the twelve courses must be research credits, each earned by working in close collaboration with a faculty member. Of the two research credits, one must be earned doing a theoretical research project and one doing an experimental research project.72 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 The students need to present the results of the project as a written report and will be given an evaluation of their performance. The choice of the four remaining courses depends on the candidate's interest and background and must be decided in consultation with the DGS and/or the prospective thesis adviser. Advisers may require students to take particular classes and obtain a specied minimum grade in order for a student to work with them for their thesis. Students must take any additional course that their supervisors require even aer their fourth term. In addition, all students, regardless of their term of study, have to attend Professional Seminar (ASTR 710 and ASTR 711) every term. Students must also take Responsible Conduct in Research for Physical Scientists (PHYS 590), which discusses ethics and responsible conduct in scientic research and fullls the requirement stipulated by the National Science Foundation for all students and for all postdoctoral researchers funded by the NSF. Note that ASTR 710, ASTR 711, and PHYS 590 may not be used to fulll the twelve-course requirement. Students are encouraged to take graduate courses in physics or related subjects. On an irregular basis, special topic courses and seminars are oered, which provide the opportunity to study some elds in greater depth than is possible in standard courses. To achieve both breadth and depth in their education, students are encouraged to take a few courses beyond their second year of study. There is no foreign language requirement. A written comprehensive examination, normally taken at the end of the fourth term of graduate work, tests the student's familiarity with the entire eld of astronomy and related branches of physics and mathematics. Particular attention will be paid to the student's performance in the eld in which the student plans to do research. An oral examination, held a few weeks aer the written examination, is based on the student's chosen eld of research. Satisfactory performance in these examinations, an acceptable record in course and research work, and an approved dissertation prospectus are required for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation should present the results of an original and thorough investigation, worthy of publication. Most importantly, it should reflect the candidate's capacity for independent research. An oral dissertation defense is required. Teaching experience is an integral part of graduate education in astronomy. All students are required to serve as teaching fellows for four terms. Both the level of teaching assignments and the scheduling of teaching are variable and largely determined by the needs of the department. Most students will teach in each of their rst three terms and complete their fourth teaching assignment sometime aer the qualifying exam. Honors Requirement Students must earn a grade of Honors in at least three classes by the end of the fourth term of full-time study and have a grade average of High Pass or better. Master's Degrees M.Phil. Upon application, the department will recommend for the award of the M.Phil. degree any student who has completed all the requirements of the Ph.D. degree except the oral examination, which is based on the student's chosen eld of research, and the Ph.D. dissertation. A written master's thesis containing original astronomical research is also required. Students are not admitted for this degree.Astronomy 73 M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) Upon application, the department will recommend for the award of the M.S. degree any student who has taken at least ten courses (not including ASTR 710 and ASTR 711), including at least one research project (ASTR 580). The student should have a grade average of High Pass in the courses and a grade of High Pass or above in the research project.

Special Admissions Requirements An undergraduate major in the biological sciences is recommended. GRE General Test is required; GRE Subject Test is recommended (in Biology or in Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology). To enter the Ph.D. program, students apply to an interest-based track, usually the Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics, and Development (MCGD) track or the Biochemistry, Quantitative Biology, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BQBS) track,Cell Biology 77 within the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students are required to take at least ve graduate-level courses. No specic curriculum of courses is required, but CBIO 602 (Molecular Cell Biology) is recommended for all students to attain a solid foundation in molecular cell biology. Also recommended is a seminar course, such as CBIO 603 (Seminar in Molecular Cell Biology), in which students can develop the skill for critical analysis of research papers. Students design their own curriculum of courses to meet individual interests and needs, in consultation with the director of graduate studies. During the rst year, students participate in three laboratory rotations. In the second year, a committee of faculty members determines whether each student is qualied to continue in the Ph.D. program. There is an oral qualifying examination by the end of the third term. In order to be admitted to candidacy, students must have met the Graduate School Honors requirement, maintained a High Pass average in course work, passed the qualifying examination, submitted an approved prospectus, and received a positive evaluation of their laboratory work from the thesis committee. All students are required to present a talk at the departmental progress report series each year aer passing the qualifying exam. The remaining degree requirements include completion of the dissertation project and the writing of the dissertation and its oral defense, the formal submission of copies of the written dissertation to the Graduate School, and the deposit of an additional copy with the department. Laboratory rotations and thesis research may be conducted outside of the department. An important aspect of graduate training in cell biology is the acquisition of teaching skills through participation in courses appropriate for the student's scientic interests. These opportunities can be drawn from a diverse menu of lecture, laboratory, and seminar courses given at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels. Ph.D. students are required to participate in two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching. Students are not expected to teach during their rst year. In addition to all other requirements, students must successfully complete CBIO 901 (First-Year Introduction to Research\u2014Ethics: Scientic Integrity in Biomedical Research) prior to the end of their rst year of study. In their fourth year of study, all students must successfully complete B&BS 503 (RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students). M.D./Ph.D. Students M.D./Ph.D. students are required to take a total of ve graduate-level courses for a grade, including the CBIO 500 /CBIO 501 /CBIO 502 sequence (Molecules to Systems; three terms, counts as one course), CBIO 602 (Molecular Cell Biology), and a seminar course that involves the reading and class discussion of research papers. The remaining courses can be in areas such as Genetics, Neuroscience, Immunology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. Students must meet the Graduate School requirement of a grade of Honors in two courses, if necessary taking additional courses beyond the ve required in the department to fulll this requirement. Students must also maintain an average grade of High Pass in all courses. One term of teaching is required.78 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Master's Degrees M.Phil.

Classics and History The combined degree program in Classics and History, with a concentration in Ancient History, is oered by the Departments of Classics and History for students wishing to pursue graduate study in the history of the ancient Mediterranean and westernClassics 95 Eurasia. Prospective students may apply through either the Department of History or the Department of Classics. The combined degree in Classics and History oers students a comprehensive education in the fundamental skills and most current methodologies in the study of the ancient Greek and Roman Mediterranean and its interaction with Eurasian and African cultures and landscapes. Its object is to train leaders in research and teaching by preparing them to handle the basic materials of ancient history through mastery of the traditional linguistic and technical skills. At the same time the combined degree in Classics and History encourages students to rediscover, reshape, and repurpose traditional and nontraditional source materials using the most up-to-date and sophisticated tools at the historian's disposal. Students are called on to complete course work in two ancient languages, historical theory, intra- and interdisciplinary skills, and fundamental research seminars. Interdisciplinary expertise is fostered through the annual seminar coordinated through the Yale Program for the Study of Ancient and Premodern Cultures and Societies (Archaia) and through required study in ancillary elds. Exams are rigorous and aimed at helping students hone skills and explore new terrain in ancient studies. Students are encouraged to take advantage of Yale's superior collections and library resources in order to explore new avenues in their learning and approaches to historical problems. Yale's outstanding faculty in Classics, History, and related disciplines, such as Near Eastern languages and cultures, religious studies, art history, and anthropology, work together to ensure broad and deep learning that will enable our students to become world leaders in the eld. Admission Requirements Prerequisites for admission through the Department of Classics are the same as for admission to the Classics degree program, i.e., the equivalent of three years (four preferred) of college training in one of the classical languages and two years (three preferred) in the other. Prerequisites for admission through the Department of History are the equivalent of three years (four preferred) of college training in one of the classical languages and two years in another ancient language, not necessarily Greek or Latin. Requirements for the Combined Ph.D. Degree in Classics and History 1.A minimum of fourteen term courses, including: (i) the historical methods and theory course, Approaching History (HIST 500); (ii) Archaia core seminar (CLSS 815 or equivalent); (iii) two graduate-level courses in two separate ancient languages. For students who are admitted in Classics, these must be Greek and Latin. Students who are admitted in History must study either Greek or Latin, and they may study both but may also choose another ancient language to fulll this requirement. The surveys of Greek and Latin literature oered by Classics are encouraged but not mandatory for fulllment of this requirement; (iv) two skills courses. These may include topics selected from epigraphy (epigraphy courses may be used to fulll the language requirement concurrently); archaeology; art history; papyrology; numismatics; digital data, GIS, digital humanities, vel sim.; an advanced course in a non-classical ancient language (no more than one such course may be used in fulllment of this requirement). Students are96 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 also encouraged to take advantage of educational opportunities outside of Yale (American Numismatic Society Summer Seminar; an archaeological excavation, e.g., the Gabii project); (v) four courses (at least two of which must be research seminars) in the history of the ancient Mediterranean world; historical courses that have a heavy skill component may be used concurrently to fulll the skills requirement; (vi) two courses outside of ancient Mediterranean history that cover two separate disciplinary areas. These courses will be in the history of dierent periods or dierent regions, or in other disciplines of the humanities or social sciences outside of history, or in the physical sciences. Possibilities include (but are not limited to): social sciences (economics, anthropology, sociology, environmental science, statistics); religion (religious studies, Divinity School, Jewish studies); law (history of law, comparative law, international law); Near Eastern languages and civilizations (Egyptian language, Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic); anthropology and archaeology (cultural anthropology, archaeological sciences); physical and biological sciences (paleoclimatology, ecology and forestry, genetics, medicine). 2.Classics proseminar oering an introduction to the discipline of Classics and its various subdisciplines, to be taken in the rst year in residence (not for credit). 3.Reading examinations in German, and in either French or Italian.

Greek and Latin examinations will be based on the Ancient History Greek and Latin reading lists and will consist of four passages in each language, at least one of which will be poetry and one documentary (epigraphy/papyrology). Some History students may nd that expertise in another language\u2014such as Hebrew, Aramaic/Syriac, Demotic, Coptic, Classical Armenian, or Sanskrit\u2014is most benecial for their research and teaching trajectory. Reading lists for these non-classical languages will be devised by the student in collaboration with the faculty adviser and other relevant member(s) of the Yale faculty, and xed in writing no later than the end of the fourth term in residence. Examinations in these languages will also consist of four passages to be set and evaluated by faculty expert in the given language. Translation exams in all languages must be taken at the beginning of the h term in residence. 5.A general examination in Ancient History during the third year and no later than the end of the sixth term in residence. This is to be broken into one major and two minor elds. For the major eld students must prepare an 8,000-word essay in advance of the oral examination. For each of the minor elds, students must prepare a syllabus for an undergraduate class. The written essays and syllabi must be submitted by a xed date, typically on the Friday before Thanksgiving or spring break. Oral exams will be completed shortly aerward to ensure time for the completion of the dissertation prospectus. 6.A dissertation prospectus by the end of the sixth term in residence. 7.A dissertation. All students at the end of each term of dissertation research and writing will present their work in progress in a \"chapter colloquium,\" which will mimic the prospectus defense in format (i.e., a discussion with interested faculty ofClassics 97 a presubmitted chunk of written work).

Raymond Clemens Latin paleography from the fourth century CE to ca. 1500. Topics include the history and development of national hands; the introduction and evolution of Caroline minuscule, pre-gothic, gothic, and humanist scripts (both cursive and book hands); the production, circulation, and transmission of texts (primarily Latin, with reference to Greek and Middle English); advances in the technical analysis and digital manipulation of manuscripts. Seminars are based on the examination of codices and fragments in the Beinecke Library; students select a manuscript for class presentation and nal paper. CLSS 602b / MDVL 563b, Advanced Latin Paleography Barbara Shailor The challenges of using hand-produced Latin manuscripts in research, with an emphasis on texts from the late Middle Ages. Gothic cursive scripts and book hands ca. 1200-ca. 1500; fragments of unidentied codices; complex or composite codices with heavy interlinear and marginal annotations. Manuscripts and fragments selected largely from collections in the Beinecke Library. Prerequisite: CLSS 601 or permission of the instructor. CLSS 605a, Greek Papyrology Ann Hanson Literary and documentary papyri of Greek and Roman Egypt, concentrating on documents housed in the Beinecke Library from the late Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Topics include using papyri as sources for social and other histories; gaining familiarity with the language of the papyri; and the reading of literary and documentary hands. CLSS 645a / HIST 507a, Roman Numismatics Benjamin Hellings An introduction to the history of ancient coinage and the modern methodology of numismatic study. Brief consideration of the Greek background is followed by detailed treatment of the Roman republic and empire, with particular attention to the Roman provinces. CLSS 811a / ARCG 611a / NELC The Ancient Egyptian Temple as Cosmos: Correlation of Architecture and Decoration Program Christina Geisen The course focuses on the correlation of archaeology, iconography, and philology by analyzing ancient Egyptian temples under the specic consideration of the interplay of architecture and decoration program. The dierent types of temples and their developments over time are discussed. The main focus is the function of each temple type, which can only be understood by analyzing the architecture of the monument, its decoration program, related texts (such as rituals, myths, and festival description, but also historical texts), and its place in the cultic landscape of the specic location. The class also provides an overview of rituals performed and festivals celebrated in the temples, as well as of the administrative sphere of the temple. Optional eld trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to see the Temple of Dendur. No previous knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture or languages is necessary; all texts are read in translation. CLSS Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China,Classics 101 and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. CLSS 830a, Beauty Pauline LeVen This seminar concentrates on the ancient Greek discourse on beauty, from Homer to the period known as the Second Sophistic. Weekly discussions of ancient Greek texts (Homer, archaic lyric poetry, Plato, Xenophon, Philostratus, Dio Chrysostom, Greek novels) and critical literature on the topic focus on the following themes: beauty and the body; beauty and the senses; beauty and the good; beauty and the arts; beauty and the beasts. Prerequisite: knowledge of ancient Greek. Students with no knowledge of Greek interested in taking the course should contact the instructor. CLSS 847a / HIST 508a, Climate, Environment, and Ancient History Joseph Manning An overview of recent work in paleoclimatology with an emphasis on new climate proxy records and how they are or can be used in historical analysis. We examine in detail several recent case studies at the nexus of climate and history. Attention is paid to critiques of recent work as well as trends in the eld. CLSS 861b / HIST 503b, Recent Trends, Current Problems, and New Approaches to Ancient History Joseph Manning Current trends in the eld and an examination of recent work, new theory, and new material. An overview of theory and method in ancient history. Each week is devoted to a case study or a recent monograph in the eld. CLSS 865b / PHIL 748b, Plato's Theaetetus Verity Harte and David Charles The class reads and discusses the Greek text of Plato's Theaetetus, a central work of Plato's philosophy and an important work in the history of philosophy. Focused on the nature of knowledge, the dialogue is notable for a series of arguments involving central notions of Plato's philosophy: knowledge, denition, perception, false judgment. The class is a core course for the combined Ph.D. program in Classics and Philosophy. The course is open to all graduate students in Philosophy or Classics who have suitable preparation in Attic Greek and some prior knowledge of ancient philosophy. Others interested in taking or attending the class must have prior permission of the instructors. Undergraduates are not normally admitted. CLSS 877a / CPLT 556a / RLST 613a, Rhetorics of the Ancient World Michal Beth Dinkler and Irene Peirano This interdisciplinary course takes as its starting point Greco-Roman rhetoric as a codied system and explores its relevance for contemporary interpretation of ancient texts. Moving back and forth between rhetoric as a set of norms and rhetoric as a condition of discourse, we engage with contemporary rhetorical studies in Classics and Biblical studies. Topics include rhetoric and narrative, exemplarity and imitation across the literary and spiritual realms, \"anti-rhetoricism,\" embedded rhetorical performances (e.g., speeches, oratory, etc.), and nonverbal forms of persuasion (e.g., visual, emotional, etc.).102 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 CLSS 881a, Proseminar: Classical Studies Milette Gaifman An introduction to the bibliography and disciplines of classical scholarship. Faculty address larger questions of method and theory, as well as specialized subdisciplines such as linguistics, papyrology, epigraphy, paleography, and numismatics. Required of all entering graduate CLSS 886a / PHIL 741a, What Is Aristotelian Hylomorphism? David Charles The aim of the seminar is to examine the extent to which Aristotle's version of hylomorphism as applied to psychological phenomena (such as the emotions, desire, perception, and thought) was modied and criticized by later philosophers. We assess the hypothesis that Aristotle's discussion of these issues was substantially modied by later philosophers and commentators in such a way as to set up (1) contemporary versions of hylomorphism and (2) the mind/body problem as formulated by Descartes. CLSS 887b / PHIL 746b, Cicero and Ancient Ethics: The Dialogue On Moral Ends (De nibus bonorum et malorum ) Brad Inwood Cicero's most important and influential work on moral philosophy is the dialogue On Moral Ends (De nibus bonorum et malorum ). Written within the general framework of eudaimonism, the dialogue expounds on and criticizes the ethical theory of three contemporary schools: Epicurean, Stoic, and Peripatetic. On Moral Ends presents important debates in ethics, gives us extensive evidence for Hellenistic philosophy in general, and had signicant influence on moral theory in the early modern period. We read the entire dialogue, with more emphasis on the Stoic (books 3-4) and Peripatetic (book 5) debates than on the Epicurean (books 1-2). In class we work predominantly from the translation by Raphael Woolf, but Latin readers are expected to read key parts of the dialogue in Latin as well; there will be a separate meeting for discussion of issues that arise from the Latin text. Prerequisite: graduate enrollment in Philosophy or Classics, or permission of the instructor. CLSS 889b, Greek Epigraphy Fran\u00e7ois Gerardin This course provides an introduction to Greek epigraphy\u2014the study of inscriptions written in ancient Greek\u2014its methods, scholarship, and aims. Key texts from the corpus are translated, analyzed, and discussed in class. We read some inscriptions in verse (\"metric inscriptions\") along with prose texts. Themes for discussion are linguistic (literacy, dialects, multilingualism) and/or historical (education, law, mythography). The course also oers essential preparation for texts included in the Combined Program in Classics and History reading list. CLSS 890a / ARCG 581a / HSAR 581a, Roman Painting: Achievement and Legacy Diana Kleiner Roman mural painting in all its aspects and innovations. Individual scenes and complete ensembles in palaces, villas, and houses in Rome and Pompeii are explored, as are their rediscovery and revival in the Renaissance and neoclassical period. Special attention is paid to the four architectural styles; history and mythological painting; the impact of the theater; the part played by landscape, genre, and still life; the accidental survival of painted portraiture; and the discovery and rejection of trompe l'oeil illusionism and linear perspective. CLSS 892b, Narrative and Vision Kirk Freudenburg This seminar explores the theory and practice of image production (enargeia, descriptio: the production of a full visual presence through verbal means) in ancient epic, withClassics 103 special focus on the narratological ends to which the poet's special \"visualizing eects\" are the means. The main epic poet studied is Vergil, but accounting for his visual practices requires a much fuller accounting of enargeia in the various \"visualizing\" poetic traditions to which he refers (especially Homer, Lucretius, and Catullus); in rhetoric, both its theory and practice (Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian); in historiography (Livy and Tacitus); and in other \"actual\" visual media such as wall paintings, sculpture, and architecture. We look at the related topics of ekphrasis, Roman concepts of \"nobility\" and \"spectacle,\" and to further developments in the production of visualization in the epics of Ovid, Statius, Lucan, and Valerius Flaccus, as well as to the of lm narratology (Bordwell, Greek Literature I Egbert Bakker A comprehensive treatment of Greek literature from Homer to the imperial period, with an emphasis on archaic and Hellenistic poetry. The course prepares for the comprehensive oral qualifying examinations. The student is expected to read extensively in the original language, working toward familiarity with the range and variety of the literature.

GREK 750a, Euripides's Late Tragedies Egbert Bakker Close reading of three late plays of Euripides, Helen, Ion, and Iphigenia in Tauris. Class discussion focuses on Euripides's literary and dramatic technique and on the issues of myth, geography, as well as cultural and personal identity in these tragedies. We also consider how the plays (qualied as \"romantic tragedies,\" \"paratragedies,\" and \"tragicomedies\") question the identity of the tragic genre and open new dramatic possibilities at the end of the h century BCE. GREK 754b, Greek Myth, Fiction, and Science Fiction Pauline LeVen Relationships among ancient Greek myths, ction, and speculative/science ction, with attention to interpretive approaches and methodologies. Narrative modes of representing reality; distinguishing ction from myth and science ction; cultural uses of myth and ction. Readings include works by Homer, Longus, Lucian, and Philostratus. GREK 763b, Praxis and Theory of the Greek Symposium Egbert Bakker This course is a study (reading in the original, interpretation, and discussion) of a selection of texts pertaining to the ancient Greek symposium (a wine-drinking event by elite males) as a central cultural institution. Readings include poetic texts (\"songs\") that were meant to be sung and performed by the participants (\"symposiasts\"); and prose representations of the symposium as an imagined event in which philosophical ideas were put forward. LATN 714b, Roman Civil Wars Irene Peirano An examination of the ways in which Romans constructed and represented their civil wars in literature across a variety of genres (epic, lyric, historiography), authors (Vergil, Lucan, Caesar, Sallust), and time periods (late republic, empire).104 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 LATN 721a, Vergil's Aeneid Kirk Freudenburg An Aeneid within its political context.

CPLT 554b / ENGL 827b, Minds: The Representation of Consciousness from Austen to Woolf Ruth Yeazell Close study of selected novels by Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf, with particular attention to the representation of consciousness and the development of the free indirect style. Our reading of ction is supplemented by narrative theory drawn from James, Wayne Booth, K\u00e4te Hamburger, Ann Baneld, G\u00e9rard / RLST 613a, Rhetorics of the Ancient World Michal Beth Dinkler and Irene Peirano This interdisciplinary course takes as its starting point Greco-Roman rhetoric as a codied system and explores its relevance for contemporary interpretation of ancient texts. Moving back and forth between rhetoric as a set of norms and rhetoric as a condition of discourse, we engage with contemporary rhetorical studies in Classics and Biblical studies. Topics include rhetoric and narrative, exemplarity and imitation across the literary and spiritual realms, \"anti-rhetoricism,\" embedded rhetorical performances (e.g., speeches, oratory, etc.), and nonverbal forms of persuasion (e.g., visual, emotional, etc.). CPLT 562b / GMAN 654b, Living Form: Organicism in Society and Aesthetics Kirk Wetters Starting with Kant, the organic is dened as a processual relation of the part and the whole, thereby providing a new model of the individual as a self-contained totality. We explore the implications of this conception in Goethe's writings on morphology (The Metamorphosis of Plants, \"Orphic Primal Words\"), the Romantics' Athenaeum, Hanslick's On the Beautiful in Music, Oswald Spengler's cultural morphology, the concept of autopoiesis in Maturana and Varela, Luhmann's systems theory, and Canguilhem's critique of the analogy of organic life and society. CPLT 622a / AMST 622a, Working Group on Globalization and Culture Michael Denning A continuing yearlong collective research project, a cultural studies \"laboratory.\" The group, drawing on several disciplines, meets regularly to discuss common readings, develop collective and individual research projects, and present that research publicly. The general theme for the working group is globalization and culture, with three principal aspects: (1) the globalization of cultural industries and goods, and its consequences for patterns of everyday life as well as for forms of ction, lm,110 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 broadcasting, and music; (2) the trajectories of social movements and their relation to patterns of migration, the rise of global cities, the transformation of labor processes, and forms of ethnic, class, and gender conflict; (3) the emergence of and debates within transnational social and cultural theory. The specic focus, projects, and directions of the working group are determined by the interests, expertise, and ambitions of the members of the group, and change as its members change. There are a small number of openings for second-year graduate students. Students interested in participating should contact michael.denning@yale.edu. CPLT 672b / ENGL 672b, Milton David Quint This course studies Milton's poetry and some of his controversial prose. We investigate the relation of the poetry to its historical contexts, focusing on the literary, religious, social, and political forces that shaped Milton's verse. We survey and assess some of the dominant issues in contemporary Milton studies, examining the types of readings that psychoanalytic, feminist, Marxist, and historicist critics have produced. A brief oral report and a term paper (as well as a prospectus and preliminary bibliography for the term paper) required. CPLT 676a / SPAN 688a, Law and Literature in Modern Latin America Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda A study of major modern narrative works in Latin America from the independence and post-independence period in the nineteenth century to the age of drug tracking and the AIDS epidemic today.

CPLT 679b / JDST 686b, Major Modern Jewish Poets Peter Cole This course introduces students to a diverse group of modern Jewish poets, from Gertrude Stein, Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, and Adrienne Rich to Muriel Rukeyser, Yehuda Amichai, Paul Celan, Edmond Jab\u00e8s, Leonard Cohen, and others. Writing in English, Yiddish, German, Hebrew, and French, these poets gave seminal expression to Jewish life in a variety of modes and permutations, and in the process produced poems of lasting and universal value. The class explores work as art and considers pressing questions of cultural, historical, and political context. All readings are in English. Permission of the instructor required.Comparative Literature 111 CPLT Epic David Quint and Jane Tylus This course looks at Renaissance epic poetry in relationship to classical models and as a continuing generic tradition. It examines epic type scenes, formal strategies, and poetic architecture. It looks at themes of exile and imperial foundations, aristocratic ideology, and the role of gender. The main readings are drawn from Vergil's Hannan Hever This course investigates the theological aspects of modern political ideologies. Subjects include sovereignty, universalism, law, election, commandment, and messianism. Primary readings include Martin Buber, / PHIL 602a, Heidegger's Being Time Martin H\u00e4gglund A systematic, chapter-by-chapter study of Heidegger's Being and Time, arguably the most important work of philosophy of the twentieth century. All the major themes of the book are addressed in detail, with a particular emphasis on care, time, death, and the meaning of being. CPLT 708a / ITAL 560a, Age of Disenchantment Giuseppe Mazzotta This course focuses on the literary debates, theological arguments, and scientic shis taking place between the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1437-38) and the Council of Trent and beyond, by reading key texts by Valla, Cusa, Pulci, Luther, Erasmus, Ariosto, Campanella, Bruno, Galileo, and Bellarmino. It examines issues such as crisis of belief, the authority of the past, the emergence of freedom, new aesthetics, and the eort to create a new theological language for modern times. CPLT 715b / ITAL 940b, 1492: Before and Aer: Geographical and Linguistic Itineraries Jane Tylus Not simply the date of Columbus's landing, 1492 also marks Lorenzo de' Medici's death, the banishment of Jews from Spain and Sicily, the election of a Borgia pope\u2014Alexander VI, celebrated by Machiavelli\u2014and the birth of Pietro Aretino. We briefly consider the shared cultural and religious history of Italy and Spain, even as most of our attention will be focused on Italy's role as precursor: the Florentine Vespucci was the rst to use the phrase \"nuovo mondo,\" and Columbus was inspired by the stories of Marco Polo and travels of Italian pilgrims to the Holy Land. We start with Columbus and his contemporary Savonarola and move into the \"new worlds\" of the early sixteenth century as represented by four topics: the rise of print; the burgeoning pastoral genre; the (brief) rearmation of the Florentine republic with cameo appearances by Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Machiavelli; and the otherworldly (but also very much of this world) romance of Ariosto. We spend time in the Beinecke Library with maps, Savonarola's sermons, and early sixteenth-century Sienese pastoral plays, and also spend an aernoon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Renaissance paintings.

And rst in East, then in West Germany, young lmmakers developed distinctive approaches to political and documentary lmmaking, to the Nazi past and the Cold War, to class, gender, and social transformation. This course juxtaposes the two German New Waves, focusing on aesthetic ferment, institutional barriers, and transformation. Features, documentaries, and experimental lms by Gerhard Klein, Konrad Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Herbert Helke Sander, Helke Misselwitz, read against other Eastern and Western New Wave lms (i.e., by Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz, Andrzej Munk, Being a Person R\u00fcdiger Campe In Western experience, the social and legal notion of a \"person\" has been deeply informed by how \"persons\" are formed and performed onstage and in narration, and vice versa. Readings focus on three areas: (1) basic texts on the history of the notion of \"person\" and \"character\" in legal, poetical, and philosophical contexts from Aristotle to modernity; (2) the performance of personhood in the rebirth of modern theater in early modern times; and (3) the narrative evocation of a new modern character in the rise of the modern novel. In order to bring into view the performative and aesthetic dimensions of personhood we discuss questions such as: What does it mean to appear as a person on a stage? What does it take to appear as a certain character (e.g., as reflected in commedia dell'arte, Shakespeare, Racine, Lessing)? What is a main and what is a supporting character (e.g., as reflected in Defoe, Richardson, Goethe, Kleist, Mary Shelley)? How can a protagonist of a novel be constituted, and how is the protagonist's identity dened and secured? Gender, race, and social class are of relevance throughout, as well as the question of being a nonperson (a madman, an animal, a monster, an outcast). None CPLT 822b / AMST 623b, Working Group on Globalization and Culture Michael Denning A continuing yearlong collective research project, a cultural studies \"laboratory.\" The group, drawing on several disciplines, meets regularly to discuss common readings, develop collective and individual research projects, and present that research publicly. The general theme for the working group is globalization and culture, with three principal aspects: (1) the globalization of cultural industries and goods, and its consequences for patterns of everyday life as well as for forms of ction, lm, broadcasting, and music; (2) the trajectories of social movements and their relation to patterns of migration, the rise of global cities, the transformation of labor processes, and forms of ethnic, class, and gender conflict; (3) the emergence of and debates within transnational social and cultural theory. The specic focus, projects, and directions of the working group are determined by the interests, expertise, and ambitions of the members of the group, and change as its members change. There are a small number of openings for second-year graduate students.

While the language that characterized the foundation of the nation-states in the nineteenth century was emancipation, in the second part of the twentieth century, and particularly around 1968, Latin America embraced the world discourse of liberation. This seminar looks at languages of liberation in an array of disciplines and artistic practices from South and Central America as well as the Caribbean. We explore regional debates that were also inserted in the larger discourse of the anticolonial struggles of the global South. Topics include philosophy of liberation (Dussel), theology of liberation (the 1968 Council of Bishops in Medell\u00edn, Colombia), theater of the oppressed (Boal), pedagogy of the oppressed (Freire), cinema of liberation (manifestos of third cinema), the New Song protest movements across the region (from Violeta Parra in Chile to Tropicalismo in Brazil), anticolonialism in the Caribbean (Fanon), anti-neocolonialism (dependency theory, internal colonialism), Indigenous liberation (from the Barbados declarations to the Lacandon Jungle declarations), experimental \"boom\" literature Figlerowicz and Jonathan Kramnick What is literary theory today, and what is its history? The aim of the course is to introduce students to central concepts in theory and explore their relation to method. We examine the variety of approaches available within the eld of literary studies, including older ones such as Russian formalism, New Criticism, deconstruction, Marxism, and psychoanalysis, as well as newer ones like actor-network theory and digital humanities research. We explore the basic tenets and histories of these theories in a way that is both critical and open-minded, and discuss their comparative advantages and pitfalls. The focus is on recurrent paradigms, arguments, and topics, and on transhistorical relations among our various schools of literary-theoretical thought. Readings might include work by Ren\u00e9 Wellek, Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Bruno Latour, Judith Butler, Northrop Frye, many others. CPLT 898a / FREN 898a, Fin-de-si\u00e8cle France Maurice Samuels The course examines major French literary and artistic movements of the last decades of the nineteenth century (Naturalism, Decadence, Symbolism) in their cultural context. Weekly reading assignments pair literary texts with contemporary theoretical/ medical/political discourse on such topics as disease, crime, sex, poverty, colonialism, nationalism, and technology. Literary authors include Barbey, Mallarm\u00e9, Maupassant, Rachilde, Villiers, Bon, Nordau, Renan, and Simmel. Some attention also paid to the visual arts. Prerequisite: reading knowledge of French. CPLT 900a, Directed Reading 905b 760b, Intermediality in Film Brigitte Peucker Film is a hybrid medium, the meeting point of several others. This course focuses on the relationship of lm to theater and painting, suggesting that where two media are in evidence, there is usually a third. Topics include space, motion, color, theatricality, tableau vivant, ekphrasis, spectatorship, and new media. Readings feature art114 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 historical and lm theoretical texts as well as essays pertinent to specic lms. Films by Fassbinder, Bergman, Murnau, von Trier, Rohmer, Godard, Kiarostami, and others, concluding lms by Peter Greenaway. CPLT 912b / EALL 801b, Media Theory, Capitalism, and Japanese Modernity Seth Jacobowitz This course introduces students to key aspects of Western media theory and media history through readings by leading thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, Friedrich Kittler, Lewis Mumford, Martin Heidegger, and Marshall McLuhan. It then brings these works into dialogue with recent critical studies of Japanese modernity, capitalism, and contemporary information society by Naoki Sakai, Karatani Kojin, Akira Lippit, Azuma English. CPLT 916a / FILM 830a / ITAL 590a, Literature into Film Millicent Marcus We study a series of written works and their cinematic adaptations, considering rst the texts in autonomous, literary terms, and then their transformation into audiovisual spectacles. In most cases we screen the lm on Tuesday evening and do a comparative study in the Thursday class period, making extensive use of video clips to do close visual analysis of scenes in the light of their corresponding textual sources. Rather than develop a general theory of adaptation, we construct methodological approaches on an ad hoc basis, taking each instance of adaptation as a case study amenable to a variety of methodologies\u2014psychoanalytic, feminist, ideological, generic, semiotic, and so forth. The class is conducted as a seminar, and active student participation is expected. There are two papers\u2014one shorter one of a critical nature at midterm and a nal research paper (approximately 15-20 pages). Films examined include (tentatively) Pasolini's Medea and Tavianis' Venice, Rosi's Three Brothers, Salvatores's I'm Not Afraid, and De Sica's Two Women. Writing assignments comprise 75 percent of the nal grade and class participation 25 percent. CPLT 921a / FILM 800a, Styles and Techniques in Recent Art Cinema Dudley Andrew How much does the art of cinema in the twenty-rst century resemble that of the previous half-century? Have massive changes visible in production, distribution, and exhibition also aected the goals and ambitions of lm artists? Or do today's auteurs and cinematographers work as their counterparts did decades ago, deploying whatever techniques current technology permits in a quest for a style that may bring out something authentic about themselves, the world, or the medium? Analyzing lms by such contemporary auteurs as Olivier Assayas, Claire Denis, Carlos Reygadas, Lav Diaz, David Lynch, and Hong Sang-soo, we measure new styles against techniques deployed by classic and modern auteurs like Mizoguchi, Welles, Cocteau, and Hitchcock. What new aesthetic (and practical) issues face lmmakers as they conceive their projects? We look at screen format, including 3-D; elastic temporality, especially slow motion; special eects, including forms animation; superimposition, including multiple screens; long-takes and camera movement; montage and alternatives to cutting; advances in sound design. Have the new narrative forms and the new types of subject matter associated with our century's most dicult lms (L'Intrus, Werckmeister Harmonies, La Mort de Louis XIV, Twin Peaks) given rise to the styles of major directors, or are they the by-product of these styles? Does style matter in the way it did during cinema's rst century?Comparative Literature 115 CPLT 925a, The Practice of Literary Translation Robyn Creswell Intensive readings in the history and theory of translation paired with practice in translating. Case studies from ancient languages (the Bible, Greek and Latin classics), medieval languages (classical Arabic literature), and modern languages (poetic texts). CPLT 942a / SPAN 912a, The Borges Eect Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda Since the publication of Ficciones in 1944 and especially since achieving worldwide acclaim aer receiving ex-aequo with Samuel Beckett the Formentor Group's Prix International in 1961, Jorge Luis Borges has become one of the most influential modern writers. He is a recognizable and oen acknowledged presence in the work of novelists and short-story writers, as well as in that of philosophers and literary theorists. A Borges \"eect\" can be perceived in John Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Italo Calvino, Michel Foucault, G\u00e9rard Genette, and Jacques Derrida, among others. That eect is also projected retrospectively in Borges's particular way of reading classics like Homer, Dante, and Cervantes. An elegant, playfully ironic skepticism, together with a fondness for aporias, enigmas, puzzles, and labyrinths as well as for minor genres such as the detective story, are the most recognizable components of Borges's style and thought. Taken together these components suggest theories about writing and reading. We read closely Borges's most influential stories, such as \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,\" \"Pierre Menard, \"The Garden of Forking Paths,\" as well as his essays on Homer, Dante, and Cervantes. We then follow his track in the writers mentioned. Class discussions in English; readings in English or the French, Spanish, or Italian originals. CPLT 949b / Diasporic Intellectuals Hazel Carby This course examines work by artists and writers of Caribbean descent from dierent regions of the transatlantic world. In response to contemporary interest in issues of globalization, the premise of the course is that in the world maps of these black intellectuals we can see the intertwined and interdependent histories and relations of the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Thinking globally is not a new experience for black peoples, and we need to understand that what is represented as \"Caribbeanness\" is a condition of movement. Literature and art are most frequently taught within the boundaries of a particular nation, but this course focuses on the work of writers and artists who shape the Caribbean identities of their characters as traveling black subjects and refuse to restrain their work within the limits of any one national identity. We practice a new and global type of cognitive mapping as we read and explore the meanings of terms like black transnationalism, migrancy, globalization, and empire. Diasporic practice embraces and represents the geopolitical realities of the modern, modernizing, and postmodern worlds in which multiple racialized histories are inscribed on modern bodies. CPLT 952a / EALL 586a, Modern Novel in Japan and Brazil Seth Jacobowitz Brazilian and Japanese novels from the late nineteenth century to the present. Representative texts from major authors are read in pairs to explore their commonalities and divergences. Topics include nineteenth-century realism and naturalism, the rise of mass culture and the avant-garde, and existentialism and postmodernism.116 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 CPLT 954a / GMAN 593a, Reading Theory Katrin Truestedt From the new form of literary theory taking shape in romanticism to recent German media studies, this course examines the relation of close readings of singular texts to larger theoretical claims. We reflect on the eminent status that literary readings have attained for broader theoretical and philosophical projects. We specically focus on a certain theoretical milieu in which far-reaching theoretical claims were not merely exemplied or illustrated by, but in fact developed from distinct practices of (close) reading of particular literary texts. The aim is to analyze this distinct type of theory by investigating the scenes of reading that major theoretical endeavors depended upon, in order to trace the trajectory of theory and turn to more recent theoretical endeavors, to discuss the changed status that reading has for them. Among the authors read are Schlegel, Benjamin, de Man, Derrida, Blumenberg, Butler, Kittler, and Latour. CPLT 958a and Dissertation Workshop Sta Dissertation preparation course. CPLT 965a / SPAN 904a, Latin American Thought Moira Fradinger This seminar introduces students to two centuries of Latin American political thought in the form of social and literary essays produced since the times of independence. It studies how Latin American writers have thought of their identity and how they have theorized the political/cultural heritage of the colony. The seminar starts with the Haitian constitution and contemporary Haitian authors who assess the legacy of the Haitian revolution. It ends with writings on current indigenous movements across the region. The rst unit engages nineteenth-century debates over \"American identity\" that were foundational to the Bol\u00edvar, second independence, the movement of \"indigenismo,\" mestizaje, transculturation and heterogeneity, the Caribbean movement of \"negritude,\" the metaphor of \"cannibalism\" to account for the cultural politics of the region, concepts such as \"internal colonialism\" and \"motley society,\" and the polemics modernity (authors third explores recent debates over indigenous cosmologies, coloniality, and other ways of knowing de Castro). There is an extra session on the tradition of Latin American feminist thought depending on the interests of the group. Weekly sessions are conducted in Spanish, and most of the readings are Spanish, French, and Portuguese materials (with a few Anglo- Caribbean sources). Students will be provided with English translations if they prefer and will be allowed to write their papers in English. CPLT 985a / AFST 969a / FREN 969a, Islands, Oceans, Deserts Jill Jarvis This seminar brings together literary and theoretical works that chart planetary relations and connections beyond the paradigm of francophonie. Comparative focus on the poetics and politics of spaces shaped by intersecting routes of colonization and forced migrations: islands (Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Martinique), oceans (Indian,Comparative Literature 117 Mediterranean, Atlantic), and deserts (Sahara, Sonoran).

The systematic acquisition of data made possible by genomics and proteomics technologies has created a tremendous gap between available data and their biological interpretation. Given the rate of data generation, it is well recognized that this gap will not be closed with direct individual experimentation. Computational and theoretical approaches to understanding biological systems provide an essential vehicle to help close this gap. These activities include computational modeling of biological processes, computational management of large-scale projects, database development and data mining, algorithm development, and high-performance computing, as well as statistical and mathematical analyses.Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 119 Special Admissions Requirements Applicants are expected (1) to have a strong foundation in the basic sciences, such as biology, chemistry, and mathematics, and (2) to have training in computing/ informatics, including signicant computer programming experience.

(See also the Combined Ph.D. Program in Film and Media Studies.) Although the primary emphasis is on these East Asian subjects, the department welcomes applicants who are seeking to integrate their interests in Chinese or Japanese literature with interdisciplinary studies in such elds as history, history of art, linguistics, religious studies, comparative literature, lm and media studies, theater studies, literary theory and criticism, and the social sciences. Special Admissions Requirements The department requires entering students in Chinese or Japanese (and the Combined Program in Film and Media Studies) to have completed at least three years of study, or the equivalent, of either Chinese or Japanese. Students applying in Chinese are expected to have completed at least one year of literary Chinese. Students applying in premodern Japanese are expected to have completed at least one year of literary Japanese. This is a doctoral program; no students are admitted for terminal master's degrees. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree During the rst three years of study, students are required to take at least fourteen term courses. Usually students complete twelve term courses in the rst and second years, and then take two tutorials or two seminars in the third year. Students concentratingEast Asian Languages and Literatures 131 in Chinese or Japanese literature are encouraged to take at least one term course in Western literature or literary theory. Graduate courses taken for a grade of Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory in other departments in which those courses are counted toward that department's doctoral course requirements will be counted toward the fourteen-course requirement. By the end of the second year, all students must prove their prociency in a language other than their primary language of study that is relevant to their course of study and is approved by the director of graduate studies (DGS). By the end of the third year, students specializing in premodern Japanese literature must pass a reading test in literary Chinese. At the end of the second full academic year, the student must take a written examination in the language of the student's specialization, including both its modern and premodern forms. At the end of each academic year, until a student is admitted to candidacy, a faculty committee will review the student's progress. For the second-year review, the student must submit a revised seminar research paper, on a topic selected in consultation with the adviser, no later than April 1 of the fourth term. No later than the end of the sixth term the student will take the qualifying oral examination. The exam will cover three elds distinguished by period and/or genre in one or more East Asian national literatures or in other elds closely related to the student's developing specialization. These elds and accompanying reading lists will be selected in consultation with the examiners and the DGS in order to allow the student to demonstrate knowledge and command of a range of topics. Aer having successfully passed the qualifying oral examination, students will be required to submit a dissertation prospectus to the department for approval by September 1 of the seventh term in order to complete the process of admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. Opportunities to obtain experience in teaching language and literature form an important part of this program. Students in East Asian Languages and Literatures normally teach in their third and fourth years in the Graduate School. Combined Ph.D. Program The Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures also oers, in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures and Film and Media Studies. For further details, see Film and Media Studies. Applicants to the combined program must indicate on their application that they are applying both to Film and Media Studies and to East Asian Languages and Literatures. All documentation within the application should include this information. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The successful completion of all predissertation requirements, including the qualifying examination, will make a student eligible for an M.Phil. degree. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) The successful completion of twelve term courses and languages required in the rst two years of study will make a student eligible for an M.A. degree.

EALL 599b, Decolonizing East Asia Stephen Poland This course explores how literary and cinematic works engaged with, promoted, critiqued, and struggled with empire and colonization in East Asia from the late- nineteenth century to the present. We explore how the very ideas of \"literature\" and \"cinema\" in East Asia were entangled with the rise of the Japanese empire in the context of imperial rivalry with Europe, and how these categories were contested and transformed by writers and lmmakers in colonial and postcolonial contexts. The course also examines how discourses of empire and colonization continued to be relevant in post-WWII cultural works grappling with the neoimperialism of Soviet- American Cold War order. Finally, we consider questions of empire and colonization aer the Cold War, especially in terms of the rise of China and continued relevance of past imperial formations in twenty-rst-century cultural production.

Too oen studied in isolation from one another, these religious and intellectual teachings were deeply intertwined throughout this period, and scholars aiming to understand the religious, intellectual, and literary history of the Tang need to be able to read broadly across their boundaries. All primary readings are in classical/literary Chinese. Open to undergraduates with sucient language skills. Prerequisite: reading ability in / HSAR Fragmentism and Culture Edward Kamens and Mimi Yiengpruksawan A cross-disciplinary consideration of the phenomenon of disaggregation of texts and visual artworks and their reconguration in new forms.

Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China, and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. EALL 801b / CPLT 912b, Media Theory, Capitalism, and Japanese Modernity Seth Jacobowitz This course introduces students to key aspects of Western media theory and media history through readings by leading thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, Friedrich Kittler, Lewis Mumford, Martin Heidegger, and Marshall McLuhan.

EALL 806b / FILM 921b, Research in Japanese Film History Aaron Gerow Theorizations of lm and culture in Japan from the 1910s to the present. Through readings in the works of a variety of authors, the course explores both the articulations of cinema in Japanese intellectual discourse and how this embodies the shiing position of lm in Japanese popular cultural history.East Asian Languages and Literatures 135 EALL 850b, Theory in/and East Asia Stephen Poland This seminar engages with the question of what \"Theory\" might mean in the context of East Asian cultural studies. Many critiques have been made of the way \"traveling theory\" serves as a Euro-American universal applied to the \"raw material\" of East Asian texts, or as a transdisciplinary common language in the humanities and social sciences. We take this notion as a starting point to explore the intersections and interactions of \"Theory\" and \"East Asia.\" Questions include: What is Theory? Who gets to theorize? How have thinkers in East Asia engaged with Theory? How has Theory engaged with East Asia? What have been the major issues and debates in Theory, and how can they apply to scholarship on East Asian cultural production? How can the work of thinkers in/of East Asia oer critiques of Theory, and what problems arise from such challenges? These questions will also be situated in the historical context of disciplinary formation and the creation of Area Studies in universities in the United States. Readings are primarily in English, but may also include Japanese, Chinese, or Korean depending on student interest and language abilities. EALL 873a / EAST 573a / HIST 873a, China and the World circa 1900 Peter Perdue and Jing Tsu Reading and discussion of signicant themes in China and world history in the rst decade of the twentieth century.

This program is designed for students preparing to go on to the doctorate in one of the disciplines of East Asian Studies (e.g., anthropology; economics; history; history of art; language and literature, including comparative literature, lm studies, and theater studies; political science; sociology; etc.), as well as for those students seeking a terminal M.A. degree before entering the business world, the media, government service, or a professional school.East Asian Studies 137 Course of Study for the M.A. Degree The East Asian Studies graduate program is designed to be completed in either a one- year or a two-year track. The two-year track requires the preparation of a master's thesis and is therefore ideal for students who are keen to pursue focused, independent research under the guidance of a faculty member. It also provides students with an opportunity to pursue additional disciplinary and language training. Students who enter the two-year track with a strong command of one East Asian language will be encouraged to consider beginning a second (or third) language. In general, students focus their course work on the study of China, Japan, or transnational East Asia. Some students may prefer to focus their course work on one or two disciplines, in addition to language study and courses focused on East Asia. Others may create a highly interdisciplinary program, taking courses in traditional disciplines such as history, literature, political science, art history, or anthropology, as well as in Yale's professional schools. Applicants to the East Asian Studies graduate program must indicate on their application whether they are applying to the one-year or the two-year track. Requirements for the M.A. Degree: One-Year Track The program of study for completion of the degree on the one-year track consists of eight term courses that must include two terms of language study at or above Yale's third-year level (unless the language requirement has already been met through previous study or native fluency), plus six other courses selected from the University's oerings of advanced language study and seminars related to East Asia at the graduate level. For those who meet the language requirement at matriculation, two of the required eight courses may be advanced training in a particular discipline (e.g., economics, history, political theory, statistics, etc.) with no explicit focus on East Asia, but related to the student's professional goals. The course of study must be approved by the director of graduate studies (DGS). Special Requirements Students must earn two Honors grades (\"H\") over the course of their two terms at Yale. Honors grades earned in any language course cannot be counted toward satisfying this requirement, except with the permission of the DGS. Requirements for the M.A. Degree: Two-Year Track The program of study for completion of the degree on the two-year track consists of sixteen term courses that must include four terms of language study, two terms of which must be at Yale's fourth-year level (unless the language requirement has already been met through previous study or native fluency), plus twelve other courses selected from the University's oerings of advanced language study and seminars related to East Asia at the graduate level. Students who have achieved advanced prociency in one East Asian language are strongly encouraged to pursue study of a second East Asian language, but for those who have met the language requirement in one language at matriculation, two of the required sixteen courses may be advanced training in a particular discipline (e.g., economics, history, political theory, statistics, etc.) with no138 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 explicit focus on East Asia, but related to the student's professional goals. The course of study must be approved by the director of graduate studies (DGS). Special Requirements Students must earn four Honors grades (\"H\") over the course of their four terms at Yale. Honors grades earned in any language course cannot be counted toward satisfying this requirement, except with the permission of the DGS. A master's thesis is also required. Master's Thesis A master's thesis is required of students enrolled in the two-year degree program. The master's thesis is based on research in a topic approved by the DGS and advised by a faculty member with specialized competence in the chosen topic. M.A. students must register for EAST 900, which may count toward the sixteen required courses. EAST 900 may not be taken for audit. Students may register for an additional independent study to prepare topics and begin research. The master's thesis must be prepared according to CEAS guidelines and is due in the student's second year on a mid-December date (if completed in the fall term) or an early-May date (if completed in the spring term) as specied by CEAS. Joint-Degree Programs The Council on East Asian Studies (CEAS) collaborates with three of Yale's professional schools\u2014Forestry & Environmental Studies, Law, and Public Health\u2014and has developed joint-degree programs that oer a strong connection between two demanding courses of study while also fullling the requirements of each separate school. Only students enrolled in the two-year track of the East Asian Studies M.A. degree program are eligible for a joint degree. Each joint program leads to the simultaneous award of two graduate professional degrees: the M.A. in East Asian Studies from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and an M.F., M.E.M., M.E.Sc., M.F.S., J.D., or M.P.H. from the relevant professional school. Students can earn the two degrees simultaneously in less time than if they were pursued sequentially. With the exception of the joint M.A./J.D. program, which requires four years, completion of all requirements takes three years. Typically candidates spend the rst year in one program and the second year in the partner program. During the third and nal year of study, students register in one program each term. Joint-degree students are guided in this process by a committee composed of the DGS and a faculty member of the relevant professional school. Candidates must submit formal applications to both the Graduate School and the relevant professional school and be admitted separately to each school, i.e., each school makes its decision independently. It is highly recommended that students apply to and enter a joint-degree program from the outset, although it is possible to apply to the second program once matriculated at Yale.

EAST 500a / HSAR 803a, Reflecting Truth: Meiji Photography between Performativity and Representation, Modernity and Empire Sta Celebrating 150 years since the Meiji Restoration (1868) is an ideal opportunity to look back and ponder the engagement with an alternative history of photography, from a Japanese point of view. Photography arrived in Japan soon aer its creation in the UK and France (1839), and rst images were created as soon as 1848 in Kagoshima and Nagasaki. We consider the two paths photography developed in Japan, and their intersections: experimental approaches with performative modes of execution (i.e., direct light, opaque image, camera-less photographs, etc.), versus representations of Japan, a method that can be studied through two tracks\u2014the creation of exotic, nonmodern images for the Western, consuming eye; and the documentation of Japan's rapid modernization and political developments into settlement, nationalism, colonialism, and militarism. EAST 511b / RLST 598b, Modern Korean Buddhism in the Global Context Hwansoo Kim This course situates modern Korean Buddhism in the global context of the late nineteenth century to the present. Through critical examination of the dynamic relationship between Korean Buddhism and the Buddhisms of key East Asian cities \u2014Shanghai, Tokyo, Taipei, and Lhasa\u2014the course seeks to understand modern East Asian Buddhism in a transnational light. Discussion includes analyzing the impact of Christian missionaries, pan-Asian and global ideologies, colonialism, Communism, capitalism, war, science, hypermodernity, and atheism. EAST 573a / EALL 873a / HIST 873a, China and the World circa 1900 Peter Perdue and Jing Tsu Reading and discussion of signicant themes in China and world history in the rst decade of the twentieth century. We concentrate on topics that contain international, transnational, and comparative implications, and include discussion of literary and historical material. Most readings are in English, but selected primary sources in Asian languages may be used. Open to all History, East Asian Studies, and East Asian Languages and Literatures students, and others by request. Includes research paper and weekly writing exercises. Prerequisite: knowledge of one foreign language, European or Asian.

Special Admissions Requirements Applicants should have had training in one of the following elds: biology, mathematics, chemistry, physics, statistics, and/or geology. Candidates are selected, regardless of their major, based on overall preparation for a career in research in ecology and evolutionary biology. Some, planning for careers in applied elds, may have prepared with courses in public policy, economics, and agriculture. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Each entering student, in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS), develops a specic program of courses, seminars, laboratory research, and independent reading tailored to the student's interests, background, and goals. There are normally no foreign language requirements. All rst-year students carry out two research rotations. Students have the option of a rotation over their rst summer. Students must participate in (1) E&EB 500 and E&EB 501, Advanced Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; (2) E&EB 545 , a course on the responsible conduct of research; (3) weekly E&EB seminars; and (4) symposia of faculty and graduate student research. In addition, during their rst two years of study, graduate students must enroll in142 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 a minimum of three additional graduate-level courses (numbered 500 and above); a grade of H must be earned in two of these. Teaching experience is regarded as an integral part of the graduate training program. All students are required to teach three courses, normally at a level 20, typically during their rst two years of study. By the middle of the fourth term of study, each student organizes a formal pre- prospectus consultative meeting with the student's advisory committee to discuss the planned dissertation research. Before the beginning of the h term, students present and defend their planned dissertation research at a prospectus meeting, at which the department determines the viability and appropriateness of the student's Ph.D. proposal. A successful prospectus meeting and completion of course requirements results in admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. The remaining requirements include completion, presentation, and successful defense of the dissertation, and submission of copies of the dissertation to the Graduate School and to the Center for Science and Social Science Information. In cases where the dissertation committee decides that preliminary eld work during the summer aer the fourth term is necessary prior to the prospectus, the prospectus meeting can be delayed by one term. A request for a delay must come from the dissertation committee adviser and must be approved by the DGS. In these exceptional cases, admission to candidacy may not be required for registration for the third year of graduate study. Honors Requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's requirement of Honors in two courses by the end of the fourth term of study. The E&EB department also requires an average grade of at least High Pass in course work during the rst two years of study. Master's Degree M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students must pass ten graduate-level courses. At least four courses must be taken for a grade, and students must earn Honors in two courses and maintain an overall average of High Pass. Required courses are: E&EB 500 and E&EB 501 , Advanced Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; E&EB 545, Responsible Conduct of Research; E&EB 901, Research Rotation I; and E&EB 902, Research Rotation II. A minimum of ve additional graduate-level courses (four taken for a grade) are required.

The intimate interplay between evolution and ecology. E&EB 705b, Plant Ecology Ann Staver Plant ecology is the study of plant interactions with their environment, at the level of individuals, and of how plant-plant interactions mediate environmental interactions at the level of populations, communities, and ecosystems. The course incorporates empirical and theoretical perspectives, emphasizing the empirical origins of concepts in plant ecology and eective empirical tests of conceptual and mathematical predictions. Students read the primary scientic literature extensively, both for content and to build familiarity with methodological standards and the scientic writing. E&EB 713b, Concepts and Methods in Global Biodiversity Change Research in the Age of Big Data Walter Jetz Biodiversity and the many functions it provides are changing worldwide, creating a critical need for a better understanding of mechanisms underpinning this change and the development of new information products to help monitoring and mitigation. New technologies, data, and methods, as well as conceptual advances, increasingly enable work addressing this challenge for species and communities at a global scale. We discuss these new opportunities and familiarize ourselves with recent research and new approaches to global biodiversity change. The course combines in-depth discussion of recent empirical work and hands-on examples of biodiversity change analysis workflows. On the technical front, we explore the use of remote sensing though Google Earth Engine (GEE) and work through R-based scripted examples of species distribution and community change modeling. The course is oered in collaboration with the Yale Center for Biodiversity and Global Change (https://bgc.yale.edu) and includes seminars and discussions with guest speakers. E&EB 725a, Scientic Writing for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Ann Staver This course provides guidance and practice for graduate students in grant and manuscript writing in the elds of ecology and evolutionary biology. Students produce one grant application (NSF GRFP/DDIG or similar) and one manuscript for publication (on a topic of their choice, to contribute to their thesis or other ongoing work). E&EB 810b, Dynamics of Evolving Systems J. Rimas Vainys An introduction to the ways evolving biological systems can be described, modeled, and analyzed by using a dynamical systems approach. To use currently fashionable terminology, we develop an individual-based model of the behavior of biological populations, which leads to evolution as an emergent property. In this approach it is possible to construct populations of varying individuals, which can then be combined into larger assemblages, and to modify both the overall environment and the environments at the lower levels, so that aspects oen neglected in modeling evolution can be explored and related to any available observational data. Extensive use of the soware package Mathematica, but prior experience with the program is not required.Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 147 E&EB 842b / ANTH 835b, Primate Diversity and Evolution Eric Sargis The diversity and evolutionary history of living and extinct primates.

Special Admissions Requirements Please see http://economics.yale.edu/graduate/application-info. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Exceptions to the requirements described below may be obtained only by vote of the Economics faculty and will be granted only in recognition of extenuating circumstances. Prior to Registration for the Second Year (1.1) Students must have taken for credit and passed at least six economics graduate courses. (Courses in the International and Development Economics master's program do not satisfy this requirement.) (1.2) Students must pass written comprehensive examinations in microeconomics and macroeconomics. These are given in May and late August each year. One or both may be taken in the August just prior to the rst year of study with permission of the director of graduate studies (DGS). ExaminationsEconomics 149 not passed prior to the rst year of study must be taken in the spring term of the rst year. In the event of failure, the failed exam must be retaken the next time it is oered. Students may take each comprehensive exam no more than two times. Students who have not passed both examinations prior to the second year of study may register as master's candidates for the following fall term for the purpose of completing enough courses to be eligible for the M.A. degree. The microeconomics and macroeconomics comprehensive exams will be given on two dierent days for at least three hours. The examinations scheduled in the spring term will occur approximately a week aer the end of course exams. The questions on the comprehensive exams will be on topics taught in the rst-year microeconomic and macroeconomic courses of the immediately preceding year. Each exam will be graded separately. In the event of failure, students will retake only the exam they did not pass. Comprehensive exams taken by students prior to their rst year will be graded as a pass only if they are a \"solid\" pass rather than a \"minimal\" pass. Students considering a combined degree with Economics and another department or program should consult the Economics department website: https:// economics.yale.edu/graduate/combined-doctoral-degrees. The proposal for a combined degree should be submitted during the summer aer the rst year of study. Prior to Registration for the Third Year (2.1) Students must have met the Graduate School's requirement of Honors in two courses. (2.2) Students must have taken at least fourteen term courses in economics and have received a grade of at least a P- in each of them. With the permission of the DGS, courses in related elds and independent reading courses can be used to fulll this requirement. Workshops may not be used to satisfy it. (2.3) Students must have received an average of at least HP in the courses they have taken. The admissibility of courses for this requirement is the same as for the fourteen-course requirement, (2.2). Grades within the Economics department include pluses and minuses. The grade average is computed as follows. A failure counts as a zero, a P- as a 1, a P as a 2, a P+ as a 3, an HP- as a 4, and so on up to a 9 for an H+. The arithmetic average of these numbers must be at least 4.5. (2.4) All students must have submitted a dra of their applied econometrics paper, discussed under (3.3) below. (2.5) All students must make their rst attempt at each of two oral qualifying examinations by June 30 of their second year in the program. The examinations test a student's general analytic ability in economics and knowledge of two elds chosen by the student. At least one of the elds must have substantial empirical and institutional content. Such applied elds are drawn from a departmental list that includes labor economics, market organization, macroeconomics, nancial economics, behavioral economics, economics of the public sector and of the environment, international trade and nance, economic development, economic history, and comparative economic systems. Students may also choose as one of their elds mathematical economics, advanced micro- or macroeconomic theory, or econometric theory. Students may request examination in a special eld designed in consultation with Economics department faculty. The choice of elds must be approved by the DGS. Students may take the oral examination in one eld no more than twice. An oral examination that was failed on the rst attempt must be retaken in the fall of the third year, and the retake must be in the same eld. Students may list two preferred examiners in each eld. The DGS's oce strives to satisfy these preferences subject to150 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 faculty availability and the number of students making similar requests. Students are required to provide eld sheets for each exam which list the literature and topics or subelds on which they wish to be examined. Students should consult faculty members as they prepare this list. Students are expected both to have command of the general eld of the exam and to know in depth the material in the areas they specify. The examinations are normally question-and-answer on this material, but examiners are not required to restrict questioning to it. The broader the topics listed, the more likely examiners are to conne questioning to them. Admission to Candidacy The Economics department adheres strictly to the Graduate School requirement that students be admitted to candidacy prior to registration for the fourth year of study. Students are recommended to the Graduate School for admission to candidacy by vote of the Department of Economics faculty aer having completed requirements (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) above, the Graduate School's prospectus requirement, and the following additional requirements. (3.1) Students must have completed two one-term prospectus workshops, one in each term of the third year. All prospectus workshops have the word \"prospectus\" in their title. If students can nd no prospectus workshop corresponding to their interests, they may substitute other workshops to meet this requirement. In order for two workshops to count toward the prospectus requirement, students must make a presentation in each workshop and present original work in one of them. This stipulation applies even if a workshop is not labeled as a prospectus workshop. If students can nd no workshop whatsoever in their area of interest, they may substitute an independent study course guided by a faculty member, provided the independent study leads to a dissertation prospectus that is accepted. (3.2) Students must receive a grade of HP- or better in ECON 551 (Econometrics II) or ECON 552 (Econometrics III). More advanced courses may be substituted for these with permission of the DGS. (3.3) Students must receive a grade of Satisfactory on an applied econometrics paper, which is evaluated by a faculty adviser of the paper and another faculty member. In the paper, the student should (a) specify an economic model useful for the investigation of an interesting economic problem, (b) select data and econometric methods appropriate to the question, (c) conduct proper statistical analysis, and (d) interpret the results in an intelligent way. The department's posted description of the Applied Econometrics Paper Requirement should answer any questions about it. The paper may be written in the course ECON 556 or independently with the help of a faculty adviser, the standards for a satisfactory paper being the same in both cases. The paper is not expected to be of publishable or nearly publishable quality, but should demonstrate facility in the application of econometric methods to an economic question. Note: Jointly authored papers will not be accepted. (3.4) Students must complete with a grade of at least HP- a term of economic history, drawn from a list of courses approved by the DGS and the economic history instructors. (3.5) Students must pass two oral qualifying examinations given by committees of faculty members. These exams are discussed under (2.5) above. Additional Requirements (1) All students must give a dissertation prospectus to their advisory committee by the second Friday in May of their third year. (2) Students must provide the names of their advisory committee to the DGS's oce by February 1 of the third year. (3) InEconomics 151 each academic year aer the second, all students must regularly attend at least two workshops. At least one of them must be an \"informal\" prospectus workshop lunch or reading group, and at least one must be a \"formal\" research workshop. Each student must present at least once a year in one or other of the workshops that they regularly attend. (4) Third-year students who have not yet satised the econometrics paper requirement must submit an econometrics paper by February 1. The Dissertation The dissertation should make an original contribution to economics that demonstrates the student's mastery of relevant resources and methods. Although the dissertation may cover several related topics, it should have a unifying theme. The dissertation may consist of one or more than one essay. The dissertation is guided by a committee of two advisers, at least one of whom must be a member of the Economics department. The second adviser need not be from the Economics department or even from Yale University. Second advisers from outside the Yale Economics department must be approved by the DGS. The two advisers serve as readers. Aer the student has completed a rst dra of the dissertation, the DGS appoints a third reader. The student and the committee may recommend third readers, but the choice remains with the DGS, since the third reader serves as an independent referee. Collaborative Work on the Dissertation The Economic department's objective regarding collaboration is to achieve a reasonable compromise between two goals. While the department wishes to encourage collaborative research among students and between students and faculty, a dissertation should demonstrate the student's ability to do independent research. A substantial part of a dissertation must present work done and written solely by the student. The dissertation committee and the DGS must approve the inclusion of collaborative work in the dissertation, and students must acknowledge and describe any collaboration in the preface to the dissertation. Expiration of Admission to Candidacy Advancement to candidacy expires ten years aer the date it is granted, if no dissertation has been submitted and approved in the intervening period. Normal Sequence of Courses The following are recommendations, not requirements. During the fall term of the rst year, students usually take ECON 500 (General Economic Theory: Microeconomics), ECON 510 (General Economic Theory: Macroeconomics), ECON 550 (Econometrics I), and an economic history class that would satisfy the economic history requirement, (3.4) above, if a grade of at least HP- were obtained. In the following spring, they usually take ECON 501 (General Economic Theory: Microeconomics), ECON 511 (General Economic Theory: Macroeconomics), ECON 551 (Econometrics II), and a fourth course in economics or related subjects, such as probability theory, mathematics, nance, or political science. Students who are well prepared in econometrics may take an advanced econometrics course instead152 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 of ECON 550 in the fall of the rst year aer consulting the DGS and an appropriate econometrics faculty member. During the second year, students normally take economics courses in specialized elds, such as industrial organization, mathematical economics, international trade, or public nance. These courses serve as preparation for the oral qualifying examinations. Students may also take courses related to economics from other departments. It is a good idea to satisfy the econometrics paper requirement in the second year and to locate a faculty adviser to advise them about their studies. The third year is normally devoted to nding a dissertation topic and to beginning research on it. In this year, students are expected to make the transition from being a taker of classes to a participant in research. Important elements in achieving this transition are thinking critically about material learned, reading widely, choosing research topics that are feasible and of interest to the student, and gaining contact with faculty. Students can expect to take the initiative in making such contact. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The M.Phil. degree is awarded to students in the Ph.D. program upon completion of all the requirements for advancement to candidacy for a doctorate in economics except the prospectus and prospectus workshop requirements. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) The M.A. degree is awarded upon completion of at least eight term graduate courses listed or cross-listed by the Department of Economics. At least six of these courses must be Ph.D. courses in the Department of Economics (not courses from the International and Development Economics master's program). The average grade of all the graduate courses taken that are listed or cross-listed by the Department of Economics must be at least a High Pass, and at least two of these grades must be an Honors. Students must complete at least two of the three rst-year two- course sequences in microeconomics, macroeconomics, or econometrics. In computing the grade average, the relevant grades are those reported to the registrar and so do not include pluses or minuses. A Fail counts as a zero, a Pass counts as a 1, a High Pass counts as a 2, and an Honors counts as a 3. To say that the average grade must be High Pass means that the arithmetic average of these numbers must be at least 2. Students in doctoral programs other than Economics may earn an M.A. in Economics under the conditions listed in the previous paragraph. Such students automatically earn an M.A. in their own department when awarded a Ph.D., and Yale allows students to earn only one M.A. degree. Consequently, students must apply to have the M.A. in their own department replaced by the Economics M.A. This application must be made to the DGS of Economics and to the DGS of the student's own department. Prior to this application, the student must have taken the rst one-term course in at least one of the three rst-year two-course sequences in microeconomics, macroeconomics, or econometrics and obtained a grade of at least High Pass. As part of the application, the student must submit a proposed list of economics courses, and this list must be approved by the two DGSs and by the appropriate dean of the Graduate School. The DGS of Economics must approve any deviation from this list, and this approval should be obtained before taking courses not on the list. Terminal Master's Degree Program Students working toward a J.D. in the Law School may earn an M.A. degree in Economics. The degree requirements that apply to theseEconomics 153 students are the same as those described above for the M.A. degree en route to Ph.D. for students in doctoral programs other than Economics. Students wishing to join this J.D./M.A. joint-degree program must apply for separate admission to the Economics graduate program. Students admitted to this program pay three years of tuition to the Law School and one year of tuition to the Graduate School. The Graduate School does not oer fellowship support to J.D./M.A. candidates. The M.A. in International and Development Economics is described under International and Development Economics.

Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree The online publication Qualication Procedure for the Ph.D. Degree in Engineering & Applied Science describes in detail all requirements in Biomedical Engineering, Chemical & Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science. The student is strongly encouraged to read it carefully; key requirements are briefly summarized below. See Computer Science's departmental entry in this bulletin for special requirements for the Ph.D. in Computer Science. Students plan their course of study in consultation with faculty advisers (the student's advisory committee). A minimum of ten term courses is required, to be completed in the rst two years. Well-prepared students may petition for course waivers based on courses taken in a previous graduate degree program. Similarly, students may place out of certain ENAS courses via an examination prepared by the course instructor. Placing out of the course will not reduce the total number of required courses. Core courses, as identied by each department/program, should be taken in the rst year unless otherwise noted by the department. With the permission of the departmental directorEngineering & Applied Science 165 of graduate studies (DGS), students may substitute more advanced courses that cover the same topics. No more than two courses can be Special Investigations, and at least two must be outside the area of the dissertation. All students must complete a one-term course, Responsible Conduct of Research, in the rst year of study. Each term, the faculty review the overall performance of the student and report their ndings to the DGS who, in consultation with the associate dean, determines whether the student may continue toward the Ph.D. degree. By the end of the second term, it is expected that a faculty member has agreed to accept the student as a research assistant. By December 5 of the third year, an area examination must be passed and a written prospectus submitted before dissertation research is begun. These events result in the student's admission to candidacy. Subsequently, the student will report orally each year to the full advisory committee on progress. When the research is nearing completion, but before the thesis writing has commenced, the full advisory committee will advise the student on the thesis plan. A nal oral presentation of the dissertation research is required to be given during term time. There is no foreign language requirement. Teaching experience is regarded as an integral part of the graduate training program at Yale University, and all Engineering graduate students are required to serve as a Teaching Fellow for one term, typically during year two. Teaching duties normally involve assisting in laboratories or discussion sections and grading papers and are not expected to require more than ten hours per week. Students are not permitted to teach during the rst year of study. If a student was admitted to the program having earned a score of less than 26 on the Speaking Section of the Internet-based TOEFL, the student will be required to take an English as a Second Language (ESL) course each semester at Yale until the Graduate School's Oral English Prociency standard has been met. This must be achieved by the end of the third year in order for the student to remain in good standing. Core Course Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Biomedical Engineering Physiological Systems (ENAS 550), Physical and Chemical Basis of Bioimaging and Biosensing (ENAS 510). One of these courses may be taken in the second year.

Teaching Two years of teaching\u2014one course per term in years three and four\u2014are required: two in English (up to two sections per course) and two in History of Art. Prospectus The dissertation prospectus must be approved by both English and History of Art. The colloquium will take place in the spring term of the third year of study. The committee will include at least one faculty member from each department. As is implied by its title, the colloquium is not an examination, but a meeting during which the student can present ideas to a faculty committee and receive advice from its members. The colloquium should be jointly chaired by the directors of graduate studies of both departments. First chapter reading Students will participate in a rst chapter reading (also known as a rst chapter conference) normally within a year of advancing to candidacy (spring term of year four). The dissertation committee, including faculty members from both programs, will discuss the progress of the student's work in a seminar-style format. Dissertation defense The hour-long defense is a serious intellectual conversation between the student and the committee. Present at the defense will be the student's advisers, committee, and the directors of graduate studies in both English and History of Art; others may be invited to comment aer the committee's questioning is completed. English and Renaissance Studies The Department of English Language and Literature also oers, in conjunction with the Renaissance Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in English Language and Literature and Renaissance Studies. For further details, see Renaissance Studies. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may receive the M.A. upon completion of seven courses with at least one grade of Honors and a maximum of one grade of Pass, and the passing of one foreign language. Terminal Master's Degree Program Students enrolled in the master's degree program must complete either seven term courses or six term courses and a special project within the English department (one or two of these courses may be taken in other departments with approval of the DGS). There must be at least one grade of Honors, and there may180 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 not be more than one grade of Pass. Students must also demonstrate prociency in one foreign language (as described under Ph.D. Requirements, above). Courses For expanded course descriptions, please visit the English department website: http:// english.yale.edu/courses. ENGL 500a / LING 500a, Old English I Sta The essentials of the language, some prose readings, and close study of several celebrated Old English poems. ENGL 502b, Old English II Sta Readings in a variety of pre-Conquest vernacular genres, varying regularly, with supplementary reading in current scholarship. Current topic: late antique romance in Anglo-Saxon England, with readings including Apollonius of Tyre, Legend of the Seven Sleepers, and Andreas. ENGL 537a, The Gawain Poet Jessica Brantley The course oers a contextual study of four of the greatest (and most enigmatic) Middle English poems\u2014Pearl, Patience, Cleanness, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. At its center is British Library MS Cotton Nero A.x, the single medieval book that contains them all. In addition to reading the poems closely in their manuscript context, we examine associated artworks, from the twelve illustrations in the Cotton MS that constitute a medieval reading of the poems, to St. Erkenwald, a poem preserved elsewhere that some argue was written by the same author. Finally, we think about the modern reception of the poems through a serious engagement with scholarly debate surrounding them, and also through comparative work with translations. ENGL 574a / CPLT 684a Epic David Quint and Jane Tylus This course looks at Renaissance epic poetry in relationship to classical models and as a continuing generic tradition. It examines epic type scenes, formal strategies, and poetic architecture. It looks at themes of exile and imperial foundations, aristocratic ideology, and the role of gender. The main readings are drawn from Vergil's Texts Peter Stallybrass This course focuses on the material culture of reading, writing, and printing from 1400 to 1900 in England and America, although students are welcome to develop their own topics based upon the Beinecke's collections. We do hands-on research, drawing on the extraordinary collections of manuscripts and printed texts in the Beinecke. The course oers students an opportunity to explore archives and develop publishable projects relevant to their future research. Topics include theories of materiality; fetishism and relics; \"persons\" and \"things\"; the bible and the body; authorship and anonymity; writing as a material practice; the manuscript production and circulation of poetry from John Donne to Emily Manuscript Culture, 1500-1750 Kathryn James This course provides a detailed introduction to early modern English paleography and manuscript cultures. The primary objective is for students to acquire fluency inEnglish Language and Literature 181 reading the main English hands encountered in the early modern archive. Students become familiar with the documentary forms and methods of production of early modern British manuscripts and with the techniques and terms by which these are understood and described. Topics include Anglicana, secretary, chancery, and italic shorthand and cipher; transcription; the forms and vocabulary associated with early modern letters, sermon- notes, diaries, annotations, inventories, and other documentary forms. The course meets in the Beinecke Library and is based on the library's early modern English manuscript collections. ENGL 603b, Shakespeare and Religion David Kastan This course is about how various understandings of religion (and religions) circulate through Shakespeare's plays, as they were written, performed, and read, and as they have continued to be sometimes rewritten, performed, and read. We are not much interested in biography (there isn't much biography to be interested in), and the course is not much interested in Shakespeare's own religious beliefs (which seem to us unknowable). What is clear however is that religion is central in the plays; it haunts them (think Hamlet) and was in so many ways inescapable in Shakespeare's England. Sometimes the plays register this fact in fundamental encounters of characters and ideas and sometimes in the sheer ordinariness in the dialogue (for example, the reflexive \"God b'wi' you\" in leave taking). We read a number of plays (including Hamlet, Measure for Measure, and Othello ), various historical sources, and theological and philosophical texts, as we try to understand how religion functions in these plays as an essential, but oen perplexing dimension of early modern identity (and perhaps of our own). ENGL 606a, History and Historical Drama in the Age of Shakespeare Lawrence Manley A study of the representation of history on the English stage in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Plays by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Peele, Heywood, Ford, and others in relation to both nondramatic forms of historical writing and contemporary aairs. ENGL 670b, Religion, Literature, and Politics in Early Modern Britain Bruce Gordon and John Rogers This course explores the protean expressions of religious belief, satire, and polemic in the literary cultures of early modern Britain by attending to the contested political and physical cultures in which they flourished. Through engagement with prose, theater, and music, students explore the diverse interrelationships of texts, images, and sacred architecture. On our visits to signicant sites, we consider the ways in which literary and religious imaginations were woven together. We engage with and learn from some of the most creative and thoughtful literary, historical, and cultural scholars working on early modern Britain, who will help us to think in expansive and interdisciplinary ways about language, faith, and authority. ENGL 672b / CPLT 672b, Milton David Quint This course studies Milton's poetry and some of his controversial prose. We investigate the relation of the poetry to its historical contexts, focusing on the literary, religious, social, and political forces that shaped Milton's verse. We survey and assess some of the dominant issues in contemporary Milton studies, examining the types of readings that psychoanalytic, feminist, Marxist, and historicist critics have produced. A brief oral182 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 report and a term paper (as well as a prospectus and preliminary bibliography for the term paper) required. ENGL 774a, Romantic Poetry Leslie Brisman An introduction to the work of Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats, with some attention to Byron and the minor poets of this rich period of poetic innovation and revolutionary spirit. ENGL 827b / CPLT 554b, Novel Minds: The Representation of Consciousness from Austen to Woolf Ruth Yeazell Close study of selected novels by Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf, with particular attention to the representation of consciousness and the development of the free indirect style. Our reading of ction is supplemented by narrative theory drawn from James, Wayne Booth, K\u00e4te Hamburger, Ann Baneld, G\u00e9rard Performing American Literature Wai Chee Dimock A broad selection of short stories, poems, and novels, accompanied by class performances, culminating in a term project with a signicant writing component. \"Performance\" includes a wide range of activities including: staging; making digital lms and videos; building websites; game design; and creative use of social media. Readings include poetry by Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Claudia Rankine; ction the Environment in the Anthropocene Michael Warner Although the concept of the Anthropocene can be dated in various ways, two of the most important benchmarks seem to be the beginning of industrial production in the late eighteenth century and the uptick in carbon dioxide emissions from the mid-nineteenth century (petroleum came into use during the Civil War). The period between these two moments is also that in which the modern language of the environment took shape, from Cuvier's discovery of extinction and Humboldt's holistic earth science to the transformative work of Thoreau and George P. Marsh. This course shuttles between the contemporary debate about the signicance and consequences of the Anthropocene and a reexamination of that environmental legacy. We look at the complexity of \"nature,\" beginning with the Bartrams, Jeerson, Cuvier, and the transatlantic literatures of natural history; georgics and other genres of nature writing; natural theology; ambiguities of pastoral in American romantic writing (Bryant, mainly); the impact of Humboldt (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman); westward expansion and Native American writing about land; Hudson School painting and landscape architecture. We also think about the country/city polarity and the development of \"grid\" consciousness in places like New York City. One aim is to assess the formation and legacy of key ideas in environmentalism, some of which may now be a hindrance as much as a foundation. Secondary readings from Leo Marx, Henry Nash Smith, and William Cronon, as well as more recent attempts to reconceive environmental history (Joachim Radkau), ecocriticism (Lawrence Buell), and related elds, as well as science journalism (Elizabeth Kolbert). Students are invited to explore a wide range of research projects; and one assignment is to devise a teaching unit for an undergraduate class on the same topic.English Language and Literature 183 ENGL 902b, Elizabeth Bishop Langdon Hammer An experiment in intensive author-centered reading, this course studies the life, writing, and visual art of Elizabeth Bishop using tools from biography, gender studies, queer theory, object relations psychoanalysis, and phenomenology. Topics for discussion include the shape of a woman poet's career in the mid-twentieth-century United States; the relations between poetry and painting, verse and prose, and private and public writing; the idea of minor literature, and the gure of the minor; Bishop as a hemispheric poet; epistolarity; the role of objects and the senses in subject formation; the ordinary, perverse, and fantastic; tourism, cosmopolitanism, and the local; the place of literature in the postwar world order; the poetics of description. In addition to Bishop, readings include, among others, Svetlana Alpers, Christopher Bollas, Judith Butler, Lee Edelman, Melanie America Robert Stepto A study of autobiographical writings from Mary Rowlandson's Indian captivity narrative (1682) to the present. Classic forms such as immigrant, education, and cause narratives; prevailing autobiographical strategies involving place, work, and photographs. Authors include Franklin, Douglass, Jacobs, Antin, Kingston, Uchida, Noreen Khawaja Seminar for humanities doctoral students who have theoretical interests and who are seeking to explore and strengthen the philosophical dimension of their work. Part I of the course is reading and discussion, including philosophical works and works of recent scholarship across disciplines which have something to teach scholars in literary studies, cultural studies, religious studies, and science studies about how to link, for example, the ethnographic and ontological, history and theory of mind, close reading and phenomenology, aect and aesthetics. Part II centers on students' own research projects. Collaborative development, discussion, critique. ENGL Figlerowicz and Jonathan Kramnick What is literary theory today, and what is its history? The aim of the course is to introduce students to central concepts in theory and explore their relation to method. We examine the variety of approaches available within the eld of literary studies, including older ones such as Russian formalism, New Criticism, deconstruction, Marxism, and psychoanalysis, as well as newer ones like actor-network theory and digital humanities research. We explore the basic tenets and histories of these theories in a way that is both critical and open-minded, and discuss their comparative advantages and pitfalls. The focus is on recurrent paradigms, arguments, and topics, and on transhistorical relations among our various schools of literary-theoretical thought. Readings might include work by Ren\u00e9 Wellek, Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Bruno Latour, Judith Butler, Northrop Frye, Fred Moten, and many others. ENGL 961b, Transformations of the Confession: Secularism, Slavery, Sexuality Caleb Smith The confession is a paradoxical speech act. Confessors are supposed to reveal the inmost secrets of themselves, but at the same time they are known to be performing, according to an established script, for an audience endowed with the capacity to judge and punish184 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 them. This seminar takes up the genre of the public confession. We sketch its genealogy from ancient religious styles of truth-telling (The Confessions of St. Augustine) to modern forms of evidence in criminal justice (The Confessions of Nat Turner) while giving special attention to its literary adaptations (The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater ). We then explore the transformation of the confession during the nineteenth century under the pressures of secularization, the slavery crisis, and the emerging science of sexuality. Readings may include works by Augustine, Rousseau, De Quincey, Hogg, Poe, Jacobs, Douglass, Plath, Lorde, and Nabokov. Critical and theoretical sources include Nietzsche, Freud, Foucault, Butler, Brooks, Hartman, and Felski. We pursue some of the themes introduced during the annual conference of the English Institute at Yale in 2018, on the theme of \"truth-telling.\" ENGL 972a, Modern Poetry and Poetics Benjamin Glaser This course explores current debates in poetics, historicism, and formalism through study of the poetry and criticism of the past century. We trace a history of the discipline by way of the poets and readers who helped make literary study what it is and isn't. Special attention is paid to contemporary debates surrounding lyric theory, historical poetics, and recent models of \"New Formalism\" as they each converge with and diverge from earlier formalisms (e.g., New Criticism) and react against historicisms (e.g., cultural studies). We also explore the racial formations at work within the logic of poetic genres and the canons of twentieth-century poetry. ENGL 976a / AMST 840a, Asian Inhumanities Sunny Xiang What might it mean to think from a position other to the \"Western humanities\"? This course takes the \"Asian inhumanities\" as neither a direct opposite nor even a direct challenge to the \"Western humanities,\" but as a heuristic device for self-conscious reflection about critical method, racial formation, knowledge production, and political action. The aim is not necessarily to decenter the human or the humanities\u2014I suspect that we will talk a good deal about both. Rather, we juxtapose \"Asia\" to \"human\" with an openness to contemplating the idiosyncrasies that each reveals about the other. We start by surveying how scholars have posited \"Asia as method\" (to borrow Kuan- Hsing Chen's formulation). From there, we pursue the \"Asian inhumanities\" in two movements. The rst examines historically specic \"inhuman\" typologies (that is, stereotypes) arising from U.S.-Asian encounters: the yellow peril during the era of Asian exclusion, the model minority during the era of Asian inclusion, and the flexible citizen during the era of Asian globalization. The second tracks the relation between \"Asian\" and \"human\" at especially fraught scenes of contact: law, war, gender, biology, and technology. Finally, we approach the \"Asian inhumanities\" as a question of race- based politics, both within and beyond the university. What is at stake in taking the human as a political, ethical, and literary reference point\u2014for example, in desiring well developed and emotionally nuanced characters or even in reading for character at all? How does race gure into alternative critical approaches circulating within the humanities\u2014for example, surface reading, distant reading, new formalism, and weak theory? How does an attention to what is \"Asian\" impact our received critical frameworks for analyzing race? ENGL 990b, The Teaching of English Jill Campbell and Margaret Homans An introduction to the teaching of literature and of writing with attention to the history of the profession and to current issues in higher education such as the corporatization of the university, the role of the state in higher education, and the precarity of theEnglish Language and Literature 185 humanities at the present time. Weekly seminars address a series of issues about teaching: guiding classroom discussion; introducing students to various literary genres; addressing race, class, and gender in the teaching of literature; formulating aims and assignments; grading and commenting on written work; lecturing and serving as a teaching assistant; preparing lesson plans. ENGL 992a, Advanced Pedagogy Heather Klemann Training for graduate students teaching introductory expository writing. Students plan a course of their own design on a topic of their own choosing, and they then put theories of writing instruction into practice by teaching a writing seminar. Prerequisite: open only to graduate students teaching ENGL 114.

The geographical scope of the council's activities extends from Ireland to Italy, and from Portugal to the lands of the former Soviet Union. The council's denition of Europe transcends conventional divisions between Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, and includes the Balkans and Russia. The U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly designated the council a National Resource Center and a FLAS Center under its HEA Title VI program. Further information on the council and the Graduate Certicate of Concentration in European Studies is provided under Non-Degree-Granting Programs, Councils, and Research Institutes in this bulletin. The council administers an M.A. program in European and Russian Studies. This M.A. program is unusual in its embrace of the entire spectrum of European nations and cultures. Its requirements allow students to choose a particular national or thematic focus, geared to their individual interests and language skills, but also ensure that students acquaint themselves with the traditions and issues associated with the other parts of Europe. Students specializing in Russia and Eastern Europe, for example, will concentrate their eorts in that area, but will also take courses that address Europe- wide problems or the countries of Central or Western Europe. The program is suited both to students who wish to pursue further academic studies and to students whose interests are policy-oriented. Fields of Study European languages and literatures; economics; history; political science; law; music; sociology and other social sciences. Special Requirements for the M.A. Degree When applying to the program, students will specify as an area of primary concentration either (1) Russia and Eastern Europe, or (2) Central and Western Europe. All students must complete sixteen graduate-level term courses (or their equivalent) in the various elds related to European and Russian studies. E&RS 900, Europe: Who, What, When, Where?, is required in addition to the sixteen courses and should be taken in the rst year of the program. E&RS 900 is taken as Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory and may not be taken for audit. Students are required to take at least one course in at least three of the four elds relevant to the program, that is, history (including history of art, history of science, and history of music), literature, social sciences, and law. Students can fulll this three- eld requirement by taking Europe-related graduate-level courses from across the University. One of the sixteen graduate-level term courses may be taken for audit. Except for E&RS 900, any other courses graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory may not be counted toward the sixteen-course requirement. For students focusing on Russia and Eastern Europe, two of the sixteen required courses (excluding language courses) must concern the nations of Central and Western Europe. Conversely, for those focusing on Central and Western Europe, two courses must concern Russia and Eastern Europe. For the purposes of this program, language courses in modern European languages count toward the sixteen required courses, even though they have undergraduate course numbers and undergraduate grade modes. If a student takes a language course to fulll the 16-credit degree requirement, the language course may not be taken188 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 for audit. Students with previous language preparation may in certain cases receive documentation of their language prociency on the basis of this work. By the time the degree is completed, all students must demonstrate at least L4 prociency in two modern European languages other than English. Those wishing to focus on Russia and Eastern Europe will need to demonstrate knowledge of Russian or an Eastern European language; those focusing on Central and Western Europe will need to demonstrate knowledge of one of the appropriate languages. In all cases, students are required to demonstrate prociency in two European languages by the end of the third term at Yale. The only exception to this rule is completion of the appropriate full sequence of Yale language classes, certied by the Yale instructor or the director of graduate studies (DGS). Students who wish to take Yale department examinations in French, German, Italian, Spanish, or other West European languages should register for a complete examination (with reading, oral, and grammar portions) with the appropriate Yale department. Students with Russian competence must receive the grade of 1+ or higher on the ACTFL/ETS Rating Scale as administered by the Slavic Languages and Literatures department at Yale, including reading, oral, and grammar portions. Students with competence in an East European language (such as Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, Hungarian, and others by special arrangement) or other European languages must take Yale department-administered examinations. Students who have met the language prociency degree requirement may study a non-European language related to the student's academic and professional goals if the courses are approved by the DGS. In all cases, students will comply with the Policies and Regulations of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, especially regarding degree requirements and academic standing. Through agreements negotiated by the MacMillan Center, the European Studies Council oers joint master's degrees with the Law School, the School of Management, the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, and the School of Public Health. Application for admission must be made to both the Graduate School and the applicable professional school, with notation made on each application that this is to be considered for the joint-degree program. Refer to http://macmillan.yale.edu/academic- programs/joint-degree-programs and contact the European Studies DGS for up-to- date information. The Master's Thesis A master's thesis is required. The master's thesis is based on research in a topic approved by the DGS and advised by a faculty member with specialized competence in the chosen topic. M.A. students must register for E&RS 950, which may count toward the sixteen required courses. E&RS 950 may not be taken for audit. Students may register for one additional independent study to prepare topics and begin research. The master's thesis must be prepared according to department guidelines and is due in two copies in the student's second year on an early-April date as specied by the council.

Bruce Gordon An interdisciplinary seminar designed to provide broad exposure to key topics in modern European studies. Special attention is given to Eastern and Western Europe as well as the humanities and social science disciplines. The seminar is framed by some key theoretical questions, including: What are Europe's boundaries? When and where is \"Europe\"? Is there a narrative to European history? If so, what is it? What makes a European? The seminar also focuses on developing academic writing skills and examining research methodologies. Seminar meetings are combined with the Modern Europe in/and the World Colloquia and feature speakers from the Yale faculty and from other academic institutions. The course is required of all rst-year European and Russian Studies M.A. students but is open to all graduate and professional students.

GRE General Test or MCAT is required. To enter the Ph.D. program, students apply to an interest-based track, usually the Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology track, within the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Course requirements Experimental Pathology students must pass PATH 640, Developing and Writing a Scientic Research Proposal; PATH 650, Cellular and Molecular Biology of Cancer; and PATH 690, Molecular Mechanisms of Disease. Passes in three additional graduate-level, one-term courses are required, which can include courses in biochemistry, genetics, immunology, cell biology, and pathology, to be chosen in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS), according to the student's background and interest. All requirements of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, including the Honors requirement, must be met. In year one, students must also take a seminar course (one in each term) and do three laboratory rotations. Prior to registering for a second year of study, students must successfully complete PATH 660, The Responsible Conduct of Research. In their fourth year of study, all students must successfully complete B&BS 503 , RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students. Honors requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's Honors requirement by the end of the fourth term of full-time study. Students must also maintain an overall High Pass average. Student progress toward these goals is reviewed at the end of the second term. Qualifying examination The qualifying examination of the Experimental Pathology graduate program comprises: (1) enrollment in the BBS/Pathology course Developing and Writing a Scientic Research Proposal (PATH 640) in the fall term of year two and preparation of a proposal on the topic of the student's research; student will receive assistance from a faculty member who will later be part of the qualifying committee; (2) two literature reading periods in the spring term of year two that are specically related to the grant proposal; and (3) an oral exam in which the student is examined by the qualifying exam committee on the research proposal, the reading periods, and general knowledge of experimental pathology. This exam is usually taken in the second term of the second year and is described below. 1.The qualifying examination committee, consisting of three faculty members, will be chosen to examine the student. At least one of the committee members must have a primary appointment in the Department of Pathology, and the thesis adviser is not on the exam committee. The student will read with two committee members. The faculty member who assisted the student during the proposal writing period will serve as the third person on the committee. At the oral exam itself, one member of the committee will be selected as the chairperson responsible for documenting the results of the exam for submission to the DGS. Members of the exam committee should have expertise in areas chosen for reading.192 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 2.All oral exams will follow the same general format. The oral examination will focus on the student's ability to present and defend the research proposal. The student should come to the exam with a short (30-40 minute) presentation of the thesis- related proposal, with visual aids. The actual presentation will take longer since exam committee faculty will interrupt with questions. The committee can also ask questions on topics covered during the reading period and general topics in experimental pathology that will have been covered in courses. The nal evaluation by the exam committee faculty takes into account the student's performance on the examination and performance in lab (based on the adviser's evaluation, solicited by the DGS). A written summary of the qualifying examination evaluation will be prepared by the examination committee chairperson and submitted to the DGS. If the student does not pass the exam, the committee has the option of recommending an additional course of reading and/or written work. The DGS has nal discretion in approving or modifying the recommendations of the committee. Prospectus Upon successful completion of the qualifying examination, the student will constitute a dissertation committee including at minimum three members in addition to the dissertation/thesis adviser. At least two of the committee members must be Pathology department faculty. The membership of the committee must be approved by the DGS. The student will prepare a written thesis prospectus, consisting of a summary of background information in the eld of interest, the specic questions to be answered, a rationale for choosing those questions, and a research plan for addressing those questions. Upon completing the course requirement with at least two terms of Honors, passing the qualifying examination, and submitting a thesis prospectus, students will be admitted to candidacy. This should take place by the end of the third year, and preferably in the second year. Students must then submit a written thesis describing the research and present a thesis research seminar. Additional requirements There is no foreign language requirement. In accordance with the BBS program, Ph.D. students are expected to participate in two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching.

John Williams Assistant Professors Marijeta Bozovic, Rizvana Bradley, Marta Chefranova, Brian Meacham, Camille Thomasson Fields of Study Film and Media Studies is an interdisciplinary eld drawing on the study of the history of art, national cultures and literatures, literary theory, philosophy, anthropology, feminist and queer studies, race and representation, and other areas. To study lm and media at Yale, every doctoral student must be accepted into a combined program involving another discipline. Film and Media Studies oers a combined Ph.D. with African American Studies, American Studies, Comparative Literature, East Asian Languages and Literatures, English, French, German, History of Art, Italian, and Slavic Languages and Literatures. In addition to acquiring a rm grounding in the methods and core material of both lm-media studies and another discipline, the candidate is advised to coordinate a plan of study involving comprehensive knowledge of one or more areas of specialization. Such areas include: 1.Historiography, including archival history, history of technology, silent lm. 2.Aesthetics: theories of the image, adaptation, lm/philosophy, avant-garde lm. British-Irish, French, culture: Hollywood, independent lm, African American cinema. 5.World lm: global image exchange; cinema in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. 6.Documentary as an aesthetic, cultural, and ideological practice. 7.Cinema in its relations with other arts and other media. 8.Screen cultures, screened images, post-cinema, theory and history of media. Through course work, examinations, and the dissertation, the candidate links a lm and media specialty with material and methods coming from the participating discipline. Directors of graduate studies from both programs monitor the candidate's plans and progress.Film and Media Studies 195 Special Admissions Requirements Combined-program applicants should familiarize themselves fully not only with the Film and Media Studies entrance requirements but with those of the other graduate program as well. Since combined-program applicants must be admitted both by Film and Media Studies and by the other department, candidates should make sure that the material they submit with the application clearly addresses the requirements and mission of both graduate programs. The application for Film and Media Studies is administered by the Oce of Graduate Admissions. All applications are to be completed online and can be accessed by visiting its website at http://gsas.yale.edu/admission-graduate-school. In the \"Program of Study\" section of the application, the applicant should choose Film and Media Studies as well as another department, since all students in the program must select a second program to combine with Film and Media Studies. All applications, including writing samples, are read by the admissions committees in both programs. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Every student selected for the combined program is subject to the supervision of the Film and Media Studies program and the relevant participating department. A written protocol between each department and Film and Media Studies outlines the requirements and schedule to be borne in mind as a plan of study is worked out in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS) of Film and Media Studies and the DGS of the participating department. In all cases, students are required to take two core seminars in Film and Media Studies (FILM 601 and FILM 603 ) as well as at least four additional Film and Media Studies seminars. Course requirements vary for participating departments. By October 1 of the third year, all students must have fullled an assignment related to foundational texts and lms. Later that year, students advance to candidacy by completing qualifying examinations and a dissertation prospectus. 1.Qualifying examinations follow the regulations of the participating department with at least one member of the Film and Media Studies Executive Committee participating. 2.The dissertation prospectus is presented to a faculty committee or the entire faculty of the participating department. The prospectus is also circulated to the entire Film and Media Studies Executive Committee for their information and ratication. 3.A defense of method occurs when the dissertation is nearing completion, one or two terms before submission. The purpose of this defense is to provide guidance and feedback at a critical stage, in order to assist the dissertation's nal form. At least three faculty readers meet with the student; the DGS of Film and Media Studies and the DGS of the participating department are also invited to participate. At least one examiner of the dissertation must be a member of the Film and Media Studies Executive Committee and one must be from the participating department. The faculty in Film and Media Studies considers participation in the Teaching Fellows Program to be essential to the professional preparation of graduate students. Students normally teach in years three and four. Every student may expect to assist in two Film and Media Studies courses, one of which will almost certainly be Introduction to Film.196 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Master's Degree M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. Courses FILM 603a / AMST 814a, Historical Methods in Film Study Charles Musser A range of historiographic issues in lm studies, including the roles of technology, exhibition, and spectatorship. Topics include intermediality and intertextuality. Consideration of a range of methodological approaches through a focus on international early cinema and American race cinema of the silent period. Particular attention to the interaction between scholars and archives. FILM 630b / RUSS 714b, Soviet Cinema and the Distribution of Perception John MacKay Soviet lmmakers and theorists in the 1920s were preoccupied with the way that the established cinema harnessed perception in socially determined, class-specic ways, and sought a variety of alternatives. This course examines those alternatives and their limitations, as postulated in theory and realized on lm, as well as their long-term, global influence on theoretical and moving image practice. We examine lms and writings by such gures as Vertov, FILM 710b / AFAM 537b, Contemporary Art, Race, and the Philosophy of Media Rizvana Bradley This course draws from a diverse range of writing in philosophy (especially the philosophy of media), contemporary critical theory (phenomenology, new materialism), contemporary feminist thought, queer theory, and black studies in order to question underlying assumptions about the body and embodied spaces in contemporary art and culture. Drawing from lm, literature, performance, and contemporary art, students think about a range of philosophical and critical themes, including the role of the body, the virtual construction of time and space, questions of aect, and sensation, all of which inform concerns over representation, embodiment, and materiality. FILM 729b / CPLT 716b / GMAN 730b, German New Waves in Cold War Europe Katie Trumpener Before 1961, Berlin was the best place in Europe to follow both Eastern and Western Europe's emerging cinematic New Waves. And rst in East, then in West Germany, young lmmakers developed distinctive approaches to political and documentary lmmaking, to the Nazi past and the Cold War, to class, gender, and social transformation. This course juxtaposes the two German New Waves, focusing on aesthetic ferment, institutional barriers, and transformation. Features, documentaries, and experimental lms by Gerhard Klein, Konrad Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Herbert Helke Sander, Helke Misselwitz, read against other Eastern and Western New Wave lms (i.e., by Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz, Andrzej Munk, Alain Resnais, Mikhail Kalatozov, Milos and FILM 736b / AMST 832a and AMST 833b, Documentary Film Workshop Charles Musser This workshop in audiovisual scholarship explores ways to present research through the moving image. Students work within a Public Humanities framework to make a documentary that draws on their disciplinary elds of study. Designed to fulll requirements for the M.A. with a concentration in Public Humanities. FILM 760b / CPLT 905b / GMAN 760b, Intermediality in Film Brigitte Peucker Film is a hybrid medium, the meeting point of several others. This course focuses on the relationship of lm to theater and painting, suggesting that where two media are in evidence, there is usually a third. Topics include space, motion, color, theatricality, tableau vivant, ekphrasis, spectatorship, and new media. Readings feature art historical and lm theoretical texts as well as essays pertinent to specic lms. Films by Fassbinder, Bergman, Murnau, von Trier, Rohmer, Godard, Kiarostami, and others, concluding with three lms by Peter Greenaway. FILM 775a / RUSS 696a, Post-Stalin Literature and Film Katerina Clark The main developments in Russian and Soviet literature and lm from Stalin's death in 1953 to the present. FILM 800a / CPLT 921a, Styles and Techniques in Recent Art Cinema Dudley Andrew How much does the art of cinema in the twenty-rst century resemble that of the previous half-century? Have massive changes visible in production, distribution, and exhibition also aected the goals and ambitions of lm artists? Or do today's auteurs and cinematographers work as their counterparts did decades ago, deploying whatever techniques current technology permits in a quest for a style that may bring out something authentic about themselves, the world, or the medium? Analyzing lms by such contemporary auteurs as Olivier Assayas, Claire Denis, Carlos Reygadas, Lav Diaz, David Lynch, and Hong Sang-soo, we measure new styles against techniques deployed by classic and modern auteurs like Mizoguchi, Welles, Cocteau, and Hitchcock. What new aesthetic (and practical) issues face lmmakers as they conceive their projects? We look at screen format, including 3-D; elastic temporality, especially slow motion; special eects, including forms animation; superimposition, including multiple screens; long-takes and camera movement; montage and alternatives to cutting; advances in sound design. Have the new narrative forms and the new types of subject matter associated with our century's most dicult lms (L'Intrus, Werckmeister Harmonies, La Mort de Louis XIV, Twin Peaks) given rise to the styles of major directors, or are they the by-product of these styles? Does style matter in the way it did during cinema's rst century? FILM 804a / Kreuzer has been assigned\u2014and might yet assume\u2014various roles in genealogies of technical media. This seminar explores both what media archaeology and other recent approaches in media studies and science and technology studies hold for an understanding of the nature of opera, and what opera might in turn contribute to a historically expanded perspective on modern and digital multimedia. In addition to such theoretical topics as the role of architecture, strategies of acoustic immersion, the development of illusionist devices, the orchestra as technology, and Wagner's theories, we examine the medial congurations in select operatic scenes and their198 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 renditions, from the illusionist picture-frame stage to present-day mobile or site- specic conceptions. Projects are tailored to students' interests and disciplines. Reading knowledge of Western musical notation is helpful but not required of students from outside the Music department. FILM 806a / WGSS 853a, Archives: Histories, Practices, Theories, and Formations Laura Wexler This seminar studies the co-constitution of objects-with-documents and undocumented people. We explore theoretical, historical, material, practical, methodological, and curatorial questions related to the operation and status of the archive in this migration of objects and people. Students are asked to work collaboratively in and with archives as sources and tools, and to experiment with creating archives of their own. The seminar involves some travel to Brown and some irregular hours that are mentioned in the syllabus. FILM 810b / AMST 729b / WGSS 746b, Visual Kinship, Families, and Photography Laura Wexler Exploration of the history and practice of family photography from an interdisciplinary perspective. Study of family photographs from the analog to the digital era, from snapshots to portraits, and from instrumental images to art exhibitions. Particular attention to the ways in which family photographs have helped establish gendered and racial hierarchies and examination of recent ways of reconceiving these images. FILM 830a / CPLT 916a / ITAL 590a, Literature into Film Millicent Marcus We study a series of written works and their cinematic adaptations, considering rst the texts in autonomous, literary terms, and then their transformation into audiovisual spectacles. In most cases we screen the lm on Tuesday evening and do a comparative study in the Thursday class period, making extensive use of video clips to do close visual analysis of scenes in the light of their corresponding textual sources. Rather than develop a general theory of adaptation, we construct methodological approaches on an ad hoc basis, taking each instance of adaptation as a case study amenable to a variety of methodologies\u2014psychoanalytic, feminist, ideological, generic, semiotic, and so forth. The class is conducted as a seminar, and active student participation is expected. There are two papers\u2014one shorter one of a critical nature at midterm and a nal research paper (approximately 15-20 pages). Films examined include (tentatively) Pasolini's Medea and Tavianis' Venice, Rosi's Three Brothers, Salvatores's I'm Not Afraid, and De Sica's Two Women. Writing assignments comprise 75 percent of the nal grade and class participation 25 percent. FILM 833a, Semiotics Francesco Casetti The seminar discusses the most relevant concepts and categories elaborated by semiotics in order to provide analytical tools for \"close readings\" of verbal or visual texts, narrative forms, cultural objects, artifacts, and social situations. Semiotics's foundational goal consisted in retracing how meaning emerges and circulates in connection with a variety of objects, from literary works to social rituals, from natural phenomena to articial languages. In an attempt to revamp semiotics's main task, we begin from the opposed conceptualization of \"sign\" in the Saussurean and Peircean traditions and from the opposed ideas of \"semiosis\" that they elicit. Then, moving from \"sign\" to \"text,\" we analyze the structures and the dynamics of discourses\u2014whether verbal, visual, musical, etc. A particular stress is put on the semantic and syntactic structures of narrative texts in an attempt to draw from them a model of human andFilm and Media Studies 199 nonhuman action. The third section retraces the way enunciation produces subjectivity and deixis, in order to gain a better understanding of the context-bound nature of discourses and some tools for the analysis of context itself as a semiotic entity. We end by discussing the complex strategies that allow a discourse to tackle \"reality\" and \"truth\"\u2014in the hope of dismantling the current use of naive epistemologies. Analytical tools are tested in class through close readings of a great variety of texts and situations, from Melania Trump's depictions to Genesis, from short novels to social encounters. FILM 872a / EALL 580a, East Asian Martial Arts Cinema Aaron Gerow An investigation of the martial arts lms of East Asia (Japan, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan), including the samurai lm, kung-fu and karate lm, and wuxia lm, and the roles they play in constructing nationalism and transnationalism, gender, stardom, spirituality, and mediality. FILM 921b / EALL 806b, Research in Japanese Film History Aaron Gerow Theorizations of lm and culture in Japan from the 1910s to the present. Through readings in the works of a variety of authors, the course explores both the articulations of cinema in Japanese intellectual discourse and how this embodies the shiing position of lm in Japanese popular cultural history.200 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Forestry & Environmental Studies Kroon Doctoral Studies Karen Seto [F] (380 St., Rm. 102, 203.432.9784, karen.seto@yale.edu) Berlyn, Mark Bradford, Benjamin Cashore, Michael Dove, Daniel Esty, Timothy Gregoire, Edgar Hertwich, Matthew Kotchen, Xuhui Lee, Robert Mendelsohn, Chadwick Oliver, Peter Raymond, James Saiers, Oswald Schmitz, Karen Seto, David Skelly, John Wargo, Julie Zimmerman Associate Professors Marian Chertow, Kenneth Gillingham Assistant Professors Craig Brodersen, Liza Comita, Justin Farrell, Eli Fenichel Fields of Study Fields include agroforestry; biodiversity ethics; environmental governance; environmental health risk assessment; environmental history; environmental law and politics; environmental and resource policy; forest ecology; hydrology; industrial ecology; industrial environmental management; and anatomy; pollution management; population ecology; resource economics; energy and the environment, silviculture, social ecology; stand development, tropical ecology and conservation; urban planning; water resource management; environmental management and social ecology in developing countries; urban ecology. Special Admissions Requirements Applicants should hold a bachelor's or master's degree in a eld related to natural resources, such as forestry, or in a relevant discipline of the natural or social sciences, such as biology, chemistry, economics, or mathematics.

Aside from this requirement, there is no required curriculum of credit courses and no formal language requirement. Courses of study are individually designated through consultation between degree candidates and their advisers and dissertation committees. The amount of course work required will depend on the previous training of the student, but the normal requirement for a student with no previous graduate training is three or four courses per term for four terms. The program of each student will be evaluated at the end ofForestry & Environmental Studies 201 the rst year of residence. At least two term grades of Honors are required in the rst two years of study; however, it is anticipated that grades of Honors or High Pass will be achieved in two-thirds of all courses taken. A written and oral qualifying examination is required upon completion of the course requirements. Students are expected to take the examination by the end of their second year, although this can be extended to the third year in cases with appropriate extenuating circumstances. At the time of the qualifying examination, the student must present a prospectus of the research work proposed for the dissertation. Successful completion of the qualifying examination and submission of the prospectus will result in admission to candidacy. Upon completion of the dissertation, the candidate must make unbound copies of the dissertation available to the faculty and appear for an oral examination at a time and place designated by the director of doctoral studies. Copies of the approved dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School. Depending upon the nature of the dissertation topic, completion of the Ph.D. degree normally requires four years. Teaching and research experiences are regarded as integral parts of the graduate training program in Forestry & Environmental Studies. All students are required to serve as teaching fellows (10 hours per week) for four terms. The nature of the teaching assignment is determined in cooperation with the student's major adviser and the director of doctoral studies. With the permission of the director of doctoral studies, the total teaching requirement may be reduced for students who are awarded fellowships supported by outside funding. Regardless of outside funding, all doctoral students must serve as teaching fellows for a minimum of two terms. Master's Degrees M.Phil.

Special Admissions Requirements A thorough command of French is expected, as well as a good preparation in all elds of French literature. Applicants should submit a twenty-page writing sample in French. This can consist of one twenty-page paper or several shorter papers that total twenty pages. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree (1) Candidates must demonstrate prociency in two languages (in addition to English and French). Prociency is dened as the successful completion of one year of study at the college level or reading prociency at the graduate level. Students must fulll one language requirement no later than the beginning of their third term of study. The second language requirement must be satised before the prospectus can be approved. (2) During the rst two years of study, students normally take sixteen term courses. These must include Old French (FREN 610 ) and at least two graduate-level term courses outside the department. They may include one term of an approved language course taken as a means of fullling one of the language requirements, and as many as four graduate-level term courses outside the department. At the end of the rst year of study, a grade of Honors must be obtained in at least two graduate term courses taught by core faculty within the French department. By the end of the second year, a grade of Honors must be obtained in at least four graduate term courses taught by core faculty within the French department. The total required number of Honors204 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 in French department courses taught by core faculty is thus four. (3) A qualifying oral examination takes place during the sixth term. The examination is designed to demonstrate students' mastery of the French language, their knowledge and command of selected topics in literature, and their capacity to present and discuss texts and issues. (4) Aer having successfully passed the qualifying oral examination, students are required to submit a dissertation prospectus for approval, normally no later than the end of the term following the oral examination. In order to be admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must complete all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus. Students must be admitted to candidacy by the end of the seventh term. Teaching is considered an integral part of the preparation for the Ph.D. degree, and all students are required to teach for at least one year. Opportunities to teach undergraduate courses normally become available to candidates in their third year, aer consideration of the needs of the department and of the students' capacity both to teach and to fulll their nal requirements. Prior to teaching, students take a language- teaching methodology course. Combined Ph.D. Program The French department also oers three combined Ph.D.s: one in French and African American Studies (in conjunction with the Department of African American Studies), one in French and Renaissance Studies (in conjunction with the Renaissance Studies Program), and one in French and Film and Media Studies (in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program). Students in all of these combined degree programs are subject to all the requirements for a Ph.D. in French, with exceptions noted below. In addition, they must fulll certain requirements particular to the combined program. The combined Ph.D. in French and African American Studies is most appropriate for students who intend to concentrate in and write a dissertation on the literature of the francophone Caribbean. Students take sixteen term courses, including Theorizing Racial Formations (AFAM 505), which is a required course for all rst-year graduate students in the combined program, and three other graduate-level African American Studies courses: (1) a history course, (2) a social science course, and (3) a course in African American literature or culture. Ten of the remaining twelve courses are devoted to the full spectrum of periods and elds in French and francophone literature and culture; the two remaining courses can be in any eld. Students in the combined degree program should fulll the French department's language requirements by gaining prociency in either a Creole language of the Caribbean or Spanish, as well as by demonstrating competence in a second foreign language that is directly relevant to the study of the Caribbean. The students' oral examinations normally include two topics of African American content. The dissertation prospectus must be approved by the director of graduate studies both in the French department and in African American Studies, and nal approval of the dissertation must come from both departments. For further details see African American Studies. Students in the combined Ph.D. program in French and Renaissance Studies will take nine courses in French and seven in Renaissance Studies. Students must learn Latin and Italian. The oral examination will consist of seven topics: four in French and three in Renaissance Studies. Both the dissertation prospectus and the nal dissertation mustFrench 205 be approved by the French department and the program in Renaissance Studies. For further details see Renaissance Studies. For students in the combined Ph.D. program in French and Film and Media Studies, the oral examination will normally include one topic on lm theory and one on French lm. Both the dissertation prospectus and the nal dissertation must be approved by the French department and the program in Film and Media Studies. In addition, Film and Media Studies requires a dissertation defense. For further details see Film and Media Studies. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may petition for the M.A. degree aer a minimum of one year of study in residence, upon completion of one of the language requirements and eight courses, of which at least six are in French. Two grades of Honors in French graduate courses are required. Program materials are available on the department's website at http://french.yale.edu/ academics/graduate-program. Courses FREN 624a / Slavery and Its Aermath in French and Francophone Literature Christopher Miller The practices, eects, and culture of both slavery and emancipation in the French empire and the postcolonial francophone world, as seen through literary writings. Readings on New France, the Code Noir, the Encyclop\u00e9die, the Haitian Revolution. Literary authors include Olympe de Gouges, Claire de Duras, Victor European Cultural History Carolyn Dean This course covers readings in European cultural history from 1789 to the present, with a focus on Western Europe. FREN 812b, The Old French Fable and Fabliaux R. Howard Bloch A study of Marie de France's 103 animal tales and some of the anonymous \"Ysopets\" as well as of the 170 comic verse tales whose veins of satire, parody, comedy of language, situation, character, and farce are at the root of the European comic tradition. We read the fables and the fabliaux against the background of twelh- and thirteenth-century social, religious, and literary culture. Fables to be read in the bilingual (Old French and English) edition of Harriet Speigel and fabliaux in the recently published bilingual edition, with translations by Ned Dubin. Conducted in English. FREN 829a, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais et Marguerite de Navarre Edwin Duval An in-depth study of two authors who dened the early Renaissance in France. Closely allied in many respects but diametrically opposed in others, Rabelais and Marguerite de Navarre are equally representative of a complex, turbulent age. Readings include Rabelais's four \"Books of Pantagruel\" and the most important works of Marguerite's abundant and varied oeuvre: songs, farces, the so-called Heptameron. Conducted in French.206 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 FREN 861b, Margins of the Enlightenment Pierre Saint-Amand This course proposes a critical examination of the French Enlightenment, with a focus on issues of progress, universalism, and race. We confront these notions with approaches that have emerged in the postcolonial eld of studies as well as gender studies. Authors from the clandestine and underground philosophical milieu are also studied. We are assisted by contemporary historians and critics of the Enlightenment, principally Foucault, Hunt, and Darnton. Readings are in Mme de Gragny, Mme de Duras, Boyer d'Argens, [Printing Wars] Sta Seventeenth-century France brought about a new relationship to writing, information, and media that transformed the style and the purpose of literature. In this course we explore various kinds of disputes in which writing and printing played a part. We examine literary quarrels and the way they created success and stars; delve into questions about propaganda, early modern fake news, and innovative strategies the government developed to control public opinion; and explore competition between the printed book and digital humanities, thinking about the way digital humanities have changed the way literature is studied and approached. Students create their own digital edition as an initiation to digital humanities. To become more familiar with book history, we also visit the Beinecke Library and try the Sterling Library's printing press.

GRE General Test scores are required. A pertinent Subject Test in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology, or Chemistry is recommended. To enter the Ph.D. program, students apply to the Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics, and Development (MCGD) track within the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree The Ph.D. program in Genetics is designed to provide the student with a broad background in general genetics and the opportunity to conduct original research in a specic area of genetics. The student is expected to acquire a broad understanding of genetics, spanning knowledge of at least three basic areas of genetics, which include molecular, cellular, organismal, and population genetics. Normally this requirement is accomplished through the satisfactory completion of formal courses, many of which cover more than one of these areas. Students are required to pass at least ve graduate- level courses that are taken for a grade. Advanced graduate study becomes increasingly focused on the successful completion of original research and the preparation of a written dissertation under the direct supervision of a faculty adviser along with the guidance of a thesis committee. A qualifying examination is given during the second year of study. This examination consists of a period of directed reading with the faculty followed by the submission of two written proposals and an oral examination. Following the completion of course work and the qualifying examination, the student submits a dissertation prospectus and is admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. There is no language requirement. An important aspect of graduate training in genetics is the acquisition of communication and teaching skills. Students participate in presentation seminars and two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching at the TF-10 level. Teaching activities are drawn from a diverse menu of lecture, laboratory, and seminar courses given at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels. Students are not expected to teach during their rst year. In addition to all other requirements, students must successfully complete GENE 901 , First-Year Introduction to Research\u2014Ethics: Scientic Integrity in Biomedical Research, prior to the end of their rst year of study. In their fourth year of study, all students must successfully complete B&BS 503 , RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students. Honors Requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's Honors requirement by the end of the fourth term of full-time study. M.D./Ph.D. Students M.D./Ph.D. students aliate with the Department of Genetics graduate program via a dierent route than other incoming graduate students in the department, resulting in some modication of the academic requirements for the Ph.D. portion of the M.D./ Ph.D. degree. Typically, one or more research rotations is done during the rst two210 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 years of medical school (in many cases, the rst rotation is done during the summer between years one and two). No set number of research rotations is required. M.D./ Ph.D. students ocially aliate with the Department of Genetics aer selecting a thesis adviser and consulting with the director of graduate studies (DGS). M.D./ Ph.D. students interested in Genetics are required to consult with the DGS prior to formal aliation to determine an appropriate set of courses tailored to the student's background and interests. The courses, rotations, and teaching requirements for M.D./Ph.D. students entering the Genetics graduate program (see below) are modied from the normal requirements for Ph.D. students. Besides the modications in these three requirements, M.D./Ph.D. students in the Department of Genetics are subject to all of the same requirements as the other graduate students in the department. Courses Four graduate-level courses taken for a grade are required (two Yale graduate- level courses taken for a grade during medical school may be counted toward this requirement at the discretion of the DGS). Course work is aimed at providing a rm basis in genetics and in cellular molecular mechanisms, with graduate-level prociency in genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry. Required courses: In addition to the four graduate-level courses, all M.D./Ph.D. students must take: Genomic Methods for Genetic Analysis (GENE 760 ); Graduate Student Seminar: Critical Analysis and Presentation of Scientic Literature (2 terms; GENE 675 and GENE 676 , graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory); Ethics: Scientic Integrity in Biomedical Research (as part of GENE 901 , graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory). Recommended courses: Advanced Eukaryotic Molecular Biology (GENE 743 ); Biochemical and Biophysical Approaches in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCDB 630 ); Molecules to Systems (CBIO 502 ); Frontiers (CBIO 601 ). Electives: Other courses may be taken in a wide variety of elds relevant to the biological and biomedical sciences. Laboratory rotations One or more rotations are necessary to identify a thesis adviser. No set number of research rotations is required. Teaching One term of teaching is required. Previous teaching while enrolled at the Yale School of Medicine may count toward this requirement at the discretion of the DGS. Qualifying exam M.D./Ph.D. students take their qualifying exam in the term following the completion of their course work. The structure of the qualifying exam is identical to that for other Ph.D. students in Genetics. Students read with three faculty members for ve weeks, one of whom supervises the reading on the thesis research topic, but who is not the thesis adviser. The following two weeks are devoted to writing two research proposals, one on the student's thesis research. An oral exam follows in the eighth week. Prospectus M.D./Ph.D. students submit their prospectus once their qualifying exam has been completed, but no later than the 30th of June following their exam.Genetics 211 Candidacy M.D./Ph.D. students will be admitted to candidacy once they have completed their course work, obtained two Honors grades, passed their qualifying exam, and submitted their dissertation prospectus. Thesis committee M.D./Ph.D. students are required to have one thesis committee meeting per year, beginning the term aer passing their qualifying exam. However, students are strongly encouraged to consider having additional meetings if they feel their project could benet from the assistance of members of the thesis committee. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.S. Students are not admitted for this degree. They may receive this recognition if they leave Yale without completing the qualifying exam but have satised the course requirements as described above, as well as the Graduate School's Honors requirement. Students who are eligible for or who have already received the M.Phil. will not be awarded the M.S. Prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the BBS website (http://bbs.yale.edu), MCGD Track.

Special Admissions Requirement All students must provide evidence of mastery of German upon application. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students are required to demonstrate, besides prociency in German, a reading knowledge of one other foreign language in the third term of study. French is recommended, although occasionally, on consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS), other relevant languages may be substituted. The faculty in German considers teaching to be essential to the professional preparation of graduate students. Four terms of teaching are required beginning in the third year of study. Students normally teach undergraduate language courses under supervision for at least three terms. Other teaching experiences are available thereaer in literature, theory, lm, etc. In the rst two years of study, students take four courses per term. Three of these sixteen courses in the rst four terms may be audited. Oral examinations must be passed in the h and sixth terms of study, and a dissertation prospectus should be submitted no later than the end of the sixth term. All students will be asked to defend the prospectus in an informal discussion with the faculty. The defense will take place before the prospectus is ocially approved, usually in May of the sixth term. Students are admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus. Candidates220 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 who wish to write the dissertation in a language other than English, in this case in German, should notify the DGS at the moment of the prospectus defense. Aer the submission of the prospectus, the student's time is devoted mainly to the preparation of the dissertation. A dissertation committee will be set up for each student at work on the dissertation. It is expected that students will periodically pass their work along to members of their committee, so that faculty members in addition to the dissertation adviser can make suggestions well before the dissertation is submitted. Dras of each chapter must be submitted in a timely fashion to all members of the student's committee: the rst chapter should be submitted to the committee by February 1 of the fourth year of study; the second chapter should be submitted by January 1 of the h year. There will be a formal review of the rst chapter. Aer the dissertation is submitted, the DGS convenes a defense colloquium with the candidate, the committee, and invited guests. Two concentrations are available to graduate students: Germanic Literature and German Studies. There is a special combined degree with Film and Media Studies; see below. Special Requirements for the Germanic Literature Concentration During the rst two years of study, students are required to take sixteen term courses, four of which may be taken outside the department. Three courses may be audited. Special Requirements for the German Studies Concentration During the rst two years of study, students are required to take sixteen term courses, seven of which may be taken outside the department. Three of those courses may be audited. Students are asked to dene an area of concentration and will meet with appropriate advisers from both within and outside the department. Combined Ph.D. Program with Film and Media Studies The Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures also oers, in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in Germanic Languages and Literatures and Film and Media Studies. For further details, see Film and Media Studies. Applicants to the combined program must indicate on their application that they are applying both to Film and Media Studies and to Germanic Languages and Literatures. All documentation within the application should include this information. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations.

Courses GMAN 571a, Robert Musil's of the Novel R\u00fcdiger Campe Musil's unnished, gigantic novel Man without Qualities (published 1930-33) is one of the quintessential modernist (interwar) European novels. Close (i.e., selective) reading of the novel is introduced by examples from Musil's earlier highly experimental narratives (Unions; The Blackbird), and it is accompanied by looking into Musil's widespread scientic and sociolegal interests, which are relevant for the novel (statistics and probability; the Vienna Circle and the modern science of philosophy; theories of accountability and the case study; Wagner and Romantic music; the theory of the image in the age of cinema). Taking as its point of departure the intertwining of essayistic writing and narration that characterizes Man without Qualities, the reading centers on the self-theorization of the novel and, even more fundamental, the question of prose as literary form and method of notation. Readings in English or German. Discussions in English. GMAN 593a / CPLT 954a, Reading Theory Katrin Truestedt From the new form of literary theory taking shape in romanticism to recent German media studies, this course examines the relation of close readings of singular texts to larger theoretical claims. We reflect on the eminent status that literary readings have attained for broader theoretical and philosophical projects. We specically focus on a certain theoretical milieu in which far-reaching theoretical claims were not merely exemplied or illustrated by, but in fact developed from distinct practices of (close) reading of particular literary texts. The aim is to analyze this distinct type of theory by investigating the scenes of reading that major theoretical endeavors depended upon, in order to trace the trajectory of theory and turn to more recent theoretical endeavors, to discuss the changed status that reading has for them. Among the authors read are Schlegel, Benjamin, de Man, Derrida, Blumenberg, Butler, Kittler, PHIL Heidegger's Being Time Martin H\u00e4gglund A systematic, chapter-by-chapter study of Heidegger's Being and Time, arguably the most important work of philosophy of the twentieth century. All the major themes of the book are addressed in detail, with a particular emphasis on care, time, death, and the meaning of being.

GMAN 654b / CPLT in Society and Aesthetics Kirk Wetters Starting with Kant, the organic is dened as a processual relation of the part and the whole, thereby providing a new model of the individual as a self-contained totality. We explore the implications of this conception in Goethe's writings on morphology (The Metamorphosis of Plants, \"Orphic Primal Words\"), the Romantics' Athenaeum, Hanslick's On the Beautiful in Music, Oswald Spengler's cultural morphology, the concept of222 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 autopoiesis in Maturana and Varela, Luhmann's systems theory, and Canguilhem's critique of the analogy of organic life and society. GMAN 730b / CPLT 716b / FILM 729b, German New Waves in Cold War Europe Katie Trumpener Before 1961, Berlin was the best place in Europe to follow both Eastern and Western Europe's emerging cinematic New Waves. And rst in East, then in West Germany, young lmmakers developed distinctive approaches to political and documentary lmmaking, to the Nazi past and the Cold War, to class, gender, and social transformation. This course juxtaposes the two German New Waves, focusing on aesthetic ferment, institutional barriers, and transformation. Features, documentaries, and experimental lms by Gerhard Klein, Konrad Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Herbert Helke Sander, Helke Misselwitz, read against other Eastern and Western New Wave lms (i.e., by Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz, Andrzej Munk, Being a Person R\u00fcdiger Campe In Western experience, the social and legal notion of a \"person\" has been deeply informed by how \"persons\" are formed and performed onstage and in narration, and vice versa. Readings focus on three areas: (1) basic texts on the history of the notion of \"person\" and \"character\" in legal, poetical, and philosophical contexts from Aristotle to modernity; (2) the performance of personhood in the rebirth of modern theater in early modern times; and (3) the narrative evocation of a new modern character in the rise of the modern novel. In order to bring into view the performative and aesthetic dimensions of personhood we discuss questions such as: What does it mean to appear as a person on a stage? What does it take to appear as a certain character (e.g., as reflected in commedia dell'arte, Shakespeare, Racine, Lessing)? What is a main and what is a supporting character (e.g., as reflected in Defoe, Richardson, Goethe, Kleist, Mary Shelley)? How can a protagonist of a novel be constituted, and how is the protagonist's identity dened and secured? Gender, race, and social class are of relevance throughout, as well as the question of being a nonperson (a madman, an animal, a monster, an outcast). None GMAN 760b / CPLT 905b / FILM 760b, Intermediality in Film Brigitte Peucker Film is a hybrid medium, the meeting point of several others. This course focuses on the relationship of lm to theater and painting, suggesting that where two media are in evidence, there is usually a third. Topics include space, motion, color, theatricality, tableau vivant, ekphrasis, spectatorship, and new media. Readings feature art historical and lm theoretical texts as well as essays pertinent to specic lms. Films by Fassbinder, Bergman, Murnau, von Trier, Rohmer, Godard, Kiarostami, and others, concluding with three lms by Peter Greenaway.

The programmatic interests of the institute focus on development; ethics, leadership, and political life; empirical and research methods; global economics; global security; human rights;224 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 democracy; transparency and governance; and IGOs and international cooperation and diplomacy. The Jackson Institute for Global Aairs administers the two-year Master of Arts (M.A.) and the one-year Master of Advanced Study (M.A.S.) degrees in Global Aairs. The y to sixty students in the M.A. program combine fundamental training in core disciplines in Global Aairs with an individualized curriculum that has relevance to current international issues. Students in the M.A.S. program select courses based on their individual academic and professional goals. In addition to courses in the Global Aairs program, students take courses throughout the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Yale's professional schools. Fields of Study The programs are designed to combine breadth of knowledge of the basic disciplines of global aairs with depth of specialization in a particular academic discipline, geographic area, specialized functional issue, and/or professional eld. The M.A. program is designed primarily for students seeking an advanced degree before beginning a career in global aairs; joint degrees are oered with the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, the Law School, the School of Management, and the School of Public Health. The M.A.S. program is aimed at midcareer professionals with extensive experience in a eld of global aairs such as, but not limited to, international security, diplomacy, and development. Special Admissions Requirements Applicants to either program must take the GRE General Test; students whose native language is not English and who did not earn their undergraduate degree at an English- language university must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The minimum score on the TOEFL is 610 on the paper-based test or 102 on the Internet-based test. Entering M.A. students are strongly encouraged to have taken introductory courses in microeconomics and macroeconomics prior to matriculation. Special Requirements for the M.A. Degree The M.A. in Global Aairs requires two years of graduate study at Yale. To complete the degree, students must pass sixteen courses, including the core requirements, demonstrate prociency in a modern language, complete a summer internship or project, and maintain the grade average specied below. Core Students take GLBL 801 , GLBL 802 , and GLBL 803 during the rst term of enrollment. Any exceptions are to be made at the discretion of the director of graduate studies (DGS). Language requirement The equivalent of four terms of language study at Yale is required to graduate. This competence must be demonstrated through successful completion of a Yale L4 class or by testing into a Yale L5 class. International students who completed secondary school or a university degree in a language other than English will be considered to have met the language requirement. Students may study language as part of their Yale program. Any exceptions are to be made at the discretion of the DGS.Global Aairs 225 Summer internship requirement All students enrolled in the Global Aairs M.A. program are required to use the summer between the rst and second years of the program to further their professional or academic education. It is expected that this requirement be fullled by obtaining experience through full-time employment or a full-time internship. The requirement may also be fullled by completing language study, other relevant course work, or independent research on an approved topic. Each rst-year student must le a form with the director of career services before June 1 stating the nature of the student' s summer internship or approved alternative and submit a self-evaluation form by September 1. Expectation of academic performance M.A. candidates are required to achieve at least two grades of Honors, while maintaining a High Pass average. To remain in good academic standing at the end of the rst year, M.A. students are expected to complete half of the course work required for the degree, with at least a High Pass average and one grade of Honors. Students who do not have at least a High Pass average or the required number of courses at the end of the rst year will not be allowed to continue in the program. Special Requirements for the M.A.S. Degree The M.A.S. in Global Aairs requires one year of graduate study at Yale. To complete the degree, students must pass eight courses in one year of full-time study. Courses are chosen in consultation with the DGS at the start of each term. The program of study is customized to a student's individual academic and professional goals. Special Requirements for the M.A. Joint-Degree Programs Joint-degree candidates must fulll all of the requirements of both programs in which they are enrolled before receiving either degree. Joint-degree students must take at least twelve graduate-level courses in Arts and Sciences departments or in professional schools other than the one granting the joint degree toward the Global Aairs program requirements. Three of these will be GLBL 801, GLBL 802, and GLBL 803, though the DGS may waive a portion of the core for a joint-degree candidate. Two of the twelve courses may be language courses. Applicants to the joint-degree programs must apply separately, by the appropriate deadline, to the Graduate School for the Global Aairs M.A. program and to the professional school involved. Decisions on admissions and fellowship support are made independently by each school. Students are encouraged to apply to both programs simultaneously. They may also apply during their rst year at Yale to the second program for a joint degree. If accepted into the new program, they must receive approval for credit allocation upon registration from both degree programs.

Prerequisite: two terms of introductory economics. GLBL 529a / CDE 585 / WGSS 529a, Sexuality, Gender, Health, and Human Rights Alice Miller This course explores the application of human rights perspectives and practices to issues in regard to sexuality and health. Through reading, interactive discussion, paper presentation, and occasional outside speakers, students learn the tools and implications of applying rights and law to a range of sexuality and health-related topics. The overall goal is twofold: to engage students in the world of global sexual health and rights policy making as a eld of social justice and public health action; and to introduce them to conceptual tools that can inform advocacy and policy formation and evaluation. Class participation, short reaction papers, and a nal paper are required. GLBL 536b, Human Rights: Theories and Practices Thania Sanchez The aim of this seminar is to engage in the normative and empirical evaluation of human rights promotion eorts by NGOs, international organizations, and states. We discuss current theories and debates about how human rights work. On the empirical front we discuss the ecacy of tools used to promote human rights, such as advocacy campaigns, naming and shaming, mass mobilization, sanctions, aid and development, and law and courts. Some of the areas of human rights under discussion include civil and political rights, genocide and crimes against humanity, refugee rights, and women's rights. GLBL 537a, Reporting and Writing on War and Humanitarian Disasters Sta This course examines how to identify, interview, and document human rights violations in the eld. It is aimed at students who want to work as journalists, advocates, or policy makers, and at those who want to work as practitioners during a conflict or humanitarian crisis or under extreme circumstances. The instructor brings twenty-ve years as a eld reporter in war zones into the classroom: the goal is to make the learning functional. The course teaches students how to compile their ndings in the form of reports and articles for newspapers and magazines as well as advocacy letters, op- eds, and blogs. We develop skills for \"crunching\" talking points for presentations and brieng papers. Each week focuses on a theme and links it to a geographical conflict. Students emerge with practical research, writing, and presentation skills when dealing with sensitive human rights material\u2014for instance, victims' evidence. GLBL 543b, Practicum in Data Analysis Using Stata Justin Thomas This course provides students with practical hands-on instruction in the analysis of survey data using the statistical package Stata. It serves as a bridge between the theory of statistics/econometrics and the practice of social science research. Throughout the term students learn to investigate a variety of policy and management issues using data from the United States as well as several developing countries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of the statistical package Stata. Prerequisites: graduate course in statistics and permission of the instructor.Global Aairs 227 GLBL 552a, Asia Now: Human Rights, Globalization, Cultural Conflicts Jing Tsu This course examines contemporary and global issues in Asia (east, southeast, northeast, south), in a historical and interdisciplinary context that includes international law, policy debates, cultural issues, security, military history, media, science and technology, and cyber warfare.

GLBL 560a, Religion and Global Politics since 1989 Daniel Steinmetz Jenkins This course examines the increasing influence that religion has had on global politics since the end of the Cold War. It attempts to narrate the rise and the fall of secular governance since 1989 in such places as central Europe, Russia, India, Turkey, and elsewhere. Concepts to be discussed include populism, traditionalism, post-secularism, religious freedom, etc. GLBL 570a, Negotiating International Agreements: The Case of Climate Change Susan Biniaz This seminar is a practical introduction to the negotiation of international agreements, with a focus on climate change. Through the climate lens, students explore the crosscutting features of international agreements, the process of international negotiations, the development of national positions, advocacy of national positions internationally, and the many ways in which dierences among negotiating countries are resolved. The seminar also examines the history and substance of the climate change regime, including the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, and the 2015 Paris Agreement. The seminar ends with a mock climate-related negotiation. GLBL 573a, Global Resources and the Environment Sta Students rst learn the global distribution of resources\u2014the amounts, importance, and causes of distribution, and potential changes of soils, water, biodiversity, human societies, energy sources, climates, agriculture, forests and forest products, minerals, and disturbances. They also learn how to analyze and interpret data on global resource distributions. Secondly, they gain an understanding of the value of multiple-country trading of resources. Thirdly, they gain an understanding of the many mechanisms that facilitate such exchanges, including policies and treaties; business, markets, trading partners, and economics; and Four teaching methods are used: lectures on the dierent resources and policy mechanisms; analytical exercises for understanding how to use228 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 and interpret international data\u2014and its limitations; a class negotiation exercise for learning the uses of international trade; and guest lectures by faculty and meetings with practitioners for learning the facilitation mechanisms. Three hours lecture; possible eld trips.

Consideration of gaps in global governance and controversies between globalization and state sovereignty, universality, and tradition. GLBL 580a, Russian Intelligence, Information Warfare, and Social Media Asha Rangappa This course explores the evolution of information warfare as a national security threat to the United States. Beginning with the KGB's use of \"active measures\" during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion and impact. Using Russia's eorts in the 2016 election as an example, students examine the legal limitations on the FBI and intelligence community's ability to counter such operations in the United States and explore potential policy solutions in the realm of intelligence tools, privacy laws, Internet regulation, and human \"social capital.\" Guest speakers include information warfare expert Molly McKew, Russian CIA ocer John Sipher, producers of the recent documentary Active Measures, and others. GLBL 590b, Cybersecurity, Cyberwar, and International Relations Edward cyberrelations. Topics include cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar, and cybergovernance. Readings from academic and government sources in the elds of history, law, political science, and sociology.

Case studies of intelligence successes and failures from World War II to the present. GLBL 601a, International Financial Economics, Analysis, and Application Sigridur Benediktsdottir This course deals with the application of basic international economics analysis to public policy issues. The objective is for students to gain a broad understanding of international economics analysis and important policies issues connected to that. International economics is broadly divided into international trade and international nance. This course will focus more on international nance, while trade theory and policy will be introduced. The course starts with nancial theory and asset pricing, which forms an important basis for international nance. Then international trade theory and policies is introduced. Next is international nance which connects with the rst part of the course. Emphasis will be on exchange rates, capital flows and eects of integrated capital markets on long term growth. Risks associated with integratedGlobal Aairs 229 capital markets will be explored and policy decision spill over in particular from large economies to emerging economies. GLBL 603a, Terrorism and Global Development Sta This course explores the interaction of two central global challenges: terrorism and development. It interrogates the causal cycle of development and terrorism. Are political and economic underdevelopment a \"root cause\" of terrorism? And under what conditions does terrorism cause or further underdevelopment? The course considers whether international development policy can improve security outcomes, and vice versa. Topics include foreign aid, democracy promotion, failed states, and civil war. Paper required. GLBL 616a, China's Rise and the Future of Foreign Policy Sta China's return to its traditional role as a regional\u2014and, increasingly, global\u2014power has implications for the political, security, and economic structures that have been the foundation of the international system since the end of the Second World War. This course looks at the impact China's ascent has had, the challenges a rising China will pose for policy makers in the years ahead, and the internal issues China will need to address in the years ahead. It does so from the perspective of a practitioner who spent nearly three decades working on U.S. foreign policy and U.S.-China relations. GLBL 618a, The Next China Stephen Roach Born out of necessity in the post-Cultural Revolution chaos of the late 1970s, modern China is about reforms, opening up, and transition. The Next China will be driven by the transition from an export- and investment-led development model to a pro- consumption model. China's new model could unmask a dual identity crisis\u2014 underscored by China's need to embrace political reform and the West's long-standing misperceptions about China. Prerequisite: basic undergraduate macroeconomics. GLBL 633b, Strategies for Economic Development Rakesh Mohan How strategies for economic development have changed over time and how dominant strands in development theory and practice have evolved. Students trace the influence of the evolution in thinking on actual changes that have taken place in successful development strategies, as practiced in fast-growing developing countries, and as illustrated in case studies of fast growth periods in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, China, and India. Prerequisites: introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics. GLBL 692a, The Politics of American Foreign Policy Howard Dean This seminar addresses the domestic political considerations that have aected American foreign policy in the post-World War II world. The goals are to give historical context to the formation of major existing global governance structures, give students an opportunity to research how major foreign policy decisions in the past were influenced by contemporary political pressure, and assess what eect those pressures have had on today's global issues. Case studies include but are not limited to Truman and the Marshall Plan; Johnson and the Vietnam War; Nixon and the opening of China; Reagan and the collapse of the Soviet Union; George H.W. Bush and Iraq; Clinton and the Balkans; and Obama and the development of a multipolar foreign policy for a multipolar world. Students assume the role of decision-makers under political pressure and are asked to generate a point of view regarding past, present, and future foreign policy decisions.230 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 GLBL 712a, Insurgency and Counterinsurgency Isaiah Wilson This course examines the dynamics of insurgency (a distinct variant of guerrilla warfare) and counterinsurgency (the government response), and has been craed with America 's recent and current involvement in both Afghanistan and Iraq in mind. This course seeks to acquaint students with the nature, dimensions, and history of insurgency and counterinsurgency both past and present and establish a solid foundation upon which expertise and analytical capabilities can be developed for future application. The course also considers a wide range of questions to provide students with a deeper understanding of the evolution of insurgent strategy and tactics over time and the development of government counterinsurgency doctrine. Questions include: What is insurgency and how does it dier from guerrilla warfare and terrorism? Why and how do insurgencies develop? How have strategies and tactics of insurgents changed over time? Who are the foremost ideological and doctrinal proponents of insurgency and why? Who are the foremost counterinsurgency practitioner-theorists? Why does insurgency succeed or fail? How can insurgency best be fought? Why the wheel is seemingly always \"reinvented\" in counterinsurgency? Finally, the course aims to analyze both the eectiveness of insurgency as a means to achieve political change and the challenges faced by the liberal democratic state in responding to insurgent campaigns and challenges. GLBL 713a, Middle East Politics Emma Sky Exploration of the international politics of the Middle East through a framework of analysis that is partly historical and partly thematic. How the international system, as well as social structures and political economy, shape state behavior. Consideration of Arab nationalism; Islamism; the impact of oil; Cold War politics; conflicts; liberalization; the Arab-spring, and the rise of the Islamic State. GLBL 715a, Economic and Trade Challenges and Opportunities in Southern Africa Sta How can the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) achieve sustainable economic development and integrate trade? In this course, we discuss structural and institutional challenges to sustainable economic development and trade and how SADC can overcome these obstacles. We examine SADC in comparative perspective. Students research the critical issues in SADC politics and governance that prevent improved economic output. This course also highlights the economic and trade successes SADC has experienced. GLBL 725a, Diplomatic Crises and Statecra Sta Hands-on case studies of diplomatic crises and statecra that include the North Korean crisis; the Iran nuclear deal; the Rohingya crisis; the eectiveness of the un-trade wars between the United States, China, the EU, and NAFTA; OPEC and the geopolitics of oil diplomacy; crises in the Congo and the Sudan; Latin America, the forgotten hemisphere (U.S.-Mexico and Venezuela relations and Trump immigration policy). The course also includes sessions on hostages and political prisoners as well as a primer on how to get elected to oce.Global Aairs 231 GLBL 750b, American Power in the Twenty-First Century: Lessons in Diplomacy John Kerry Led by former Secretary of State John Kerry '66, this seminar examines U.S. foreign policy in the twenty-rst century. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding diplomacy both in theory and practice, and it examines the core subjects on which the Kerry Initiative is focused: failed and failing states, the challenge of authoritarian populism, rising sectarianism and violent extremism, climate change and other environmental threats, capacity building and anti-corruption, and global economic opportunity and development. Students focus on a series of case studies from the perspective of those who make and implement U.S. foreign policy. Application and course dates at http://jackson.yale.edu/apply/american-power-21st-century-lessons- diplomacy. GLBL 752a, American Power in Transition: Providing an Uncommon Defense and the Search for Strategic Stability Isaiah Wilson The years since the end of the Cold War have marked two big world-system-impacting consequences: the end of more than forty years of relatively stable bipolarity and the beginning of America 's \"unipolar moment\" of preeminent power dominance. Today 's tumultuous global security environment is perhaps best characterized as contagious with converging, transregional compound security dilemmas and a growing pathological weakening of nation-states and, arguably, of the Western-Liberal system. For the United States and the world-system at-large, these times mark a moment of signicant, and perhaps historic, strategic inflection. The hard choices the United States makes today and in the coming years impacting whether or not it intervenes in world aairs\u2014and if so, how it chooses to intervene\u2014will matter most. These choices will (re)dene the new American national security and, consequently, the future stability of the international system and community of nation-states. As such, they demand a reconsideration of American global leadership since its rise to unipolar primacy in the early 1990s. This course explores and examines questions revolving around power in transition, in general terms, and more pointedly with critical focus on American power and uses of force over the past three to four decades. We adopt a theory-history-practice analytical approach, incorporating mixed methods, including case examinations. The seminar is organized around ve \"crisis arenas\": crisis in American grand strategy; crisis in American commitment to assuring global system order; crisis in humanitarianism; crisis of law, ethics, and intervention; and crisis in American identity. GLBL 771b, Eective States, Weak States, and Citizens in the Twenty-First Century Clare Lockhart Analysis of the role of the state and the social compact in the twenty-first century. Consideration of the changing dynamics (including digital, demographics, globalization), and the challenges and opportunities this presents for the role of the state in meeting citizen expectations. Analysis of the functions the state is expected to perform. Examination of cases of success and setbacks in responding to these challenges. Review of perspectives of and policy options for domestic actors and international actors. This is a graduate seminar, but undergraduates may also apply. Enrollment limited to sixteen. Given the limited space available, students may e-mail the instructor to discuss enrollment.232 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 GLBL 789a and GLBL 790b, Leadership Stanley McChrystal and Christopher Fussell This course examines the practical execution of leadership in today's environment. Using a combination of historical case studies and recent events, we review how dramatic changes in technology, society, politics, media, and globalization have increased the complexity of the tasks facing modern leaders. Although the course includes the military aspects of leadership, the overall objective is to study leadership in a wider context, identifying the common factors shared by politics, business, education, warfare, and other elds. Specic topics include the changing leadership environment; the role of the leader; driving change; making dicult decisions; dealing with risk; coping with failure; navigating politics; and the eect of modern media. This is an application-only course oered over two terms (fall and spring); credit is granted only upon completion of both terms (GLBL 789 and GLBL 790). \u00bd Course cr per term GLBL 792a, Ethical Choices in Public Leadership Eric Braverman All public leaders must make choices that challenge their code of ethics. Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide dicult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real- world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices. Permission of the instructor required; application at http://jackson.yale.edu/apply/glbl-792. Attendance at rst session is mandatory. GLBL 801a, Economics: Principles and Applications James Levinsohn This course deals with the application of basic microeconomic analysis to public policy issues. The principal goal is to teach students the process of economic reasoning and how to apply that reasoning to policy issues in the real world. The course covers the basic topics in microeconomic theory: consumer theory, production theory, market models from competition to monopoly, theories of labor and capital markets, and models of externalities and other common market failures. Some calculus will be used without apology along with a great deal of algebra and graphical analysis. GLBL 802a, Applied Methods of Analysis Lloyd Grieger The course focuses on useful analytical approaches in public policy and the social sciences. The rst part of the course focuses on mathematical skills. The second part focuses on methods for analyzing empirical data and builds on the mathematical skills from the rst part of the course. Special focus is devoted to developing the skills necessary to synthesize and evaluate empirical evidence from the social sciences. Students leave the class with an applied understanding of how quantitative methods are used as tools for analysis in public aairs. GLBL 803b, History of the Present Daniel Steinmetz Jenkins The rst half of the course presents some of the major diplomatic (and sometimes military) confrontations of the twentieth century, beginning with the First Balkan War, including the breakdowns of the late 1930s and progressing through the end of the Cold War. The second half introduces the history of Ukraine and closes with a case study of the Russian invasion of Ukraine's south and east as the end of the post-coldGlobal Aairs 233 war order. In both parts emphasis is placed upon a close reading of primary documents and upon the reconstruction of possible alternatives. GLBL 833a, Anti-Money Laundering and Counterterrorist Financing William King For more than a decade, the international community has attempted to disrupt, debilitate, and destroy illegal nancial networks of those who would nance terror. This course provides an introduction to anti-money laundering (AML) and counterterrorist nancing (CTF). The approach is interdisciplinary, as understanding the nancial tools to combat terrorism necessitates a consideration of law, policy, and intelligence. Additionally, AML and CTF focus on the overlapping realms of crime, corruption, and terrorism. Guest speakers join the class for select discussions. Students gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of AML/CTF, the approaches and limitations of combating current terrorist threats, particularly ISIL, and the challenges and opportunities of using nancial tools in the war against terror. GLBL 840b, Macroeconomics Marnix Amand This course develops a framework for understanding the causes and consequences of macroeconomic events in real time. We begin by dening basic national accounting identities and using these identities to compare countries' economic structure and performance over time. We then consider models in which the choices of private and public agents interact to produce aggregate outcomes in response to policy or economic shocks. In developing and using these models, we will rely on numerous historical and contemporary examples. GLBL 883b, Challenges to Security and Stability in Central and Eastern Europe Yuriy Sergeyev This course examines the geopolitical, political, military, socioeconomic, and ideological factors that are challenging security and stability in the region of Central and Eastern Europe aer collapse of the USSR. The goal is to give students a broad understanding of the reasons for the worsening security and stability in the region, particularly the Baltic states, Visegrad states, and GUAM member states, and to model further potential developments. The influence of the global players\u2014United States, European Union, Russia\u2014on the security situation in the region is considered. GLBL 885b, World Order in Liberal Arts Charles Hill International peace and security as humanity's primary moral-philosophical problem, reflected in works beyond the policy realm, from Confucius to Kant, Hegel, Wittgenstein, and Niebuhr. Early writings of Kissinger and his diplomatic papers now at Yale provide case studies. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. GLBL 889a, World Fellows Seminar Emma Sky Enrollment limited to those graduate and professional school students selected as Associate World Fellows. Associates join 16 leaders from across the globe to learn, share, connect, and challenge through their participation in the weekly \"Good Society\" seminar, the Distinguished Speaker weekly dinner series, and other events throughout the fall term. See http://worldfellows.yale.edu/associate for details. 0.5 GSAS credit. Graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory. \u00bd 695a, International Security Nuno Monteiro This course covers the main theories and problems in international security. Aer analyzing the main theoretical traditions devoted to understanding international security and world order, we discuss a variety of topics such as: the causes of war; the234 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 role of nuclear weapons and the problems with their proliferation; coercion, signaling, and crisis bargaining; military eectiveness; and U.S. grand strategy. Students acquire broad familiarity with the canonical literature in these elds, understand how to apply scholarship to analyze contemporary international security problems, and learn to identify opportunities for new research. The course is designed for master's and Ph.D. students who plan to pursue either policy or scholarly work in international security. Seminar sessions may feature outside guest scholars. Besides the weekly seminar sessions, students are strongly encouraged to attend weekly reading group sessions in which we dissect recent scholarship on the same topics for which we have read the canonical works. GLBL 929a and GLBL 930b, GSE India: Global Social Entrepreneurship Tony Sheldon Launched in 2008 at the Yale School of Management, the Global Social Entrepreneurship (GSE) course links teams of Yale students with social enterprises based in India. GSE is committed to channeling the skills of Yale students to help Indian organizations expand their reach and impact on \"bottom of the pyramid\" communities. Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specic management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the term. GSE has worked with thirty leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women's empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and aordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, nancing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. Enrollment is by application only. Also MGT 529. \u00bd Course cr per term GLBL 944b, Sigridur Benediktsdottir This course focuses on current macroprudential theory and the application and experience of macroprudential policies, which address risks and vulnerabilities of nancial systems in an eort to manage systemic risk and promote nancial stability.History 235 History McClellan Hall, 203.432.1366 http://history.yale.edu M.A., M.Phil., Ph.D. Chair Alan Mikhail Director of Graduate Studies Paul Sabin (203.432.1361) Professors Abbas Amanat, Ned Blackhawk, David Blight, Daniel Botsman, Paul Bushkovitch, Deborah Coen, Stephen Davis, Carolyn Dean, Fabian Drixler, Carlos Eire, David Engerman, Paul Freedman, Joanne Freeman, John Gaddis, Beverly Gage, Bruce Gordon, Valerie Hansen, Robert Harms, Matthew Jacobson, Gilbert Joseph, Paul Kennedy, Benedict Kiernan, Jennifer Klein, Naomi Lamoreaux, Noel Lenski, Kathryn Loon, Mary Lui, Daniel Magaziner, J.G.

Special Admissions Requirements The deadline for submission of the application for the History graduate program is December 15. The department requires a short book review (maximum 1,000 words) to accompany the application. It should cover the book that has most shaped the applicant's understanding of the kind of work the applicant would like to do as a historian. In addition, the department requires submission of an academic writing sample of not more than 25 pages, double spaced. Normally, the writing sample should be based on research in primary source materials.236 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Language Requirements All students must pass examinations in at least one foreign language by the end of the rst year. Students are urged to do everything in their power to acquire adequate linguistic training before they enter Yale and should at a minimum be prepared to be examined in at least one language upon arrival. Typical language requirements for major subelds are as follows: African Either (1) French and German or Portuguese or Dutch-Afrikaans; or (2) French or German or Portuguese and Arabic; or (3) French or German or Portuguese or Dutch-Afrikaans and an African language approved by the director of graduate studies (DGS) and the faculty adviser. American One language relevant to the student's research interests. Ancient German and either French or Italian and two ancient languages, one of which must be Greek or Latin and the second of which can be either the second classical language or another ancient language (e.g., Hebrew, Aramaic/Syriac, Demotic, Coptic, Classical Armenian, Sanskrit). Chinese Chinese and Japanese; additional languages like French, Russian, or German may be necessary for certain dissertation topics. East European The language of the country of the student's concentration plus two of the following: French, German, Russian, or an approved substitution. Global/International Two languages to be determined by the DGS in consultation with the adviser. Japanese Japanese and French or German; Chinese may be necessary for certain elds of Japanese history. Jewish Modern Hebrew and German, and additional languages such as Latin, Arabic, Yiddish, Russian, or Polish, as required by the student's areas of specialization. Latin American Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Medieval French, German, and Latin. Middle East Arabic, Persian, or Turkish (or modern Hebrew, depending on area of research) and a major European research language (French, German, Russian, or an approved substitute). Modern Western European (including British) French and German; substitutions are permitted with the approval of the DGS. Russian Russian plus French or German with other languages as required. Southeast Asian Choice of Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Sanskrit, or Arabic, plus one or more Southeast Asian language (e.g., Bahasa Indonesian, Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, Tetum, or Vietnamese). In certain cases, Ph.D. dissertation research on Southeast Asia may also require knowledge of a regional or local language, e.g., Balinese or Cham.History 237 Foreign students whose native language is not English may receive permission during their rst year to hand in some written work in their own language. Since, however, the dissertation must be in English, they are advised to bring their writing skills up to the necessary level at the earliest opportunity. Additional Requirements These new regulations will be observed by students admitted in 2013 and following years. Students admitted earlier may opt to observe either the new or the old regulations. During the rst year of study, students normally take six term courses, including Approaching History (HIST 500). During the second year of study, they may opt to take four to six term courses, with the approval of their adviser and the DGS. Students who plan to apply for outside grants at the beginning of their third year are recommended to take the Prospectus Tutorial (HIST 995) during their second year, and it is required for students in European history. The tutorial should result in a full dra of the dissertation prospectus. The ten courses taken during the rst two years should normally include at least six chosen from those oered by the department. Students must achieve Honors in at least two courses in the rst year, and Honors in at least four courses by the end of the second year, with a High Pass average overall. Courses graded in the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory mode (HIST 994, HIST 995, HIST 998) count toward the course work requirement but do not count toward the Honors requirement. Two of the ten courses must be research seminars in which the student produces an original research paper from primary sources. The Prospectus Tutorial does not count as a research seminar. All graduate students, regardless of eld, will be required to take two seminar courses in a time period other than their period of specialty. Students in their second year should choose their courses so that at least one course will prepare them for a comprehensive examination eld in their third year. Some elds oer reading seminars specically designed to help prepare students for examination; others encourage students to sign up for examination tutorials (HIST 994) with one of their examiners. By the end of their h term, at the latest, students are expected to take comprehensive examinations. Students will have a choice of selecting three or four elds of concentration: a major eld and either two or three minor elds. The examination must contain one minor eld that deals 50 percent or more with the historiography of a region of the world other than the area of the student's major eld. The examination will have a written component that will be completed before the oral component. For their major eld, students will write a historiographical essay of maximum 8,000 words. For each of the minor elds, the student will prepare a syllabus for an undergraduate lecture class in the eld. All of these are to be written over the course of the examination preparation process and will be due on a denite, uniform date toward the end of the students' h term, typically on the Friday before Thanksgiving break (or on a corresponding date in the spring term). The oral examination examines the students on their elds and will, additionally, include discussion of the materials produced for the written component of the examination. If the student selects the four- eld option, the major eld will be examined for thirty minutes. If the student selects238 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 the three-eld option, the major eld will be examined for sixty minutes and each minor eld for thirty minutes. By the end of their sixth term, at the latest, students are expected to hold a prospectus colloquium, but those who took the Prospectus Tutorial (HIST 995) during their second year are encouraged to hold the colloquium at the beginning of their third year. The prospectus colloquium oers students an opportunity to discuss the dissertation prospectus with their dissertation committee in order to gain the committee's advice on the research and writing of the dissertation and its approval for the project. The dissertation prospectus provides the basis of grant proposals. Completion of ten term courses (including HIST 500), the language requirements of the relevant eld, the comprehensive examinations, and the prospectus colloquium will qualify a student for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D., which must take place by the end of the third year of study. It is also possible for students who have completed extensive graduate work prior to entering the Yale Ph.D. program to complete course work sooner. Students may petition for course waivers based on previous graduate work (up to three term courses) only aer successful completion of the rst year. Students normally serve as teaching fellows during four terms to acquire professional training. Ordinarily, students teach in their third and fourth years. During their rst term of teaching, students must attend training sessions run by the Center for Teaching and Learning and work with the associate director of graduate studies to discuss any matters of concern. Students may teach, normally in their fourth term of teaching, as seminar fellows, teaching an undergraduate seminar in conjunction with a faculty member, if such positions are available. By the end of their ninth term, students are required to submit a chapter of their dissertation to the dissertation committee. This chapter will then be discussed with the student by the committee, in a chapter conference, to give the student additional advice and counsel on the progress of the dissertation. This conference is designed to be an extension of the conversation begun in the prospectus colloquium and is not intended as a defense: its aim is to give students early feedback on the research, argument, and style of the rst writing accomplished on the dissertation. No less than one month before students plan to submit their dissertations, a relatively polished full dra of the dissertation should be discussed with the student by the dissertation committee, in a dissertation defense of one to two hours, to give the students additional advice and counsel on completing the dissertation or on turning it into a book, as appropriate. Students are required to submit the dra to their committee in sucient time for the committee to be able to read it. This defense is designed to give students advice on the overall arguments and the nal shape of the dissertation or book, and to leave time for adjustments coming out of the discussion. The fellowship package oered to Ph.D. students normally includes twelve months of University Dissertation Fellowship (UDF), which nances a full year of research and writing without any teaching duties. Students may choose to take the UDF at any point aer they have advanced to candidacy and before the end of their sixth year. Students are prohibited from teaching when they are on the UDF. The department strongly recommends that students apply for a UDF only aer completing the rstHistory 239 chapter conference and that they have draed at least two chapters before starting the fellowship. Students who have not submitted the dissertation by the end of the sixth year need not register in order to submit. If, however, students wish to register for a seventh year for good academic reasons, they may petition for extended registration. The petition, submitted to the History DGS, will explain the academic reasons for the request. Only students who have completed the rst chapter conference will be considered for extended registration. Evaluation of First- and Second-Year Graduate Students At the end of each term, the DGS will ask faculty members whether they have serious concerns about the academic progress of any rst- or second-year students in the Ph.D. program. Faculty members who have such concerns will provide written feedback to the DGS at the DGS's request. The DGS will use discretion in ensuring that feedback is provided in a clear and eective manner to any students about whom there are concerns. We expect such concerns to be rare. Toward the end of the academic year, the History faculty will hold a special meeting to review each rst- and second-year student in the program. The purpose of the meeting is to assess students' academic progress. In order for second-year students to proceed to the third year, they must demonstrate through written work, classroom performance, and participation in departmental activities that they have the ability to: (a) speak and write clearly; (b) conduct independent research at a high level; and (c) develop coherent scholarly arguments. A faculty vote will be taken at the conclusion of the review meeting to decide whether each second-year student may stay in the program. In the unusual case that a majority of faculty present and voting determine that a student may not continue, the student will be informed in writing and withdrawn from the program. The review meeting must be a full faculty meeting, but faculty members with no knowledge of the students under review may abstain from the vote, and their abstentions will not count in the total. Those members of the faculty who have worked with or know the students being evaluated are required to attend. In the event that any necessary faculty members absolutely cannot be present, they may send their views in writing to the DGS, who will read them at the meeting. A student informed of a vote of dismissal from the program may submit a formal letter of appeal within two weeks, accompanied by supporting documentation (research or other scholarly work), to the Graduate Advisory Committee. The Graduate Advisory Committee will render a nal decision within two weeks of receipt of the appeal. Any members of the Graduate Advisory Committee who have worked directly with the student will recuse themselves from the nal vote on the case. Combined Ph.D. Programs History and Classics The Department of History also oers, in conjunction with the Department of Classics, a combined Ph.D. in History and Classics, with a concentration in Ancient History. For further details, see Classics.240 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 History and African American Studies The Department of History also oers, in conjunction with the Department of African American Studies, a combined Ph.D. in History and African American Studies. For further details, see African American Studies. History and Renaissance Studies The Department of History also oers, in conjunction with the Renaissance Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in History and Renaissance Studies. For further details, see Renaissance Studies. Master's Degrees M.Phil. Students who have completed all requirements for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. may receive the M.Phil. degree. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may qualify for the M.A. degree upon completion of a minimum of seven graduate term courses at Yale, of which two must have earned Honors grades and the other ve courses must average High Pass overall. Students must also pass an examination in one foreign language. A student in the American Studies program who wishes to obtain an M.A. in History, rather than an M.A. in American Studies, must include in the courses completed at least two research seminars in the History department. Terminal Master's Degree Program For this terminal master's degree, students must pass seven term courses, four of which must be in History; substantial written work must be submitted in conjunction with at least two of these courses, and Honors grades are expected in two courses, with a High Pass average overall. An undergraduate language course, statistics course, or other applicable course in a technological \"language\" may count for one course credit toward the graduate degree. All students in this program must pass an examination in one foreign language. Financial aid is not available for this program. More information is available on the department's website, http://history.yale.edu. Courses HIST 500a, Approaching History: Problems, Methods, and Theory Daniel Botsman An introduction to the professional study of history, which oers new doctoral students an opportunity to explore (and learn from each other about) the diversity of the eld, while also addressing issues of shared concern and importance for the future of the discipline. By the end of the term participants have been exposed to some of the key methodological and theoretical approaches historians have developed for studying dierent time periods, places, and aspects of the human past. Required of all rst-year doctoral students. HIST Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China,History 241 and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. HIST 503b / CLSS 861b, Recent Trends, Current Problems, and New Approaches to Ancient History Joseph Manning Current trends in the eld and an examination of recent work, new theory, and new material. An overview of theory and method in ancient history. Each week is devoted to a case study or a recent monograph in the eld. HIST 507a / CLSS 645a, Roman Numismatics Benjamin Hellings An introduction to the history of ancient coinage and the modern methodology of numismatic study. Brief consideration of the Greek background is followed by detailed treatment of the Roman republic and empire, with particular attention to the Roman provinces. HIST 508a / CLSS 847a, Climate, Environment, and Ancient History Joseph Manning An overview of recent work in paleoclimatology with an emphasis on new climate proxy records and how they are or can be used in historical analysis. We examine in detail several recent case studies at the nexus of climate and history. Attention is paid to critiques of recent work as well as trends in the eld. HIST 536a / MDVL 536a, Charters, Cartularies, and Archives Paul Freedman and N. Raymond Clemens An examination of medieval documentation and how to use it to answer questions about medieval politics, society, and religion. Charters are single documents representing transactions, ranging from wills to grants of rights to sales contracts. Cartularies are collections of documents that show how an institution (usually an ecclesiastical institution) acquired property; and they back up and prove rights over those properties. The course looks at archives and ways in which documents end up in archives, how they are organized, and what that can tell us about the issues they focus on. HIST 540b, Introduction to Research in Medieval History Anders Winroth The seminar provides an introduction to research in medieval European history: oen- used source genres, methods, and research tools. We focus on working with primary sources in original languages, occasionally in their original manuscript and early printed form. A working knowledge of a medieval language is, therefore, desirable. Yale is particularly fortunate in that the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library possesses much relevant material, including medieval manuscripts and early printed bibles. HIST 582b / AMST 705b / in American Society, 1600-2018 Tisa Wenger This seminar explores intersections of religion and society in American history from the colonial period to the present as well as methodological problems important to their study. It is designed to give graduate students a working knowledge of the eld, ranging from major recent studies to bibliographical tools. In short, the seminar is a broad readings course surveying religion in American history from colonization242 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 to the present. It is not a specialized research seminar, but it does require a basic understanding of historiography. HIST Holocaust, Israel, and American History David Sorkin This course explores the changing nature of Jewish politics in relationship to three of the twentieth century's major events. First we examine Jewish political behavior during the Holocaust, especially the notion of \"resistance\" vis-\u00e0-vis the so-called Jewish councils and the controversy surrounding Hannah Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem. Second, we probe the continuities and discontinuities in the establishment of the State of Israel, focusing on the politics of the \"Yishuv\" (Jewish settlement in Mandatory Palestine) and its relationship to British imperialism. Third, we analyze shis in the domestic and foreign policies of the organized American Jewish community during the era of the civil rights movement (1946-64). HIST 599a / JDST 801a, Medieval Jewish History: 800-1500 CE Sta This course is an introduction to some of the major themes in the history of the Jewish people from late antiquity to 1500. We trace the development of Jewish communities in Muslim and Christian lands, focusing on the complex relationship that Jews had with their host societies. Other topics include Jewish self-government and communal organization and major currents in Jewish intellectual culture. The course follows a thematic line, moving from demographics to economics, from legal issues to intellectual and social questions. HIST 600b / JDST 802b, Jewish Everyday Life in the Middle Ages Sta Medieval Jewish history has been based primarily on written sources and hence has tended to concentrate on the intellectual male elite, institutions, and events. In recent years, historians are increasingly interested in everyday, or quotidian, history, looking beyond the intellectual elite to society as a whole and using, alongside texts, archaeology and the material world. Following the \"material turn,\" this seminar focuses on Jewish material culture, using archaeology and art history in the service of cultural history. Among the subjects considered are the Jewish quarter and street; the synagogue; the ritual bath (mikve); the cemetery 776a, Jewish History, Thought, and Narratives in Medieval Societies Ivan Marcus Research seminar that focuses on the two medieval Jewish subcultures of Ashkenaz (northern Christian Europe) and Sefarad (mainly Muslim and Christian Spain). HIST 613a / ENGL 592a, English Paleography and Manuscript Culture, 1500-1750 Kathryn James This course provides a detailed introduction to early modern English paleography and manuscript cultures. The primary objective is for students to acquire fluency in reading the main English hands encountered in the early modern archive. Students become familiar with the documentary forms and methods of production of early modern British manuscripts and with the techniques and terms by which these are understood and described. Topics include Anglicana, secretary, chancery, and italic shorthand and cipher; transcription; the forms and vocabulary associated with early modern letters, sermon- notes, diaries, annotations, inventories, and other documentary forms. The courseHistory 243 meets in the Beinecke Library and is based on the library's early modern English manuscript collections. HIST 619a, Readings in the Social and Cultural History of Britain, 1500 -1750 Keith Wrightson Reading and discussion of central works in the social and cultural history of the period. The class begins with the fundamental issues of social structure and population dynamics. Thereaer the weekly agenda is decided in consultation, selecting from such topics as urbanization; poverty; household and family relationships; gender and sexuality; community structures; crime and the law; protest and rebellion; education, literacy, and print culture; material culture; popular religion; witchcra; national identities; agrarian custom and change; history and social memory. HIST 654a, Readings in European Cultural History Carolyn Dean This course covers readings in European cultural history from 1789 to the present, with a focus on Western Europe. HIST 656a / PLSC 629a, Histories of Political Thought Isaac Nakhimovsky The intersection between political theory and intellectual history, examined from a historiographical rather than an exclusively methodological perspective. The course aims to develop a comparative framework for discussing the kinds of preoccupations and commitments that have animated various important contributions to the history of political thought since the nineteenth century. HIST 667b / FREN 900b / WGSS 667b, History of Sexuality in Modern Europe Carolyn Dean An introduction to the various lines of inquiry informing the history of sexuality. The course asks how historians and others constitute sexuality as an object of inquiry and addresses dierent arguments about the evolution of sexuality in Europe, including the relationship between sexuality and the state and sexuality and gender. HIST 677b, Russia in the Age of Peter the Great Paul Bushkovitch An introduction to the principal events and issues during the transformation of Russia in the years 1650 to 1725. Topics include political change and the court; Russia in Europe and Asia; religion and the revolution in Russian culture. HIST 687a, Russia, the USSR, and the World, 1855-1945 Paul Bushkovitch Political and economic relations of Russia/Soviet Union with Europe, the United States, and Asia from tsarism to socialism. HIST 701a / AMST 920a, Writing Workshop in U.S. History Joanne Meyerowitz For advanced graduate students in History, American Studies, and related elds. Students share and comment on dra dissertation chapters, article manuscripts, and conference papers. HIST 703a / AMST 803a, Research in Early National America Joanne Freeman A research seminar focused on the early national period of American history, broadly dened. Early weeks familiarize students with sources from the period and discuss research and writing strategies. Students produce a publishable article grounded in primary materials.244 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 HIST 704b, Research in Early American and Atlantic History, 1500-1815 Mark Peterson The Atlantic turn in historical scholarship on colonial America has made it clear that there is a great deal of fundamental work to be done to understand the interconnected world of European colonial projects and their fraught relationships with the peoples of Africa and the Americas. Yale's archival resources housed in the Beinecke Library, Sterling Library, and the Yale Center for British Art, Yale Divinity School, and other archives oer a treasure trove of materials to form the basis for such research projects. This seminar, to be taught in the Beinecke Library, is designed to introduce graduate students to an array of such source materials and to address challenges and questions in using these sources ranging from orthography to contextualization. The goal is for each student to produce an article-length original research paper grounded in Yale's collections. Readings in African American Women's History Crystal Feimster The diversity of African American women's lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social, political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, ction, autobiography, art, religion, lm, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women's activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the identity, work. HIST 715a / AFAM 764a / AMST 715a, Readings in Nineteenth-Century America David Blight The course explores recent trends and historiography on several problems through the middle of the nineteenth century: sectionalism, expansion; slavery and the Old South; northern society and reform movements; Civil War causation; the meaning of the Confederacy; why the North won the Civil War; the political, constitutional, and social meanings of emancipation and Reconstruction; violence in Reconstruction society; the relationships between social/cultural and military/political history; problems in historical memory; the tension between narrative and analytical history writing; and the ways in which race and gender have reshaped research and interpretive agendas. HIST 737b, Research Seminar in U.S. Political Economy Jennifer Klein Research seminar oriented around themes and issues in U.S. political economy from the late nineteenth century through the end of the twentieth. Readings in the rst part of the term look at various approaches to writing about political economy: for example, business history, intellectual history, labor history, biography, local monograph, or transnational history. Research projects explore new possibilities for writing about labor, business, the state, and capitalism. HIST 746a / AMST 903a, Introduction to Public Humanities Sta What is the relationship between knowledge produced in the university and the circulation of ideas among a broader public, between academic expertise on the one hand and nonprofessionalized ways of knowing and thinking on the other? What is possible? This seminar provides an introduction to various institutional relations and to the modes of inquiry, interpretation, and presentation by which practitioners in the humanities seek to invigorate the flow of information and ideas among a publicHistory 245 more broadly conceived than the academy, its classrooms, and its exclusive readership of specialists. Topics include public history, museum studies, oral and community history, public art, documentary lm and photography, public writing and educational outreach, the socially conscious performing arts, and fundraising. In addition to core readings and discussions, the seminar includes presentations by several practitioners who are currently engaged in dierent aspects of the Public Humanities. With the help of Yale faculty and aliated institutions, participants collaborate in developing and executing a Public Humanities project of their own denition and design. Possibilities might include, but are not limited to, an exhibit or installation, a documentary, a set of walking tours, a website, a documents collection for use in public schools. Required for the M.A. with a concentration in Public Humanities. HIST 747a / AFAM 763a / AMST 731a, Methods and Practices in U.S. Cultural History Matthew Jacobson This sampling of U.S. cultural history from the early national period to the present is designed to unfold on two distinct planes. The rst is a rendering of U.S. culture itself\u2014a survey, however imperfect, of the major currents, themes, and textures of U.S. culture over time, including its contested ideologies of race and gender, its organization of productivity and pleasure, its media and culture industries, its modes of creating and disseminating \"information\" and \"knowledge,\" its resilient subcultures, and its reigning nationalist iconographies and narratives. The second is a sampling of scholarly methods and approaches, a meta-history of \"the culture concept\" as it has informed historical scholarship in the past few decades. The cultural turn in historiography since the 1980s has resulted in a dramatic reordering of \"legitimate\" scholarly topics, and hence a markedly dierent scholarly landscape, including some works that seek to narrate the history of the culture in its own right (Kasson's history of the amusement park, for instance), and others that resort to cultural forms and artifacts to answer questions regarding politics, nationalism, and power relations (Melani McAlister's Epic Encounters ). In addition to providing a background in U.S. culture, then, this seminar seeks to trace these developments within the discipline, to understand their basis, to sample the means and methods of \"the cultural turn,\" and to assess the strengths and shortcomings of culture-based historiography as it is now constituted.

Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree All students must pass examinations in at least two languages pertinent to their eld of study, to be determined and by agreement with the adviser and director of graduate studies (DGS). One examination must be passed during the rst year of study, the other not later than the beginning of the third term. During the rst two years of study, students typically take twelve term courses. In March of the second year, students submit a qualifying paper that should demonstrate the candidate's ability successfully to complete a Ph.D. dissertation in art history. During the fall term of the third year, students are expected to take the qualifying examination. Candidates must demonstrate knowledge of their eld and related areas, as well as a good grounding in method and bibliography. By the end of the second term of the third year, students are expected to have established a dissertation topic. A prospectus outlining the topic must be approved by a committee at a colloquium by the end of the third year. Students are admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus and qualifying examination. Admission to candidacy must take place by the end of the third year. The faculty considers teaching to be an important part of the professional preparation of graduate students. Students are required to complete four terms of teaching. This requirement is fullled in the second and third years. Students may also serve as a graduate research assistant at either the Yale University Art Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art. This can be accepted in lieu of one or two terms of teaching, butHistory of Art 251 students may accept a graduate research assistant position at any time aer the end of their rst year. Application for these R.A. positions is competitive. Combined Ph.D. Programs History of Art and African American Studies The Department of the History of Art oers, in conjunction with the Department of African American Studies, a combined Ph.D. in History of Art and African American Studies.

Courses HSAR 500a, Methods in Art History Carol Armstrong This seminar is designed to introduce students to a range of art historical methods past and present: a variety of formalisms, connoisseurship, dierent kinds of iconography, the social history of art, psychoanalysis, and a number of other approaches that are sometimes referred to as visual culture. Readings include classic texts by Riegl, W\u00f6lin, Panofsky, and Warburg, and more recent approaches by Alpers, Clark, and Crary, among others. HSAR 509b / EALL 506b, Japanese Classics in Text and Image Edward Kamens and Mimi Yiengpruksawan Fiction, poetry, and plays from the eighth century through the nineteenth, studied alongside related works of art and illustrated books housed in collections at Yale. An introduction to the Japanese classics as well as an example of interdisciplinary study in the humanities. No knowledge of Japanese required. HSAR 512a, Directed Research Nicola Suthor By Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China, and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. HSAR 581a / ARCG 581a / CLSS 890a, Roman Painting: Achievement and Legacy Diana Kleiner Roman mural painting in all its aspects and innovations. Individual scenes and complete ensembles in palaces, villas, and houses in Rome and Pompeii are explored, as are their rediscovery and revival in the Renaissance and neoclassical period. Special attention is paid to the four architectural styles; history and mythological painting; the impact of the theater; the part played by landscape, genre, and still life; the accidental survival of painted portraiture; and the discovery and rejection of trompe l'oeil illusionism and linear perspective.254 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 HSAR 591a / MDVL 650a, Visions and Art in Medieval Europe Jacqueline Jung From the Book of Revelation to the Showings of Julian of Norwich (d. 1423), accounts of visions in the Christian tradition were inextricably intertwined with the visual arts. Through examinations of medieval texts, images, and material culture, in conjunction with modern analyses of related phenomena, this seminar explores the range of representational practices that helped medieval Christians summon up, make sense of, and communicate extraordinary moments of contact with the divine. We address such questions as the changes in visionary experiences over time, the role of language and literacy in the communication of such experiences, the impact of gender on visions, the varieties and functions of other senses (especially touch and taste) in medieval visions, and the impact of visionary reports on the development of art. We begin by addressing the theoretical, cognitive, and anthropological facets of visionary experience before turning to medieval primary sources such as saints' lives, accounts of otherworld journeys, miracle books, sermons, monastic chronicles, and individually composed vision books, and to modern interpretations by historians such as Caroline Bynum, William Christian, Peter Dinzelbacher, Jerey Hamburger, Barbara Newman, Giselle de Nie, and Jean-Claude Schmitt. Visual materials include both depictions of visions (such as Apocalypse manuscripts, paintings of the Temptation of St. Anthony, and renderings of Hildegard's visions) and images that played a role in sparking visionary experience (such as Marian statues, crucixes, Man of Sorrows images, and Baby Jesus dolls). Reading knowledge of German, French, and Latin is strongly recommended. HSAR 605a / RUSS 603a, Russian Realist Literature and Painting Molly Brunson An interdisciplinary examination of the development of nineteenth-century Russian realism in literature and the visual arts. Topics include the Natural School and the formulation of a realist aesthetic; the artistic strategies and polemics of critical realism; narrative, genre, and the rise of the novel; the Wanderers and the articulation of a Russian school of painting; realism, modernism, and the challenges of periodization. Readings include novels, short stories, and critical works by Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Goncharov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and others. Painters of focus include Fedotov, Perov, Shishkin, Repin, and Kramskoy. Special attention is given the particular methodological demands of inter-art analysis. HSAR 652a, Documenting the World Kishwar Rizvi This seminar explores the signicance of the documentary survey in Europe and the Middle East. Writing the history of the world can only be undertaken from a particular ideological point of view; for example, although medieval illustrated manuscripts, such as the Compendium of History of Rashid al-Din (1304) and the Travels of Sir John Mandeville (ca. 1371), were concerned with situating the reader within the context of religious and political authority, during the eighteenth century the attempt was made to document the world through scientic explorations of race, religion, and geography, as exemplied by the magnum opus Ceremonies and Customs of the World Religions, by Bernard and Picart (1727-31). This seminar studies original and facsimile copies of manuscripts at Yale libraries. HSAR 674b, The History of Color, 1400-2000 Carol Armstrong and Nicola Suthor This seminar looks at the vexed history of color in all of its aspects, from the Renaissance to the present. Divided between colore/couleur and colorito/coloris, and frequently opposed to disegno/dessin, color has oen been relegated to second place and to the status of supplement, derogatorily associated with the supercial, the ephemeral,History of Art 255 the deceptive, the illusory, the articial, and the feminine. At the same time, it has been understood as the \"dierence\" of painting, it is the essence of \"what painting is\" from a material and practical point of view, it has been at the heart of the paragone debates, and it has been a linchpin of modern and modernist art and theory. This course looks at the history of thought about color in a variety of areas: the alchemical and chemical; the practical and the theoretical; the science of optics; discourse, rhetoric, poetics, and philosophy. Writers addressed include Cennino Cennini and other authors of artist's manuals; Roger de Piles, Sir Isaac Newton, and Johann Wolfgang van Goethe; Charles Baudelaire, Michel Eug\u00e8ne Albers; Rilke Ludwig Seurat and Paul C\u00e9zanne; Henri Matisse, Helen Frankenthaler, and the color- eld painters. HSAR 743a, The Book in the Sixteenth-Century Americas Barbara Mundy This course centers on books created in the Americas over the course of the sixteenth century, with an emphasis on Mexico, where a millennium-long book tradition was reshaped through its encounter with manuscripts and printed books of European origin. It surveys the Aztec, Mixtec, and Maya screenfold manuscripts that were the indigenous forbears of the sixteenth-century butterfly-bound book, and it considers the impact that new genres and new technologies, particularly the printing press, had on indigenous manuscripts. Topics include the nature of writing systems and pictography; the visual properties of literary genres; the semantics and economies of early modern media, particularly paper and ink; and the conceptual frameworks of \"colonial\" and \"hybrid.\" We work closely with works in Yale collections, particularly the Beinecke Library. HSAR 753a, Theories of Imagination and Visual Perception Margaret Olin This seminar traces the role of imagination and visual perception as conceived by philosophers, phenomenologists, perceptual psychologists, and other theorists in mainly Western thought since the seventeenth century. The ways in which perception and imagination are conceived together are informed by changing conceptions of each term. \"Imagination\" can be seen as a mental power of internal image making that must be considered separately from perception, or it may be considered as an indispensable component of perception, which itself can be conceived as a more or less faithful representation or a creative process. Readings are chosen from among the works of John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Hippolyte Taine, Hermann von Helmholtz, Henri Bergson, Jean Piaget, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others. The signicance of the discourse for art and literature is stressed. Students make presentations and submit papers on topics of their choosing in consultation with the instructor. Qualied undergraduates are welcome. HSAR 786a / AFAM 745a, Black Atlantic Visual Arts since 1980 Kobena Mercer This seminar surveys black diaspora practices in late-twentieth- and early twenty- rst-century art while questioning the survey genre as such. Examining contributions of black artists to paradigm shis that have interrogated the identity of art over the past thirty years, we review the demands that issues of race and ethnicity place on interpretive models in the historiography of art. Considering thematic categories in which to understand what is distinctive to the diasporic conditions of Black Atlantic practitioners, while consistently relating their concerns to broad patterns in art practice256 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 as a whole in an era of globalization, the aim is to identify critical terms that best narrate the transformations black diaspora artists have introduced to a period characterized by the shi from modern to postmodern to contemporary. HSAR 803a / EAST 500a, Reflecting Truth: Meiji Photography between Performativity and Representation, Modernity and Empire Sta Celebrating 150 years since the Meiji Restoration (1868) is an ideal opportunity to look back and ponder the engagement with an alternative history of photography, from a Japanese point of view. Photography arrived in Japan soon aer its creation in the UK and France (1839), and rst images were created as soon as 1848 in Kagoshima and Nagasaki. We consider the two paths photography developed in Japan, and their intersections: experimental approaches with performative modes of execution (i.e., direct light, opaque image, camera-less photographs, etc.), versus representations of Japan, a method that can be studied through two tracks\u2014the creation of exotic, nonmodern images for the Western, consuming eye; and the documentation of Japan's rapid modernization and political developments into settlement, nationalism, colonialism, and militarism. HSAR 814a, Japan's Global Baroque Mimi Yiengpruksawan The intersection of art, science, and diplomacy at Kyoto and Nagasaki in the time of Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch cultural and mercantile interaction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with attention to the entangled political relations linking the shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Philip II of Spain, Jesuit missionaries such as Alessandro Valignano, and the Christian daimy of Kyushu and the Inland Sea. Focus on Japanese castle architecture, nanban screens, world maps, arte sacra, and tea ceremony practices as related to the importation of European arte sacra, prints and drawings, scientic instruments, and world atlases such as Theatrum Orbis Terrarum. Includes inquiry into back-formations such as \"baroque\" and \"global\" to describe and/ or EALL and in Culture Edward Kamens and Mimi Yiengpruksawan A cross-disciplinary consideration of the phenomenon of disaggregation of texts and visual artworks and their reconguration in new forms. Focus on examples from the Japanese past in comparative and theoretical perspective. Students engage directly in the preparation of an installation on this theme in the Yale Art Gallery for spring 2019. Prerequisite: prociency in literary and modern Japanese. HSAR 837a, The Painting of Modern Life Marisa Bass \"Genre imagery\" is a category of art perennially resistant to interpretation, and one most oen dened by what it is not. It encompasses pictures understood to be secular, nonnarrative representations of everyday life, which at the same time appear staged, parodic, and at far remove from lived experience. These are works that raise issues of class and of gender and that speak above all to the exigencies of modern life within the culture of consumerism that bore them. This course examines genre painting from its rst emergence in the sixteenth-century Netherlands to its apogee in the seventeenth century. We interrogate the notion of self-awareness in these works, the issues associated with their enduring characterization as \"moralizing\" images, their development in relation to the tectonic shis of the Protestant Reformation, and the polyvalence of their comic mode. Particularly crucial to our discussion is the artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder, whose works in many ways defy the very category to whichHistory of Art 257 they most seem to belong. This seminar travels over October recess to Vienna to see the retrospective Bruegel exhibition at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, among other collections. Enrollment is limited and advanced permission of the instructor is required.258 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 History of Science and Medicine McClellan Hall, 203.432.1365 http://hshm.yale.edu M.A., M.Phil., Ph.D. Chair Deborah Coen Director of Graduate Studies Paola Bertucci Faculty Sakena Abedin (History of Science & Medicine), Paola Bertucci (History), Deborah Coen (History), Ivano Dal Prete (History), Rachel Elder (History of Science & Medicine), Joanna Radin (History of Medicine), Chitra Ramalingam (History of Science & Medicine), William Rankin (History), Carolyn Roberts (African American Studies; History; History of Medicine), Naomi Rogers (History; History of Medicine; Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies), John Harley Warner (History of Medicine; History) Aliated Faculty Rene Almeling (Sociology), Toby Appel (Librarian for Medical History), Alexi Baker (Collections Manager, HSI), Marisa Bass (History of Art), Randi Epstein (English ), Melissa Grafe (Librarian for Medical History), Dimitri Gutas (Emeritus, Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations), Ann Hanson (Classics), Jessica Helfand (Yale College), Marcia Inhorn (Anthropology), Kathryn James (Curator, Early Modern Books & Manuscripts, Beinecke Library), Amy Kapczynski (Law), Jennifer Klein (History), Stephen Latham (Director, Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics), Lisa Messeri (Anthropology), Joanne Meyerowitz (History), Amy Meyers (Yale Center for British Art), Alan Mikhail (History), Jennifer Raab (History of Art), Ayesha Ramachandran (Comparative Literature), Kevin Repp (Curator, Modern European Books & Manuscripts, Beinecke Library), Paul Sabin (History), Jason Schwartz (Public Health), Gordon Shepherd (Neuroscience), Rebecca Tannenbaum (History), R.

All students will normally take the three core Problems seminars: Problems in the History of Medicine and Public Health (HSHM 701 ), Problems in the History of Science (HSHM 702 ), and Problems in Science Studies (HSHM 710 ). These courses are committed to exploring histories of medicine and science alongside the cultural, political, and social forces that shape them. Issues of race, gender, sexuality, disability, class, and religion are integrated into discussions of medical and scientic knowledge production and praxis in Western and non-Western contexts. In addition to the three core Problems seminars, students are required to take four graduate seminars in the history of science or medicine. Two of the four must be graduate research seminars. The remaining ve courses can be taken in history of science or medicine, history, science, or any other eld of demonstrated special relevance to the student's scholarly objectives. Graduate school grading at Yale follows a qualitative rubric of Honors, High Pass, or Pass. During the rst two years of study, students must achieve Honors in at least two courses in the rst year and Honors in at least four courses by the end of the second year, with a High Pass average overall. At the end of each term, the director of graduate studies (DGS) will ask faculty members whether they have serious concerns about the academic progress of any rst- or second-year students in the Ph.D. program. Faculty members who have such concerns will provide written feedback to the DGS at the DGS's request. The DGS will use discretion in ensuring that feedback is provided in a clear and eective manner to any students about whom there are concerns. Students who enter having previously completed graduate work may obtain up to three course credits toward the completion of the total course requirement, the number being contingent on the extent and nature of the previous work and its t with intended course of study at Yale. Languages All students must show prociency in two languages in addition to English relevant to the student's research interests and approved by the DGS. Over the years, our graduate students have demonstrated prociency in a wide range of languages, including American Sign Language, Bulgarian, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Students may fulll the requirement in a variety of ways, including demonstrated command of a native language other than English, graduation from an approved foreign university where teaching is conducted in a language other than English, passing an approved language course for credit, or passing a language test administered by the faculty or by one of Yale's language departments. Language tests are administered by their respective departments (such as German, Italian, French,260 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 East Asian Languages and Literatures). Students should consult the DGS for additional details and options for uncommon languages. Yale oers classes in a variety of languages, from introductory to advanced levels, as well as special summer courses for targeted reading prociency. There are also opportunities to study languages outside of Yale's curriculum, including funding for summer language study, and Directed Independent Language Study (DILS) for individuals who wish to study a language not oered by Yale. For more information on these programs and foreign language tutoring at Yale, please visit the Center for Language Study's website at http://cls.yale.edu. Second-Year Review At the end of the academic year, the HSHM faculty will hold a special meeting to review each rst- and second-year student in the program. The purpose of the meeting is to assess students' academic progress. In order for second-year students to proceed to the third year, they must demonstrate through written work, classroom performance, and participation in departmental activities that they have the ability to: (a) speak and write clearly; (b) conduct independent research at a high level; and (c) develop coherent scholarly arguments. A faculty vote will be taken at the conclusion of the review meeting to decide whether each second-year student may continue in the program. If a majority of faculty present and voting determine that a student may not continue, the student will be informed in writing and withdrawn from the program. The review meeting must be a full faculty meeting, but faculty members with no knowledge of the students under review may abstain from the vote, and their abstentions will not count in the total. Those members of the faculty who have worked with or know the students being evaluated are required to attend. In the event that any necessary faculty members absolutely cannot be present, they may send their views in writing to the DGS, who will read them at the meeting. Qualifying Examination Prior to beginning work on the dissertation, all students are expected to develop a broad general knowledge of the discipline. This knowledge will be acquired through a combination of course work, regular participation in HSHM colloquia and workshops, and dedicated preparation for the qualifying oral examination. The qualifying examination has two main goals. First, it is a preparatory step toward the dissertation. Students will master the analytical vocabulary of the discipline and engage critically with key historiographic and theoretical questions. This will prepare them to select a research topic of scholarly signicance and to articulate its import eectively. Second, the qualifying examination will prepare students for teaching. Students will learn to communicate a set of historical themes and narratives condently and fluently. Accordingly, as part of their exam preparation, students may be asked to dra a syllabus for an undergraduate course based on each exam eld. Students will normally spend the summer following their second year preparing for the oral qualifying examination, which will be taken in the third year, preferably during the rst half. The qualifying examination will normally consist of four elds, each of which will be examined by a dierent faculty member: two elds in the history of science and/orHistory of Science and Medicine 261 history of medicine; one eld in an area of history outside of medicine and/or science; and one eld of special interest, the content and boundaries of which will be established in consultation with the student's adviser. Possibilities for the eld of special interest include a second eld in history outside of history of science or medicine, a eld with a scientic or medical focus (such as bioethics, health policy, public health, medical anthropology, or medical sociology), or a eld at the intersection of science, medicine, and other subjects (such as law, national security, religion, culture, biotechnology, gender, race, literature, the environment, and so on). In preparation for the qualifying examination, the program's faculty work closely with students to facilitate the successful passage of the exam. A student who does fail the qualifying examination will be permitted to retake it. A student who fails a second time will be asked to withdraw from the program. Advising During their rst term in the program, all students will be advised by the DGS. During the second term and thereaer, each student will be advised by a faculty member of the student's choosing. The adviser will provide guidance in selecting courses and preparing for the qualifying examination. The adviser may also oer help with the development of ideas for the dissertation, but students are free to choose someone else as the dissertation adviser when the time comes to do so. Students are encouraged to discuss their interests and program of study with other members of the faculty. Dissertation Prospectus Students are encouraged to begin thinking about their dissertation topics during the second year. This is an opportune time, since they will be expected to submit a dissertation prospectus as soon as possible following the qualifying examination and to defend the prospectus orally before being admitted to full candidacy for the doctoral degree. The prospectus defense is typically held in the second term of the third year, with advancement to candidacy before the start of the fourth year. For more information, please see the program's Guide to Prospectus and Prospectus Defense at https://hshm.yale.edu/sites/default/les/les/prospectus_guide.pdf. Committee Constitution Requirement Each Ph.D. student must have a dissertation committee and a dissertation adviser, satisfactory to the student's department and in accordance with Graduate School requirements, in order to register for the fourth year of study. Students without an approved committee and dissertation adviser will normally be withdrawn from their program. Teaching Teaching is an important part of the professional preparation of graduate students in History of Science and Medicine. Students are encouraged to participate in programs to develop their teaching skills, including the Certicate for College Teaching Preparation,262 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 which is a comprehensive training program designed to enhance prociency in classroom instruction. Typically, during the third and fourth years of study, students will serve as teaching fellows, which usually means that they will lead small-group discussion sections for undergraduate courses and grade their students' exams and papers. On occasion, however, students may work as teaching fellows in the second term of the second year, particularly if they have received course credit for previous graduate studies, or if they choose to defer the completion of their required course work for the rst term of the third year. Students usually work as teaching fellows for courses in the History of Science and Medicine, but they may also have the opportunity to be teaching fellows in History or other departments. At least two terms of teaching are required for doctoral students to graduate from the Program in the History of Science and Medicine; four terms are required for students on Yale-supported fellowships, although students may elect to substitute one or two of these terms with research assistantships at the Yale Center for British Art, the Yale University Art Gallery, or other sites across campus For more information, please contact the Oce of Financial Aid. Chapter Conference and Dissertation Completion In the fourth or h year, and preferably no later than the fall term of the h year, students are required to submit one chapter of the dissertation (not necessarily the rst chapter) to the dissertation committee. The committee will then meet as a group with the student to discuss the chapter and the student's progress on the dissertation more generally. This conference is meant to be an extension of the conversation begun in the prospectus defense, with the aim of providing feedback on the student's research, argument, and style at this early stage of the dissertation writing process. M.D./Ph.D. and J.D./Ph.D. Joint-Degree Programs Students may pursue a doctorate in History of Science and Medicine jointly with a degree in Medicine or Law. Standard graduate nancial support is provided for the doctoral phase of work toward such a joint degree. Candidates for the joint degree in Law must apply for admission to both the Law School and the Graduate School. Information about the joint-degree program with Medicine can be obtained from the website of the Yale School of Medicine (http://medicine.yale.edu/mdphd) and from the website of the Section of the History of Medicine (http://medicine.yale.edu/ histmed). Master's Degrees M.Phil. and M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. Terminal Master's Degree Program For the terminal master's degree students must pass seven term courses, four of which must be in HSHM. Course work will normally include the three Problems graduate seminars and one additional graduate seminar in HSHM. The remaining courses are to be chosen in consultation with the DGS or a faculty adviser. Honors grades are required in two courses, with a High Pass average overall. Financial aid is not available for this M.A. program.History of Science and Medicine 263 More information is available on the program's website, http://hshm.yale.edu. Courses HSHM 658b, The History of the Laboratory Chitra Ramalingam The social and cultural history of the experimental laboratory as a site for scientic activity, from early modern origins to the present day. The early modern origins of the laboratory; private, institutional, and state laboratories; relations between labs and eld stations; the lab in the colonial and developing world; industrial and corporate labs; laboratory architecture; secrecy and openness; gender in the experimental workplace; and popular representations of the laboratory. HSHM 701a / AMST 878a / HIST 930a, Problems in the History of Medicine and Public Health John Warner An examination of the variety of approaches to the social, cultural, and intellectual history of medicine, focusing on the United States. Reading and discussion of the recent scholarly literature on medical cultures, public health, and illness experiences from the early national period through the present. Topics include the role of gender, class, ethnicity, race, religion, and region in the experience of health care and sickness and in the construction of medical knowledge; the interplay between vernacular and professional understandings of the body; the role of the marketplace in shaping professional identities and patient expectations; health activism and social justice; citizenship, nationalism, and imperialism; and the visual cultures of medicine. HSHM 710b / HIST 921b, Problems in Science Studies Lisa Messeri Exploration of the methods and debates in the social studies of science, technology, and medicine. This course covers the history of the eld and its current intellectual, social, and political positioning. It provides critical tools\u2014including feminist, postcolonial, and new materialist perspectives\u2014to address the relationships among science, technology, medicine, and society. HSHM 716a / HIST 936a, Early Modern Science and Medicine Paola Bertucci The course focuses on recent works in the history of science and medicine in the early modern world. We discuss how interdisciplinary approaches\u2014including economic and urban history, sociology and anthropology of science, gender studies, art and colonial history\u2014have challenged the classic historiographical category of \"the Scientic Revolution.\" We also discuss the avenues for research that new approaches to early modern science and medicine have opened up, placing special emphasis on the circulation of knowledge, practices of collecting, and visual and material culture. HSHM 753a / AMST 838a / HIST 749a, Research in Twentieth-Century United States Environmental History Paul Sabin Students conduct advanced research in primary sources and write original essays over the course of the term. Topics are particularly encouraged in twentieth-century environmental history (broadly dened, no specied geography) as well as in U.S. history, with a focus on politics, law, and economic development. Readings and library activities inform students' research projects. Interested graduate students should contact the instructor with proposed research topics.264 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 HSHM 770b / HIST 940b / WGSS 782b, Disability Histories: Research Seminar Naomi Rogers This course introduces students to the major issues in current disability history as well as theoretical debates in disability studies. We discuss cultural, social, and political meanings of citizenship; eorts to dene and classify disabled bodies; contested notions of bodily dierence; and the ways disability has and continues to be used as a metaphor for socially dened inferiority like gender, race, or sexuality. By the fourth week students have identied the topic for their research papers and discussed them in class. The next month is devoted to research and writing. We start meeting again aer spring break to read and discuss a dra of each paper.Immunobiology 265 David Schatz Graduate Studies Carla Rothlin (TAC 625, 203.737.4679, carla.rothlin@yale.edu) Director of Graduate (TAC Medicine), Marcus Bosenberg, Chen, Joseph Cra (Internal Medicine), Peter (Microbial David Professors Tarek Fahmy (Biomedical Ann Haberman (Laboratory Medicine), John MacMicking (Microbial Pathogenesis), Eric Mere, Carla Rothlin, Bing Su Assistant Professors Stephanie Eisenbarth (Laboratory Medicine), Nikhil Joshi, Carrie Lucas, Noah Palm, Jo\u00e3o Pereira, Aaron Ring Fields of Study The Immunobiology graduate program is designed to prepare students for independent careers in research and teaching in immunology or related disciplines. The educational program emphasizes interdisciplinary training and collaborative and interactive research, an approach based on the idea that solving dicult problems requires the integration of individuals with common goals but diering expertise. Graduate students are diverse in their interests and ethnic backgrounds, and more than 50 percent are women. Research Areas Research focuses on the molecular, cellular, and genetic underpinnings of immune system function and development, on host-pathogen interactions, and on human and translational immunology, with a particular interest in a variety of autoimmune disorders. These research interests break down into six major themes, spanning almost all aspects of the immune system and its role in disease prevention. Lymphocyte development A central focus of research is to understand the molecular events underlying the development of B and T lymphocytes. Areas of major interest include the receptors and signals that control lymphocyte lineage commitment, cell maturation, cell proliferation, and cell death; the establishment of the proper environments for lymphocyte development; mechanisms that regulate the state of266 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 chromatin during lymphocyte development; and the mechanisms by which antibody and T cell receptor genes are assembled and diversied. Mounting an immune response An eective immune response requires the coordinated action of numerous cell types. A critical rst step is the activation of cells of the innate immune system, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils; and the receptors and signaling molecules that control this process are under intensive study. The mechanism by which cells take up, process, and present antigen is a major interest, as is the recognition of this antigen by T cell receptors on T lymphocytes. Cytoplasmic signal transduction molecules, nuclear transcription factors, and mechanisms controlling gene expression are all under study. Regulating the immune response The immune response is tightly regulated through the interaction of cell surface receptors with secreted cytokines and with one another, and the mechanisms by which these interactions exert their regulatory influences are studied in several laboratories. Another major interest is in learning how specialized cells or anatomic locations, such as vascular endothelial cells or the epidermis, regulate and direct the immune response. Consequences of an immune response Apart from the obvious consequence of the elimination of an invading organism, an appropriate immune response results in immunological memory and large numbers of activated lymphocytes, which must be eliminated. The mechanisms controlling immunological memory, tolerance, and apoptosis, as well as those leading to autoimmunity, are a major interest of many faculty. Diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis are just some of the autoimmune diseases under study. Much of this work takes place in the context of the Section of Human and Translational Immunology. Infectious disease and the host-pathogen interaction A major interest is the study of infectious organisms\u2014bacterial, viral, and parasitic\u2014and the immune response to them. A great deal of eort is directed toward understanding the strategies used by infectious agents to avoid the immune system. HIV, HBV (hepatitis B virus), and Legionella pneumophilia are all under study. Structural analysis of immune system receptors and eectors There is a growing interest in using structural approaches to understand the function of key molecules of the immune response. For example, a major eort is devoted toward understanding how the Toll-like receptors, despite their similarity in extracellular-ligand recognition regions, are able to specically recognize such a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS). Another eort is aimed at understanding the mechanism of APOBEC enzymes in controlling viruses such as HIV. Facilities More than thirty laboratories are actively involved in research in immunology. Many share immediately adjoining or nearby laboratory space on the top three floors of the Anlyan Center (TAC), 10 Amistad Street, and 300 George Street, and three faculty are funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The Department of Immunobiology provides one of the largest, highest-ranked training programs in immunology in the country, led by a faculty with a reputation for excellence in research. The Department ofImmunobiology 267 Immunobiology maintains a wide variety of major equipment, and Dr. Richard Flavell oversees a very active transgenic mouse/ES cell/knockout facility to which members of the department have access. Program Entry Most students enter the Immunobiology graduate program through the Immunology track of the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Other types of students enter from the M.D./Ph.D. program (see below), the MRSP (see below), or another BBS track, with approval of the Immunobiology director of graduate studies (DGS) and the faculty adviser. The faculty and students of the BBS program are organized into interest-based tracks. Immunology, being one of eight tracks, encourages individualized attention to maximize scientic interactions. There is complete freedom to work with any of the 350 faculty members aliated within any of the tracks and to take courses oered by any of the BBS departments or programs. Students are encouraged to supplement core courses in molecular and cellular immunology with additional courses selected from the wide range available in cell biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, molecular medicine, neuroscience, and bioinformatics. Research seminars and informal interactions with other graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty also form an important part of graduate education. The Section of Human and Translational Immunology (HTI) is a component of the Immunobiology department and is located at 10 Amistad Street and 300 George Street. Its mission is to accelerate the application of new developments in the eld of immunology to the treatment of human diseases. HTI faculty study the immunologic aspects of a very broad range of human diseases, encompassing investigations in the elds of cancer; transplantation of solid organs and stem cells; autoimmune diseases; and neurologic disease. The Medical Research Scholars Program (MRSP) is open to students who have already been accepted into the BBS program. A separate application is also required, and is to be submitted to the BBS. A total of eight students each year (four rst-years and four second-years) will be enrolled as Medical Research Scholars. They remain in their BBS tracks or departments but participate in the additional MRSP curriculum. The program bridges barriers between traditional predoctoral and medical training by providing Yale Ph.D. students with both medically oriented course work and a mentored clinical experience. This combination of medical knowledge and face-to-face interaction with patients and their doctors provides a new perspective to Ph.D. students and enhances the rigorous training in basic science already provided. Admission requirements In addition to meeting general BBS requirements, applicants are expected to have a rm foundation in the biological and physical sciences. It is preferred that students have taken courses in biology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, cell biology, physics, and mathematics. Actual course requirements, however, are not xed, and students with outstanding records in any area of the biological sciences may qualify for admission. There are no specic grade requirements for prior course work, but a strong performance in basic science courses is of great importance for admission. In special cases, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores may substitute for scores on the general GRE.268 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students are required to take six courses for a grade in the Yale Graduate School. Required graded courses for rst- and second-year students are: 1.IBIO 530 , Biology of the Immune System (Students have the option of passing out of IBIO 530 by taking the nal exam from the previous year.) 2.IBIO 531 , Advanced Immunology second seminar course can be audited if a student has grades in six other science courses and has already taken one seminar course for credit.) Required credit-only, nongraded courses for rst-year students (short research projects are taken under the guidance of three Yale professors) 3.IBIO 601 , Fundamentals of Research: Responsible Conduct of Research Fourth-year students are required to take IBIO 503 , a refresher training course in the responsible conduct of research. Additional courses are determined based on the individual needs of the student, and include courses in biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, molecular biology of prokaryotes, molecular biology of eukaryotes, animal viruses, the structure of nucleic acids and proteins, microbiology, and disease mechanisms. Students choose courses aer consulting the DGS and the thesis adviser. Honors The Graduate School uses grades of Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail. Students are required to earn a grade of Honors in at least two courses in the rst two years, and are expected to maintain a High Pass average. There is no foreign language requirement. Teaching Students are required to serve as a science TA (teaching assistant) for two terms before the end of their sixth term. Teaching protocol and rules are as follows: 1.Teaching two term-long science courses is required as a fulllment of the Ph.D.; 2.First-year students do not teach; 3.Teaching opportunities are rst given to students who need teaching credit; 4.Teaching for additional income is available when openings exist aer those selected for credit are hired; approval signatures from the adviser and DGS are required. 5.The maximum teaching allowed is one course per term. A Yale McDougal Center one-day seminar entitled \"Teaching at Yale\" is oered each year. Attending this seminar is recommended prior to teaching. Prospectus and qualifying exam Early in the fourth term (or in certain circumstances, in the third term), students make a thirty-minute presentation to the department of their proposed research and initial results. Thereaer, they meet with their prospectus committee, which assigns four or ve broad areas of biology and immunology that are of particular relevance to the proposed research and on which the student will beImmunobiology 269 examined in the qualifying exam. During the next several weeks, students prepare a formal research proposal (in NIH grant format) concerning the proposed thesis research and study for the exam. The exam is held within three months. It is an oral exam covering all aspects of immunology generally, with a focus on the assigned areas mentioned above. The student is questioned on aspects of the thesis proposal. Admission to candidacy Requirements for admission to candidacy, which usually takes place aer six terms of residence, are: completion of course requirements, one of the two teaching requirements, the qualifying exam, and the third-year committee meeting \u2014at the one-year anniversary of the qualifying exam\u2014with a signed certication form from the adviser and committee members verifying that the student has made good progress. Progress in thesis research in the third and later years is monitored carefully by the student's thesis committee (composed of the adviser and three or four other faculty). See below. M.D./Ph.D. Students Majoring in Immunobiology Required Six courses for a grade. Out of the six courses the following are mandatory: 1.IBIO 530 , Biology of the Immune System (Students have the option of passing out of IBIO 530 by taking the nal exam from the previous year.) 2.IBIO 531 , Advanced Immunology second seminar course can be audited if a student has grades in six other courses and has already taken one seminar course for credit.) Also required Two grades of Honors: Yale University graduate courses taken for a grade at the School of Medicine may be counted toward the Honors fulllment and the six total required courses. Verication must be provided to the DGS. One term of teaching : Previously taught courses in the School of Medicine may count toward this requirement. To request credit for previous teaching experience, a note from the course director describing the teaching experience (duration of the teaching experience, frequency of class meetings, number of students taught, materials covered, dates, and for whom) should be provided to the Immunobiology DGS. Responsible Conduct of Research, Refresher Course: Fourth-year students are required to take a refresher training course in the responsible conduct of research. M.D./Ph.D. students can fulll this NIH requirement through Immunobiology (IBIO 503 ) or through the M.D./Ph.D. program. are not required to take: Fundamentals of Research: Responsible Conduct of Research. A note from the DGS of the M.D./Ph.D. program must be forwarded to the Immunobiology DGS stating that the student has taken a course in Research Conduct and Ethics, or its equivalent in the School of Medicine. Include dates, titles, and faculty . If the student has not taken this course, then registration in this class is required.270 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Annual thesis committee meetings Each student is required to have a thesis committee meeting at least every twelve months, and more frequently if the student or committee feels that it would be appropriate or helpful. The thesis supervisor (the student's PI) then submits a thesis committee report form to the DGS summarizing the student's progress. Master's Degrees M.Phil. A student is entitled to the M.Phil. degree once all academic and prospectus requirements, and one of the two teaching requirements, have been met. Also required is a third-year committee meeting at which the members sign an approval form stating that the student is making good progress toward the student's research. M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students who complete at least one year of resident graduate study at Yale with the quality of work judged satisfactory by the Department of Immunobiology faculty and who have satised ten courses with an average grade point average of High Pass (graded) may petition for the award of the M.S. degree. Students must petition through the Registrar 's Oce of the Graduate School in early October for the December award of the M.S. and by the middle of March for the May award. Students who are eligible for or who have already received the M.Phil. will not be awarded the M.S. For additional information on the Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences see http://bbs.yale.edu. Courses For a complete listing of immunology-related courses, see http://bbs.yale.edu. IBIO 503b, Responsible Conduct of Research, Refresher Course Sta The NIH requires that students receive training in the responsible conduct of research every four years. This course meets that requirement for fourth-year students. The course has two components: (1) one large-group session is held for all fourth-year students through the BBS; the main topics are scientic misconduct and authorship; (2) two Immunobiology faculty facilitate discussions based on RCR topics, gathered in advance from the students; anonymous or hypothetical stories are selected by the faculty and discussed in a workshop environment in which students are then asked to analyze each case and suggest courses of actions. IBIO 530a / MBIO 530a / MCDB 530a, Biology of the Immune System Eric Mere The development of the immune system. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune recognition. Eector responses against pathogens. Immunologic memory and vaccines. Human diseases allergy, autoimmunity, cancer, immunodeciency, HIV/AIDS. IBIO 531b, Advanced Immunology Sta The historical development and central paradigms of key areas in immunology. The course attempts to develop a clear understanding of how these paradigms were established experimentally. Landmark studies are discussed to determine how the conclusions were obtained and why they were important at the time they were done. Lecture and discussion format; readings of primary research papers and review articles. Prerequisite: IBIO 530 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to een.Immunobiology 271 IBIO 532b, Inflammation Ruslan Medzhitov This course covers fundamentals of inflammation from a broad biological perspective, with a focus on both physiological and pathological aspects of inflammation. IBIO 536a, Immunobiology Seminar: Neuroimmunology Sta This course explores the diverse array of interactions between the immune and nervous systems, both in homeostasis and disease settings, including but not limited to neurodegenerative, and malignant diseases. IBIO 537b, Immunobiology Seminar: Translational O'Connor This designed to introduce immunobiology Ph.D. students to translational research and medicine. Each weekly seminar focuses on a specic disease with a conspicuous immunological component. In-class periods consist of very interactive, didactic sections covering disease phenotype, underlying immunobiology and pathology, and mechanisms of treatment approaches, including limitations. Discussions are led by principal investigators who focus on human translational immunology and by clinician-scientists who see patients in associated clinics. Examples of topics include: T and B cell contributions to the underlying pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and other autoimmune diseases; immune responses to acute brain injury; inherited immune disorders; paradigms governing how antitumor immune responses are promoted or suppressed; and current approaches in immunotherapy-based clinical trials. Assignments challenge students to think creatively about solutions to problems that obstruct the progress toward understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. A term assignment, in the form of a research proposal, focuses on independent study of a translational immunobiology problem of each student's choosing. Students are provided with elective opportunities for experiential learning through clinic visits with course faculty instructors. The combination of medical knowledge and interaction with translational and clinician-scientists provides a new perspective to immunobiology Ph.D. students that broadens their basic science training. The exposure to the practice of medicine enables them (and other graduate students) to work more condently at the interface of research and medicine and facilitate collaborations with clinical investigators. Prerequisite: IBIO 531 or a similar course that provides a solid foundation in fundamental immunology; may be waived for highly motivated students.

The goal of the program is to ensure that degree candidates obtain a solid understanding of cellular and molecular neurobiology, physiology and biophysics, neural development, systems and behavior, and neural computation. In addition to course work, graduate students participate in an annual research-in-progress talk and a regular journal club, organize the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program Seminar Series, and attend other seminar programs, named lectureships, symposia, and an annual research retreat.Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program 275 Special Admissions Requirements Applicants to the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program should have a B.S. or B.A. Most applicants have had course work in neuroscience, psychobiology, physiological psychology, mathematics through calculus, general physics, general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, or engineering. Deciencies in these areas can be corrected through appropriate course work in the rst year of residence. Laboratory research experience is desirable but is not a formal requirement. Scores for the GRE (General Test required; Subject Test recommended) or MCAT, three letters of recommendation, transcripts of undergraduate grades, and a statement of interest must accompany the application. To enter the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Ph.D. program, students apply to the Neuroscience track within the program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Each entering student is assigned a faculty advisory committee to provide guidance. This committee is responsible for establishing the student's course of study and for monitoring the student's progress. This committee will be subsequently modied to include faculty with expertise in the student's emerging area of interest. Although each student's precise course requirements are set individually to take account of background and educational goals, the course of study is based on a model curriculum beginning with ve core required courses: Bioethics in Neuroscience (INP 580 ), Principles of Cellular ), Comparative Neuroanatomy (INP 704 ), all completed in the rst year of enrollment. Collectively, these courses are designed to ensure broad competence in modern neuroscience. Students are also required to complete at least three additional elective courses from a broad set of neuroscience-related courses. The Graduate School uses grades of Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Fail and requires two term grades of Honors during the rst two years of study. Students are expected to maintain at least a High Pass average. Additional degree requirements are successful completion of both terms of Lab Rotation for First-Year Students (INP 511 , INP 512 ); both Second-Year 513 , INP 514 BBS Students (B&BS 503 ), completed during the fourth year of enrollment. This will ensure that degree candidates obtain a solid background in systems, cellular, and molecular approaches to neuroscience. Admission to candidacy requires passing a qualifying examination normally given during the second year, and submission of a dissertation prospectus (NIH NRSA grant format) before the end of the third year. In accordance with the expectations of the BBS program, Ph.D. students are expected to participate in two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching. Thesis committee meetings are required annually. Also required is the completion and satisfactory defense of the thesis. Requirements for M.D./Ph.D. students are the same as for Ph.D. students with the following dierences: three courses are required (INP 701 ; Structural and Functional Organization of the Human Nervous System [INP 510 ]; and one elective graduate-level course).

INP 523a / ENAS 880a, Imaging Drugs in the Brain Evan Morris Seminar course to explore the uses of functional imaging (PET and fMRI) to study the mechanisms of action and long-term eects of drugs (legal and illegal) on brain function. Basic research ndings are the main topics, augmented by some discussion of imaging in drug development by Pharma. The central theme of the course is experiment design: how to design the proper imaging experiment to ask the question. What are the endpoints of the experiment? What are the limitations of interpretation? What are the proper controls and what are the proper analyses to ensure reliable, interpretable results? The syllabus is comprised primarily of classic journal articles, in addition to the occasional book chapter or review article. Most class periods begin with a short lecture to cover methodological concepts, followed by discussion of reading material. A number of class periods are organized as games, contests, or other in-class exercises. The emphasis is on formulating the question and designing the experiment. Topics include basic understanding of imaging technology (brief physics, biochemistry, and mathematics) as it relates to imaging of drugs, receptors, neurotransmitters; understanding the primary outcomes of imaging experiments; imaging experiment design; recent ndings related to drug abuse; common neurophysiological pathways of addictive drugs (how to image reward); and uses of imaging in drug development (what do drug companies want to measure?). Weekly homework: concise written synopses of assigned articles (students routinely endorse the synopses as the best way to learn the material). INP 530a / PSYC 530a, Foundations of Neuroscience: Biological Bases of Human Behavior Steve Wohn Chang The purpose of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the biological factors underlying human cognition and behavior. Particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms associated with individual dierences in healthy functions (including emotion regulation, stress sensitivity, higher cognition, reward sensitivity, impulsivity, and social functions) and their relations with psychiatric and neurological disorders. Biological factors to be covered include genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, neurochemical, hormonal, and neuropsychological influences. Several of the initial sessions are devoted to basic topics (e.g., neurons, neuronal signaling, brain systems), before we begin our discussion of the neural basis of behavior and cognition. We also cover seminal work on animal models for mechanistic insights into the neurobiology of human behavior. Graduate students with any neuroscience research interest are encouraged to take this course. Required of Psychology Ph.D. students in the neuroscience area.

Fields of Study The Italian department brings together several disciplines for the study of the Italian language and its literature. Although the primary emphasis is on a knowledge of the subject throughout the major historical periods, the department welcomes applicants who seek to integrate their interests in Italian with wider methodological concerns and discourses, such as history, rhetoric and critical theories, comparison with other literatures, the gurative arts, religious and philosophical studies, medieval, Renaissance, and modern studies, and the contemporary state of Italian writing. Interdepartmental work is therefore encouraged and students are accordingly given considerable freedom in planning their individual curriculum, once they have acquired a broad general knowledge of the eld through course work and supplementary independent study. Special Admissions Requirements The department recognizes that good preparation in Italian literature is unusual at the college level and so suggests that applicants begin as soon as possible to acquire a broad general knowledge of the eld through outside reading. At the end of the rst and second years, students' progress is analyzed in an evaluative colloquium. Applicants who have had little or no experience in Italy are generally urged to do some work abroad during the course of their graduate program. For all students of Italian, a reading knowledge of Latin is essential. This may be acquired during the course of the rst year, but applicants are reminded that it is dicult to schedule beginning language courses in addition to a normal graduate program. Students are advised to acquire prociency in the languages required for the doctoral program before matriculation.288 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Candidates must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second Romance language, Latin, and a non-Romance language (German recommended). The Latin examination must be passed, usually before the beginning of the third term of study, and all language requirements must be fullled before the Ph.D. qualifying examination. Students are required to take two years of course work (as a rule sixteen courses), including two graduate-level term courses outside the Italian department. Aer consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS), students who join the graduate program with an M.A. in hand may have up to four courses waived. The comprehensive qualifying examination must take place during the third year of residence. It is designed to demonstrate the student's mastery of the language and acquaintance with the literature. The examination, which is both written and oral, will be devised in consultation with members of the department. In the term following the qualifying examination, the student will discuss, in a session with the departmental faculty, a prospectus describing the subject and aims of the dissertation. Students are admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus. Admission to candidacy normally occurs by the end of the sixth term. Teaching is considered to be an important component of the doctoral program in Italian. Students will be appointed as teaching fellows in the third and fourth years of study. Guidance in teaching is provided by the faculty of the department and specically by the director of language instruction. Combined Ph.D. Programs Italian and Film and Media Studies The Department of Italian also oers, in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in Italian and Film and Media Studies. For further details, see Film and Media Studies. Applicants to the combined program must indicate on their application that they are applying both to Film and Media Studies and to Italian. All documentation within the application should include this information. Italian and Renaissance Studies The Department of Italian also oers, in conjunction with the Renaissance Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in Italian and Renaissance Studies.

ITAL 560a / CPLT 708a, Age of Disenchantment Giuseppe Mazzotta This course focuses on the literary debates, theological arguments, and scientic shis taking place between the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1437-38) and the Council of Trent and beyond, by reading key texts by Valla, Cusa, Pulci, Luther, Erasmus, Ariosto, Campanella, Bruno, Galileo, and Bellarmino. It examines issues such as the crisis of belief, the authority of the past, the emergence of freedom, new aesthetics, and the eort to create a new theological language for modern times. ITAL 590a / CPLT 916a / FILM 830a, Literature into Film Millicent Marcus We study a series of written works and their cinematic adaptations, considering rst the texts in autonomous, literary terms, and then their transformation into audiovisual spectacles. In most cases we screen the lm on Tuesday evening and do a comparative study in the Thursday class period, making extensive use of video clips to do close visual analysis of scenes in the light of their corresponding textual sources. Rather than develop a general theory of adaptation, we construct methodological approaches on an ad hoc basis, taking each instance of adaptation as a case study amenable to a variety of methodologies\u2014psychoanalytic, feminist, ideological, generic, semiotic, and so forth. The class is conducted as a seminar, and active student participation is expected. There are two papers\u2014one shorter one of a critical nature at midterm and a nal research paper (approximately 15-20 pages). Films examined include (tentatively) Pasolini's Medea and Tavianis' Venice, Rosi's Three Brothers, Salvatores's I'm Not Afraid, and De Sica's Two Women. Writing assignments comprise 75 percent of the nal grade and class participation 25 percent. ITAL 691a or b, Directed Romantic Quarrels Giuseppe Mazzotta The course examines the extraordinary intellectual and political feverishness that characterizes Italian history between the time of the French Revolution and the achievement of the national unity of the country (1861). Radical literary theories, terrorist political practices, epoch-making literary works, and passionate debates about aesthetics mark this period. Its vitality and contradictions emerge from a reading of selected works by Cuoco, Aleri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Mazzini, Manzoni, Rosmini, and De Sanctis. They all in varying degrees explore the nexus between the idea of a \"country,\" the sense of secret revolutionary action (the so-called Risorgimento), the value of the classical heritage, and the need for the emergence of a new sense of history and a new philosophical discourse that would be addressed also for Europe. In Italian. ITAL 720a / CPLT 684a Epic David Quint and Jane Tylus This course looks at Renaissance epic poetry in relationship to classical models and as a continuing generic tradition. It examines epic type scenes, formal strategies, and poetic architecture. It looks at themes of exile and imperial foundations, aristocratic ideology, and the role of gender. The main readings are drawn from Vergil's Aeneid, Lucan's De290 Graduate School of Arts and del Novecento Millicent Marcus No literary form is better suited to gauging the convulsive changes wrought by Italy's entrance into modernity than the novel. Innitely permeable to the forces of historical circumstance, the novel counters these external forces with its own version of the evolving Italian subject in all its personal richness and complexity. We study the evolution of this literary genre throughout the course of the twentieth century and, in the process, adopt a variety of approaches, including, but not limited to, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narratology, gender, ideological criticism, and Aer: Geographical and Linguistic Itineraries Jane Tylus Not simply the date of Columbus's landing, 1492 also marks Lorenzo de' Medici's death, the banishment of Jews from Spain and Sicily, the election of a Borgia pope\u2014Alexander VI, celebrated by Machiavelli\u2014and the birth of Pietro Aretino. We briefly consider the shared cultural and religious history of Italy and Spain, even as most of our attention will be focused on Italy's role as precursor: the Florentine Vespucci was the rst to use the phrase \"nuovo mondo,\" and Columbus was inspired by the stories of Marco Polo and travels of Italian pilgrims to the Holy Land. We start with Columbus and his contemporary Savonarola and move into the \"new worlds\" of the early sixteenth century as represented by four topics: the rise of print; the burgeoning pastoral genre; the (brief) rearmation of the Florentine republic with cameo appearances by Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Machiavelli; and the otherworldly (but also very much of this world) romance of Ariosto. We spend time in the Beinecke Library with maps, Savonarola's sermons, and early sixteenth-century Sienese pastoral plays, and also spend an aernoon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Renaissance paintings. In English.Law 291 Law Sterling Law Building, 203.432.1696 http://law.yale.edu/phd M.A., Ph.D. Dean Heather Gerken Director of Graduate Studies Robert Post Fields of Study The Ph.D. in Law program prepares students who have earned a J.D. to enter law teaching or other careers that require a scholarly mastery of law. The program is designed to provide a broad foundation in the canonical texts and methods of legal scholarship and to support students in producing original scholarship in the form of a dissertation. The program strongly encourages, but does not require, interdisciplinary approaches to the study of law. Admissions Requirements All applicants must hold a J.D. from an accredited United States law school at the time they matriculate in the program. Applicants must have taken the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). For additional admissions requirements, please see the Ph.D. in Law program's website, http://law.yale.edu/phd. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Each student will have a faculty advisory committee, which will help the student select appropriate courses. In their rst year, students take a mandatory two-term seminar on the foundations of legal scholarship, legal theory, and methods and as many as four additional courses. Students may take other courses in the Law School or in other departments or schools at Yale University. Each student's advisory committee may waive up to four courses. The foundations seminar may not be waived and must be taken for a grade, not audited. Each Ph.D. student must take two qualifying examinations. The rst, administered before the start of the second term in the program, is a written examination based on materials studied in the rst term of the foundations seminar. It will test the student's breadth of knowledge across the legal canon, including knowledge of canonical texts, methods, and principles. The second is an oral examination administered by the student's advisory committee at the beginning of the second year and no later than October 15 of that year. The oral examination tests the student's knowledge of the scholarship, theories, and methodologies relevant to the student's area of study. Both qualifying examinations are graded on a pass/fail basis. A student who fails a qualifying examination will have one opportunity to retake the examination in the following term. Aer completion of the second qualifying examination, the student will assemble a faculty dissertation committee and prepare a dissertation prospectus. Upon approval of the prospectus, usually by the end of the fourth term, the student will devote the remaining time in the program to writing a dissertation, which may take the form of292 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 a traditional monograph or three publishable scholarly articles. The nal dissertation must be approved by both the student's dissertation committee and the Ph.D. Policy Committee. Students in the Ph.D. in Law program are also expected to meet additional academic requirements in each year of the program, specied below and outlined in greater detail in the Ph.D. in Law Program Manual available from the Graduate Programs Oce at Yale Law School. Students who fail to meet program requirements will not be in good standing and may be withdrawn from the program. All required written work must be judged satisfactory by the student's advisory committee, in consultation with the assistant dean for graduate programs and the director of graduate studies (DGS). A satisfactory article or chapter is one that the student's advisory committee, the assistant dean, and the DGS agree is appropriate and ready for professional presentation at an academic workshop, and one that oers the promise of meeting the standards expected by leading law reviews or academic presses. First-year requirements include satisfactory performance in course work, including the foundations seminar; passing the rst qualifying examination; and completion of a rst dissertation article or chapter. Students also must submit an approved reading list for the second qualifying examination to the assistant dean and the DGS no later than the nal day of the spring examination period. Second-year requirements include submission of the rst dissertation article or chapter for publication no later than the rst day of classes for the fall term of the second year and successful completion of the second qualifying examination by October 15 of that year. Second-year students shall complete a second satisfactory dissertation article or chapter by December 1 and complete their rst required teaching experience by the end of their second year in the program. They shall submit their dissertation prospectus to the assistant dean and the DGS by June 1 of the second year. In the third year, students are required to complete and submit a dra of their third dissertation article or chapter by August 1, and to workshop their article or chapter at the Law School no later than September 20 in preparation for the academic job market. For those who plan to graduate in May of their third year, a nal and complete dissertation must be submitted to the assistant dean, the DGS, dissertation committee members, and the Graduate School registrar no later than March 15. Students must also satisfactorily complete their second teaching experience during their third year in the program. Both teaching experiences will typically be reviewed in person or via recorded media with the assistant dean and/or the committee chair and the DGS. Students who do not successfully complete all program requirements before the conclusion of their third year in the program may petition the Ph.D. Policy Committee to enroll in a seventh or eighth term on \"Dissertation Completion\" status. Teaching As part of their training, Ph.D. students must complete two terms of teaching experience. There are a number of ways to fulll this requirement, depending on the availability of teaching experiences from year to year. They include: (1) serving as a teaching assistant for a Law School course; (2) serving as a student organizer for a Law School reading group; (3) serving as a teaching fellow for a course in Yale College or another school at Yale; (4) co-teaching a Law School course with a faculty member;Law 293 and (5) in unusual situations, teaching their own course. In all cases, students engaged in teaching will have faculty supervision and feedback from their advisers. Master's Degree M.A. The M.A. degree may be granted to Ph.D. in Law students who are not completing the program, but who successfully complete the two-term foundations seminar and at least two additional courses, pass the two qualifying examinations, and submit an academic paper that is judged to be of publishable quality. Students may substitute a third course for one of the two qualifying examinations. The degree is available retroactively to students who matriculated from September 2013 onward. Program materials are available upon request to the Graduate Programs Oce, Yale Law School, 127 Wall Street, New Haven CT 06511.

Fields of Study The Department of Linguistics embraces an integrative approach to the study of language, based on the premise that an understanding of the human language faculty arises only through the combination of insights from the development of explicit formal theories with careful descriptive and experimental work. Members of the department oer courses and conduct research in which theoretical inquiry proceeds in partnership with historical and comparative studies, eldwork, experimental work, cognitive neuroscience, and computational and mathematical modeling. Faculty expertise includes all of the major domains of linguistics (phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) and spans a wide range of languages. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Course Work The conception of linguistics embraced by the Yale Ph.D. program requires that students receive training that is both deep in its coverage of areas of linguistic inquiry and broad in the range of methodological approaches. The course work requirements are designed to accomplish these complementary goals. This course work must include a set of core courses, designed to expose students to core theoretical ideas, together with courses exposing students to a range of methodologies in linguistic research. During their rst six terms, students must complete a minimum of fourteen term courses at the graduate level, of which seven must be completed during the rst two terms, and twelve during the rst four terms. During the initial two years of course work, students must receive at least three grades of H (= Honors). Two grades of F, or three of P or F, during the initial two-year period constitute grounds for dismissal from the Ph.D. program.Linguistics 295 Core courses The core requirement ensures that students achieve expertise at the level of the following courses: LING 612 , Linguistic Change; I; LING 680 , Morphology. The usual way to demonstrate this expertise will be to take all of these courses. Because several of these courses have prerequisites, students will typically need to take more basic courses in order to prepare themselves for the courses listed here. For example, LING 632 , Introduction to Phonological Analysis, serves as a prerequisite for LING 635 ; and LING 653 , Syntax I, is a prerequisite for LING 654 ; entering students usually take both of these prerequisite courses in the rst term. However, students entering the Ph.D. program with sucient background will be able to place out of antecedent courses. To facilitate placement, reading lists covering the material in the following basic courses will be provided, and students may request to take placement exams in areas in which their previous preparation is such that they could proceed directly to more advanced course work: LING 512 , Historical Linguistics; LING 620 , General Syntax I; LING 663 , Semantics I. By August 1, entering students may send a request to the DGS for a placement exam in any of these ve areas. The exams will be given during the week prior to the fall term. Passing an exam allows the student to place out of the corresponding course. Students placing out of courses are nonetheless expected to complete the same requirement of a minimum of fourteen term courses in the rst three years. Methodology courses For the methodology requirement, students must take three relevant courses. The following courses, which are oered regularly by the department, qualify, but other courses may as well, to be determined in consultation with the adviser and DGS: LING 600 , Experimentation in Linguistics; LING 624 , Formal Foundations Theories; , and Computation I; LING 631 , Neurolinguistics; LING 641 , Field Methods. One of the methodology courses must be taken during the rst year of the program, and two must be completed by the end of the second year. Seminar courses Starting in year three and continuing until the prospectus is approved, students are expected to enroll in one seminar course for credit each term. Students should use such seminars as opportunities both for exploring new research areas and, especially, for pushing current research interests in novel directions. Research The primary focus of a Ph.D. program is independent research. In the course of our Ph.D. program, students will learn to carry out cutting-edge linguistic research, culminating in the completion of a dissertation. To help students in the transition from \"consuming\" to also \"producing\" linguistic research, there are a number of structures and requirements in place. 1.Research adviser and rst-year directed readings. By the end of the rst term of the program, students will need to nd a department faculty member who is willing to serve as their research adviser. This choice should be made on the basis of296 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 compatibility of research interests and discussions between the student and faculty member. Starting from the spring term of the rst year, students will, with the help of their adviser, dene a topic of research interest, meeting regularly (minimally once every three weeks) and carrying out a series of readings on this topic. Students are required to keep a research journal, describing their readings and how they t in with work in the area, and chronicling the development of their thinking about the research topic. It is the faculty's expectation that this exploration will form the foundation for the research reported in the student's rst qualifying paper (on which see below). Note however that the initial choice of research adviser is not set in stone: students who want to change their choice of topic or adviser for whatever reason may do so, so long as they are able to nd a faculty member who is willing to serve as their adviser on a new topic. It is the student's responsibility to nd a suitable adviser, and students are expected to have a faculty adviser at all times during their enrollment in the program. 2.Portfolio. At the conclusion of the rst year of the program, students must submit to the faculty a portfolio of two research papers, in two distinct subelds. These papers should demonstrate a student's mastery of the material in these elds to the level covered in the core courses in the area, as well as the ability to identify a signicant research question and argue for a possible solution. In short, such papers should be at the level of an excellent term paper, representative of a student's best work during the rst year of course work. The faculty do not expect students to write papers expressly for the portfolio. Rather, the portfolio will typically consist of versions of term papers from classes taken during the rst year in the program, which are then lightly revised on the basis of comments received from the course instructors. The deadline for the submission of these papers is June 15. 3.Annotated bibliography/research plan. On the basis of the research journal begun during the rst year in the program, students will prepare an annotated bibliography and research plan (ABRP) for their rst qualifying paper. The ABRP, which should be approximately twenty pages in length, should lay out the question that the student wants to explore, motivating its importance through a presentation and synthesis of relevant past literature on the topic. The deadline for submission of the ABRP is the beginning of the third week of the fall term. 4.Qualifying papers. Once the ABRP has been completed, the student will proceed to work on the qualifying papers (QPs). The goal of the QPs is to develop a student's ability to conduct independent research in linguistics at the level of current scholarship in two dierent areas of linguistics. The faculty expect a QP to report on the results of a substantial project, which are written up in a manner consistent with the standards of the eld. Because the transition from student to scholar can be a dicult one, we have broken the process of writing the rst QP into a number of smaller steps with specic deadlines for each (all during the second year of the program): (a) Students are required to make a presentation of their preliminary results in an appropriate venue (lab meeting, reading group, seminar, etc.) by no later than the end of the fall term. (b) Also by the end of the fall term, the student will send a request for a QP reader to the DGS. This request must include a title and abstract of the project, and may also request specic faculty members to be involved. On the basis of research area and faculty availability, the DGS will identify a faculty member other than the adviser to serve as a QP reader. This reader will be involved in the ultimate evaluation of the QP once it is completed. Because itLinguistics 297 is useful to get a range of feedback on one's work, we encourage students to make the best use of their QP reader by meeting with them and keeping them up to date on the progress of the project. (c) Students must submit a rst dra of their QP to their adviser and reader no later than February 1. (d) Students must make an oral presentation of their work. This oral presentation may take place in the department (typically at a Friday Lunch Talk). Alternatively, the oral presentation requirement may be satised via a presentation at a professional conference, provided at least one member of the department faculty is in attendance. (e) Once the QP has been orally presented, students must submit the nal version of the paper to their adviser and reader no later than three weeks from the date of presentation. Toward the end of the spring term of the second year, the student should begin to explore possible areas and advisers for the second QP, and must have identied an area and adviser by the beginning of the fall term of the third year. Students must follow the same steps and deadlines listed above for the second QP, this time during the third year. 5.Prospectus. No later than the beginning of the seventh term, students must choose a dissertation topic and nd a faculty member who is willing to serve as dissertation adviser. By the end of the seventh term, students will present a dissertation prospectus to the entire faculty. The prospectus should lay out clearly the student's proposed dissertation topic. It should motivate the importance of the topic, present the core idea of the proposed work together with its promise and viability, and demonstrate how this work ts into past research in the area. The prospectus should also identify a dissertation committee. The committee must include at least three faculty members (including the adviser), two of whom must be members of the Linguistics department. The prospectus document should be een to twenty pages in length. Aer the document is submitted, the prospectus must be defended orally in front of the faculty. Upon successful completion of the prospectus defense, students advance to Ph.D. candidacy. 6.Dissertation . By the end of the eighth term, students must complete a chapter of the dissertation, together with a detailed outline of the dissertation and comprehensive bibliography. At this point (and at one-term intervals thereaer until the completion of the dissertation), the student will meet with the entire dissertation committee to evaluate progress toward the dissertation. When this committee approves the chapter and dissertation outline, students are eligible for a University Dissertation Fellowship, which will support them in their h year of graduate study. Students are expected to complete their dissertations by the end of the h year. At least one month prior to the dissertation ling date, the completed dissertation must be orally defended. This defense will typically involve a public presentation of the main results of the dissertation and oral examination by the members of the dissertation committee. Committee members must be given the completed dissertation no less than two weeks prior to the date of the defense. Feedback and Evaluation At the conclusion of each academic year, all Ph.D. students will receive a written evaluation of their performance in the program, highlighting their strengths and accomplishments, as well as mentioning areas for improvement. Because of the298 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 fundamental role played by research in the Ph.D. program, we expect the completion of the research requirements to take highest priority. It is particularly important that students make satisfactory progress toward the rst QP and complete all work by the deadlines given above. Failure to do so may result in being asked to leave the program. Language Requirement Students are expected to exhibit some breadth in their knowledge of the languages of the world beyond those most commonly studied (including but not conned to Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages) and those most similar in structure to the student's rst language. LING 641 , Field Methods, fullls this requirement; alternatively, with the permission of the DGS, the student may instead take an appropriate language structure class, or one or more classes characterized as L3 or higher at Yale or the equivalent elsewhere. This requirement must be completed before the prospectus defense, when the student advances to Ph.D. candidacy. Teaching Fellow/Research Assistant Requirements The faculty regard teaching experience as an integral part of the graduate training program in Linguistics. All students are required to serve as Teaching Fellows for a minimum of two terms, usually beginning in the rst term of the third year. In addition, students must complete two additional terms of assistantship. These may be either as a Teaching Fellow, or through participation in externally supported, supervised research as a Research Fellow. Research assistantships may be provided by the Linguistics faculty and by various Yale and Yale-aliated units. Before accepting a research assistantship in fulllment of this requirement, students must receive approval from the DGS. To be approved, a research assistantship must meet the following criteria: 1.It must be supervised by a Linguistics department faculty member or a faculty member from an aliated unit, such as Haskins Laboratories or the Yale School of Medicine. 2.It must provide research experience that complements the student's academic plan of study. 3.It must provide at least ten hours of experience per week. If an approved research assistantship is accepted that does not provide a stipend equal to the standard departmental stipend, a University Fellowship will be provided to augment the stipend so as to bring it up to the departmental standard. Master's Degrees M.Phil. Students in the doctoral program who complete all requirements for the Ph.D. apart from the submission of a completed dissertation (but including the presentation and successful defense of a dissertation prospectus) may petition for the M.Phil. degree. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students in the doctoral program who successfully complete the course work, examinations, and work samples required by the end of the second year of graduate study (see above) may petition for the M.A. degree.

Therefore, language change must result from external factors: language contact involving a cohort of L2- learners. Likewise, multilingualism, thus language contact, is commonly assumed to hinder acquisition, and presupposed \"intense\" contact situations are regarded as propitious for creolization. This course proposes a shi of perspective, focusing on multiple-variety ecologies such as creole societies in which speakers-listeners can acquire, alternate between, and sometimes \"mix\" dierent languages, dialects, or registers. Two major questions are addressed: (1) How does acquisition proceed in such multiple-variety ecologies? (2) What does a theory of the multilingual mind tell us about acquisition of L1 and the emergence of grammars? The descriptive and theoretical framework adopted is that of hybrid grammars as developed in Aboh (2015). Prerequisite: familiarity with syntax and linguistic variation. LING 617a, Language and Mind Maria Pi\u00f1ango The course is an introduction to language structure and processing as a capacity of the human mind and brain.

Set theory, rst- and higher-order logic, and the lambda calculus as they relate to the study of natural302 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 language meaning. Some attention to analyzing the meanings of tense/aspect markers, adverbs, and modals. LING 681b / AFST 681, Comparative Syntax: A View from Kwa (Niger-Congo) Sta This course adopts a microcomparative perspective by looking at closely related languages (i.e., Gbe and Kwa families of Niger-Congo) as well as a macrocomparative perspective that situates these languages in the larger context of typologically and genetically unrelated languages (e.g., Romance, Germanic). We set the stage by rst looking at word formation, word classes, and the role of tones at the morphosyntactic level. Building on this, the rst part of the course discusses topics such as Tense, Mood, Aspect (TMA) expressions, word order variation (e.g., VO vs. OV patterns), serial verb constructions, restructuring, and the notion of \"light verb.\" These topics allow us to establish a prole of the clause structure in these languages. With this knowledge at hand, the second part of the course addresses the question of information structure and the commonly assumed parallelism between the CP and DP domains. The descriptive framework adopted is the cartographic approach developed by Rizzi (1997), Cinque (1999), Aboh (2004), and much related work. Prerequisite: some background in syntax. LING 772a, Meaning, Concepts, and Words Maria Pi\u00f1ango The only way a nite brain can produce an unlimited number of novel thoughts is by storing a nite system. It is proposed that part of this system is a large collection of stored parts, which we call \"concepts\" and which are further combined and recombined via predetermined principles. In order to allow us to express our thoughts, our nite brain must also include a system of associating combinations of concepts with combinations of words and sentences. In this seminar we investigate proposals and empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, linguistics, and cognitive neuroscience, seeking to explain this connection between the ways we combine our concepts and the ways we combine our words and phrases. LING 790a, Research Methods Hadas Kotek An introduction to research methods in linguistics. Observational and experimental approaches to research in the eld. Topics include collection and organization of linguistic data, basic eld methods, and use of language corpora and databases. Introduction to research in language acquisition and language change.

Special Admissions Requirements The GRE General Test or the GMAT Test is required by the Graduate School. Applicants whose native language is not English must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Core Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree All students are required to take the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop (MGMT 780) and each individual program 's seminar and workshop series in every term throughout their years in residence. These are not counted as part of the required number of courses specied below for each of the individual programs. All of the programs are full-time, requiring that all students be in residence at Yale during the academic year as well as the summer months. Teaching is considered to be an important part of the doctoral program in Management. Students are expected to serve as teaching fellows in304 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 one term of their residence. Additional requirements in each program of study are listed below. Special Requirements in Accounting The specialization in Accounting prepares students to become accounting scholars engaged in research and teaching at the highest levels in the general areas of nancial information and contracting within and across organizations. It is designed to develop strong theoretical and empirical skills. There is heavy emphasis on students' original research, which is supported through courses, presentations, feedback, joint work, and informal interactions with the faculty and fellow students in accounting and other disciplines. The general structure of the program is as follows. During the rst four terms of study, students take a minimum of twelve courses in addition to attending conference and seminar presentations and other academic activities. Courses are selected in consultation with the faculty advisers and the director of graduate studies (DGS). The summer months at the end of years one and two are devoted to completing original research papers (due by September 1 and October 1, respectively). Aer four terms in the program (typically by mid-June), students take a faculty-written three-day qualifying exam aimed at assessing their intellectual readiness to start dissertation research. They remain in residence for ve years while they receive a stipend. During this period each student is assigned to a member of the faculty as a research assistant. Students also have the option of accepting teaching assistantships. To register for their seventh term of study, students submit an approved dissertation prospectus. Students are expected to complete their dissertations by the end of the sixth year but may petition for a seventh year of study if academically necessary. Special Requirements in Financial Economics The specialization in Financial Economics prepares students to launch a career in academic nance. Students should seek out faculty with whom they may wish to work early in the process to ensure a smooth transition from one stage of the program to the next. Students are required to take twelve courses. In the rst year of study, students are expected to take Financial Economics I (MGMT 740 ), Financial Economics II (MGMT (ECON 500 and 501), Econometrics I (ECON 550), and Econometrics II (ECON 551). Some students with limited math or economics backgrounds may be advised to postpone taking some of these courses until their second year of study. In addition, students are expected to take the Ph.D.-level courses oered by the Finance faculty. Availability and topics vary by year. Students must receive a grade of Honors in at least one full-year or two term-long graduate courses. Furthermore, students must have no more than one grade of Pass in these courses. To be admitted to candidacy, a student must pass both Financial Economics I and II as well as the topic courses oered in the year the student takes the qualifying exam and maintain an HP average in their courses. Research papers Students are expected to write original research papers during the summers aer their rst and second years of study. Both papers must be solo authored. The topic of the rst-year paper requires written approval from the student's faculty adviser; the deadline to submit that approval to the DGS is May 15. The paper itself isManagement 305 due to the director of the program by the second Monday in August. The second-year paper proposal must be approved by May 15 by a member of the Finance faculty who has agreed to supervise the project. The paper itself is due to the student's adviser by the second Monday in August. Students whose papers receive a failing grade may be dismissed from the program. Qualifying exam The two-part qualifying exam covers the Ph.D.-level Finance courses taken in the rst two years of study. Unless given a waiver by the director of the Finance Ph.D. program, students must take the relevant section of the qualifying exam before the last business day before June 15 of their rst and second years of study. A student who fails either section of the exam may retake it once, by the nal business day before August 1. A student who fails either section of the exam a second time will be dismissed from the program. Dissertation Students must write a dissertation prospectus and assemble a dissertation committee in order to register for a sixth term of study. The committee must have at least three members, at least two of whom must be from the Finance faculty unless a waiver is given by the program director. If a student cannot form a committee prior to the start of the sixth term of study, the student will be withdrawn from the program. Prior to submission of the dissertation, students must pass a public defense. Before a public defense can be scheduled all three members of the committee must agree that the student and the dissertation itself are ready. All members of the faculty are invited to a dissertation defense. Aer the defense, the faculty in attendance will meet to discuss the dissertation. The faculty may pass or fail the student. In addition, they may grant a conditional pass when they believe there are only minor problems with the dissertation and delegate the nal decision regarding corrections of those problems to the committee. Special Requirements in Marketing (Behavioral) Students are required to take fourteen Ph.D.-level courses in their rst two years of study: one microeconomics course (ECON 545); two empirical methods courses (e.g., PSYC 518, S&DS 563 ); ve or INP 597 ); and six electives (from may take other courses as electives if the faculty adviser permits. Students are expected to obtain at least two Honors grades and a High Pass average in the remaining twelve courses. Research papers Students are expected to write original research papers during the summers aer their rst and second years of study. Either paper may be coauthored with others students or faculty. Students select a faculty adviser for each paper and work with him or her during the summer to develop the paper. The rst paper must be presented in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop during the fall term of the student's second year of study. The second paper must be presented in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop in the student's third year of study. Qualifying exam Students must successfully complete the qualifying exam in Marketing at the end of their second year of study. The exam is administered no later than June 15. A student who fails to successfully complete the exam may retake it once;306 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 retakes are generally scheduled during August of the year in which the student rst took the exam. A second failure results in dismissal from the program. Dissertation The dissertation typically consists of three essays which are completed in the student's third through h years of study. Prior to starting work on the dissertation, the student must write a dissertation prospectus and nalize the dissertation committee, consisting of the principal adviser and three other faculty members. The prospectus must be completed and accepted by the dissertation committee by the end of the student's third year of study. Prior to submission of the dissertation to the Graduate School, the student must defend it before the student's committee, other faculty members, and interested doctoral students. The faculty could accept the dissertation as is, require minor changes, or reject the dissertation and ask the student to redo one or more essays. Special Requirements in Marketing (Quantitative) Students are required to take twelve Ph.D.-level courses in their rst two years of study: two microeconomics courses ( ECON 500 and ECON courses ECON 550 551); three depth Students may take some other courses as electives if the faculty adviser permits. Students are expected to obtain at least two Honors grades and a High Pass average in the remaining twelve courses. If a student has requested and received a waiver for any of the above courses, the total number of required courses drops by the number of waivers received. Research papers Students are expected to write original research papers during the summers aer their rst and second years of study. Either paper may be coauthored with other students or faculty. Students select a faculty adviser for each paper and work with the adviser during the summer to develop the paper. The rst paper must be presented in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop during the fall term of the student's second year of study. The second paper must be presented in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop in the student's third year of study. Qualifying exam Students must successfully complete the qualifying exam in Marketing at the end of their second year of study. The exam is administered no later than June 15. A student who fails to successfully complete the exam may retake it once; retakes are generally scheduled during August of the year in which the student rst took the exam. A second failure results in dismissal from the program. Dissertation The dissertation typically consists of three essays which are completed in the student's third through h years of study. Prior to starting work on the dissertation, the student must write a dissertation prospectus and nalize the dissertation committee, consisting of the principal adviser and three other faculty members. The prospectus must be completed and accepted by the dissertation committee by the end of the student's third year of study. Prior to submission of the dissertation to the Graduate School, the student must defend it before the student's committee, other faculty members, and interested doctoralManagement 307 students. The faculty could accept the dissertation as is, require minor changes, or reject the dissertation and ask the student to redo one or more essays. Special Requirements in Operations Students are required to take at least twelve courses: two core courses (ECON 500 and ENAS 649), typically completed in the rst year of study; courses MGMT 720 , MGMT 721 ), completed in the second year of study; and at least three elective courses scheduled in consultation with the student's course adviser. Under unusual circumstances and with the approval of both the adviser and the DGS, students may fulll some of the methods course requirements with alternative oerings. Research paper During the summer aer the rst year of study, each student works with an Operations faculty member on an ongoing research project. By September 30 the student must write a paper and prepare a presentation on the project for the Operations group internal seminar. Continuation in the program is contingent upon faculty approval of the paper. General exam The general exam has two components, an exam based upon the course work of the rst two years, and a research paper. The course-work exam is scheduled by faculty sometime aer the last day of spring-term, second-year exams and prior to June 1. Students then spend the summer writing an original research paper on a topic chosen from a list provided by the Operations faculty (or, with the approval of the faculty, on a topic of the student's own choosing); the paper must be submitted by September 30. Faculty will evaluate the student's continued enrollment in the program based upon the course-work exam and the research paper. Students who do not pass the exam will be oered a chance for remediation prior to the end of the fall term of their third year of study. Dissertation Prior to the start of the seventh term of study, the student must submit a proposal for the dissertation as an application to doctoral candidacy. Based upon this proposal and the student's previous performance, the faculty will decide whether to admit the student to candidacy. Special Requirements in Organizations and Management Upon admission, each student is assigned a faculty adviser who helps the student design an individualized program that prepares the student to do research in the student's area of interest. All students must complete twelve courses: two methods courses ( PLSC 503 and PLSC 504 ; or ECON 550 and ECON 551; or, students who believe they will primarily do experimental research may take PLSC 503 and a methods course in psychology such as PSYC 518); four depth 629); four social science courses in psychology or sociology PSYC 505, ); one breadth course outside the student's area of study, chosen in consultation with the student's adviser; and one additional elective chosen in consultation with the adviser. Beginning in their third year, students are also expected to present in the Organizations and Management Workshop once per year.308 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Research papers and qualifying exam During the summer aer the rst year of study, each student collaborates on a research paper with a faculty member. An initial dra of the paper should be completed by September 30, and the completed paper should be approved by two faculty members and submitted by 5 p.m. of the last day of classes of the fall term. Students will present these coauthored papers in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop in the fall of the second year. During the summer aer the second year of study, each student works on a research paper under the guidance of a faculty member. An initial dra of the paper should be submitted by 5 p.m. of the last business day in October of the student's third year of study. Students will present these papers in the Ph.D. Student Research Workshop in their third year of study. The second summer paper is considered the qualifying exam and will be vetted by both the Organizations and Management faculty and the DGS. Dissertation Once students have completed their course work, rst-year paper, and qualifying exam, they may apply for admission to candidacy. As part of this application, students must submit a proposal for their planned dissertation and form a four-person dissertation committee to advise this research. Admission to candidacy depends on approval of the proposed plan of study and a comprehensive review of the student's performance by the faculty; completion of the requirements listed above does not guarantee admission. Students must be admitted to candidacy prior to their fourth year of study. JOINT J.D./PH.D. IN FINANCE Students in the joint J.D./Ph.D. in Finance program must meet the following requirements: Course requirements Ph.D.: Eight courses, including the following seven required courses: ECON 500; ECON 501, which covers an 550 and ECON 551; for MGT If MGMT 742 is not oered in the student's second year in the program, the student may choose in its place one of the following graduate nance courses: J.D.: 71 credit units at Yale Law School, including the required rst-term courses taken in one term (Contracts, Torts, Civil Procedure, and Constitutional Law); Criminal Law; a course satisfying the legal ethics requirement; and Business Organizations. Predissertation writing requirements (1) A paper fullling the Ph.D. second- year research paper requirement; and (2) a paper fullling one of the J.D. writing requirements (substantial or supervised analytic writing). Note: an accepted Ph.D. second-year research paper will fulll the student's remaining J.D. paper requirement by registration for independent research credit with the student's law school faculty adviser. One of these papers must qualify as the student's prospectus. Qualifying examination in nance The section of the qualifying exam pertaining to MGMT 740 and MGMT 742 (or the doctoral nance course taken in place of MGMT 742 when it is not oered in the student's second year in the program). The qualifying exam is taken aer the student has completed all required graduate nance courses. Dissertation and oral defenseManagement 309 Master's Degrees M.Phil. A student who is admitted to candidacy will be eligible to receive the M.Phil. upon the recommendation of the program's faculty and the approval of the Graduate School. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) A student who completes the required courses with a High Pass average and the rst-year paper will be eligible for the M.A. degree upon the recommendation of the program's faculty and the approval of the Graduate School. Program materials are available upon request to the Director of Graduate Studies, Management, Yale University, PO Box 208200, New Haven CT 06520-8200. For information on the M.B.A. degree, please contact the admissions oce at the School of Management. Courses MGMT 700a, Seminar in Accounting Research I Zeqiong Huang Study of analytical modeling techniques in accounting research that covers topics such as performance measurement for incentives, the consequences of asymmetric information in economic relationships and the role of accounting therein, information sharing within and across rms, and the pricing of related-party transactions. MGMT 720a, Models of Operations Research and Management Vahideh Manshadi MGMT 731a, Organizations and the Environment Olav Sorenson This course, oered every other year, reviews economic, psychological, and sociological perspectives of how organizations interact with one another. Sessions are generally organized around phenomena and jointly taught by two instructors from dierent perspectives. MGMT 734a / SOCY 506a, Designing Social Research Balazs Kovacs This is a course in the design of social research. The goal of research design is \"to ensure that the evidence obtained enables us to answer the initial [research] question as unambiguously as possible\" (de Vaus 2001: 9). A good research design presupposes a well-specied (and hopefully interesting) research question. This question can be stimulated by a theoretical puzzle, an empirical mystery, or a policy problem. With the research question in hand, the next step is to develop a strategy for gathering the empirical evidence that will allow you to answer the question \"as unambiguously as possible.\" MGMT 740a / I Jonathan Ingersoll and Stefano Giglio Current issues in theoretical nancial economics are addressed through the study of current papers. Focuses on the development of the problem-solving skills essential for research in this area. MGMT PSYC and Nathan Novemsky The seminar examines research on the psychology of decision-making, focusing on judgment. Although the normative issue of how decisions should be made is relevant, the descriptive issue of how decisions are made is the main focus of the course. Topics of discussion include judgment heuristics and biases, condence and calibration, issues of well-being including predictions and experiences, regret and counterfactuals. The310 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 goal of the seminar is threefold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing knowledge in behavioral decision theory, to develop the students' skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to that knowledge. Students generally enroll from a variety of disciplines including cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, nance, marketing, political science, medicine, and public health.

The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. program is ve years. Requirement (1) should be completed by the end of the second year. A sequence of three qualifying examinations (algebra and number theory, real and complex analysis, topology) is oered each term, at intervals of about one month. All qualifying examinations must be taken by the end of the third term. The thesis is expected to be independent work, done under the guidance of an adviser. This adviser should be contacted not long aer the student passes the qualifying examinations. A student is admitted to candidacy aer completing requirements (1)-(5) and obtaining an adviser.312 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 In addition to all other requirements, students must successfully complete MATH 991, Ethical Conduct of Research, prior to the end of their rst year of study. This requirement must be met prior to registering for a second year of study. Honors Requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's Honors requirement by the end of the fourth term of full-time study. Teaching Teaching experience is integral to graduate education at Yale. Therefore, most Mathematics students are required to assist in teaching during ve terms. Students in years one and two serve as tutors and graders in undergraduate mathematics courses during one term per year. The department also oers a required teaching practicum in year two. In years three through ve, students normally teach one section of calculus or its equivalent during one term per year. Students receiving external fellowships may petition for a waiver of teaching while receiving external funding in place of University funding, but they are still required to teach one section of calculus or its equivalent for a minimum of two terms over the course of their program. Master's Degrees M.Phil. In addition to the Graduate School's Degree Requirements (see under Policies and Regulations), a student must undertake a reading program of at least two terms' duration in a specic signicant area of mathematics under the supervision of a faculty adviser and demonstrate command of the material studied during the reading period at a level sucient for teaching and research. M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) A student must complete six term courses with at least one Honors grade, perform adequately on the general qualifying examination, and be in residence at least one year. The M.S. degree is conferred only en route to the Ph.D.; there is no separate master's program in Mathematics. Courses MATH 500a, Modern Algebra I Sta A survey of algebraic constructions and theories at a sophisticated level. Topics include categorical language, free groups and other free objects in categories, general theory of rings and modules, artinian rings, and introduction to homological algebra.

We discuss algebraic and combinatorial tools used by topologists to encode information about topological spaces. Broadly speaking, we study the fundamental group of a space, its homology, and its cohomology. While focusing on the basic properties of these invariants, methods of computation, and many examples, we also see applications toward proving classical results. These include the Brouwer xed-point theorem, the Jordan curve theorem, Poincar\u00e9 duality, and others.

Special Admissions Requirements The General Test of the GRE is required. A writing sample of ten to twenty pages should be included with the application. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Languages required are Latin, French, and German. Latin may be replaced with Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew when appropriate. Prociency in Latin, Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew is tested with an examination administered and evaluated by the program during the rst term. Prociency in French and German is demonstrated by passing the departmental examinations and should be achieved by the third term. Students will design their programs in close contact with the director of graduate studies (DGS). During the rst two years students take fourteen term courses, and must receive an Honors grade in at least four term courses the rst year. Students take an oral examination, usually in the h term, on a set of three topics worked out in consultation with the DGS. Then, having nurtured a topic of particular interest, the student submits a dissertation prospectus that must be approved by the end of the third year. Upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus, students are admitted to316 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. What remains, then, is the writing, submission, and approval of the dissertation during the nal two years. Students in Medieval Studies participate in the Teaching Fellows Program in the third and fourth years. Master's degrees M.Phil. See degree requirements under Policies and Regulations. The M.Phil. degree may be requested aer all requirements but the dissertation are met. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may qualify for the M.A. degree upon satisfactory completion of three terms of course work. Minimum requirements include a High Pass average in courses and passing the examination in Latin, Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew. Courses MDVL 536a / HIST 536a, Charters, Cartularies, and Archives Paul Freedman and N. Raymond Clemens An examination of medieval documentation and how to use it to answer questions about medieval politics, society, and religion. Charters are single documents representing transactions, ranging from wills to grants of rights to sales contracts. Cartularies are collections of documents that show how an institution (usually an ecclesiastical institution) acquired property; and they back up and prove rights over those properties. The course looks at archives and ways in which documents end up in archives, how they are organized, and what that can tell us about the issues they focus on. MDVL 563b / CLSS 602b, Advanced Latin Paleography Barbara Shailor The challenges of using hand-produced Latin manuscripts in research, with an emphasis on texts from the late Middle Ages. Gothic cursive scripts and book hands ca. 1200-ca. 1500; fragments of unidentied codices; complex or composite codices with heavy interlinear and marginal annotations. Manuscripts and fragments selected largely from collections in the Beinecke Library. Prerequisite: CLSS 601 or permission of the instructor. MDVL 571a / CLSS 601a, Introduction to Latin Paleography N. Raymond Clemens Latin paleography from the fourth century CE to ca. 1500. Topics include the history and development of national hands; the introduction and evolution of Caroline minuscule, pre-gothic, gothic, and humanist scripts (both cursive and book hands); the production, circulation, and transmission of texts (primarily Latin, with reference to Greek and Middle English); advances in the technical analysis and digital manipulation of manuscripts. Seminars are based on the examination of codices and fragments in the Beinecke Library; students select a manuscript for class presentation and nal paper. MDVL 650a / HSAR 591a, Visions and Art in Medieval Europe Jacqueline Jung From the Book of Revelation to the Showings of Julian of Norwich (d. 1423), accounts of visions in the Christian tradition were inextricably intertwined with the visual arts. Through examinations of medieval texts, images, and material culture, in conjunction with modern analyses of related phenomena, this seminar explores the range of representational practices that helped medieval Christians summon up, make sense of, and communicate extraordinary moments of contact with the divine. We address suchMedieval Studies 317 questions as the changes in visionary experiences over time, the role of language and literacy in the communication of such experiences, the impact of gender on visions, the varieties and functions of other senses (especially touch and taste) in medieval visions, and the impact of visionary reports on the development of art. We begin by addressing the theoretical, cognitive, and anthropological facets of visionary experience before turning to medieval primary sources such as saints' lives, accounts of otherworld journeys, miracle books, sermons, monastic chronicles, and individually composed vision books, and to modern interpretations by historians such as Caroline Bynum, William Christian, Peter Dinzelbacher, Jerey Hamburger, Barbara Newman, Giselle de Nie, and Jean-Claude Schmitt. Visual materials include both depictions of visions (such as Apocalypse manuscripts, paintings of the Temptation of St. Anthony, and renderings of Hildegard's visions) and images that played a role in sparking visionary experience (such as Marian statues, crucixes, Man of Sorrows images, and Baby Jesus dolls). Reading knowledge of German, French, and Latin is strongly recommended.318 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Microbiology Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine 354F, 203.737.1087 http://medicine.yale.edu/micropath M.S., M.Phil., Ph.D. Director Corey Brushett Professors Serap Aksoy (Epidemiology), Susan Baserga (Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry; Genetics; Therapeutic Radiology), Ronald Breaker (Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology; Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry), Richard Cellular, Jacobs-Wagner (Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology; Microbial Pathogenesis), Albert Ko Walther Mothes (Microbial Pathogenesis), (Epidemiology), Pathogenesis; Immunobiology), Nancy Ruddle (Emerita, Epidemiology), Dieter S\u00f6ll (Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry; Chemistry), William Summers (Emeritus, Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry), Joann Sweasy (Therapeutic Radiology; Genetics), Peter Tattersall (Laboratory Medicine; Genetics), Christian Tschudi (Epidemiology), Paul Turner (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology) Associate Professors Murat Acar (Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology; Physics), Choukri Farren Isaacs Developmental Biology), Carla Rothlin (Immunobiology), Christian Schlieker (Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry; (Internal Medicine; Microbial Pathogenesis), Jerey Townsend (Biostatistics; Ecology & Evolutionary Biology), Xiong (Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry) Assistant Professors Stavroula Hatzios (Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Ho (Microbial Internal Medicine/Infectious Diseases), Nikhil Rego (Microbial Pathogenesis), Aaron Ring (Immunobiology)Microbiology 319 Fields of Study The Graduate Program in Microbiology is a multidepartmental, interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in training and research in the study of microorganisms and their eects on their hosts. The faculty of the program share the view that understanding the biology of microorganisms requires a multidisciplinary approach; therefore, the Microbiology graduate program emphasizes the need for strong multidisciplinary training. The program is designed to provide individualized education in modern microbiology and to prepare students for independent careers in research and teaching. Students can specialize in various areas, including bacteriology, virology, microbe-host interactions, microbial pathogenesis, cell biology and microbial genetics and physiology, parasitology, microbiome, and microbial ecology and evolution. Special Admissions Requirements To enter the Ph.D. program, students apply to the Microbiology track within the interdepartmental graduate program in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. An undergraduate major in biology, biophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, or molecular biology is recommended; the GRE General Test or MCAT is required. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Course work generally occupies the rst two years of study. Each student, together with a faculty committee, outlines a course of study tailored to the individual's background and career goals. A program of course work may include general microbiology, virology, parasitology, and/or microbial genetics, as well as complementary courses in such areas as epidemiology, cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, and genetics. Students must take a minimum of four courses, three of which have to be in microbiology. Students must receive a grade of Honors in two full-term courses. All students participate in three laboratory rotations (MBIO 670 , MBIO 671 , and MBIO 672 ), with dierent faculty members, in their area of interest. Laboratory rotations ensure that students quickly become familiar with the variety of research opportunities available in the program. An individualized qualifying exam on topics selected by each student, in consultation with the faculty, is given before the end of the second year. Students then undertake an original research project under the direct supervision of a faculty member. In the third year, students organize their thesis committee and prepare a dissertation prospectus, which is submitted to the Graduate School aer approval by their committee. The student is then admitted to candidacy. Upon completion of the student's research project, the Ph.D. requirements conclude with the writing of a dissertation and its oral defense. An important aspect of graduate training in microbiology is the acquisition of teaching skills through participation in courses appropriate for the student's scientic interests. These opportunities can be drawn from a diverse menu of lecture, laboratory, and seminar courses given at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels. Ph.D. students are expected to participate in two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching. Students are not permitted to teach during their rst year. In addition to all other requirements, students must successfully complete IBIO 601 , Fundamentals of Research: Responsible Conduct of Research, prior to the end of their320 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 rst year of study. This requirement must be met prior to registering for a second year of study. In their fourth year of study, all students must successfully complete B&BS 503, RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The M.Phil. degree can be awarded to Ph.D. students who have been admitted to candidacy. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.S. This degree may only be granted to students who are withdrawing from the Ph.D. program prior to advancing to candidacy. To be eligible for this degree, a student must have completed at least four graduate-level term courses at Yale, chosen from a number of main courses including, but not limited to: MBIO 685, MBIO 530, MBIO 734, MBIO 680, and CBIO 602.

Laboratories in MB&B focus on a diverse collection of problems in biology. Some specialize in the study of DNA dynamics, including replication, recombination, transposition, and/or functional genomics. Others focus on transcriptional regulation, from individual transcription factors to the control of lymphocyte activation, the interferon response, and organismal development. Other groups study RNA catalysis, RNA-protein interactions, and ribonucleoproteins including spliceosomes and the ribosome. Additionally there are those that emphasize protein folding and design, transmembrane signaling, and control of the cell cycle. Structural and computational biology is a strong component of many of these research eorts. Special Admissions Requirements Courses in introductory biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, mathematics through dierential equations, and one year of physics withMolecular Biophysics and Biochemistry 323 calculus are required for admission. Biochemistry is strongly recommended. Applicants must take the GRE General Test, which is preferred, or the MCAT. To enter the Ph.D. program, students apply to an interest-based track within the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (PEB) Students applying to one of four tracks of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences program may simultaneously apply to be part of the PEB program. See the description under Non-Degree-Granting Programs, Councils, and Research Institutes for course requirements, and http://peb.yale.edu for more information about the benets of this program and application instructions. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree All rst-year students (except M.D./Ph.D.) perform three laboratory rotations (encompassed by MB&B 650 and MB&B 651 , Lab Rotation for First-Year Students). All students are required to take, for credit, seven one-term science courses. To obtain the desired breadth and depth of education, students are required to take two courses in molecular biophysics (one of which must be MB&B 720 ), one course in critical thinking (MB&B 730 ), and one course in molecular biology (MB&B 743 is recommended but not required). The second credit in molecular biophysics and the molecular biology credit may be satised by taking appropriate courses from an approved list available each fall. Additional courses, chosen from within MB&B or from related graduate programs, should form a coherent background for the general area in which the student expects to do dissertation research. All students also attend MB&B 676 , Responsible Conduct of Research. In their fourth year of study, all students must successfully complete B&BS 503 , RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students. Students with an extensive background in biochemistry or biophysics are permitted to substitute advanced courses for the introductory courses. There is no foreign language requirement. The student's research committee (see below) makes the nal decision concerning the number and selection of courses required of each student. All students are required to assist in teaching two terms at the TF-10 level during their graduate careers, usually during the second and third years. The student selects a research adviser by the end of the second term of residence. At that time two additional faculty members are chosen to form a research committee, with the total committee including at least two members of MB&B. Students are required to meet with this committee in the spring of years two and three, and in both the fall and spring of subsequent years. The qualifying examination, usually taken in the fall of the second year, is an oral defense of a research proposal consisting of (1) thesis aims and (2) extended goals on the same topic. The extended goals should include approaches beyond those in the thesis aims, typically beyond those generally employed by the host lab. Thus, a predominantly molecular biological set of thesis aims should be accompanied by biophysical approaches in the extended goals section, and vice versa. The three-member oral examination committee usually includes at least one of the two members of the research committee excluding the thesis adviser. Requirements for admission to candidacy, which usually takes place aer four terms of residence, include (1) completion of course requirements; (2) completion of the qualifying examination; (3) certication of the student's research abilities by vote324 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 of the faculty upon recommendation from the student's research committee; and (4) submission of a brief prospectus of the proposed thesis research. Completion of the teaching requirement is not required for admission to candidacy. Once nal dras of the thesis chapters have been approved by the research committee, the student presents a dissertation seminar to the entire department, and only aerward may the thesis be submitted. Students must have written at least one rst-author paper that is submitted, in press, or published by the time of the thesis seminar. Honors Requirement Students must meet the Graduate School's Honors requirement by the end of the fourth term of full-time study; see Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. Students must also maintain an overall High Pass average. Student progress toward these goals is reviewed at the ends of the rst and second terms. M.D./Ph.D. Students M.D./Ph.D. students must satisfy the requirements listed above for the Ph.D. with the following modications: Laboratory rotations are not required but are available. Assisting in teaching of one lecture course is required. Students are required to take MB&B 800 as part of their medical curriculum in addition to the two courses in molecular biophysics described above. Students with weak backgrounds in molecular biology will need to take MB&B 743 . Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. Awarded only to students admitted to candidacy who are continuing for the Ph.D. Students need not have completed their teaching requirement to receive the M.Phil.

Special Admissions Requirements Applicants should state their specic eld of study and intended specialization. Evidence of reading knowledge of both French and German is required of all Ph.D. students. Prociency in one of these languages is normally a prerequisite for admission and is demonstrated by passing a departmental examination upon registration at Yale. Prociency in the second language must be achieved before admission to the second year of study. Ph.D. students admitted with only one of the two required languages or who fail the departmental examination are expected to enroll in an appropriate full-year course given by the French or German department at Yale (or the equivalent elsewhere, with the approval of the director of graduate studies [DGS]). Completion of such a course with a grade of A or B will be accepted as fullling the prociency requirement in either language; exceptions, for instance, for native speakers of French or German, may be made by the department upon recommendation of the DGS. For students in the M.A. program, evidence of reading knowledge of either French or German is sucient. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Course Work The department normally requires three full years of course work: four yearlong courses or eight term courses per year are considered a full load. Normal progress in course work is considered to be consistent achievement of grades of High Pass or better, and at least four term courses or two yearlong courses with Honors per year.342 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Of the twenty-four required courses for graduate study, at least eighteen should be taken within the department, usually within the student's primary eld of study. Courses taken outside of the department should be clearly related to the student's primary eld or constitute a coherent second eld. For students who take no courses outside of the department, minimum competence in a second eld within NELC is required, dened as follows: at least two terms of a Near Eastern language, to be evaluated either by examination or a course grade of High Pass or better, or at least two terms of nonlanguage courses outside the area of specialization. Advanced standing In exceptional cases, upon presenting evidence of successful completion of graduate courses at other universities or at Yale prior to their matriculation in the Ph.D. program, students with signicant prior knowledge in their primary elds of study may apply for a waiver of up to eight courses toward the twenty- four required for candidacy. The faculty adviser and the DGS will normally present such applications to the faculty of the department, with a recommendation, no later than the end of the second year. Committees While doing course work, students are mentored by a faculty adviser from their eld and by the DGS. Students writing dissertations may, if they so wish, be mentored by a committee headed by a primary adviser from NELC (not necessarily the faculty adviser from the course work years) and staed with one, two, or more additional members, from either inside or outside the department, depending on the student's specic needs. Committees are to be approved by the DGS. Interested students are encouraged to seek out suitable and willing faculty to serve on their advisory committees. Special Language and Course Requirements Course work should be planned to meet two departmental general standards: core languages for the primary elds of study, and minimum competence in a secondary eld. The core languages in each of the major elds of study are as follows: Arabic Humanities: Arabic and one other Near Eastern language, typically Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish. Assyriology: Sumerian and Akkadian. Classical Near East: Arabic and at least two of the following: Armenian, Aramaic (Babylonian or Syriac), Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, Middle Persian, New Persian, or Sanskrit. Egyptology: Egyptian and at least four terms of Demotic or Coptic. Minimum competence in a secondary eld of study is dened as follows: at least two terms of a Near Eastern language to be evaluated either by examination or with a course grade of High Pass or better, or at least two terms of nonlanguage courses outside the area of specialization. A minimum grade of High Pass in these courses will be considered successful fulllment of this requirement. In Arabic Humanities, the minimum competence can be extended to an interdisciplinary course of study in a minor eld. Minors may include six to eight term courses in such departments and programs as Comparative Literature, French, History, History of Science and Medicine, Italian, Judaic Studies, Linguistics, Medieval Studies, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Spanish and Portuguese, or others as applicable.Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations 343 Students in all four elds of the department will be expected to declare their choice of a secondary language or area, or a minor eld, by their third term of study. Training in Teaching NELC students normally acquire four terms of teaching experience, between their second and fourth years in residence. Teaching Fellow assignments will be made by the DGS in consultation with the relevant faculty and will, whenever possible, take student preferences into account. Examinations and the Dissertation The qualifying examination is normally taken at the end of the third year of study or no later than the beginning of the fourth year of study. For students who enter with advanced standing, the qualifying examination could be taken at the end of the second year. Qualifying examinations normally include three written and one oral examination, including language, literature, history, and other topics to be determined by the DGS in consultation with the student and the relevant faculty. Qualifying examinations may be based in part on reading lists of primary core texts and secondary literature compiled in advance by the student and the relevant faculty. Primary texts and secondary literature from course work may also be topics of the examination. For language examinations, unseen texts may also be included. In the case of the program in Arabic Humanities, for students electing to do a minor, the written portion will consist of two language examinations and one subject in the minor eld, and the oral will consist of two subjects in Arabic studies and one in the minor eld. Written examinations are set by the individual faculty members responsible for particular areas of study, but the oral portion may be conducted by the full sta of the department. The dissertation proposal is normally submitted one month aer completing the qualifying examination. In their nal term of course work, students may, with the permission of the DGS and the relevant faculty, enroll in a Directed Readings course related to the general eld of the prospective dissertation topic. Course work should include preparation of a comprehensive, annotated bibliography for the prospective topic and exploration of selected aspects of the topic in a research paper. Students availing themselves of this option may present some of their work at the NELC Roundtable. The dissertation prospectus may comprise up to thirty pages, excluding the bibliography. A two-page summary of the prospectus will normally be circulated among and voted upon by the faculty, though the full prospectus will be available for consideration. Successful completion of the comprehensive examination and submission of an acceptable prospectus will qualify the student for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Aer completion of the dissertation, the candidate may receive a nal examination concerned primarily with the defense of the thesis. Archaia Graduate Qualification Students can participate in the Yale Program for the Study of Ancient and Premodern Cultures and Societies (Archaia) and receive a graduate qualication by fullling the necessary requirements.

The Final Oral Examination typicallyNursing 355 lasts 1.5 to 2 hours. The student gives a 15- to 20-minute formal presentation of the dissertation and answers questions. Successful completion of the Final Oral Examination is required before the Ph.D. can be awarded. M.S.N./Ph.D. Joint-Degree Program The joint-degree program combines the two-year M.S.N. degree from the School of Nursing and the ve-year Ph.D. in Nursing. The joint program allows students to complete requirements for both degrees in ve years. Applicants for admission to the joint program must be admitted to both schools. Students typically enter the joint program at matriculation, but M.S.N. students who are completing the Research Concentration may apply to the Ph.D. program while enrolled in the fall of year two of the M.S.N. degree. Students will be assigned a Ph.D. adviser upon enrollment in the joint program; the adviser will work closely with the student to determine a plan of study, course selection (aligned with the student's research interests), and the development of research ideas. The rst two years of the program are spent in the School of Nursing, completing all requirements for the M.S.N. degree. In the second year, students will complete the Research Concentration, which provides mentored research experience and the development of a research proposal. The M.S.N. Research Concentration will fulll one half of the rst-term Research Assistantship in the Ph.D. program. Students are eligible to take Graduate School courses while enrolled at the School of Nursing, with up to three courses counting toward both degrees. Students may have the opportunity to undertake additional mentored research experiences in the summers following years one and two, including research assistantship hours. The minimum residence requirement in the program is ve years. The tuition requirement is two years in the School of Nursing, and three years in the Graduate School. Financial aid is awarded by each school according to its own criteria. While enrolled at the School of Nursing, students are eligible to compete for nancial aid available to master's students, but are not eligible for Graduate School aid. Once they have completed the M.S.N. degree and are enrolled in the Graduate School in year three, students in the joint-degree program receive a full doctoral nancial aid package, including up to three years of tuition, stipend, and a Health Award to cover the cost of Yale Health Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage. Students are expected to complete the joint-degree program within ve years. The M.S.N. and Ph.D. degrees are awarded separately, upon completion of the M.S.N. requirements (at the end of the second year of study in the M.S.N program by the School of Nursing), and upon completion of the requirements for the Ph.D. by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. To qualify for the M.S.N. and Ph.D. degrees, students must satisfy all degree requirements of both schools. Any exception to this pattern of study must be approved by the DGS and the appropriate associate dean. Master's Degree M.Phil. This degree will be granted to Ph.D. students who successfully complete two years of course work, but do not progress to the dissertation stage. To be awarded the M.Phil. degree, students need to complete all core courses, four cognates (may include independent study with faculty), and two years of Graduate Research Assistant experience, and must pass the Preliminary Examination. This degree is normally granted only to students who are withdrawing from the Ph.D. program.356 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 For information on the terminal master's degree oered by the Yale School of Nursing (Master of Science in Nursing), please visit the School's website, http:// nursing.yale.edu.

A written proposal must be submitted and signed by the student, the faculty member(s), and the program chairperson.Pharmacology 359 Lolis (SHM B345, 203.785.6233, B395, 203.737.2494, ben.turk@yale.edu) Professors Karen Anderson, Anton Bennett, Jack Cooper (Emeritus ), Priscilla Dannies (Emerita ), Barbara Ehrlich, Jonathan Ellman, James Howe (Emeritus ), Leonard Kaczmarek, Irit Lax, Mark Lemmon, Elias Lolis, Gary Rudnick, Joseph Schlessinger, William Sessa, Dianqing (Dan) Wu Associate Professors Titus Boggon, David Calderwood, Kathryn Ferguson, Ya Ha, Benjamin Turk Assistant Professors Claudio Alarc\u00f3n, Daryl Klein, Yansheng Liu, Bryce Nelson Fields of Study Major emphases in the department are in the areas of molecular pharmacology, mechanisms of drug action, signal transduction, structural biology, neuropharmacology, and chemotherapy. Special Admissions Requirements A bachelor's degree in biology, chemistry, or another science is required. Undergraduate courses should include biology, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus. GRE scores are required; a GRE Subject Test, preferably in Biology or Chemistry, is recommended. To enter the Ph.D. program, students should apply to an interest-based track within the interdepartmental graduate program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), http://bbs.yale.edu. Most students interested in a Ph.D. in Pharmacology apply through the Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology track or the Biochemistry, Quantitative Biology, Biophysics, and Structural Biology track. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Because the eld of pharmacology encompasses many disciplines, the department's flexible program of study toward the Ph.D. degree permits students to concentrate in areas of their particular interest. Students must take the core graduate pharmacology course ( PHAR 504 ) and the two terms of the graduate seminar course (PHAR 502 ) or equivalent from another department. The other courses will be selected based on each student's interest but must include at least two of three other courses: PHAR 528 , PHAR 529 , and 560 may be substituted for PHAR 550 . Students are required to do three laboratory rotations. The Graduate School requires a grade of Honors for a minimum of two courses. Honors for seminar courses or rotations cannot be used toward this requirement. Students must meet the Honors requirement prior to360 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 being admitted to candidacy. Students must also maintain an overall High Pass average. A grade of Honors or High Pass is required for PHAR 504 . Student progress toward these goals is reviewed at the end of the second term. Prior to registering for a second year of study, students must successfully complete PHAR 580 , The Responsible Conduct of Research, or the equivalent from another department. In addition, two lectures from PHAR 580 and one lecture from B&BS 503 , RCR Refresher for Senior BBS Students, must be completed by the end of the fourth year. Students are also required to pass the qualifying examination by the end of their fourth term. Before the end of the third year, a thesis prospectus must be submitted and accepted for admission to candidacy. A doctoral dissertation based upon original research includes an oral presentation given only to the pharmacology faculty (pre- defense). Within six months of passing the pre-defense, the student must submit a preliminary written thesis to the thesis committee and an outside reader. A public Ph.D. dissertation seminar will be scheduled, followed by a closed examination by the thesis committee and the outside examiner. Once the dra of the written thesis is approved by the thesis committee, it is submitted to the Graduate School. One rst-author manuscript is required from the thesis research. The Pharmacology faculty recognizes that some thesis-related work takes a longer time and may not yield anticipated results. As long as the student has made signicant progress in parallel experiments, the faculty can exempt a student from the one rst author paper requirement. An important aspect of graduate training in pharmacology is the acquisition of teaching skills through the participation in courses related to the student's scientic interests. These opportunities can be drawn from a diverse menu of lecture, laboratory, and seminar courses given at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels. Ph.D. students are required to participate in two terms (or the equivalent) of teaching. Students are not expected to teach during their rst year. M.D./Ph.D. Students M.D./Ph.D. students must satisfy all of the above requirements for the Ph.D. with the following modications: (1) only two of three laboratory rotations are required; (2) some medical school courses (except Pharmacology) can qualify as Graduate School courses as long as the M.D./Ph.D. student registers for them in OCS (Online Course Selection); and (3) only one term of teaching is required. Current Graduate School courses cannot be used to fulll any medical school course requirements. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) Students are eligible for the M.S. degree upon successful completion of the rst three terms of the Ph.D. program. This includes one year of lab rotations and course requirements. Program materials are available upon request to the Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Pharmacology, Yale University, PO Box 208066, New 680a, Seminar in Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology Don Nguyen Readings and discussion on a diverse range of current topics in molecular medicine, pharmacology, and physiology. The class emphasizes analysis of primary research literature and development of presentation and writing skills. Contemporary articles are assigned on a related topic every week, and a student leads discussions with input from faculty who are experts in the topic area. The overall goal is to cover a specic topic of medical relevance (e.g., cancer, neurodegeneration) from the perspective of three primary disciplines (i.e., physiology: normal function; pathology: abnormal function; Principles of Pharmacology Elias Lolis This course covers the molecular mechanisms of therapeutics, which are presented in a conceptual framework to increase understanding but decrease memorization. Topics include (but are not limited to) receptor anity, ecacy, multiple equilibria, pharmacokinetics, molecular of antimicrobial therapy, cardiology drugs, anticancer and antiviral therapies; and therapeutics for inflammatory disorders, asthma, and allergy. PHAR 528a, Principles of Signal Transduction Anton Bennett The regulation of intracellular signaling is of fundamental importance to the understanding of cell function and regulation. This course introduces the broad principles of intracellular signal transduction. More detailed lectures on specic intracellular signaling pathways are given in which students learn both the basic and most recent and cutting-edge concepts of intracellular signaling. Topics include regulation of signaling by protein phosphorylation, small G proteins, G-protein- coupled receptors, hormones, phospholipids, adhesion, and gasses. PHAR 529b, Structural Biology and Drug Discovery Ya Ha and Titus Boggon A comprehensive introduction to the concepts and practical uses of structural biology and structural biology-related techniques in drug discovery. The rst half of the course focuses on techniques used to discover and optimize small and macromolecule drugs. Students are introduced to topics such as small molecule lead discovery, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biophysical techniques. The rst half of the course also includes a practical component where students conduct hands-on structural biology experiments and learn about biophysical techniques in a laboratory setting. The second half of the course focuses on drug discovery, particularly for protein kinases. It includes a eld trip to the Yale Center for Drug Discovery, where the students are introduced to the in-house Yale screening facilities for small molecule drug discovery. Two half-credit courses\u2014PHAR 530 and PHAR 531\u2014are also halves of PHAR 529. PHAR 530b, Targeted Use of Structural Biology in Drug Discovery Ya Ha and Titus Boggon This 0.5-credit course, the second half of PHAR 529, begins in February. The goal of the course is to show students how concepts of structural biology are applied to areas of great importance in pharmacology such as protein kinases, proteases, cell surface receptors, integrins and other membrane-bound enzymes, and transporters and channels, and how these concepts facilitate drug development. \u00bd Course cr362 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 PHAR 531b, Concepts of Structural Pharmacology Ya Ha and Titus Boggon This 0.5-credit course, the rst half of PHAR 529, introduces students to the concepts of structural biology and provides the background for how these concepts are applied to areas of great importance in pharmacology and how they facilitate drug development. \u00bd Course cr Saltzman and Stuart Campbell The course develops a foundation in human physiology by examining the homeostasis of vital parameters within the body, and the biophysical properties of cells, tissues, and organs. Basic concepts in cell and membrane physiology are synthesized through exploring the function of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. The physical basis of blood flow, mechanisms of vascular exchange, cardiac performance, and regulation of overall circulatory function are discussed. Respiratory physiology explores the mechanics of ventilation, gas diusion, and acid-base balance. Renal physiology examines the formation and composition of urine and the regulation of electrolyte, fluid, and acid-base balance. Organs of the digestive system are discussed from the perspective of substrate metabolism and energy balance. Hormonal regulation is applied to metabolic control and to calcium, water, and electrolyte balance. The biology of nerve cells is addressed with emphasis on synaptic transmission and simple neuronal circuits within the central nervous system. The special senses are considered in the framework of sensory transduction. Weekly discussion sections provide a forum for in-depth exploration of topics. Graduate students evaluate research ndings through literature review and weekly meetings with the instructor. PHAR 560b / C&MP 560b Cellular and Molecular Physiology: Molecular Machines in Human Disease Frederick Sigworth The course focuses on understanding the processes that transfer molecules across membranes at the cellular, molecular, biophysical, and physiological levels. Students learn about the dierent classes of molecular machines that mediate membrane transport, generate electrical currents, or perform mechanical displacement. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between the molecular structures of membrane proteins and their individual functions. The interactions among transport proteins in determining the physiological behaviors of cells and tissues are also stressed. Molecular motors are introduced and their mechanical relationship to cell function is explored. Students read papers from the scientic literature that establish the connections between mutations in genes encoding membrane proteins and a wide variety of human genetic diseases.Philosophy 363 Philosophy Connecticut Hall, 203.432.1665 http://philosophy.yale.edu M.A., M.Phil., Ph.D. Della Rocca, Keith DeRose, Paul Franks, Tamar Gendler, John Hare, Verity Harte, Brad Inwood, Shelly Kagan, Joshua Knobe, Laurie Paul, Thomas Pogge, Scott Shapiro, Sun-Joo Shin, Steven Smith, Jason Stanley, Zolt\u00e1n Szab\u00f3, Kenneth Winkler, Gideon Yae Assistant Professors Robin Dembro, Daniel Greco, Elizabeth Miller, John Pittard Fields of Study The department oers a wide range of courses in various traditions of philosophy, with strengths and a well-established reputation in the history of philosophy, ethics, philosophy of law, epistemology, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion as well as other central topics.

Please see the Philosophy website for information on the program: http:// philosophy.yale.edu. Courses PHIL 567a, Mathematical Logic I Sun-Joo Shin An introduction to the metatheory of rst-order logic, up to and including the completeness theorem for the rst-order calculus. An introduction to the basic concepts of set theory is included. PHIL 602a / CPLT 699a / GMAN 603a, Heidegger's Being Martin H\u00e4gglund A systematic, chapter-by-chapter study of Heidegger's Being and Time, arguably the most important work of philosophy of the twentieth century. All the major themes of the book are addressed in detail, with a particular emphasis on care, time, death, and the meaning of being. PHIL 604b, Leibniz Michael Della Rocca A close examination of Leibniz's vast, intricate, and still poorly understood philosophical system. Topics to be explored include substance, necessity, freedom, psychology, teleology, and the problem of evil. Attention to relevant philosophical and theological antecedents, including Spinoza, Descartes, Suarez, Aquinas, and Aristotle. Attention also to Leibniz's relevance to contemporary philosophy. PHIL 626b, Cognitive Science of Morality Joshua Knobe Introduction to the emerging eld of moral cognition. Focus on questions about the philosophical signicance of psychological ndings. Topics include the role of emotion in moral judgment; the signicance of character traits in virtue ethics and personality psychology; the reliability of intuitions and the psychological processes that underlie them. PHIL 627b, Computability and Logic Sun-Joo Shin A technical exposition of G\u00f6del's rst and second incompleteness theorems and of some of their main consequences in proof theory and model theory, such as L\u00f6b's theorem, Tarski's undenability of truth, provability logic, and of arithmetic. PHIL 637b, Philosophy of Mathematics Sun-Joo Shin Metaphysical and epistemological issues raised by mathematics. Questions concerning the notion of a set; whether one can quantify over absolutely everything; whether there are really innite dierent sizes; the signicance of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems; arguments designed to show that certain mathematical terms are referentially indeterminate. PHIL 638a, Philosophy of Logic Sun-Joo Shin Exploration of valid reasoning, mainly in the context of propositional and predicate logic. Topics include the well-known debate on the justication of modus ponens; Tarski's analysis of logic consequence; and the relatively recent and provocative claim366 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 (made by Etchemendy) that Tarski's analysis of logical consequence fails in capturing ordinary and intuitive concept of logical consequence. PHIL 641b, Reductionism Elizabeth Miller An exploration of some reductive approaches in contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of science and some challenges to the reductive project. Is there a deep sense in which all the complexity of reality reduces to some more limited class of fundamental features? PHIL 643a, Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics Elizabeth Miller An examination of a wide range of philosophical issues as informed by quantum mechanics. Evaluation of dierent, and controversial, interpretations of quantum mechanics and their distinct ontologies. Subtopics include the measurement problem, nonlocality and holism, wave function realism, and the relationship between physics and metaphysics. PHIL 650a, The Problem of Evil Keith DeRose The evils of our world can seem to present strong reasons for disbelieving in the existence of God. This course examines the main forms that this problem for theism takes, and some of the proposed ways of solving, or at least mitigating, the problem. PHIL 655a, Normative Ethics Shelly Kagan A systematic examination of normative ethics, the part of moral philosophy that attempts to articulate and defend the basic principles of morality. The bulk of the course surveys and explores some of the main normative factors relevant in determining the moral status of a given act or policy (features that help make a given act right or wrong). Brief consideration of some of the main views about the foundations of normative ethics (the ultimate basis or ground for the various moral principles). PHIL 664b, Justice, Taxes, and Global Financial Integrity Thomas Pogge This seminar studies the formulation, interpretation, and enforcement of national and international tax rules from the perspective of national and global economic justice. PHIL 665a, Recent Work in Ethical Theory Stephen Darwall A study of recently published works on ethics and its foundations. Issues include the grounds of normativity and rightness, and the role of the virtues. PHIL 674a / PLSC 580a, Borders, Culture, and Citizenship Seyla Benhabib The contemporary refugee crisis in Europe and elsewhere; new patterns of migration, increasing demands for multicultural rights on the part of Muslim minorities in the West, and transnational eects of globalization faced by contemporary societies. This course examines these issues in a multidisciplinary perspective in the light of political theories of citizenship and migration, and laws concerning refugees and migrants in Europe and the United States. PHIL 677a / WGSS 677a, Feminist Philosophy: Theories of Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation Robin Dembro This course surveys several feminist frameworks for thinking about sex, gender, and sexual orientation. We consider questions such as: Is there a tenable distinction between sex and gender? Between gender and sexual orientation? What does it mean to say that gender is a social construction, or that sexual orientation is innate? What is the place of politics in gender and sexual identities? How do these identities\u2014andPhilosophy 367 especially resistant or transgressive identities\u2014impact the creation and revision of social categories? PHIL 679b, Contemporary Deontology Shelly Kagan Most people are intuitively drawn to deontological moral theories rather than consequentialist ones (roughly, to theories that give priority to moral factors other than simply the potential goodness of results). In this course we read and evaluate three major contemporary works exploring this deontological perspective in a systematic way: Judith Thomson's The Realm of Rights, T.M. Scanlon's What We Owe to Each Other, and (parts of) F.M. Kamm's Intricate Ethics. Our goal throughout is to investigate the complications involved in moving beyond the initial pull toward deontology to spelling out such a deontological theory in fuller detail (whether at the normative or at the foundational level). PHIL 685b, Wittgenstein Kenneth Winkler Study and discussion of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Philosophical Investigations, and On Certainty, with some attention to their background in writings by Frege, Russell, and Moore. Consideration of Wittgenstein's influence on more recent philosophers, among them Iris Murdoch, Elizabeth Anscombe, Saul Kripke, and Cora Diamond. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. PHIL 686a, Kant's Critique of Judgment Sta In-depth study of Kant's third and nal critique, one of the major works of modern philosophy, containing both the foundation of modern aesthetics and a critical reformulation of natural teleology. Discussions address both parts and their enigmatic unity; highlight the relation of nature and freedom, mechanism and teleology, theoretical and practical cognition at the heart of the book; and include post-Kantian thought (German Idealism, twentieth-century continental philosophy) that only became possible through Kant's third critique. Prerequisite: some familiarity with Kant's critical project. PHIL 700a, Kant's Philosophy of Religion John Hare This course looks at Kant's writings in the philosophy of religion and moral theology from the Critique of Pure Reason to the Conflict of the Faculties. PHIL 705a, First-Year Seminar Keith DeRose Required of and limited to rst-year students in the Philosophy Ph.D. program. Topic varies from year to year. Preparation for graduate work. Reading, writing, and presentation skills. PHIL 719a, Faith and the Will John Pittard An investigation of questions concerning the nature of religious faith, the relationship of faith to the will and to desire, and the merits of various prudential, moral, and existential arguments for and against religious faith. Questions to be treated include: Is faith in some sense \"meritorious\" (to use Aquinas's language)? Do the commitments of faith essentially involve believing propositions? Can belief be voluntary? Can trust or hope be voluntary? Should we hold religious beliefs to the same epistemic standards that apply to more mundane beliefs? Or should we persist in faith even if these beliefs do not meet conventional rational standards? We explore these questions through writings by Aquinas, Pascal, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, James, Freud, Wittgenstein, and various contemporary philosophers.368 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 PHIL 731b, Theological Predications and Divine Attributes John Pittard An exploration of philosophical debates concerning the nature of theological language and the nature of God. Topics include theories of analogical predication, divine simplicity, God's relation to time, divine impassibility, the nature of God's love, divine freedom, the compatibility of foreknowledge and human freedom, and theories of providence. PHIL 734a / GMAN 651a / PLSC 583a, Contemporary Critical Theory Seyla Benhabib An examination of the themes of statelessness, migration, and exile in the works of Arendt, Benjamin, Adorno, Shklar, and Berlin. PHIL 741a / CLSS 886a, What Is Aristotelian Hylomorphism? David Charles The aim of the seminar is to examine the extent to which Aristotle's version of hylomorphism as applied to psychological phenomena (such as the emotions, desire, perception, and thought) was modied and criticized by later philosophers. We assess the hypothesis that Aristotle's discussion of these issues was substantially modied by later philosophers and commentators in such a way as to set up (1) contemporary versions of hylomorphism and (2) the mind/body problem as formulated by Descartes. PHIL 746b / CLSS 887b, Cicero and Ancient Ethics: The Dialogue On Moral Ends (De nibus bonorum et malorum ) Brad Inwood Cicero's most important and influential work on moral philosophy is the dialogue On Moral Ends (De nibus bonorum et malorum ). Written within the general framework of eudaimonism, the dialogue expounds on and criticizes the ethical theory of three contemporary schools: Epicurean, Stoic, and Peripatetic. On Moral Ends presents important debates in ethics, gives us extensive evidence for Hellenistic philosophy in general, and had signicant influence on moral theory in the early modern period. We read the entire dialogue, with more emphasis on the Stoic (books 3-4) and Peripatetic (book 5) debates than on the Epicurean (books 1-2). In class we work predominantly from the translation by Raphael Woolf, but Latin readers are expected to read key parts of the dialogue in Latin as well; there will be a separate meeting for discussion of issues that arise from the Latin text. Prerequisite: graduate enrollment in Philosophy or Classics, or permission of the instructor. PHIL 748b / CLSS 865b, Plato's Theaetetus Verity Harte and David Charles The class reads and discusses the Greek text of Plato's Theaetetus, a central work of Plato's philosophy and an important work in the history of philosophy. Focused on the nature of knowledge, the dialogue is notable for a series of arguments involving central notions of Plato's philosophy: knowledge, denition, perception, false judgment. The class is a core course for the combined Ph.D. program in Classics and Philosophy. The course is open to all graduate students in Philosophy or Classics who have suitable preparation in Attic Greek and some prior knowledge of ancient philosophy. Others interested in taking or attending the class must have prior permission of the instructors. Undergraduates are not normally admitted. PHIL 750a or b, Tutorial Sta By arrangement with faculty. PHIL 755a / HIST 759a, Conservatism: Seminar Samuel Moyn, Scott Shapiro, and Ross Douthat This seminar examines conservatism's origins as a body of theory; turns to the trajectory of American conservatism since World War II, focusing on both intellectualPhilosophy 369 history and popular mobilization; and concludes with a survey of versions of conservatism prominent in contemporary legal scholarship.370 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Physics 35 Sloane Physics Laboratory, 203.432.3607 http://physics.yale.edu M.S., (Applied Physics), Yoram Alhassid, Thomas Appelquist, Charles Bailyn (Astronomy), O.

The GRE General Test and the Subject Test in Physics are required. Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (PEB) Students applying to the Ph.D. program in Physics may also apply to be part of the PEB program. See the description under Non-Degree-Granting Programs, Councils, and Research Institutes for course requirements, and http://peb.yale.edu for more information about the benets of this program and application instructions. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree To complete the course requirements, students are expected to take a set of six term courses: ve foundational courses and one elective. The ve core courses (1. PHYS 500, Advanced Classical Mechanics; 2. PHYS 508, Quantum Mechanics I; 3. PHYS 502, Electromagnetic Theory I; 4. PHYS 512, Statistical Physics I; and 5. PHYS 608, Quantum Mechanics II) serve to complete the student's undergraduate training in classical and quantum physics. For the sixth course, students select from the list of graduate elective courses oered by the Physics or Applied Physics departments, or courses oered by other departments with the approval of the DGS. In addition, all students are required to engage in a research project by taking PHYS 990, Special Investigations. In their rst year of study, students must take, at a minimum, the foundational courses one through four, along with the research seminar courses: PHYS 515, Topics in Modern Physics Research, and PHYS 590, Responsible Conduct in Research for Physical Scientists. Certain equivalent course work or successful completion of a pass-out examination may allow substitution of elective courses for individual students. Students who have completed their course requirements with satisfactory grades, passed the qualifying examination, and submitted an acceptable thesis prospectus are recommended for admission to candidacy. (A grade of Honors in PHYS 990, Special Investigations, may be counted toward the Graduate School requirement of two grades of Honors.) The qualifying examination, normally taken at the beginning of the third term (and no later than the beginning of the h term), consists of four separate, written exams on Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory, Statistical Mechanics, and Quantum Mechanics. Students normally submit the dissertation prospectus before the end of the third year of study. There is no foreign language requirement. Teaching experience is regarded as an integral part of the graduate training program. During their studies, students are expected to serve four terms as teaching fellows at the TF-10 level, usually in the rst two years. Formal association with a dissertation adviser normally begins in the fourth term, aer the qualifying examination has been passed and required course work has been completed. An adviser from a department other than Physics can be chosen in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS), provided the dissertation topic is deemed suitable for a physics Ph.D.372 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Master's Degrees M.Phil.

Finally, we employ this understanding for the design of microwave measurement systems and techniques for modulation and signal recovery, to analyze the performance of heterodyne/homodyne receivers and radiometers. for students in PEB involves hands-on laboratory modules with students working in pairs. A biology student is paired with a physics or engineering student; a computation/theory student is paired with an experimental student. The modules are devised so that a range of skills is acquired, and students learn from each other. Modules are hosted in faculty laboratories.Political Science 377 Political Science Rosenkranz Hall, 203.432.5241 http://politicalscience.yale.edu M.A., M.Phil., Ph.D. Chair Steven Wilkinson Director of Graduate Studies Milan Svolik Professors Bruce Ackerman, Akhil Amar (Law), Seyla Benhabib, Paul Bracken (Management), David Cameron, Bryan Garsten, Alan Gerber, Jacob Hacker, Gregory Huber, Isabela Mares, David Mayhew, Gerard Padr\u00f3 i Miquel, John Roemer, Frances Rosenbluth, James Scott, Ian Shapiro, Stephen Skowronek, Steven Smith, Milan Svolik, Peter Swenson, John Wargo (Forestry & Environmental Studies), Steven Wilkinson, Elisabeth Wood Associate Professors Peter Aronow, Ana De La O Deborah Beim, Sarah Bush, Daniela Cammack, Alexander Coppock, John Henderson, Daniel Mattingly, Elizabeth Nugent, Oskian, Tyler Pratt, Didac Queralt, Thania Sanchez, Fredrik S\u00e4vje, Emily Sellars Fields of Study Fields include political theory, international relations, comparative politics, American politics, political economy, quantitative empirical methods, qualitative and archival methods, and formal theory. Special Admissions Requirement The department requires that scores from the GRE General Test and a writing sample accompany an application. Additional details about the application process are available on the department website. The department only accepts applications for the Ph.D. program. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Overall program requirements Students are required to pass sixteen term courses by the end of their fourth term in the program, to receive a grade of Honors in at least two Political Science courses, and to maintain an overall High Pass or above average (for purposes of calculating this average, Honors=3, High Pass=2, Pass=1, and Fail=0). The High Pass average must also be met for graduate courses listed in the Political Science department. To remain in good standing throughout their time in the Ph.D. program, students are expected to actively participate in classes and workshops, produce high- quality written work, and demonstrate regular progress toward completion of the dissertation. The department regularly oers about sixty term courses for graduate students each year. Courses are conducted as seminars and typically have small enrollments. Four of the courses required for the degree may be in departments other378 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 than Political Science (two of these can be advanced language courses with the approval of the director of graduate studies [DGS]). Each student must demonstrate elementary reading competence in one foreign language. Such competence is usually demonstrated by taking, or having completed, two years of undergraduate course work or by examination. Alternatively, the language requirement can be satised by successfully completing two terms of formal theory or two terms of statistical methods at the graduate level (beyond the introductory course in statistical methods oered in the department). Courses are oered in ve substantive elds\u2014political theory, international relations, comparative politics, American politics, and political economy\u2014and three methods elds: quantitative empirical methods, qualitative and archival methods, and formal theory. Courses taken must include one each in at least three of the department's substantive elds. Courses cannot be counted in more than one eld. Each student must demonstrate competence in three elds (two of which must be substantive elds) before the start of the h term. Competence can be demonstrated either by passing the comprehensive examination in the eld or by course work, provided that each student takes at least two comprehensive exams. The elds of formal theory and quantitative empirical methods oer certication only through examination. For elds to be certied by course work, students are required to satisfactorily complete three courses in the eld, where courses in the eld are determined by the faculty and the DGS, including one in which a research paper is written and presented. The paper must be submitted to review by the instructor of the course for which the paper was written. The department oers exams twice a year, in late August and in early January. Students are expected to pass their comprehensive examinations by August of their second year. Each examination is based on a reading list compiled by the faculty within the eld and updated each year. Each list oers an introduction and framework for study in the eld and preparation for the examination. A committee of faculty within the eld grades the exams as Distinguished, Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory. Students who successfully complete the Ph.D. in Political Science will oen join the faculties of colleges and universities. For that reason, learning what is involved in teaching and gaining teaching experience are also essential components of graduate education. The department normally expects students to devote themselves exclusively to course work and comprehensive examinations in their rst two years in the Ph.D. program. Students in Political Science typically teach in their third and fourth years. During each year in residence, graduate students are expected to participate actively and regularly in one or more of the many research workshops run by the department. Students beyond their fourth term are required to enroll in at least one of the workshops for credit, and all workshops are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. All students are expected to present a research paper of their own at one of these workshops before the end of their fourth year. Workshop participation does not count toward the requirement of sixteen term courses. Prior to registration for the second year (1) Students must have taken and passed at least seven courses, including the required Introduction to the Study of Politics (PLSC 510 ), and maintained an overall High Pass average. At least ve of these courses must be graduate courses in Political Science. While only seven courses are required, students are normally expected to complete eight courses in the rst year to be on trackPolitical Science 379 to complete sixteen courses by the end of the second year. (2) Students are strongly encouraged to complete at least one eld certication prior to the beginning of their second year. (3) Students are strongly encouraged to attend one of the subeld weekly workshops. (Note that these workshops do not count toward the required number of completed courses.) Prior to registration for the third year (1) Students must have taken at least sixteen term courses and have received a grade of at least Pass in each of them, including the two-term required Research and Writing course (PLSC 540 , PLSC 541 ) for second- year students. Research and Writing is devoted to the preparation of a manuscript based on original research on a topic of the student's choice and will count as two of the sixteen credits needed to advance to candidacy. (2) Students must have received a grade of Honors in at least two Political Science courses and maintained an overall High Pass average. (3) Students must have completed certication in three elds by the end of their second year. (For purposes of fullling this requirement, students registered for the August exams are assumed to have passed those exams when determining eligibility for enrollment in the third year.) At the discretion of the DGS, students who fail an exam may be granted a one-term extension (to January of the third year) for obtaining certication. (4) Students are strongly encouraged to attend one of the required subeld weekly workshops. (Note that these workshops do not count toward the required number of completed courses.) Admission to candidacy Students must be admitted to candidacy prior to registration for the fourth year of study. Students are recommended to the Graduate School for admission to candidacy by the Department of Political Science aer having completed departmental requirements listed above and the Graduate School's prospectus requirement. As part of admission to candidacy, a student must have a prospectus approved by a dissertation director and two other members of the faculty. This must occur no later than May 1 of the student's third year of study. Submitting the dissertation A student's dissertation research is guided by a committee of no fewer than three faculty members, at least two of whom must be members of the Yale Department of Political Science. One of the committee members is designated as chair. When a dissertation is completed, the student will select two members to write written reports on the nal dissertation, at least one of whom must be a member of the Yale Department of Political Science. The DGS will also appoint one additional member of the department to write an additional evaluation. Combined Degrees The Graduate School oers a combined degree in Political Science and African American Studies. For details, see African American Studies in this bulletin. Students may also pursue a joint degree with the Law School. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The academic requirements for the M.Phil. degree are the same as for the Ph.D. degree except for the completion of the prospectus and dissertation. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) The M.A. degree is awarded upon completion of a full year of course work in the program (i.e., at least eight term courses) with an average of High Pass or better. The courses must include at least six listed in the Political380 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Science department and one each in at least three of the department's substantive elds. Language requirements are the same as for the Ph.D. degree. Courses Empirical Analysis and Research Methodology PLSC 503b, Quantitative Methods II: Foundations of Statistical Inference Didac Queralt An intensive introduction to statistical theory for quantitative social inquiry. Topics include foundations of probability theory, statistical inference from random samples, estimation theory, linear regression, maximum likelihood estimation, and nonparametric identication. PLSC 504a, Advanced Quantitative Methods Fredrik S\u00e4vje The aim of this course is to provide students with the understanding and tools to critically consume and conduct statistical research. The theme is the challenge of drawing reliable causal inference. We will learn: how to use graphical methods to transparently analyze and present data; how to discipline our analyses against multiple-comparisons bias; how to use nonparametric methods to avoid implausible assumptions; how strong research design is essential to causal inference; how Bayesian inference provides the mathematical vocabulary for thinking about scientic inference; how causal graphs allow us to express and analyze causal assumptions, choose control variables, and think about selection bias; how placebo tests allow us to test assumptions; how to build and understand Likelihood and Bayesian models including Logistic and Probit models; how to think about and analyze time-series cross-sectional data. We will review instrumental variables methods and regression-discontinuity designs, though it is assumed that you have already covered these in PLSC 503. The course assumes students have command of the material covered in PLSC 500 and PLSC 503, including basic probability theory, matrix algebra, and the linear regression model. PLSC 505b / SOCY 508b, Qualitative Field Research Daniel Mattingly In this seminar we discuss and practice qualitative eld research methods. The course covers the basic techniques for collecting, interpreting, and analyzing ethnographic data, with an emphasis on the core ethnographic techniques of participant observation and in-depth interviewing. All participants carry out a local research project. Open to undergraduates with permission of the instructor. PLSC 510a, Introduction to the Study of Politics Sta The course introduces students to some of the major controversies in political science. We focus on the ve substantive themes that make up the Yale Initiative: Order, Conflict, and Violence; Representation and Popular Rule; Craing and Operating Institutions; Identities, Aliations, and Allegiances; and Distributive Politics. We divide our time between discussing readings on these subjects and conversations with dierent members of the faculty who specialize in them. There is also some attention to methodological controversies within the discipline. Requirements: an annotated bibliography of one of the substantive themes and a take-home nal exam. PLSC 518b, Introduction to Game Theory Alexandre Debs This course oers a rigorous introduction to noncooperative game theory. The goal is to help students understand the key concepts and ideas in game theory and to provide students with a road map for applying game theoretic tools to their own research.Political Science 381 Topics include strategic form games, extensive form games, and Bayesian games, among others. Students are assumed to have mathematical knowledge at the level of the Political Science Math Camp. PLSC 519b, Formal Models of Comparative Politics Milan Svolik This course surveys key applications of game theory and related methods to the study of politics and political economy. Topics include electoral competition, political accountability, social choice, collective action, democratization, and war. Prerequisite: PLSC 518, or an introductory course in game theory. PLSC 520b, Game Theory and Political Science Sta Introduction to game theory\u2014a method by which strategic interactions among individuals and groups in society are mathematically modeled\u2014and its applications to political science. Concepts employed by game theorists, such as Nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Problems of cooperation, time-consistency, signaling, and reputation formation. Political applications include candidate competition, policy making, political bargaining, and international conflict. PLSC 529a, Mathematics for Political Science Sta This course builds on the material seen in math camp. It covers foundational concepts and techniques in mathematics that are relevant to quantitative and formal research. Students learn to read and write rigorous mathematical proofs. Topics include real analysis, optimization, and probability theory. PLSC 530a or b / S&DS 530a or b, Data Exploration and Analysis Sta Survey of statistical methods: plots, transformations, regression, analysis of variance, clustering, principal components, contingency tables, and time series analysis. The R computing language and Web data sources are used. PLSC 540a, Research and Writing Sta This is a required course for all second-year students. It meets for the rst six weeks of the fall term and the rst six weeks of the spring term. The fall meetings are devoted to discussion of research design as well as individual student projects. The spring meetings are devoted to discussion of dras of student papers. The work of the spring- term seminar includes criticism of the organization, arguments, data evaluation, and writing in each student's paper by the instructors and the other students. Using this criticism, and under the supervision of the instructors, each student conducts additional research, if necessary, rewrites the paper as required, and prepares a nal paper representing the best work of which the student is capable. Students must submit a one-page outline of the proposed project for the rst fall-term meeting and a complete dra of the paper at the rst meeting in the spring. Political Theory PLSC 534a, Theories of Distributive Justice: Formal Models of Political Theory John Roemer We survey the main theories of distributive justice proposed by political philosophers since John Rawls, including A. Sen, R. Dworkin, G.A. Cohen, and R. Arneson. We use economic models to study these theories, and we critique them from the economic and philosophical viewpoints. We then read Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the Twenty- First Century. If time permits, we introduce a microeconomic theory modeling how382 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 people cooperate in economic settings, to be contrasted with Nash equilibrium, a model of how people compete. Prerequisite: microeconomics, at least at the intermediate level, or permission of the instructor. PLSC 565a, Democracy and Distribution Ian Shapiro The attention showered in 2015 on Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the Twenty-First Century brought issues of inequality in the distribution of income and wealth to the forefront of public and scholarly attention. An enormous body of research has been produced over the past two decades to understand the nature of the dramatic rise in inequality, especially in the United States, and its causes. A long list of proposals for legal change has emerged in response to the outpouring of data and analysis. This course explores the facts and the causes of and political barriers to potential responses to these recent developments, principally but not exclusively in the United States. Ultimately, the question requires an examination of the relations between democracy and the distribution of income and wealth. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which dierent groups, classes, and coalitions aect, and are aected by, democratic distributive politics. Attention is paid to theories of distribution, politics of distribution, distributive instruments, and the implementation of policies aecting distribution. Substantive topics covered include regulation, protectionism, taxes, social insurance, welfare, public opinion, education, and unions. Follows Law School academic calendar. PLSC 576a, Ancient Greek Political Development Daniela Cammack This course explores the varieties of political experience in the ancient Greek world in the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. Attention is given to dierent regime types (monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy), places (Athens, Sparta, Crete, Carthage, Syracuse, Persia), political forms (city-state, alliance, empire), institutions (assembly, council, courts, oces), and persons (political leader, citizen, woman, foreign resident, slave). PLSC 580a / PHIL 674a, Borders, Culture, and Citizenship Seyla Benhabib The contemporary refugee crisis in Europe and elsewhere; new patterns of migration, increasing demands for multicultural rights on the part of Muslim minorities in the West, and transnational eects of globalization faced by contemporary societies. This course examines these issues in a multidisciplinary perspective in the light of political theories of citizenship and migration, and laws concerning refugees and migrants in Europe and the United States. PLSC 583a / GMAN 651a / PHIL 734a, Contemporary Critical Theory Seyla Benhabib An examination of the themes of statelessness, migration, and exile in the works of Arendt, Benjamin, Adorno, Shklar, and Berlin. PLSC 597a, Lincoln's Statecra and Rhetoric Steven Smith This class is based on a reading and interpretation of Lincoln's major speeches and letters. Its purpose is to understand his views on the problem of slavery, equality, and race in American society, but also to consider the relation of words to deeds in the practice of his statecra. We also situate Lincoln within the history and theory of statesmanship. PLSC 602b, Political Epistemology: On Knowledge and Belief in Politics H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore We arguably live in the age of \"alternative facts\" and \"post-truths\"\u2014or, as philosopher Harry Frankfurt presciently theorized it, \"bullshit.\" By contrast, this course aimsPolitical Science 383 to explore the new and burgeoning eld of \"political epistemology,\" for which the concepts of knowledge and even truth\u2014both factual and moral\u2014are central to politics. Political epistemology can be described as a branch of philosophy inquiring into how to acquire knowledge and into what we ought to believe in the political realm. It deals with the ways societies generate, process, and diuse knowledge and beliefs. Typical questions in political epistemology relate to whether we can know anything in politics and to the epistemic status of political beliefs in general. Between the Charybdis of moral relativism and the Scylla of authoritarian dogmatism, is there any room for something like \"political truths\"? How would we best attain them and how would we know that we have? Political epistemologists are also concerned with the question of \"peer-disagreement\" and the proper epistemic stance to hold with respect to peers, typically other citizens, with whom we disagree. In this course we thus seek to understand better the ways in which political institutions and procedures (somewhat broadly construed, such as national assemblies, electoral rules, parties, the media, courts, etc., but including also social norms) generate and process knowledge. We also study the ways in which certain social, economic, and political arrangements may generate what has been diagnosed as \"epistemic injustice\" and how this specic type of injustice may be redressed and should be dealt with by both political theorists and political actors. PLSC 629a / HIST 656a, Histories of Political Thought Isaac Nakhimovsky The intersection between political theory and intellectual history, examined from a historiographical rather than an exclusively methodological perspective. The course aims to develop a comparative framework for discussing the kinds of preoccupations and commitments that have animated various important contributions to the history of political thought since the nineteenth century. PLSC 630b, Philosophy of Science for the Study of Politics H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore An examination of the philosophy of science from the perspective of the study of politics. Particular attention to the ways in which assumptions about science influence models of political behavior, the methods adopted to study that behavior, and the relations between science and democracy. Readings include works by both classic and contemporary authors. PLSC 640b, Advanced Topics in Modern Political Philosophy Steven Smith and Giulia Oskian This seminar is designed to survey modern political philosophy at a level appropriate for graduate students (to help them prepare for the eld exam) and for advanced undergraduates who have completed substantial course work in intellectual history and/or political theory. This term, the seminar addresses the topic of democracy and inequality from Rousseau to Marx. We pursue the politics of classical political economy by tracing discussions of the identity of the modern representative republic, the nature of capitalism or commercial society, and the relation between the two from Rousseau to Marx. While the main focus is close analysis of the writings of Rousseau, Smith, and Marx, we also mark the trajectory from Smith to Marx via readings from Kant, Hegel, Condorcet, Malthus, Ricardo, and Proudhon.384 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 International Relations PLSC 656a / GLBL 579a, Global Governance Yuriy Sergeyev Examination of global policy problems, the acceleration of interdependence, and the role, potential, and limits of the institutions of global governance to articulate collective interests and to work out cooperative problem-solving arrangements. Consideration of gaps in global governance and controversies between globalization and state sovereignty, universality, and tradition. PLSC 695a / GLBL 905a, International Security Nuno Monteiro This course covers the main theories and problems in international security. Aer analyzing the main theoretical traditions devoted to understanding international security and world order, we discuss a variety of topics such as: the causes of war; the role of nuclear weapons and the problems with their proliferation; coercion, signaling, and crisis bargaining; military eectiveness; and U.S. grand strategy. Students acquire broad familiarity with the canonical literature in these elds, understand how to apply scholarship to analyze contemporary international security problems, and learn to identify opportunities for new research. The course is designed for master's and Ph.D. students who plan to pursue either policy or scholarly work in international security. Seminar sessions may feature outside guest scholars. Besides the weekly seminar sessions, students are strongly encouraged to attend weekly reading group sessions in which we dissect recent scholarship on the same topics for which we have read the canonical works. PLSC 698a, International Political Economy Didac Queralt This course examines how domestic and international politics influence the economic relations between states. It addresses the major theoretical debates in the eld and introduces the chief methodological approaches used in contemporary analyses. We focus attention on four types of cross-border flows and the policies and international institutions that regulate them: the flow of goods (trade policy), the flow of capital (nancial and exchange rate policy), the flow and location of production (foreign investment policy), and the flow of people (immigration policy). Comparative Politics PLSC 709b, Comparative Constitutional Law Sta An eort to dene the key concepts adequate for an evaluation of the worldwide development of modern constitutionalism since the Second World War.

Special Admissions Requirement The department requires that scores from the GRE General Test accompany an application. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree In order to allow students to be trained in accordance with their own interests and career goals, the general requirements of the department are kept to a minimum. The formal requirements are: (1) Course work selected to meet the individual's objectives with a minimum of three basic-level courses and one course in data analysis. Two of the three required basic-level courses must be in two dierent areas of psychology outside the student's main area of concentration. The basic-level course requirement must be completed by the end of the second year. Students must attain an Honors grade in at least two term courses by the end of the second year of study. (2) Students are required to assist in teaching four courses by the end of their fourth year. (3) CompletionPsychology 391 of a First-Year Research Paper due by May 10 of the second term. (4) Completion of a predissertation research project, to be initiated not later than the second term and completed not later than May 1 of the second year. Certication of this research project as well as performance in course work and other evidence of scholarly work at a level commensurate with doctoral study, as judged by the faculty, are necessary for continuation beyond the second year. (5) Submission of a dissertation prospectus, and a theme essay that demonstrates the candidate's comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the area of concentration. Certication of the theme essay completes the qualifying examination. (6) Approval of the dissertation by an advisory committee and the passing of an oral examination on the dissertation and its general scientic implications. The theme essay and the dissertation prospectus are completed during the third year. Students are then formally admitted to Ph.D. candidacy. There are no language requirements. The faculty considers teaching to be an essential element of the professional preparation of graduate students in Psychology. For this reason participation in the Teaching Fellow Program is a degree requirement for all doctoral students. They are expected to serve as teaching fellows (level 20) for four terms over the course of the second through fourth years in the program. Opportunities for teaching are matched as closely as possible with students' academic interests. Clinical Graduate Student Internships Registered students undertaking their required clinical internships (usually in their sixth year) are typically not eligible for Graduate School stipend funding, since these are paid internships. Students will be considered to have fullled the nal requirement for the degree aer successfully completing their internship (typically in July) and will be awarded degrees the following December. They will not be registered in the Graduate School during the fall term in which their degrees are conferred. Combined Ph.D. Programs Psychology oers a combined Ph.D. degree program with African American Studies. For the combined program with African American Studies, students must apply to the African American Studies department, with Psychology indicated as the secondary department. Psychology also oers a combined Ph.D. degree program with Philosophy. Students interested in this combined degree can apply to the Philosophy department or the Psychology department. However, if a student applies to the Philosophy department for the combined degree program, that student should also contact one or more Psychology faculty members with compatible interests so that a suitable advisor in Psychology can be identied prior to an admissions decision. Questions about the combined degree programs may be directed to the Directors of Graduate Studies in the participating departments prior to application. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The academic requirements for the M.Phil. degree are the same as for the Ph.D. degree except for the submission of a prospectus, and the completion and defense of a dissertation, which dene the Ph.D.392 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 M.S. (en route to the Ph.D.) The M.S. degree is awarded upon satisfactory completion of a rst-year research project, a predissertation research project, and a minimum of eight courses. Program materials are available online at http://psychology.yale.edu. Courses PSYC 508b, Intergroup Relations: The Psychology of Social Inequality Jennifer Richeson This course provides a survey of core concepts in social psychology through the lens of societal intergroup relations. Specically, the perception, cognition, and motivations that give rise to the formation, maintenance, and even acknowledgment of societal inequality are examined. We also examine the eects of societal inequality on perception, cognition, motivation, and health (individual outcomes), as well as how inequality may shape close relationships and even broader sets of interactions between and within societal groups. Prerequisites: PSYC 110 or equivalent; PSYC Jara-Ettinger Analysis of tabular data arrays arising usually from experiments. Sums of squares, F-tests, and variance components. The method of contrasts. Data transformations. \"Nesting,\" \"crossings,\" and Latin square designs. The analysis of covariance. Aspects of Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis such as box plots and median polish. Introduction to computer program packages. How to think about statistics. PSYC 530a / INP 530a, Foundations of Neuroscience: Biological Bases of Human Behavior Steve Wohn Chang The purpose of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the biological factors underlying human cognition and behavior. Particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms associated with individual dierences in healthy functions (including emotion regulation, stress sensitivity, higher cognition, reward sensitivity, impulsivity, and social functions) and their relations with psychiatric and neurological disorders. Biological factors to be covered include genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, neurochemical, hormonal, and neuropsychological influences. Several of the initial sessions are devoted to basic topics (e.g., neurons, neuronal signaling, brain systems), before we begin our discussion of the neural basis of behavior and cognition. We also cover seminal work on animal models for mechanistic insights into the neurobiology of human behavior. Graduate students with any neuroscience research interest are encouraged to take this course. Required of Psychology Ph.D. students in the neuroscience area. PSYC 534a, Developmental Psychopathology Fred Volkmar, Eli Lebowitz, and Denis Sukhodolsky This course, designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students, provides an overview of developmental psychopathology during childhood and adolescence. It is team-taught by a child psychiatrist and psychologist and covers aspects of normal development, assessment methods, clinical disorders, treatment, and legal and social policy issues. We begin with a review of normative development and then a discussion of theoretical approaches to understanding developmental aspects of common mental health conditions in childhood. Relevant issues of culture and ethnicity in expression of psychopathology in childhood are also reviewed.Psychology 393 PSYC 539a, Advanced Psychopathology Jutta Joormann The aim of this course is to have students master information on theory and assessment for major forms of psychopathology using cognitive-behavioral approaches. The focus is on learning how behavior can be conceptualized in cognitive-behavioral terms and to review recent models and empirical ndings regarding clinical disorders. Students play an active role in this process by participating in class discussions and making presentations on etiological models and empirical ndings for various clinical problems. PSYC 541b, Research Methods in Psychology Tyrone Cannon Research design, methodology, and evaluation considered in the context of clinical research. Emphasis on experimental and quasi-experimental designs, threats to validation, confounding, sources of artifact and bias, alternative assessment strategies, and data evaluation methods. PSYC 553a / MGMT and Nathan Novemsky The seminar examines research on the psychology of decision-making, focusing on judgment. Although the normative issue of how decisions should be made is relevant, the descriptive issue of how decisions are made is the main focus of the course. Topics of discussion include judgment heuristics and biases, condence and calibration, issues of well-being including predictions and experiences, regret and counterfactuals. The goal of the seminar is threefold: to foster a critical appreciation of existing knowledge in behavioral decision theory, to develop the students' skills in identifying and testing interesting research ideas, and to explore research opportunities for adding to that knowledge. Students generally enroll from a variety of disciplines including cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, nance, marketing, political science, medicine, and public health. PSYC 558b / INP 558b, Computational Methods in Human Neuroscience Nicholas Turk-Browne This course provides training on how to use computational science for the advanced analysis of brain imaging data, primarily from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Prerequisite: some prior experience with programming, data preprocessing, and basic fMRI analysis. PSYC 601b / HPM 601, The Science of Science Communication Dan Kahan The simple dissemination of valid scientic knowledge does not guarantee it will be recognized by non-experts to whom it is of consequence. The science of science communication is an emerging, multidisciplinary eld that investigates the processes that enable ordinary citizens to form beliefs consistent with the best available scientic evidence, the conditions that impede the formation of such beliefs, and the strategies that can be employed to avoid or ameliorate such conditions. This course surveys, and makes a modest attempt to systematize, the growing body of work in this area. Special attention is paid to identifying the distinctive communication dynamics of the diverse contexts in which non-experts engage scientic information, including electoral politics, governmental policy making, and personal health decision making.394 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 PSYC 604b, Cognition and Emotion Matthias Siemer The course presents an overview of current research questions and results in the area of cognition and emotion. We explore basic research questions as well as implications of cognitive approaches toward emotions for domains such as emotional disorders and psychological resilience and well-being. PSYC 605a, Social Emotions Margaret Clark The nature and function of emotions in social context. How emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, and anger shape how we relate to others; how the ways in which we relate to others shape our experience and expression of these emotions. The nature and functions of additional emotions that seem to arise only within the context of social relationships: feelings of hurt, guilt, gratitude, empathic joy, and empathic sadness. PSYC 616b, The Psychology of Group Life Yarrow Dunham Study of social categorization, the psychological tendency to partition individuals into groups, with attention to cognitive, developmental, social, and evolutionary approaches. The nature and development of social categorization, including its evolutionary advantages and its relation to the phenomenon of categorization more broadly. Ways in which social categorization influences prejudice and discriminatory behavior; methods for reducing such negative eects. PSYC 617b, Etiology and Treatment of Addiction Arielle Baskin-Sommers What is considered a drug? Why do some individuals use substances, but others become addicted? Are there eective treatments for addiction? Why and how does society attempt to control substance use and distribution? Exploring questions such as these is a central concern in this interdisciplinary seminar, which highlights research from cognitive neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and public health perspectives. The focus is on examining social, neurobiological, and genetic explanations for addiction, evaluating addiction treatments, and discussing the social construction of substance policies. Students are asked to think critically about material and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. To foster critical thinking skills, students have ample opportunities to discuss topics in class, analyze arguments in reading assignments, and apply ideas to real-world situations through projects and presentations. Readings consist primarily of journal articles. PSYC 621a, Cognitive Science of Pleasure Paul Bloom The appeal of ction and the imagination. We explore the mysterious appeal of narratives, fantasies, daydreams, nightmares, and other imaginary pursuits. Our approach is eclectic, drawing on elds such as literary criticism, lm studies, behavioral economics, evolutionary theory, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and analytic philosophy. PSYC 625b, Social Perception Brian Scholl When exploring the structure of the mind, we typically think of visual perception as among the earliest and most basic of our cognitive processes, while we think of social cognition as among the most advanced forms of higher-level cognition. In this seminar we explore how these two aspects of the mind connect. Specic topics include the perception of animacy, agency, and goal-directedness; biological motion; face perception (including the perception of facial attractiveness); gaze processing and socialPsychology 395 attention; thin-slicing and perceptual stereotypes; and social and cultural influences on perception. PSYC 628a, Neuroscience of Decision-Making Molly Crockett An overview and examination of the neuroscience of decision-making. Interdisciplinary course highlighting research from cognitive neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, nance, marketing, computer science, and public health. Topics include utility and value, reinforcement learning, risky decision-making, impulsivity and self control, social decision-making, psychopathology, and commercial applications (e.g., neuromarketing and neuronance). PSYC 637b, Minds, Brains, and Machines Julian Jara-Ettinger Exploration of the implications that the brain is a kind of computer that gives rise to the mind. Readings combine classical and cutting-edge research in psychology, philosophy, and articial intelligence. PSYC 643b, Psychological Measurement of Individual Dierences in Cognitive Functioning, Achievement, and Perso Mary O'Brien This course focuses on theoretical, methodological, and practical issues in psychological assessment. The processes that underlie evidence-based assessment are explored: how constructs are conceptualized and operationalized, how measures are developed and evaluated, how assessment tools are selected to answer specic questions, how ndings are analyzed and synthesized, and how psychological reports are written to meet the expectations of professional and layperson audiences. Over the course of the term, students gain experience with administering, scoring, and interpreting a variety of commonly used assessment instruments (such as the WAIS-IV, WMS- IV, and MMPI-2). The importance of critical evaluation of the assessment process is emphasized throughout. PSYC 647b, Social Science and Institutional Design: The Empirical Evaluation of Legal Policies and Practices Tom Tyler The current legal system bases many of its policies and practices upon assumptions concerning human nature. What does research tell us about how those policies and practices actually operate? What alternative social science models are available and how would institutions be dierent if those models were used? This class considers deterrence models and compares them to models emphasizing legitimacy, morality, and social norms. Policing, the courts, and corrections are examined and evaluated against available empirical evidence. The class also considers alternative models of institutional design and evidence of their potential or actual eectiveness. PSYC 656b, Developmental Psychopathology and Sensitive Periods of Neural Development BJ Casey More than one in ve children suer from serious forms of psychopathology that emerge at dierent developmental times. These dierent time courses in the emergence of symptoms suggest sensitive periods of neural development for understanding etiological factors and when and how to intervene. This course provides an overview of brain circuitry implicated in psychiatric illnesses from a neurodevelopmental perspective. Evidence from preclinical nonhuman and human imaging empirical studies is evaluated and discussed in terms of its clinical implications. We examine how understanding the biological state of the developing brain may help to optimize and target treatments more eectively for these disorders.396 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 PSYC 671a, The Cognitive Science of Mind Reading Laurie Santos Examination of theory of mind from a developmental, comparative, and neural perspective. Topics include whether dierent representational systems underlie theory of mind capacities, how infants come to represent others' mental states, whether nonhuman animals share humanlike theory of mind capacities, and how phenomena like conformity and metacognition can be reconciled with developmental and neural ndings in the domain of mind reading. PSYC 684a or b, Introduction to Psychotherapy: Technique Mary O'Brien The focus of the seminar is on formulating and conceptualizing psychological problems from a cognitive-behavioral perspective. Special consideration is paid to individual and cultural diversity in conceptualizing cases and planning treatment. Also discussed are ways in which cognitive-behavioral perspectives can be integrated with other theoretical orientations (e.g., interpersonal theory, experiential therapy).

PSYC 755a or b, Research Topics in Intergroup Relations Jennifer Richeson Students in this laboratory course are introduced to and participate in social- psychological research examining interactions and broader relations between members of socioculturally advantaged and disadvantaged groups. For instance, we examine the phenomena and processes associated with one's beliefs about members of social groups (stereotypes), attitudes and evaluative responses toward group members (prejudice), and behaviors toward members of a social group based on their group membership (discrimination). We also study how these issues shape the experiences of social group members, especially when they are members of low-status and/or minority groups. We primarily focus on large societal groups that dier on cultural dimensions of identity, with a focus on race, ethnicity, and gender. Notably, we apply the theoretical and empirical work to current events and relevant policy issues.

Suggested courses are: PLSC 800 , Introduction to American Politics; PLSC Preferences and American Political PLSC 803 , American Politics III: Institutions. HPM students take qualifying exams in each of three areas: (1) health policy and management; (2) empirical analysis and/or statistics; and (3) the student's disciplinary concentration. Typically these are taken in the summer aer two years of course work. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree At the end of years one and two, advisers will be asked to complete a progress report for each student evaluating the student's academic progress and describing the student's readiness for teaching and/or conducting research. This is then discussed with the student and reviewed by the DGS. Students who have not progressed adequately will be asked to meet with the DGS to address the situation. The qualifying exam is typically taken by the end of the second full academic year. With the assistance of the faculty adviser, generally aer qualifying exams, each student requests appropriate faculty members to join a dissertation advisory committee (DAC). The DAC reviews and approves the prospectus as developed by the student and submits it to the DGS and the Graduate Studies Executive Committee for approval. The dissertation prospectus must be approved by the end of the third year. To be admitted to candidacy, students must: (1) satisfactorily complete the course requirements for their department as outlined above, achieve grades of Honors in at least two full-term courses, and achieve an overall High Pass average; (2) obtain an average grade of High Pass on the qualifying exam; and (3) have the dissertation prospectus approved by the Graduate Studies Executive Committee. Students who have been admitted to candidacy are required by the Graduate School to complete an annual Dissertation Progress Report. Each DAC is expected to meet as a group at least twice each year, and more frequently if necessary. The student schedules meetings of the DAC. The chair/adviser of the DAC produces a summary evaluation of progress and plans for the next six months. This document is to be distributed to each committee member for comments, and the student and the DGS are to receive a copy of the nal document. The DAC reviews the progress of the dissertation research and decides when the dissertation is ready to be submitted to the readers. This decision is based on a closed defense of the dissertation, which involves a formal oral presentation to the DAC and other invited faculty. Upon completion of the closed defense, the chair/adviser of the DAC submits the recommendation to the DGS along with the names of three appropriate readers.Public Health 409 Doctoral dissertations originating in Public Health must also be presented in a public seminar. This presentation is scheduled aer the submission of the dissertation to the readers and preferably prior to the receipt and consideration of the readers' reports. At least one member of the DAC supervising the dissertation and at least one member of the Graduate Studies Executive Committee are required to attend the presentation. Master's Degrees M.Phil. (en route to the Ph.D.) The M.Phil. is awarded to students who have advanced to candidacy. When students advance to candidacy, the registrar's oce automatically submits a petition for the awarding of the M.Phil. degree. Terminal Master's Degree Program The School oers a terminal master's degree program leading to an M.S. in Public Health in three specialty areas: Biostatistics (a two-year program), Health Informatics (a two-year program), and Chronic Disease Epidemiology (a one-year program).

In addition, students must complete three electives. Suggested electives are: BIS 540 , Fundamentals of Clinical Trials; BIS 561 , Advanced Topics and Case Studies in BIS 621 , Regression Models; Theory of Survival BIS 645 Statistical Methods in Human Genetics; CDE 520 , Case-Based Learning for Genetic Heart Disease and Stroke; CDE 545 , Health Disparities by Race and Social Class: Application to Chronic Disease Epidemiology; CDE 551 , Obesity Prevention and Lifestyle Interventions; CDE , Genetic Concepts in Public Health; , Directed Readings (one term); CDE 650 Medicine and SBS , Aging. *In the capstone course CDE 617 , the student is required to develop a grant application that is deemed reasonably competitive by the instructor. An alternative to this capstone course is an individualized tutorial (CDE 600 ) in which the student completes a manuscript that is suitable for submission for publication in a relevant journal. M.D./Ph.D. Program Requirements for Public Health All M.D./Ph.D. students must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) in Public Health if they are considering aliating with Public Health. Students in this program are expected to meet the guidelines listed below in the timeframe outlined. The DGS must approve any variations to these requirements. Teaching One term of teaching is required. If students teach beyond this requirement, they can be compensated. If a student has served as a teaching fellow elsewhere on campus, this experience may be counted toward the requirement. DGS approval is required to waive the teaching requirement on the basis of previous Yale teaching experience. Rotations/Internships Students should do two rotations/internships with potential advisers in Public Health. The purpose of these rotations/internships is to learn lab technique and/or to allow the student time to determine if the PI's research interests are compatible with the student's research interests. These rotations/internships are usually done during the summer between the rst and second years of medical school course work. In some cases, students may need to defer this requirement until the summer aer the secondPublic Health 413 year aer taking certain courses and/or completing readings in order to possess the background necessary for a successful rotation/internship. Required Course Work M.D./Ph.D. students are generally expected to take the same courses as traditional Ph.D. students. Departmental requirements may vary; therefore students should confer with the DGS and their Ph.D. adviser. Timeline for Qualifying Exam Students generally will take medical school courses in years one and two. Students can take Public Health doctoral courses in years one and two before they aliate if scheduling allows. Once aliated with the Public Health program, students will complete all course requirements for the department. This generally takes a minimum of two terms but can take up to four terms aer aliating with Public Health. The qualifying exam is commonly completed aer the fourth term of aliation with the Ph.D. program in Public Health but can sometimes be done earlier with approval of the Ph.D. adviser and DGS. Prospectus Timeline Following completion of the qualifying exam, students should focus on the prospectus, which has to be approved by the Public Health Graduate Studies Executive Committee (GSEC) before the end of their sixth term as an aliated Ph.D. student in Public Health. Admission to Candidacy To be admitted to candidacy, students must: (1) satisfactorily complete the course requirements for their department as outlined above, achieve grades of Honors in at least two full-term courses, and achieve an overall High Pass average; (2) obtain an average grade of High Pass on the qualifying exam; and (3) have the dissertation prospectus approved by the Graduate Studies Executive Committee. All Ph.D. students must be admitted to candidacy before the start of their fourth year in the Ph.D. program (i.e., before the start of the seventh term).

Special Admissions Requirements The department requires the scores of the GRE General Test; previous study in areas relevant to the chosen eld of study, including ancient languages where applicable; and a writing sample of 20-30 pages, which will be evaluated for both content and style. Prospective students must apply in one of the ten elds of study, and when requesting information they should specify their particular eld of interest. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students are required to take twelve term courses that meet the Graduate School Honors requirement, including RLST 510, Method and Theory, normally taken in a student's rst year. Prociency in two modern scholarly languages, normally French416 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 and German, must be shown, one before the end of the rst year, the other before the beginning of the third; this may be done by passing an examination administered by the department, by accreditation from a Yale Summer School course designed for this purpose, or by a grade of A or B in one of Yale 's intermediate language courses. Mastery of the languages needed in one 's chosen eld (e.g., Chinese, Hebrew, Greek, Japanese) is also required in certain elds of study. A set of four qualifying examinations is designed for each student, following guidelines and criteria set by each eld of study; these are normally completed in the third year. The dissertation prospectus must be approved by a colloquium, and the completed dissertation by a committee of readers and the departmental faculty. Upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus, students are admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. This is expected before the seventh term in American Religious History, Philosophy of Religion, Religion and Modernity, Religious Ethics, and Theology; before the eighth term in other elds. Students begin writing their dissertation in the fourth year and normally will have nished by the end of the sixth. There is no oral examination on the dissertation. In the Department of Religious Studies, the faculty considers learning to teach to be an important and integral component of the professional training of its graduate students. Students are therefore required to teach as teaching fellows for at least two years during their graduate programs. Such teaching normally takes place during their third and fourth years, unless other arrangements are approved by the director of graduate studies. A combined Ph.D. degree is available with African American Studies. Consult department for details.

RLST 703a / AMST 719a, Interrogating the Grewal In ocial and unocial discourses in the United States, diagnoses of Islam's various \"crises\" are ubiquitous, and Muslim \"hearts and minds\" are viewed as the \"other\" front in the War on Terror. Since 9/11, the U.S. State Department has made the reform of Islam an explicit national interest, pouring billions of dollars into USAID projects in Muslim-majority countries, initiating curriculum development programs for madrasas in South Asia, and establishing the Arabic Radio Sawa and the satellite TV station Al- Hurra to propagate the U.S. administration's political views as well as what it terms a \"liberal\" strain of Islam. Muslim Americans are also consumed by debates about the \"crisis\" of Islam, a crisis of religious authority in which the nature and rapidity of change in the measures of authority are felt to be too dicult to assimilate. This course maps out the various and deeply politically charged contemporary debates about the \"crisis of Islam\" and the question of Islamic reform through an examination of ocial U.S. policy, transnational pulp Islamic literature, fatwas and essays authored by internationally renowned Muslim jurists and scholars, and historical and ethnographic works that take up the category of crisis as an interpretive device. RLST 705b / AMST 705b / in American Society, 1600-2018 Tisa Wenger This seminar explores intersections of religion and society in American history from the colonial period to the present as well as methodological problems important to their study. It is designed to give graduate students a working knowledge of the eld, ranging from major recent studies to bibliographical tools. In short, the seminar is a broad readings course surveying religion in American history from colonization to the present. It is not a specialized research seminar, but it does require a basic understanding of historiography. RLST 715a, The Theology and Philosophy of Fakhr al-Din Griel Recent research has shown that Fakhr al-Din al-Razi was the most influential Muslim theologian in the so-called postclassical period in Islam aer 1100. In his works, Islamic theology and philosophy reached a mature state that brings together several intellectual traditions, among them that of classical Ash'arism, of Aristotelian philosophy (falsafa ), of al-Ghazali's critique of falsafa, and Susm. The kind of synthesis that Fakhr al-Din al-Razi created dominated the education of Sunni theologians up to the mid-eighteenth century, when the confrontation with modernity created new priorities. This seminar takes a close look at this understudied thinker. The goal is to understand the most widespread kind of Islamic theology of the centuries between 1200 and 1750, a time that is not yet covered in textbooks on Islamic intellectual history. We read selections ofReligious Studies 419 Fakhr al-Din's work in the Arabic original. Prerequisites: a rm grounding in classical Arabic and permission of the instructor.

Prerequisite: reading fluency in ancient Hebrew. RLST 763a / JDST 701a, The Bible Christine Hayes This course introduces students to the writings common to both Jewish and Christian scripture (the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh found in all Bibles) and examines these writings as diverse and oen conflicting expressions of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel as well as a foundational element of Western civilization. Special emphasis on the writings' cultural and historical setting in the ancient Near East; close reading of selected passages; the interpretive history of selected passages influential in Western culture. Students are also introduced to a wide range of critical and literary approaches to biblical studies, including source criticism, tradition criticism, redaction criticism, and contemporary literary criticism. Students view course lectures, which survey the entire Bible, online; class time focuses on comparative materials, close readings, and the interpretation of specic biblical passages in Jewish and Christian culture.

Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery. RLST 833a / ARCG 611a / CLSS The Ancient Egyptian Temple as Cosmos: Correlation of Architecture and Decoration Program Christina Geisen The course focuses on the correlation of archaeology, iconography, and philology by analyzing ancient Egyptian temples under the specic consideration of the interplay of architecture and decoration program.

The program is designed to train Renaissance specialists who are rmly based in a traditional discipline but who can also work across disciplinary boundaries. Departmental areas of concentration available are Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, History, History of Art, History of Music, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese. Special Admissions Requirements Only candidates wishing to proceed to a doctorate should apply. Application should be made to the department of concentration, with an indication that the candidate seeks nomination to the combined degree in Renaissance Studies. Applications should be accompanied by scores from the GREs and one research or critical paper. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree Students are subject to the combined Ph.D. supervision of the Renaissance Studies program and the relevant participating department. The student's program will be decided in consultation with an adviser, the director of graduate studies (DGS) in Renaissance Studies, and the DGS in the participating department. As detailed below, requirements for the combined degree vary slightly to accommodate the requirements of the participating departments, but all candidates for the combined degree are expected to meet, at a minimum, the following requirements. (1) Students must demonstrate a reading knowledge of Latin, Italian, and a third language, which will vary according to departmental requirements. At the minimum, an examination in Latin or Italian should normally be passed upon entrance; a second language should be passed before the third term; and a third language by the end of the second year. (2) Each student is required to take sixteen term courses (in History of Art, een).424 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 The normal pattern is to have completed een courses during the rst two years of study, no more than two of which may be individual reading and research. (3) A two- term core seminar (RNST 500/RNST 501), designed to present a wide range of topics concerned with Renaissance and early modern culture, is required of all combined degree candidates. This course, oered every other year, is open to students from other departments. Training in teaching, through teaching fellowships, is considered an important part of every student's program. Most students teach in their third and fourth years. The scheduling of the oral examination and the dissertation prospectus follows the practice of the primary department, but in every case the two requirements must be completed not later than September of the fourth year. The oral examination, varying in length from two hours to two hours and een minutes, will include questions on Renaissance topics outside the primary discipline. The remainder of the examination will be devoted to the primary discipline, including (except in the case of Classics) some further coverage of the Renaissance period. Students take additional written examinations as required by the primary departments. Upon completion of all predissertation requirements, including the prospectus, students are admitted to candidacy for the combined Ph.D. degree. Admission to candidacy must be completed by the beginning of the fourth year. The dissertation will be advised and completed according to departmental guidelines, but one of the readers will normally be a member of the Renaissance Studies Executive Committee. Classics Course work Students are required to complete sixteen term courses. Eight of these will be courses in Classics and will include at least four courses in Greek and Latin literature, a course in historical or comparative grammar, and at least three seminars.

The prospectus must be submitted to the DGS in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, who will circulate it to the departmental faculty for their review and approval; the prospectus will likewise be submitted to the Renaissance Studies program for review and approval by the faculty member(s) working with the student. The prospectus must be submitted and approved by the faculty by the beginning of the seventh term of enrollment. Failure to meet this deadline will result in suspension of registration privileges by the Graduate School. The deadline for the submission of the dissertation prospectus in either term is the Monday of the nal week of classes. Dissertation The dissertation is to achieve a strong disciplinary (i.e., Spanish, Portuguese, or Spanish/Portuguese) identity while at the same time projecting a clear Renaissance Studies prole. The dissertation normally will be directed from within the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, and there will be at least one reader from the Renaissance Studies Executive Committee. Master's Degrees M.Phil. The combined M.Phil. degree may be requested aer all requirements but the dissertation are met. M.A. (en route to the Ph.D.) The M.A. degree is awarded upon completion of eight term courses, taken in at least three disciplines, and with at least three grades of Honors. The examination in Latin or Italian must have been passed.Renaissance Studies 431 Program materials are available upon request to the Chair, Renaissance Studies Program, Yale University, PO Box 208298, New Haven CT 06520-8298. Courses The two-term Renaissance Studies core seminar (RNST 500/RNST 501) is oered Epic David Quint and Jane Tylus This course looks at Renaissance epic poetry in relationship to classical models and as a continuing generic tradition. It examines epic type scenes, formal strategies, and poetic architecture. It looks at themes of exile and imperial foundations, aristocratic ideology, and the role of gender. The main readings are drawn from Vergil's School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Slavic Languages and Literatures Arnold Hall, 304 Elm Street, 203.432.1300, slavic.department@yale.edu http://slavic.yale.edu M.A., M.Phil., Ph.D. Chair John Katerina Professors Edyta Bojanowska, Katerina Clark, Harvey Goldblatt, Krystyna Illakowicz, Julia Titus, Karen von Kunes Fields of Study The department oers the Ph.D. in Russian literature and culture and, by special arrangement, in medieval Slavic literature and philology. Special Admissions Requirements An advanced-level command of the Russian language is required. A ten- to twenty-page writing sample, written in English, should be submitted with the application. Special Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree All graduate students are required to take four courses. RUSS 607, Topics in Russian Literature from Its Origins to the Eighteenth Century, is coordinated with the department's graduate reading list of required works in Russian literature of the period. All students will take an examination in RUSS 607 that will also double as the medieval Russian literature examination for the doctorate (for more on examinations, see below). RUSS 608, Eighteenth-Century Russian Literature, follows the same pattern as RUSS 607. Its readings are also coordinated with the department's graduate reading list of required works in Russian literature. All students will take an examination in RUSS 608 that will also double as the eighteenth-century Russian literature examination for the doctorate. The other required courses are SLAV 754, Old Church Slavonic, and RUSS 834, Aspects of Russian Grammar and Teaching Methodologies, which combines pedagogy with the structure of Russian. If possible, SLAV 754 should be taken before RUSS 607. RUSS 834 should be taken concurrently with or before a graduate student's rst term of teaching Russian language, typically during the seventh term of study. The minimum number of graduate courses for the Ph.D. is sixteen, counting the above four required courses. Of the remaining twelve, at least two must be taken in nineteenth-century Russian literature and at least two in twentieth-century Russian literature, including poetry and prose or dramatic works.Slavic Languages and Literatures 433 Students who have done graduate work elsewhere may petition the department for up to three course credits toward their degree aer one year's residence at Yale. A special curriculum may be arranged for students wishing to specialize in medieval Slavic literature and philology. Minor eld As part of their program of study, students will also be responsible for developing a minor eld of specialization in one of the following: (1) a Western or non- Western literature; (2) lm studies; (3) a topic in intellectual history; (4) one of the other arts; (5) another Slavic literature; (6) Slavic linguistics; (7) another discipline relevant to their primary interests in Russian literature. The student's minor eld of specialization will be determined in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS). The minor eld can be developed most readily through reading courses in the Slavic department or by taking graduate courses in another department. Up to two graduate courses in other departments will count toward the sixteen for the doctorate if they are relevant to a student's program of study. The successful completion of a course or courses in the student's minor eld taken in another department may double as the departmental examination in the minor. Examinations The Ph.D. qualifying examinations comprise eight parts and will be completed during the third year of study: (1) medieval Russian literature; (2) Russian literature of the eighteenth century; (3) minor eld; (4) nineteenth-century Russian prose and drama; (5) nineteenth-century Russian poetry; (6) twentieth-century Russian prose and drama; (7) twentieth-century Russian poetry; (8) pre-prospectus examination. The rst two examinations are taken in conjunction with courses oered during the rst two years of course work, RUSS 607 and RUSS 608. Early in the h term of study, students will take (3), a forty-minute oral exam in their chosen minor eld, administered by the DGS and relevant faculty within and/or outside the department; this examination will be waived if the student has successfully completed one or two relevant graduate courses in another department. In October of the third year of study (typically during the second week), students will take two written examinations, (4) and (5), of two hours each, the rst on Monday of the given week, the second on Friday. Each exam will consist of two or three passages drawn from well-known works of literature that will be identied and that are designated as required on the department's reading list (which also includes additional works that are recommended but not required). Students will be expected to choose one passage and write an essay in which they analyze the text from as many of the following points of view as possible: versication (if relevant), style, structure, narrative point of view, themes, genre, period, place in the author's oeuvre and in literary history, comparative context, and critical reception. Two additional written examinations, (6) and (7), which will follow the same format, will be held during one week at the end of the student's h term of study (typically the rst week of December), again on Monday and Friday. Each of these four written exams will be compiled and graded by two faculty members with expertise in the given century and genres. Aer each exam, students will be informed as to how they performed. Aer the nal written exam, all students will have a one-hour oral pre-prospectus exam on a date to be specied by the department near the beginning of the sixth term (typically, during the rst week of February). This examination will explore issues434 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 pertaining to the student's future dissertation prospectus. Normally, preparation for the exam will entail a more focused reading of the departmental reading list. For example, a student who proposes to work on Pasternak would read not only the required and recommended works by Pasternak, but also the required and recommended works by other writers of the twentieth century. Students will also be expected to explore secondary and theoretical sources outside the reading list that are relevant to their chosen topic. Preparation for the examination will be done in consultation with two faculty advisers (see below), and students will be required to prepare in advance a seven- to ten-page text outlining their future dissertation topic, including a discussion of existing scholarship and the way they propose to structure their work. An annotated bibliography of primary and secondary works pertaining to their dissertation topic should also be appended. The pre-prospectus text will be distributed to all departmental faculty one week prior to the exam, and all faculty will attend the exam. The aim of this exam is for the student to take an intermediate step toward developing a dissertation prospectus and also to provide the student with feedback from the faculty about the project. The departmental reading list is available on the department's website. Article in lieu of examination As a possible alternative to one of the four written examinations on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, students may choose to write an article that they will submit for publication to a scholarly journal. The work will be carried out in consultation with a faculty adviser and will focus on a work or works in either poetry or prose (or drama) of the given century. This article will be due on the date that the exam on the given genre is normally scheduled. It is expected that the article will be ambitious in its overview and in its conceptualization of the issue(s) being addressed. The faculty adviser will evaluate the work and will advise the student on publication. Combined Ph.D. Program with Film and Media Studies The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures also oers, in conjunction with the Film and Media Studies Program, a combined Ph.D. in Slavic Languages and Literatures and Film and Media Studies. For further details, see Film and Media Studies in this bulletin and the department's website. Applicants to the combined program must indicate on their application that they are applying both to Film and Media Studies and to Slavic Languages and Literatures. All documentation within the application should include this information. Master's Degrees M.Phil. See Degree Requirements under Policies and Regulations. M.A. The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures does not admit students for the terminal M.A. degree, nor does it award an M.A. en route to the Ph.D. degree. If, however, a student admitted for the Ph.D. leaves the program prior to completion of the doctoral degree, the student may be eligible to receive a terminal master's degree. The student must have completed at least een term courses in Russian literature and linguistics, chosen in consultation with the DGS. A grade of Honors in at least two term courses and an average of High Pass in the remaining courses must be attained.Slavic Languages and Literatures 435 A reading knowledge of French or German is required, and candidates must pass departmental prociency examinations in Russian.

Students taking the course for credit in Comparative Literature can write their papers on texts in other languages. RUSS 714b / FILM 630b, Soviet Cinema and the Distribution of Perception John MacKay Soviet lmmakers and theorists in the 1920s were preoccupied with the way that the established cinema harnessed perception in socially determined, class-specic ways, and sought a variety of alternatives. This course examines those alternatives and their limitations, as postulated in theory and realized on lm, as well as their long-term, global influence on theoretical and moving image practice. We examine lms and writings by such gures as Vertov, Wang Bing.436 Graduate School Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 SLAV 752a, The Slavic Peoples and Their Languages: From Unity to Diversity Harvey Goldblatt Examination of the linguistic and cultural history of the Slavs from their prehistoric period up to the formation of the diverse Slavic languages, the individual Slavic states, and their national literatures.

Courses SOCY 506a / MGMT 734a, Designing Social Research Balazs Kovacs This is a course in the design of social research. The goal of research design is \"to ensure that the evidence obtained enables us to answer the initial [research] question as unambiguously as possible\" (de Vaus 2001: 9). A good research design presupposes a well-specied (and hopefully interesting) research question. This question can be stimulated by a theoretical puzzle, an empirical mystery, or a policy problem. With the research question in hand, the next step is to develop a strategy for gathering the empirical evidence that will allow you to answer the question \"as unambiguously as possible.\" SOCY 508b / PLSC 505b, Qualitative Field Research Daniel Mattingly In this seminar we discuss and practice qualitative eld research methods. The course covers the basic techniques for collecting, interpreting, and analyzing ethnographic data, with an emphasis on the core ethnographic techniques of participant observation and in-depth interviewing. All participants carry out a local research project. Open to undergraduates with permission of the instructor. SOCY 542a, Sociological Theory Emily Erikson The course seeks to give students the conceptual tools for a constructive engagement with sociological theory and theorizing. We trace the genealogies of dominant theoretical approaches and explore the ways in which theorists contend with these approaches when confronting the central questions of both modernity and the discipline. SOCY 560a or b / PLSC 734a or b, Comparative Research Workshop Julia Adams This weekly workshop is dedicated to group discussion of work-in-progress by visiting scholars, Yale graduate students, and in-house faculty from Sociology and aliated disciplines. Papers are distributed a week ahead of time and also posted on the website of the Center for Comparative Research (http://ccr.yale.edu). Students who take the course for a letter grade are expected to present a paper-in-progress the term that they are enrolled for credit. SOCY 576b, Civil Sphere and Democracy Jerey Alexander In dialogue with normative and empirical approaches to civil society (Habermas, Putnam), this course introduces \"civil sphere theory,\" starting from Alexander's The Civil Sphere (2006) and its critics. The sacred and profane binaries that animate the civil sphere are examined, as are such civil sphere organizations as polls, mass media, electoral systems, law and oce. We read works about U.S. presidential elections, immigration and its controversies, the civil rights movements, the crisis of contemporary journalism, and recent controversies over church pedophilia, the nancial system, and telephone hacking. We consider the challenge of deprovincializing civil sphere theory, looking at civil spheres in Latin America and East Asia. Regarding theSociology 439 possibility of a cosmopolitan or global civil society, we examine the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. SOCY 580a, Introduction to Methods in Quantitative Sociology Sta Introduction to methods in quantitative sociological research.

Topics of concern include urban poverty, race relations, ethnicity, class, privilege, education, social networks, social deviance, and crime. SOCY 595a or b, Inequality and Life Course Workshop Sta In this workshop we present and discuss ongoing research work, primarily but not exclusively quantitative analyses. In addition, we address theoretical and methodological issues in the areas of the life course (education, training, labor markets, aging, as well as family demography), social inequality (class structures, stratication, and social mobility), and related topics. SOCY 598a and SOCY 599b, Independent Study Philip Gorski By arrangement with faculty. When students register for the course online, the dropdown menu should be completed. SOCY 602b, Poverty and Social Welfare Policy in the United States Lloyd Grieger Who is poor in America? How has the social safety net evolved over time in the United States? Who is \"deserving\" of federal assistance? In this course we examine the formation and eectiveness of anti-poverty policies in the United States from a sociological and public policy perspective. Topics include the origins of the modern social safety net, the role of the federal government in constructing and implementing anti-poverty policy, the realities of low-wage work, and the \"culture of poverty.\" Employment- and family-based policy strategies for alleviating poverty are considered. Applied understanding of quantitative social science research methods is helpful, but not required. SOCY 620b, Material Culture and the Iconic Consciousness Jerey Alexander How and why do contemporary societies continue to symbolize sacred and profane meanings, investing these meanings with materiality and shaping them aesthetically? Initially exploring such \"iconic consciousness\" in theoretical terms (philosophy, sociology, semiotics), the course then takes up a series of compelling empirical studies about food and bodies, nature, fashion, celebrities, popular culture, art, architecture, branding, and politics.440 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 SOCY 625a, Analysis of Social Structure Scott Boorman Emphasizing analytically integrated viewpoints, the course develops a variety of major contemporary approaches to the study of social structure and social organization. Building in part on research viewpoints articulated by Kenneth J. Arrow in The Limits of Organization (1974), by J\u00e1nos Kornai in an address at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences published in 1984, and by Harrison C. White in Identity and Control (2nd ed., 2008), four major species of social organization are identied as focal: (1) social networks, (2) competitive markets, (3) hierarchies/bureaucracy, and (4) collective choice/legislation. This lecture course uses mathematical and computational models\u2014 and comparisons of their scientic styles and contributions\u2014as analytical vehicles in coordinated development of the four species. SOCY 628a or b, Workshop in Cultural Sociology Jerey Alexander This workshop is designed to be a continuous part of the graduate curriculum. Meeting weekly throughout both the fall and spring terms, it constitutes an ongoing, informal seminar to explore areas of mutual interest among students and faculty, both visiting and permanent. The core concern of the workshop is social meaning and its forms and processes of institutionalization. Meaning is approached as both structure and performance, drawing not only on the burgeoning area of cultural sociology but on the humanities, philosophy, and other social sciences. Discussions range widely among methodological, theoretical, empirical, and normative issues. Sessions alternate between presentations by students of their own work and by visitors. Contents of the workshop vary from term to term, and from year to year. Enrollment is open to auditors who fully participate and for credit to students who submit written work. SOCY 629b / WGSS 629b, Politics of Reproduction Rene Almeling Reproduction as a process that is simultaneously biological and social, involving male and female bodies, family formation, and powerful social institutions such as medicine, law, and the marketplace. Sociological research on reproductive topics such as pregnancy, birth, abortion, contraception, infertility, reproductive technology, and aging. Core sociological concepts used to examine how the politics of reproduction are shaped by the intersecting inequalities of gender, race, class, and sexuality. SOCY 630a / AFAM 773a, Workshop in Urban Ethnography Elijah Anderson The ethnographic interpretation of urban life and culture. Conceptual and methodological issues are discussed. Ongoing projects of participants are presented in a workshop format, thus providing participants with critical feedback as well as the opportunity to learn from and contribute to ethnographic work in progress. Selected ethnographic works are read and assessed. SOCY 647b, Social Processes Scott Boorman Focus is on identifying and exploring robust alternatives/complements to the rational choice models that have come to dominate so much of the analysis of social (including organizational) processes in recent years. Specically, emphasis is placed on a range of mathematical models and related analytic approaches originating outside of the rational choice literature\u2014in elds such as social network analysis, evolutionary biology, organization theory, and the law. Possible starting points include the Boorman-Levitt network matching model and its applications to nonprots and complex statutes; weak ties models of job information transmission and other information transfer in eliteSociology 441 social networks; and \"garbage can\" models of the internal problem-solving dynamics of complex organizations. SOCY 656a, Professional Seminar Sta This required seminar aims at introducing incoming sociology graduate students to the department and the profession. Yale Sociology faculty members are invited to discuss their research. There are minimum requirements, such as writing a book review. No grades are given; students should take for Audit.

Courses PORT 922a, Brazil's Modern Art Movement K. David Jackson Study of Brazilian modernism in literature and the arts, centered on S\u00e3o Paulo's \"Modern Art Week\" of 1922, from the perspective of the European avant-gardes (cubism, futurism, surrealism) and Brazilian content. Themes include the Cannibal Manifesto and cultural independence from Europe; and avant-garde practices in literature and the arts from the 1920s to the construction of Bras\u00edlia and S\u00e3o Paulo Concrete Poetry. Special attention to major authors\u2014Oswald de Andrade, M\u00e1rio Cavalcanti, and Tarsila do Amaral. Includes influential visitors to Brazil, as well as radio, lm, and music of the period. PORT 925b, Brazilian Modernist Poetry K. David Jackson This course studies the generation of major poets who were part of Brazilian modernism, centered on the \"Modern Art Week\" of 1922 and the poetry written to express the individuality and character of Brazil's language and culture at the onset of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization. Major poets include Manuel and Policies 2018\u20142019 Andrade, Raul Bopp, Lu\u00eds Aranha, Oswald de Andrade, Jorge de Lima, and Vin\u00edcius de Moraes. Points of analysis include form, use of language, themes of memory and modernization, cultural characterization, humor, and ethical and existential concerns. PORT 975a, Experimental, Visual, and Concrete Poetry in Perspective K. David Jackson Brazilian concrete poetry in international perspective; production and theory of concrete poetry, translation, and criticism during the second half of the twentieth century. Brazilian concrete poets in the context of visual and concrete poetics. Representative works include \"Pilot Plan\" and Theory of Concrete Poetry, graphic and spatial poems, and public expositions of works. Brazilian concrete poets were among the leaders of an international neo-vanguard movement in the mid-twentieth century related to geometrical abstraction in painting. In the journals Noigandres and Inven\u00e7\u00e3o, and in Theory of Concrete Poetry, the Brazilians link their poetics to Pound, Mallarm\u00e9, cummings, and other inventive gures in world poetry, while relating poetry to graphic arts through reference to painting and to semiotics, including Fenollosa's essay on use of the Chinese character. The exhibit in S. Paulo's Museum of Modern Art in December 1956 was the beginning of the public exhibition of concrete poetry, now the topic of anthologies, websites, criticism, and museum retrospectives. Concrete poetics dominated the production of poetry in Brazil for half a century with a major eect on cultural and intellectual life. Prerequisite: PORT 140 or equivalent. SPAN 688a / CPLT 676a, Law and Literature in Modern Latin America Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda A study of major modern narrative works in Latin America from the independence and post-independence period in the nineteenth century to the age of drug tracking and the AIDS epidemic today. The course begins with the Cuban Cirilo Villaverde's antislavery novel Cecilia Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara (1929) by the Venezuelan R\u00f3mulo Gallegos and the dictator novel El se\u00f1or presidente (1946) by the Guatemalan Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's total novel Cien a\u00f1os de soledad (1967); and ends with the Colombian Fernando Vallejo's La virgen de los sicarios (1994) and the Mexican Mario Bellatin's Sal\u00f3n de belleza (2009) . The course follows the thematics of the law, particularly Roman Law, and the way in which the characters are controlled or driven by civil and criminal law issues that constitute the plots of the novels. In Spanish. SPAN 711b, Clar\u00edn/Gald\u00f3s: La Regenta and Fortunata y Jacinta No\u00ebl in-depth reading of two nineteenth-century Spanish narrative masterpieces. We analyze the texts as literary aesthetic achievements and explore their cultural-historical contexts. In Spanish. SPAN 790b, Methodologies of Modern Language Teaching Ame Cividanes Preparation for a teaching career through readings, lectures, classroom discussions, and presentations on current issues in foreign/second language acquisition theory and teaching methodology. Classroom techniques at all levels. In Spanish. SPAN 812a, The Polemics of Possession in Early Spanish American Narrative Rolena Adorno Fundamental writings on the Spanish Indies from Columbus's \"Letter of Discovery\" of 1493 to the writings by authors of indigenous American heritage in the rst quarter of the seventeenth century: their observations of New World realities, their debatesSpanish and Portuguese 445 about the meanings and rights of Spanish sovereignty, and their literary relationships to one another. The concept of \"the polemics of possession\"\u2014their varied claims to territorial, political, cultural, and/or literary authority\u2014orients the readings of the seminar. Prose texts by Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, Hern\u00e1n Garcilaso de la Vega, and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala are complemented by Alonso de Ercilla's enduring narrative epic poem. In Spanish. SPAN 904a / CPLT 965a, Latin American Thought Moira Fradinger This seminar introduces students to two centuries of Latin American political thought in the form of social and literary essays produced since the times of independence. It studies how Latin American writers have thought of their identity and how they have theorized the political/cultural heritage of the colony. The seminar starts with the Haitian constitution and contemporary Haitian authors who assess the legacy of the Haitian revolution. It ends with writings on current indigenous movements across the region. The rst unit engages nineteenth-century debates over \"American identity\" that were foundational to the Bol\u00edvar, second independence, the movement of \"indigenismo,\" mestizaje, transculturation and heterogeneity, the Caribbean movement of \"negritude,\" the metaphor of \"cannibalism\" to account for the cultural politics of the region, concepts such as \"internal colonialism\" and \"motley society,\" and the polemics modernity (authors third explores recent debates over indigenous cosmologies, coloniality, and other ways of knowing de Castro). There is an extra session on the tradition of Latin American feminist thought depending on the interests of the group. Weekly sessions are conducted in Spanish, and most of the readings are Spanish, French, and Portuguese materials (with a few Anglo- Caribbean sources). Students will be provided with English translations if they prefer and will be allowed to write their papers in English. SPAN 912a / CPLT 942a, The Borges Eect Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda Since the publication of Ficciones in 1944 and especially since achieving worldwide acclaim aer receiving ex-aequo with Samuel Beckett the Formentor Group's Prix International in 1961, Jorge Luis Borges has become one of the most influential modern writers. He is a recognizable and oen acknowledged presence in the work of novelists and short-story writers, as well as in that of philosophers and literary theorists. A Borges \"eect\" can be perceived in John Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Italo Calvino, Michel Foucault, G\u00e9rard Genette, and Jacques Derrida, among others. That eect is also projected retrospectively in Borges's particular way of reading classics like Homer, Dante, and Cervantes. An elegant, playfully ironic skepticism, together with a fondness for aporias, enigmas, puzzles, and labyrinths as well as for minor genres such as the detective story, are the446 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 most recognizable components of Borges's style and thought. Taken together these components suggest theories about writing and reading. We read closely Borges's most influential stories, such as \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,\" \"Pierre Menard, \"The Garden of Forking Paths,\" as well as his essays on Homer, Dante, and Cervantes. We then follow his track in the writers mentioned. Class discussions in English; readings in English or the French, Spanish, or Italian originals. SPAN 978a, Religion and the Novel in Contemporary Spanish American Narrative An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez Perez This seminar examines the many ways in which religious discourse has been appropriated in the twentieth-century Spanish American novel, oen with the aim of turning novels into \"sacred texts.\" We also consider the meaning of the \"literary theology\" that Spanish American literature has generated by creatively adapting into its makeup a variety of religious concepts, such as \"the holy,\" the notion of an aerlife, reincarnation, salvation, canonization, and the various theories about the nature of God. Primary readings include works ranging from Federico Gamboa's Santa (1903), Mar\u00eda Luisa Bombal's La amortajada (1938), and selected essays and stories by Jorge Luis Borges in Discusi\u00f3n (1932) and El Aleph (1949), to M\u00e1rquez's Cien a\u00f1os de soledad Severo Sarduy's Maitreya (1978), Mario Vargas Llosa's La guerra del n del mundo (1981), and Tom\u00e1s Eloy Martinez's Santa Evita (1995).

It supplements the curriculum with seminars, conferences, and special lectures by scholars from Yale as well as visiting scholars, and oers a graduate qualication. Students with an interest in Archaia should apply to one of the University's degree-granting departments, and should meet the entrance standards of the admitting department. Departments and schools currently participating in Archaia are Anthropology, Classics, East Asian Languages and Literatures, History, History of Art, Judaic Studies, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Religious Studies, and the Divinity School; students from other relevant units should contact the Archaia graduate coordinators. The qualication program provides enhanced training to graduate students with wide-ranging interests in the ancient and premodern world to extend their studies beyond departmental lines. Program students are expected to fulll the requirements of the home department, but their course of study is individually modied to allow for interdisciplinary work through classes, examinations, and guidance by faculty in several departments. Graduate students who are enrolled in and funded by participating departments will earn a qualication upon satisfactory completion of the requirements. Students should apply to the department that coincides best with their backgrounds and their prospective areas of specialization, and they should indicate an interest in the interdepartmental program at the time of their application to that department. Students in participating Ph.D. programs earn the qualication en route to the doctorate. The qualication in Archaia is open to Yale Ph.D. students and to students at the Divinity School. A program of study for completion of the qualication must include the Core Seminar \u2014or, in special cases, an approved alternative seminar\u2014introducing students to issues in the study of the premodern world. In addition, a minimum of three other courses plus a capstone project is required, the courses to be selected in consultation from oerings of advanced language study and seminars related to the premodern world at the graduate level. The course of study must be approved by a graduate coordinator of Archaia and by the director of graduate studies (DGS) of the student's home456 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 department, who together with the student will lay out a blueprint for completing the requirements, articulating a eld of concentration and a direction for the capstone project, and identifying potential mentors. Requirements for the Qualification 1.A team-taught Core Seminar\u2014or, in special cases, an approved alternative seminar \u2014introducing students to issues in the study of antiquity and the premodern world, from a cross- and multidisciplinary perspective. Initiative students normally take the Core Seminar in the rst year of study. Oered each year in the spring, the seminar is normally a team-taught class sponsored by two or more of the cooperating departments. There will be supplementary sessions in the Yale collections (e.g., the Yale Art Gallery or the Beinecke) and a required monthly colloquium component. Specic topics vary, but each seminar has signicant interdisciplinary and comparative dimensions emphasizing the methodologies and techniques of the elds involved. 2.A minimum of three pre-approved courses, of which at least two must be seminar or seminar-type courses, chosen in consultation with Archaia's graduate coordinator and the DGS of the student's home department from courses oered across the University. These will in most cases be courses that also ll requirements for the student's home department, and must be at a level that would normally be accepted for graduate study in that department. 3.A capstone project that demonstrates the student's capacity to pursue independent, interdisciplinary research (the equivalent of 1 or 2 course units, depending on the scope), to be approved in consultation with a graduate coordinator of Archaia and the DGS of the student's home department (e.g., an exhibition, documentary, research paper, conservation project). 4.Regular participation in events hosted by Archaia throughout the academic year, especially the monthly meetings of the Ancient Societies Workshop. Students who fulll these requirements will receive a letter from the DGS of the Classics department, indicating that they have completed the work for the qualication. Core Seminar ANTH Sensory Experiences in Ancient Ritual Carolyn Laferriere and Andrew Turner A comparative exploration of the role the senses played in the performance of ancient and premodern ritual, drawing from a range of ancient traditions including those of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and from cultural traditions of the Near East, India, China, and the New World. Placing particular emphasis on the relationship between art and ritual, we discuss the methods available for reconstructing ancient sensory experience, how the ancient cultures conceived of the senses and perception, and how worshipers' sensory experiences, whether visual, sonic, olfactory, gustatory, or haptic, were integral aspects in their engagement with the divine within religious ritual. This seminar incorporates material in the Yale Art Gallery.Atmospheric Science 457 Atmospheric Science Advisory Committee Sarbani Basu (Astronomy), Michelle Bell (Forestry & Environmental Studies), Alexey Fedorov (Geology & Geophysics), Debra Fischer (Astronomy), Gary Haller (Emeritus, Chemical & Environmental Engineering), Xuhui Lee (Forestry & Environmental Studies), Ronald Smith (Geology & Geophysics), Mitchell Smooke (Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science; Applied Physics), Mary-Louise Timmermans (Geology & Geophysics), John Wettlaufer (Geology & Geophysics; Mathematics; Physics) A number of departments of the Graduate School oer courses dealing with the physics, dynamics, and chemistry of the atmosphere, and the interactions of the atmosphere with the biosphere, oceans, and cryosphere, including all biogeochemical cycles.

BBS has no boundaries, either departmental or geographical. Students therefore have access to courses, seminars, and faculty labs in every department. Moreover, students can participate in research activities anywhere\u2014on the main University campus, West Campus, or the School of Medicine. Within BBS there are approximately 350 participating faculty, several dozen courses, and a great many seminars from which to choose. BBS is currently divided into eight interest-based \"tracks\": Biochemistry, Quantitative Biology, Biophysics, and Structural Biology Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Immunology Microbiology Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics, and Development Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology Neuroscience Plant Molecular Biology Students apply to and, upon matriculation, aliate with one of these eight tracks. It is important to note that, regardless of a student's home track, all courses, faculty, and research opportunities at the University remain available. Year 1 Each track has a faculty director who helps rst-year students select courses and nd suitable lab rotations. Students typically take two to three courses per term and conduct two to four lab rotations over the course of the year. Year 2 Just prior to the start of the second year, students select a thesis adviser in whose lab they will conduct their doctoral research. They also then leave their BBS track and formally join one of eleven Ph.D.-granting programs: Cell Biology Cellular and Molecular Physiology Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Experimental Pathology Genetics Immunobiology Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program MicrobiologyCombined Program in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) 459 Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Pharmacology Students in year 2 complete the course requirements for the graduate program they have joined, take a qualifying exam, act as teaching assistants in lecture or lab courses, and begin thesis research. Year 3 and beyond Students focus primarily on thesis research, publishing their results, and presenting their work at scientic meetings. The average time to degree is 5.5 years. For the duration of their studies all students receive a stipend, full tuition, and health coverage. Financial support comes from Yale University Fellowships, National Institutes of Health (NIH) training grants, and grants from foundations and companies.

JDST 781b / RLST 774b, History of Jewish Culture, 1500 to the Present Sta A broad introduction to the history of Jewish culture from the late Middle Ages until the present. Emphasis on the changing interaction of Jews with the larger society as well as the transformation of Judaism in its encounter with modernity. JDST 790a / HIST 601a / RLST 776a, Jewish History, Thought, and Narratives in Medieval Societies Ivan Marcus Research seminar that focuses on the two medieval Jewish subcultures of Ashkenaz (northern Christian Europe) and Sefarad (mainly Muslim and Christian Spain). JDST 801a / HIST 599a, Medieval Jewish History: 800-1500 CE Sta This course is an introduction to some of the major themes in the history of the Jewish people from late antiquity to 1500. We trace the development of Jewish communities in Muslim and Christian lands, focusing on the complex relationship that Jews had with their host societies. Other topics include Jewish self-government and communal organization and major currents in Jewish intellectual culture. The course follows a thematic line, moving from demographics to economics, from legal issues to intellectual and social questions. JDST 802b / HIST 600b, Jewish Everyday Life in the Middle Ages Sta Medieval Jewish history has been based primarily on written sources and hence has tended to concentrate on the intellectual male elite, institutions, and events. In recent years, historians are increasingly interested in everyday, or quotidian, history, looking beyond the intellectual elite to society as a whole and using, alongside texts, archaeology and the material world. Following the \"material turn,\" this seminar focuses on Jewish material culture, using archaeology and art history in the service of cultural history. Among the subjects considered are the Jewish quarter and street; the synagogue; the ritual bath (mikve); the cemetery Political Theology Hannan Hever This course investigates the theological aspects of modern political ideologies. Subjects include sovereignty, universalism, law, election, commandment, and messianism.472 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Primary readings include Carl Schmitt, Martin Buber, 797a, Holocaust, Israel, and American History David Sorkin This course explores the changing nature of Jewish politics in relationship to three of the twentieth century's major events. First we examine Jewish political behavior during the Holocaust, especially the notion of \"resistance\" vis-\u00e0-vis the so-called Jewish councils and the controversy surrounding Hannah Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem. Second, we probe the continuities and discontinuities in the establishment of the State of Israel, focusing on the politics of the \"Yishuv\" (Jewish settlement in Mandatory Palestine) and its relationship to British imperialism. Third, we analyze shis in the domestic and foreign policies of the organized American Jewish community during the era of the civil rights movement (1946-64).The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale 473 The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale Luce Hall, 203.432.0694 http://macmillan.yale.edu Director Ian Shapiro (Political Science) For more than half a century the Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale has been the University's principal institution for encouraging and coordinating teaching and research on all aspects of international aairs, societies, and cultures around the world. The MacMillan Center seeks to make understanding the world outside the borders of the United States an integral part of liberal education and professional training at the University.

Graduate Certificates of Concentration in Area Studies General Guidelines\u2014Program Description The Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale, through the regional councils on African Studies, European Studies, Latin American and Iberian Studies, and Middle East Studies, sponsors graduate certicates of concentration that students may pursue in conjunction with graduate-degree programs in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the professional schools. The certicate is intended for students seeking to demonstrate substantial preparation in the study of one of four areas of concentration: Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Candidates for the certicate must demonstrate expertise in the area of concentration through their major graduate or professional eld, as well as show command of the diverse interdisciplinary, geographic, and cultural-linguistic approaches associated with expertise in the area of concentration. Admission to the graduate certicate is contingent on the candidate's acceptance into a Yale graduate-degree program. Award of the graduate certicate, beyond fullling the relevant requirements, is contingent on the successful completion of the candidate's Yale University degree program. Application Procedure Specic requirements of each council are reflected in its application, monitoring, and award procedures. Application forms can be picked up at the relevant councilThe Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale 475 or downloaded from its website. Prospective students should submit a completed application form to the relevant council. Applications may be submitted by students admitted to a graduate program at Yale or during their program of study but no later than the beginning of the penultimate term of study. Each council may set limits on the number of candidates for its program in any given year. For further information, see the council administrator. General Requirements While the general requirements are consistent across all councils of the MacMillan Center, the specic requirements of each council may vary according to the dierent expertise required for its area of concentration. In addition to the specic requirements, students pursuing the certicate are expected to be actively engaged in the relevant council's intellectual community and to be regular participants at its events, speaker series, and other activities. Serious study, research, and/or work experience overseas in the relevant region is highly valued. Course Work Students must complete a total of six courses focused on the area from at least two dierent elds, including a Foundations Course if designated by the council. Of the remaining ve courses, only two may be \"directed readings\" or \"independent study.\" Please note: No more than four courses may count from any one discipline or school. Courses from the home eld of the student are eligible. Courses may count toward the student's degree as well as toward the certicate. Literature courses at the graduate level may count toward the six-course requirement, but elementary or intermediate language courses may not. At the discretion of the faculty adviser, an advanced language course at the graduate level may be counted if it is taught with substantial use of eld materials such as literature, history, or social science texts and journals relevant to the area. Course work must demonstrate broad comparative knowledge of the region rather than focus on a specic country. Course work must demonstrate a grasp of the larger thematic concerns aecting the region, such as environment, migration, or global nancial movements. Only those courses listed on the Graduate Course Listings provided by the area council may be used to fulll course requirements. For courses not listed there, please consult the certicate adviser. Non-listed courses may only be counted with prior approval of the council adviser, not aer the fact. A minimum grade of HP must be obtained or the course will not be counted toward the certicate. Only course work taken during the degree program at Yale may be counted toward the certicate. Language Proficiency Language prociency in at least one language relevant to the area of concentration beyond prociency in English is required. (For some councils and for some individual circumstances, prociency in two languages beyond English is required.) In the476 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 major-area language targeted for meeting the prociency requirement, students must demonstrate the equivalent ability of two years of language study at Yale with a grade of B+ or better. Language prociency must encompass reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills plus grammar. Students may demonstrate prociency by completing course work, by testing at Yale, or by other means as approved by the council adviser. When a second major language of the region beyond English is required, the relevant council will specify the target level. The typical departmental graduate reading exam is not sucient for certifying the four-skill language requirement of the certicate. Normally, a candidate who is a native speaker of one of the area's major languages will be expected to develop language prociency in a second major-area language. Interdisciplinary Research Paper A qualifying research paper is required to demonstrate eld-specic research ability focused on the area of concentration. Aer they have completed substantial course work in the area of concentration, students must seek approval from the council faculty adviser for the research project they propose as the qualifying paper. Normally, students will submit their request no later than the fourth week of the term in which they plan to submit the qualifying paper. The interdisciplinary research paper may be the result of original research conducted under the supervision of a faculty member in a graduate seminar or independent readings course or in eld research related to the student's studies. An M.A. thesis, Ph.D. prospectus, or dissertation may also be acceptable if it is interdisciplinary as well as focused on the area of concentration. The qualifying paper should examine questions concerning the area of concentration in a comparative and/or interdisciplinary context. It should also use relevant international and area-focused resource materials from a relevant region and/or resource materials in the language(s) of a relevant region or regions. Normally the paper should incorporate at least two of the following elements: Address more than one country relevant to the area of concentration Draw on more than one disciplinary eld for questions or analytic approaches Address a transregional or transnational theme relevant to the area of concentration The paper will be read by two faculty members selected in agreement with the council adviser. The readers will be evaluating the paper for the quality of research, knowledge of the relevant literature, and depth of analysis of the topic. The qualifying paper must be fully footnoted and have a complete bibliography. The council adviser may call for a third reader as circumstances warrant. Progress Reports and Filing for the Award of the Certicate Students should submit a progress report along with a copy of their unocial transcript to the council faculty adviser at the end of each term. Ideally, this will include a brief narrative describing the student's engagement in the relevant council's intellectual community and participation in its events, speaker series, and the like, as well as any planned or newly completed experience overseas. A student who intends to le for the nal award of the certicate should contact the council no later than the end of the term prior to award. No later than the fourth weekThe Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale 477 of the term of the expected award, candidates should demonstrate how they have or will have completed all the requirements on time. At the end of the term as grades are nalized, the council will conrm that the candidate is cleared to receive the home degree and has fullled all the requirements of the certicate. The nal award will require review and clearance by the deputy director of the MacMillan Center. Pursuit of Two Certicates No courses may overlap between the two certicates. Any application for two certicates by a single student must robustly fulll all of the requirements for each of the two certicates. Each certicate must be approved independently by each respective council's certicate adviser. In addition to the approval of both council advisers, any award of two certicates will require review and approval by the deputy director of the MacMillan Center.478 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Council on African Studies The MacMillan Center 136 Rosenkranz Hall, 203.432.1425 http://african.macmillan.yale.edu Graduate Certicate of Concentration in African Studies Chair Michael Cappello (Pediatrics; Microbial Pathogenesis; Public Health) Faculty For faculty listings, see African Studies under Degree-Granting Departments and Programs in this bulletin. Special Requirements for the Graduate Certificate of Concentration in African Studies The Graduate Certicate of Concentration in African Studies enables graduate and professional school students in elds other than African Studies to demonstrate interdisciplinary area expertise, language prociency, and research competence in African Studies. The certicate program is intended to complement existing elds of studies in other M.A. and Ph.D. programs and to provide the equivalent of such specialization for students in departments and schools without Africa-related elds of study. The certicate program is designed to be completed within the time span of a normal Ph.D. residence. Professional school students and M.A. students in the Graduate School may require an additional term of registration to complete the certicate requirements depending on the requirements of specic programs. The certicate program includes interdisciplinary course work, language study, and research components. The specic requirements are: 1.Successful completion of at least six courses in African Studies from at least two departments or schools, one of which is a core course in African Studies (AFST 764, Topics in African Studies, or AFST 501, Research Methods in African Studies). 2.Demonstration of prociency in an African language. 3.Evidence of research expertise in African Studies. Research expertise may be demonstrated by completion of an interdisciplinary thesis, dissertation prospectus, or dissertation, or by completion of a substantive research seminar paper or the equivalent as approved by the faculty adviser. The certicate courses and research work should be planned to demonstrate clearly fulllment of the goals of the certicate. Certicate candidates should design their course schedules in consultation with the director of graduate studies (DGS) for African Studies. Ideally, students should declare their intention to complete the certicate requirements early in their program at Yale. Graduate and professional school students who intend to complete the certicate program must declare their intention to do so no later than during their penultimate term of enrollment.

The Council on East Asian Studies (CEAS) was founded in 1961 and continues a long tradition of East Asian Studies at Yale. CEAS provides an important forum for academic exploration and support related to the study of China, Japan, and Korea. Its mission is to facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students and to foster outstanding education, research, and intellectual exchange about East Asia. For nearly sixty years, it has promoted education about East Asia both in the Yale curriculum and through lectures, workshops, conferences, lm series, cultural events, and other activities open to students, faculty, and the general public. With nearly thirty core faculty and more than twenty language instructors spanning ten departments on campus, East Asian Studies remains one of Yale's most extensive area studies programs. Its interdisciplinary emphasis encourages collaborative linkages across elds and departments and contributes to diversity across the curriculum and in the classroom. Approximately one hundred y courses on East Asia in the humanities and social sciences are oered each year. CEAS administers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Master of Arts (M.A.) programs. While the B.A. program focuses on the study of either a country or an area within East Asia, the M.A. program focuses on the study of China, Japan, or a transnational region in East Asia. Graduates of the East Asian Studies B.A. and M.A. programs have gone on to distinguished careers in the elds of academia, business, nonprot organizations, and government service. For details on the M.A. program, see East Asian Studies under Degree-Granting Departments and Programs in this bulletin. East Asian Studies endowments make it possible for CEAS to oer grants and fellowships for Yale students conducting East Asian-related research and language study, as well as to support student organization programming and conferences. Every year, CEAS welcomes domestic and international scholars to campus as guest lecturers, visiting fellows, research scholars, and professors. In 1999 the council initiated the CEAS Postdoctoral Associates Program, bringing talented individuals into the community of scholars at Yale to conduct research and teach advanced undergraduate seminars. Study and research in East Asian Studies at Yale are supported by one of the nest library collections in the country. The Chinese-, Japanese-, and Korean-language print resources in the East Asia Library at Sterling Memorial Library constitute one of the oldest and largest collections found outside of East Asia. The Asian art collections at480 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 the Yale University Art Gallery also support classroom instruction, faculty research, and community outreach activities.European Studies Council 481 European Studies Council The MacMillan Center 332 Luce Hall, 203.432.3423 http://europeanstudies.macmillan.yale.edu Graduate Certicate of Concentration in European Studies Chair Edyta Bojanowska (Slavic Languages & Literatures) Acting Chair [F] Julia Adams (Sociology) Faculty and Participating Sta For faculty listings, see European and Russian Studies under Degree-Granting Departments and Programs in this bulletin. The European Studies Council promotes research programs on European politics, culture, economy, society, and history. The geographical scope of the council's activities extends from Ireland to Italy, and from Portugal to the lands of the former Soviet Union. The council's denition of Europe transcends conventional divisions between Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, and includes the Balkans and Russia. The U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly designated the council a National Resource Center and a FLAS Center under its HEA Title VI program. The European Studies Council builds on existing programmatic strengths at Yale while serving as a catalyst for the development of new initiatives. Yale's current resources in European Studies are vast and include the activities of many members of the faculty who have teaching and research specialties in the area. Such departments as Comparative Literature, Economics, English, History, History of Art, Political Science, Slavic Languages and Literatures, and Sociology regularly oer courses with a European focus. These are complemented by the rich oerings and faculty strength of the French, German, Italian, Slavic, and Spanish and Portuguese language and literature departments, as well as the European resources available in the professional schools and other programs, such as Film and Media Studies. By coordinating Yale's existing resources, including those in the professional schools, encouraging individual and group research, and promoting an integrated comparative curriculum and degree programs, the council strongly supports the disciplinary and interdisciplinary study of European regions and their interactions. The council is also home to special programs in European Union Studies; Baltic Studies; Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies; and Hellenic Studies; as well as a Polish cultural initiative. In addition to the M.A. degree program, the council oers students in the University's doctoral and other professional degree programs the chance to obtain a Graduate Certicate of Concentration in European Studies by fullling a supplementary curriculum. The undergraduate major in Russian and East European Studies is administered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. The benets provided to the Yale community by the European Studies Council include its aliation with interuniversity and international organizations that can oer specialized training programs and research grants for graduate students (see482 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 https://yale.communityforce.com/Funds/Search.aspx), support conferences among European and North American scholars, and subsidize European visitors to Yale. The Fox International Fellowship Program, for example, oers generous fellowship support to qualied students who undertake research at specied institutions in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Russia; and the Geneva Exchange supports Yale doctoral students who wish to study at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. Furthermore, the council supplements the regular Yale curriculum with lm series, lectures, and seminars by eminent scholars, artists, diplomats, and political ocials. The European Studies Council constantly expands its formal connections with a variety of European institutions and regularly hosts a European Union Fellow sponsored by the European Commission. Fields of Study European and Slavic languages and literatures; economics; history; music; political science; law; sociology and other social sciences.

Of particular note are the collections of Arabic and Persian manuscripts, as well as large holdings on the medieval and modern Middle East. The Council on Middle East Studies administers the Middle East Studies National Resource Center at Yale, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education under HEA Title VI. As a National Resource Center, the council supports a number of projects and activities, including summer- and academic-year language fellowships and an extensive outreach program. The council also oers a Graduate Certicate of Concentration in Modern Middle East Studies. Students with an interest in the Middle East should rst apply to one of the University's degree-granting departments, such as Anthropology, History, Linguistics, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Political Science, Religious Studies, or Sociology, and then apply for the graduate certicate of concentration no later than the beginning of their penultimate term of study. Graduate Certificate of Concentration in Modern Middle East Studies The certicate represents acknowledgment of substantial preparation in Middle East Studies, both in the student's major graduate or professional eld and also in terms of the disciplinary and geographical diversity required by the council for recognized competency in the eld of Middle East Studies. As language and culture are the core of the area studies concept, students are required to attain or demonstrate language prociency. Requirements 1.Language prociency: At least two years of successful study at the college level (or the equivalent) in one of the four major modern languages of the Middle East: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. 2.Course work: A total of six courses in at least two disciplines on the Middle East and related issues. All courses must be completed with a passing grade. 3.Interdisciplinary research paper: A qualifying research paper that demonstrates eld-specic research ability focused on the area of concentration. Aer having completed substantial course work in the area of concentration, students must seek approval from the council faculty adviser for the research project they propose as the qualifying paper. Normally, students submit their request no later than the fourth week of the term in which they plan to submit the qualifying paper.

Students interested in participating in the PEB program may indicate their interest on their graduate application for admission to a home department or track. Students may also join the PEB aer they have matriculated at Yale. Aer arriving at Yale, students should e-mail peb@yale.edu to express their interest in the PEB, and the leadership will review their application materials. PEB students acquire a depth of knowledge in their home department and also a breadth of knowledge across disciplines from PEB courses and activities. They will become skilled at applying physical and engineering methods and quantitative reasoning to biological problems, and at identifying and tackling cutting-edge problemsIntegrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (PEB) 495 in the life sciences, and they will be procient at combining theory and computation with wet lab experiments. In addition, students will become comfortable working in an interdisciplinary and collaborative research environment and adept at communicating with scientists from a variety of disciplines as well as with nonscientists. PEB Curriculum The PEB curriculum consists of four core courses (see below), which all students, regardless of their undergraduate background, take together. The Integrated Workshop course (MB&B 591 /ENAS 991/MCDB 591 /PHYS 991) and the Interdisciplinary Research course (MB&B 517 /ENAS 517/MCDB 517 /PHYS 517) are typically taken in the rst year. The third course, Biological Physics (ENAS 541/CB&B 523 /MB&B 523 /PHYS 523), and the fourth course, either Dynamical Systems in Biology (MCDB 562 /AMTH 765 /CB&B 562 /ENAS 561/INP 562 /MB&B 562 /PHYS 561), should be completed by the end of the second year. With permission of the PEB leadership, one of the following three courses may be substituted to satisfy the fourth course requirement: (1) Systems Biology of Cell Signaling (ENAS 567), (2) Biomedical Data Science: for Genetic Analysis (GENE 760 ). Two primer courses are also oered (but not required). Boot Camp Biology (MB&B 520 ) is a primer course for students entering PEB with little or no background in biology, and Quantitative Approaches in Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B 635 /ENAS 518) is a primer course for students entering PEB with little or no background in mathematics and computation. In addition to the formal courses, there are a multitude of enrichment activities available to PEB students; see http://peb.yale.edu.496 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 315 William L.

Gender (the social and historical meanings of the distinction between the sexes) and sexuality (the domain of sexual practices, identities, discourses, and institutions) are studied as they intersect with class, race, ethnicity, nationality, and other axes of human dierence. The introduction of these perspectives into all elds ofWomen's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 497 knowledge necessitates new research, criticism of existing research, and the formulation of new paradigms and organizing concepts. The Certicate (previously known as the Qualication) in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is open to students already enrolled in a Ph.D. program at Yale. Interested students are strongly encouraged to register for the certicate by meeting with the director of graduate studies (DGS) during their rst year. Students who wish to receive the certicate must (1) complete a graduate course on the theory of gender and sexuality; (2) complete two electives, including one course that must be drawn from the WGSS curriculum; (3) complete one term of WGSS 900, WGSS Certicate Workshop; (4) demonstrate the capacity to pursue independent, interdisciplinary research in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies by presenting a qualifying paper at a meeting of the WGSS Colloquium; and (5) fulll a teaching requirement. Each of these requirements must be met in consultation with the DGS and the individual WGSS graduate adviser. Students who fulll these expectations will receive a letter from the DGS, indicating that they have completed the work for the certicate. Program information and the requirements for the certicate are available on the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies website, or by contacting 203.432.0845 or wgss@yale.edu. Courses WGSS 529a / GLBL 529a, Sexuality, Gender, Health, and Human Rights Alice Miller This course explores the application of human rights perspectives and practices to issues in regard to sexuality and health. Through reading, interactive discussion, paper presentation, and occasional outside speakers, students learn the tools and implications of applying rights and law to a range of sexuality and health-related topics. The overall goal is twofold: to engage students in the world of global sexual health and rights policy making as a eld of social justice and public health action; and to introduce them to conceptual tools that can inform advocacy and policy formation and evaluation. Class participation, short reaction papers, and a nal paper are required. WGSS 625b, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Human Rights Graeme Reid Examination of historical, cultural, and political aspects of sexual orientation, gender identity, and human rights in the context of globalization. WGSS 629b / SOCY 629b, Politics of Reproduction Rene Almeling Reproduction as a process that is simultaneously biological and social, involving male and female bodies, family formation, and powerful social institutions such as medicine, law, and the marketplace. Sociological research on reproductive topics such as pregnancy, birth, abortion, contraception, infertility, reproductive technology, and aging. Core sociological concepts used to examine how the politics of reproduction are shaped by the intersecting inequalities of gender, race, class, and sexuality. WGSS Diasporic Intellectuals Hazel Carby This course examines work by artists and writers of Caribbean descent from dierent regions of the transatlantic world. In response to contemporary interest in issues of globalization, the premise of the course is that in the world maps of these black intellectuals we can see the intertwined and interdependent histories and relations of the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Thinking globally is not a new experience for498 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 black peoples, and we need to understand that what is represented as \"Caribbeanness\" is a condition of movement. Literature and art are most frequently taught within the boundaries of a particular nation, but this course focuses on the work of writers and artists who shape the Caribbean identities of their characters as traveling black subjects and refuse to restrain their work within the limits of any one national identity. We practice a new and global type of cognitive mapping as we read and explore the meanings of terms like black transnationalism, migrancy, globalization, and empire. Diasporic practice embraces and represents the geopolitical realities of the modern, modernizing, and postmodern worlds in which multiple racialized histories are inscribed on modern bodies. WGSS 660b / ANTH 684b, Men, Manhood, and Masculinity Andrew Dowe Cultural and historic constructions of masculinity through an investigation of male bodies, sexualities, and social interactions. Examination of multiple masculinities and exploration of the relationships among hegemonic, masculinities. WGSS 661b, Queer This course provides an introduction to queer theology, its theoretical grounding in queer theory, and some of the controversies and possibilities that make up its current shape. Questions considered include whether Christianity can or should be queer; the implications of contemporary debates in queer theory over temporality, futurity, sociality, and spatiality for the shape and possibility of queer theology itself; how to use art and performance as theological sources; and the way queer theory's anti-essentialist stance shis the stakes of debates over the theological and political status of LGBTQ+ persons. The course also considers the impact of HIV/AIDS on notions of community formation, risk, and nitude. Prerequisites: at least one term of theology at the graduate level (introduction to theology or systematic theology) or permission of the instructor; and preferably at least one course in gender studies. WGSS 667b / FREN 900b / HIST 667b, History of Sexuality in Modern Europe Carolyn Dean An introduction to the various lines of inquiry informing the history of sexuality. The course asks how historians and others constitute sexuality as an object of inquiry and addresses dierent arguments about the evolution of sexuality in Europe, including the relationship between sexuality and the state and sexuality and gender. WGSS 677a / PHIL 677a, Feminist Philosophy: Theories of Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation Robin Dembro This course surveys several feminist frameworks for thinking about sex, gender, and sexual orientation. We consider questions such as: Is there a tenable distinction between sex and gender? Between gender and sexual orientation? What does it mean to say that gender is a social construction, or that sexual orientation is innate? What is the place of politics in gender and sexual identities? How do these identities\u2014and especially resistant or transgressive identities\u2014impact the creation and revision Readings in African American Women's History Crystal Feimster The diversity of African American women's lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social,Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 499 political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, ction, autobiography, art, religion, lm, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women 's activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the and work. WGSS 737b / ANTH 735b, Gendering the Modern Subject Eda Pepi This seminar familiarizes students with how the analytical categories of sex and gender interrogate \"classic\" philosophical texts and restructure key debates on the nature of the human subject as a locus of unmarked, universal reason and purposeful action as well as embodied perception and passion. From Spinoza and Descartes to Hegel and Merleau-Ponty, we engage an overview of the conceptual and historical development of modern, Western ideas of personhood and the emergence of liberalism as the basis of new technologies of the self. We read these texts alongside feminist, critical race, and postcolonial commentaries that highlight the sexual and racial constitution of a seemingly universal subject of modernity. These commentaries trace how practical theories of \"lower\" or minor selves\u2014the subject people of the colonies, slaves, and others\u2014were integral to the very development of ideas of the modern, autonomous, and acting self in the Western world. WGSS 746b / AMST 729b / FILM 810b, Visual Kinship, Families, and Photography Laura Wexler Exploration of the history and practice of family photography from an interdisciplinary perspective. Study of family photographs from the analog to the digital era, from snapshots to portraits, and from instrumental images to art exhibitions. Particular attention to the ways in which family photographs have helped establish gendered and racial hierarchies and examination of recent ways of reconceiving these images. 782b / HIST 940b / HSHM 770b, Disability Histories: Research Seminar Naomi Rogers This course introduces students to the major issues in current disability history as well as theoretical debates in disability studies. We discuss cultural, social, and political meanings of citizenship; eorts to dene and classify disabled bodies; contested notions of bodily dierence; and the ways disability has and continues to be used as a metaphor for socially dened inferiority like gender, race, or sexuality. By the fourth week students have identied the topic for their research papers and discussed them in class. The next month is devoted to research and writing. We start meeting again aer spring break to read and discuss a dra of each paper. WGSS 852b / AMST 852b / ANTH 852b, Reading the Americas, Reading Ethnography Ana Ramos-Zayas The course uses ethnographic approaches to understand \"America\" as a hemispheric formation, while simultaneously examining \"ethnography\" as methodological, epistemological, and representational cra. Complemented by critical readings and seminar discussions about some of the trademarks of ethnographic research\u2014e.g., participant observation, life history, eld notes, and eld sites\u2014the course is designed to encourage students to interrogate the theoretical and methodological models that have been used in the production of knowledge about the Americas. Emphasizing ethnography's concern with everyday life, practices, routines, and relationships, it analyzes how micro-processes and manifestations of race, sexuality, class, and gender500 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 entwine with macro-processes of empire and nation-state building, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, urbanism, and social inequality in the United States, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean. While this is not a \"how to\" course on ethnographic research, we use classic and contemporary ethnography to understand the region and gain greater knowledge about the process, epistemology, and politics of eldwork. We analyze a number of aspects and approaches to doing and writing ethnography, including the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the eld; and as we build familiarity with the components of ethnography, we consider its applicability to an array of topics, settings, objects, cultural dynamics, and relationships. WGSS 853a / FILM 806a, Archives: Histories, Practices, Theories, and Formations Laura Wexler This seminar studies the co-constitution of objects-with-documents and undocumented people. We explore theoretical, historical, material, practical, methodological, and curatorial questions related to the operation and status of the archive in this migration of objects and people. Students are asked to work collaboratively in and with archives as sources and tools, and to experiment with creating archives of their own. The seminar involves some travel to Brown and some irregular hours that are mentioned in the syllabus. WGSS 960a / CPLT 881a Figlerowicz and Jonathan Kramnick What is literary theory today, and what is its history? The aim of the course is to introduce students to central concepts in theory and explore their relation to method. We examine the variety of approaches available within the eld of literary studies, including older ones such as Russian formalism, New Criticism, deconstruction, Marxism, and psychoanalysis, as well as newer ones like actor-network theory and digital humanities research. We explore the basic tenets and histories of these theories in a way that is both critical and open-minded, and discuss their comparative advantages and pitfalls. The focus is on recurrent paradigms, arguments, and topics, and on transhistorical relations among our various schools of literary-theoretical thought. Readings might include work by Ren\u00e9 Wellek, Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Bruno Latour, Judith Butler, Northrop Frye, Fred Moten, and many others.Yale Center for the Study of Globalization 501 Yale Center for the Study of Globalization Betts House, 203.432.1900, globalization@yale.edu http://ycsg.yale.edu Director Ernesto Zedillo The Yale Center for the Study of Globalization (YCSG) is devoted to examining the impact of our increasingly integrated world on individuals, communities, and nations. The center's purpose is to support the creation and dissemination of ideas for seizing the opportunities and overcoming the challenges resulting from globalization's impact on the world's people and places. The center also studies problems that, even if they do not result directly from globalization, are global in nature and can therefore be eectively addressed only through international cooperation. In accordance with this mission, the YCSG enriches the debate about globalization on campus and promotes the flow of ideas between Yale and the policy world. One of the center's strengths, and an important area of focus, is its ability to engage with multilateral institutions and global organizations in activities pertinent to its mission through an activity well known in international and policy circles: Commission Diplomacy. Over a ten-year period from 2002 to 2012, the YCSG was involved in over 50 percent of the international commissions convened worldwide, and the center continues this eective work today, bringing its eorts here to the Yale community in a variety of public forums. The YCSG's current projects include the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health, which focuses on the interconnectedness between planetary health and human well-being; a project to produce a Charter on Universal Health Coverage; and work on global drug policy reform. These highlighted activities are in addition to the center's consistent focus on global development, global trade, nancial globalization, peace and security, nuclear disarmament, and climate change mitigation. On campus, the center hosts international conferences, organizes brainstorming sessions and panels, and works constantly to bring to the Yale community individuals who have input on international policy. The center's project International Cooperation in the National Interest: In Defense of the Multilateral System is an ongoing series of lectures and public presentations at Yale by leaders of the world's multilateral institutions and the experts and scholars who have studied and analyzed them.Policies and Regulations Admissions http://gsas.yale.edu/admission-graduate-school Application for admission to any of the Graduate School's programs should begin in the summer or fall of the academic year prior to the one in which the applicant proposes to matriculate. Application can be made to only one department, program, or combined program. The Graduate School utilizes an online application. Access to this application as well as application procedures, guidelines, requirements, fees, deadline dates, and all other information that an applicant will need are available at the website listed above. Holders of American Ph.D. or Sc.D. degrees, or their international equivalents, are not eligible for admission to the Graduate School in the eld in which they have already earned a degree. They may, however, apply in other elds and are also eligible to apply for admission to the Division of Special Registration as Visiting Students for nondegree study (see Nondegree Study below for more information or visit the website listed above). With the approval of the appropriate associate dean, holders of master's degrees are eligible for admission to a terminal master's degree program in the same eld at the Graduate School provided that there is signicant curricular distinction between the previous and proposed programs of study. Individual program descriptions, prerequisites, special admissions requirements, and links to these programs are available via the Graduate School's website at http:// gsas.yale.edu/academics/departments. Although programs may have varying prerequisites and special requirements for admission, all programs will require, in addition to an application and the application fee, three letters of recommendation, transcripts from each academic institution previously attended, and the results of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test, which is administered in the United States and abroad by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). This examination, in addition to any GRE Subject Tests that may be required by the student's program of study, should be taken as early as possible to ensure that ocial scores are released and received no later than the stated deadline of the program for which the student is applying. Applicants whose native language is not English must present evidence of prociency in English by satisfactorily completing the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), which is administered by ETS, or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). This requirement is waived only for applicants who, prior to matriculation at Yale, will have received a baccalaureate degree or its international equivalent from a college or university where English is the primary language of instruction. The applicant must have studied in residence at the baccalaureate institution for at least three years to receive a waiver. The TOEFL or IELTS, if required, should be taken as early as possible to ensure that ocial scores are released and received no later than the stated deadline of the program for which the student is applying.Policies and Regulations 503 Students who do not demonstrate sucient prociency in English may be retested or asked to take courses in English for speakers of other languages. A higher level of prociency will be required in order for students to serve as teaching fellows. International applicants who accept oers of admission will be required to give appropriate evidence of necessary nancial support before the University will be able to issue visa documents. The application contains questions regarding prior or pending criminal convictions and disciplinary actions. When an applicant answers armatively to either of these questions, the Graduate School will evaluate the circumstances outlined by the applicant to determine if they are potentially relevant to the applicant's participation in the Yale community as a graduate student. In cases where such charges are pending, the Graduate School may decide to admit the applicant contingent upon the charges being resolved or to defer the decision on admission until the charges are resolved. If new criminal or disciplinary charges are led against an applicant aer submission of the application but prior to matriculation, applicants are required to notify the Graduate School Admissions Oce of this fact in writing. Failure to do so may result in rejection of an application or rescission of an oer of admission. It is the policy of the Graduate School to verify all credentials in support of an application. All transcripts, recommendations, publications, standardized test scores, and supplemental materials may be traced to their sources in order to conrm their authenticity. Written materials submitted by an applicant may be subject to review for the purpose of identifying plagiarism. Applicants are typically notied of decisions regarding their applications during the months of February and March. Ocial notication is sent from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences only. All entering students must have obtained the bachelor's degree or its international equivalent. Oers of admission are contingent on a student providing an ocial transcript indicating that the student has been awarded a baccalaureate degree (or its international equivalent) prior to matriculation. Students who are not able to provide such evidence will not be permitted to register. Those who have been engaged in graduate work at Yale or another university must also present an ocial transcript giving evidence of degree(s) awarded and/or satisfactory completion of the previous year's work. Applicants who have been previously denied admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences three times may not apply again. The Oce of Graduate Admissions will not release application materials, including standardized test scores, letters of recommendation, or transcripts, to the applicant or other institutions or agencies for any purpose. Students will need to contact ETS, recommenders, or educational institutions they have previously attended in order to furnish such materials to a third party.504 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Programs of Study Full-Time Degree Candidacy Most students enrolled in the Graduate School are registered for full-time study as they pursue a Ph.D. or master's degree program. These students devote their full eort to course work, preparation for qualifying examinations, gaining teaching experience, and the research and writing leading to the completion of the dissertation. Part-Time Study In rare circumstances, qualied individuals who are unable to devote their full time to graduate study may apply and be admitted as part-time students in either doctoral or terminal master's programs. For more complete information, see Part-Time Study under Degree Requirements, below. Nondegree Study Qualied individuals who wish to study at the graduate level as nondegree candidates may be admitted to the Division of Special Registration (DSR). Admission to the DSR is for one term or for one year only and carries with it no commitment by the Graduate School for further study. Students admitted for the academic year must demonstrate satisfactory academic performance in the rst term in order to register for the second term. Students in the DSR may obtain transcripts indicating the appropriate credit for work completed. DSR students engaged in course work or a combination of course work and research are identied as Visiting Students. Although normally admitted for full-time study, Visiting Students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents may be admitted for part-time study and are charged tuition on a per-course basis, whether for credit or audit. Please refer to Financing Graduate School for a schedule of tuition and fee charges. Students admitted to the DSR as Visiting Students are not eligible for nancial aid, including federal and most nonfederal student loans. Advanced graduate students who are degree candidates (at the master's or Ph.D. level) at another university and who have made arrangements with a specic Graduate School faculty member for a research project under that faculty member's direct supervision may be admitted to the DSR as Visiting Assistants in Research. Undergraduate students in combined or simultaneous B.S./M.S., B.A./M.A., or similar programs are not considered advanced graduate students. Student research conducted at Yale must be part of the visiting student's thesis or dissertation. The extent and location of the research completed at Yale must be cited in the completed thesis or dissertation. The Graduate School does not provide nancial support to Visiting Assistants in Research. Such students either hold standard graduate student Assistantship in Research appointments that are funded by the faculty adviser, or provide their own funding through external awards or personal resources. Please refer to Financing Graduate School for a schedule of tuition and fee charges. Detailed information, requirements, and access to the online DSR application are available at http://gsas.yale.edu/admissions/application-process/non-degree-Policies and Regulations 505 programs-division-special-registration. DSR applicants must provide evidence of health care for the duration of their studies at Yale at the time of application. Some departments at Yale have formal exchange agreements with universities in other countries that have been approved by the Graduate School. Graduate students who are admitted to Yale under such approved exchange agreements may be registered as Exchange Scholars . Exchange Scholars normally are not charged tuition. In rare circumstances, students may apply for a second year of registration in the DSR; however, cumulative enrollment is limited to two years. Students enrolled in the DSR who are subsequently admitted to degree programs in the Graduate School may receive academic and tuition credit for no more than four courses completed while enrolled in the DSR, provided that the department recommends such credit and the appropriate associate dean approves. Interdisciplinary Study All graduate students are formally associated with one department or program, and in the case of students in combined-degree programs, with two. Students may, however, be encouraged to take one or more courses in related departments. Students are oen advised by faculty members from more than one department during their dissertation research. Students in the Graduate School, with permission of the director of graduate studies and the relevant school, may take advantage of particular course or research opportunities in Yale College and in Yale's professional schools. Combined- and Joint-Degree Programs Students interested in African American Studies, Film and Media Studies, and Renaissance Studies pursue a combined Ph.D. with departments in related elds. In addition to these academic programs, there are several formal interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs in the Graduate School listed under the appropriate departmental entries of this bulletin. Ad hoc programs may also be approved. A student who is interested in an ad hoc program should prepare a written proposal for review and approval by the relevant departments and associate deans before the student has advanced to candidacy. Students are encouraged to contact the appropriate directors of graduate studies about specic opportunities for interdisciplinary study throughout the Graduate School and the University. The Graduate School also participates in formal joint-degree programs with the professional schools, including the J.D./M.A. and J.D./Ph.D. programs in cooperation with the Law School; the M.D./Ph.D. program in cooperation with the School of Medicine; and the Ph.D./M.B.A. program in cooperation with the School of Management. In addition, joint-degree programs with professional schools have been approved for master's students in European and Russian Studies, Global Aairs, and International and Development Economics, and for doctoral students in Nursing. These programs are described in the individual departmental listings. For all joint-degree programs except the M.D./Ph.D., students are required to submit formal applications to both the professional school and the Graduate School indicating their interest in enrolling in the joint program. Individuals interested in the M.D./Ph.D.506 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 program apply directly to the School of Medicine (see Requirements for Joint-Degree Programs, below). Exchange Scholar Program http://gsas.yale.edu/academics/exchanges/exchange-scholar-program-ivyplus- exchange Graduate students in Yale Ph.D. programs may petition to enroll full- or part-time for a term or for an academic year as exchange scholars at the University of California at Berkeley, Brown, University of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Stanford. The Exchange Scholars Program enables students to take advantage of special educational opportunities not available at their home institutions. Applications are available at the website listed above. Please direct questions to Assistant Dean Jasmina Besirevic Regan (jasmina.besirevic@yale.edu). Applications must be received at least six weeks prior to the beginning of the term for which the student is applying. International Graduate Student Exchange Agreements http://gsas.yale.edu/academics/exchanges/international-exchanges The Graduate School has established and continues to develop formal exchanges with a number of institutions internationally in cases where there are reciprocal academic benets for faculty and graduate students. Yale doctoral students may participate in the international exchanges listed below. Most of them last one term or a full academic year, and a small number of exchanges are available for summers only. All international exchange agreements must be approved in advance by the Graduate School to ensure that they meet University policies and Graduate School guidelines. Departments interested in establishing an exchange program must prepare a statement that demonstrates that there is a clear academic and reciprocal need for such a program, and that the program will conform to the established guidelines for all such exchange agreements. Students and faculty interested in pursuing these exchanges should contact Assistant Dean Jasmina Besirevic Regan (jasmina.besirevic@yale.edu).

See individual departmental policies in this bulletin regarding specic expectations for degree programs during the summer. Although the Graduate School does not oer courses in the summer, intensive language instruction is available through the Yale Summer Session, and graduate students may wish to take advantage of those programs while in New Haven. For further details on summer oerings at Yale, please consult the Yale Summer Session website at http://summer.yale.edu and a relevant dean in the Graduate School. Degree Requirements The requirements set forth in the pages that follow are the minimum Graduate School degree requirements and apply to all degree candidates. Students should consult the508 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 listings of individual departments and programs for additional specic departmental requirements. Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Length of Study In most elds of study, six years should normally be sucient for the completion of the Ph.D. Departments and programs make every eort to design a course of study and to provide advice and guidance to make it possible for students to complete their work within six years. Normally three, or at most three and one-half, years are devoted to the completion of predissertation requirements (courses, examinations, selection of a dissertation topic). The remaining time, typically two to three years, is devoted to conducting research and writing the dissertation. Residence Requirement Students seeking the Ph.D. degree are required to be in residence in the New Haven area during at least three academic years. This is an academic requirement, distinct from and independent of the tuition requirement described below. The residence requirement must normally be met within the rst four years of study. Any exception to the residence requirement must be approved by the department and by the appropriate associate dean. Tuition Requirement and the Continuous Registration Fee All Ph.D. candidates are charged four years (eight terms) of full tuition, or proportionately less if all degree requirements, including submission of the dissertation, are completed in less than four continuous years of full-time study from the date of matriculation in the Ph.D. program. Once the full-tuition obligation has been completed, registered students are charged the Continuous Registration Fee (CRF). Transfer Credit/Course Waivers The Graduate School does not award transfer credit for graduate work completed before matriculation at Yale. Non-Yale courses A department may, with the approval of the Graduate School, waive a portion of the Ph.D. course requirement (normally a maximum of three courses) in recognition of previous non-Yale graduate-level work completed aer receipt of the bachelor's or bachelor's-equivalent degree. Such a waiver does not aect the tuition requirement. Courses taken prior to matriculation at Yale will not appear on the student's Graduate School transcript. The Yale courses waived will be recorded on the student's transcript as waived. Yale courses With the approval of the department, a doctoral student who is currently enrolled may petition to count up to one year of relevant course work completed in a Yale master's or professional doctoral program as partial fulllment of the Ph.D. course requirements. This petition must be received by the appropriate associate dean in the Graduate School before the end of the student's rst year of study in the Ph.D. program. The dean may reduce the four-year tuition requirement by either one or twoPolicies and Regulations 509 terms, based on the number of courses accepted. The courses accepted will be listed on the student's transcript. Waived courses are not counted in determining a student's eligibility for either terminal or en route master's degrees. Foreign Language Requirement Language requirements are set by individual departments and programs. Specic language requirements are explained in the individual department listings. All departmental requirements are subject to initial approval by the Executive Committee of the Graduate School and are monitored by the Degree Committee. A department cannot make exceptions to its own requirements without authorization by the Degree Committee. Graduate students taking undergraduate language courses will be graded according to the Yale College grading scale. Where applicable, language courses may count toward graduate degree requirements in some programs (see program descriptions). Undergraduate language courses may not count toward the Honors requirement. The required level of prociency in foreign languages, and the method for demonstrating it, are determined by the individual departments. Students are urged to be prepared to meet language requirements at the beginning of their rst year of study. Course and Honors Requirements The course requirements for the Ph.D. degree are set individually by each department or program. Each course oered in the Graduate School counts for a single credit or, in rare cases, one-half credit. Only courses oered by the Graduate School and ocially numbered on the graduate level (i.e., 500 or higher), and receiving a qualitative grade of Honors, High Pass, or Pass, can fulll requirements for the doctoral degree, with the exception of certain undergraduate language courses or where specied in advance by the department or program. Although departments may set more stringent requirements, to meet the minimum Graduate School quality requirement for the Ph.D., students must achieve the grade of Honors in at least one full-year or two full- term graduate courses taken aer matriculation in the Graduate School and during the nine-month academic year. The Honors requirement must be met in courses other than those concerned exclusively with dissertation research and preparation. A student who has not met the Honors requirement at the end of the fourth term of full-time study will not be permitted to register for the h term. A student who is not in academic good standing with regard to course work or research, as dened by the minimum standards established by the Graduate School and the expectations outlined by the student's department or program, may be dismissed from the Graduate School. Such dismissal will be recorded on the student's transcript. Qualifying Examination Each Ph.D. student must pass a general examination, separate from course examinations, in the major subject oered and in such subordinate subjects as may be required by the department. Such examinations are described in the individual department listings. Students should consult with their director of graduate studies for further information about this requirement.510 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Committee Constitution Requirement Each Ph.D. student must have a dissertation committee, satisfactory to the student's department and in accordance with Graduate School requirements, in order to register for the fourth year of study. Students without an approved committee will normally be withdrawn from their program. Prospectus The dissertation topic, in the form of a prospectus, must be approved by the department. Certication of this approval, together with a copy of the prospectus, must be led with the Graduate School registrar at least six months prior to the submission of the dissertation. By the time a prospectus is submitted, the department must approve a member of the graduate faculty to serve as the primary adviser for the dissertation. Students who plan to submit the dissertation before the end of the fourth year of study should be sure to reserve time to satisfy this requirement. The prospectus should be viewed as a preliminary statement of what the student proposes to do in the dissertation and not as an unalterable commitment. However, substantive deviation from the dissertation project outlined in a prospectus (as determined by the director of graduate studies and associate dean) will require that the student dra a new prospectus to be approved by the dissertation committee at least six months prior to the submission of the dissertation. In consultation with their faculty advisers and directors of graduate studies, students should give serious thought to the scale of proposed dissertation topics. There should be a reasonable expectation that the project can be completed during the stipulated duration of the degree program. The appropriate form and typical content of a prospectus inevitably vary from eld to eld. In most cases, however, a prospectus should contain the following information: 1.The name of the dissertation adviser. 2.A statement of the topic of the dissertation and an explanation of its importance. What in general might one expect to learn from the dissertation that is not now known, understood, or appreciated? 3.A concise review of what has been done on the topic in the past. Specically, how will the proposed dissertation dier from or expand upon previous work? A basic bibliography should normally be appended to this section. 4.A statement of where most of the work will be carried out\u2014for example, in the Yale library or another library or archive, in the laboratory of a particular faculty member, or as part of a program of eldwork at specic sites in the United States or abroad. 5.If the subject matter permits, a tentative proposal for the internal organization of the dissertation\u2014for example, major sections, subsections, sequence of chapters. 6.A provisional timetable for completion of the dissertation. Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy indicates that the department and the Graduate School consider the student prepared to do original and independent research. Students will be admitted to candidacy when they have completed all predissertation requirements,Policies and Regulations 511 including the dissertation prospectus and excluding any required teaching. Admission to candidacy will normally take place by the end of the third year of study. Any programmatic variations from this pattern that have been approved by the Executive Committee of the Graduate School are described in the individual department statements. Training in teaching can occur both before and aer a student is admitted to candidacy. A student who has not been admitted to candidacy at the expected time will not be permitted to register for the following term. At the time of advancement to candidacy, students who have not petitioned for or received en route degrees (e.g., M.A., M.S., M.Phil.) will automatically be considered for such degrees. If a student advances to candidacy aer the deadline to submit a petition for the degree in that term, the student will be considered for a degree in the following term. Training in Teaching The Teaching Fellow Program (TFP) is the principal framework at Yale in which graduate students learn to become eective teachers. Learning to teach and to evaluate student work is fundamental to the education of graduate students. Teaching is required in many departments and is an expectation for all doctoral students. All graduate students teaching for the rst time at Yale are required to attend a \"Teaching @ Yale Day\" (T@YD) orientation. The TFP provides opportunities for graduate students to develop teaching skills, under faculty guidance, through active participation in the teaching of Yale undergraduates. Teaching fellows who encounter problems or diculties related to their teaching appointments are encouraged to meet with their associate dean. A student must be registered in the Graduate School, at least half- time, to be appointed as a teaching fellow (TF) or as a part-time acting instructor (PTAI). TFs assist faculty in teaching relatively large undergraduate courses. PTAIs are responsible for small undergraduate courses, subject to guidance and advice by department faculty. For a more detailed description of these types of appointments, see Teaching Fellow Levels under Financing Graduate School. Faculty should clearly communicate to students and teaching fellows their expectations about evaluation of work, feedback to students, and grading policies. Faculty are expected to prepare course syllabi, assignments, and examinations. Typically, they should not ask teaching fellows to give lectures when they are unable to attend class, although they are encouraged to oer occasional opportunities for student lectures when they can attend and advise. While on rare occasions teaching fellows may be asked to assist with administrative activities (such as placing course material on library reserve or online, making photocopies for class, ensuring that audiovisual resources are available and working, and the like), in general such activities should not be done by students. Graduate students may occasionally serve as graders for graduate-level courses, but only in highly quantitative courses with grading demands for frequent assignments. To avoid conflicts of interest, teaching fellows should not normally be assigned to evaluate the work of graduate student peers. However, in courses requiring extensive quantitative work, teaching fellows may score quantitative homework and exams submitted by graduate students, using nondiscretionary scoring keys approved by the faculty instructor. In these instances, the faculty member should review the teaching fellow's scoring and must assign the nal grade. In courses that are double-titled with both graduate and undergraduate numbers, the same guidelines hold for the grading512 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 of assignments; all other grading of graduate students should be done by the faculty member. The Graduate School requires that all students who teach be in academic good standing. In addition, they must be fluent in English. Graduate students whose native language is not English are required to meet the oral English prociency standard before they may begin teaching. This includes teaching in foreign language courses. The standard may be met by (1) passing the SPEAK test, (2) passing the Center for Language Study oral exam, (3) passing the speaking section of the iBT TOEFL, (4) passing the speaking portion of the IELTS exam, or (5) having received an undergraduate baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from an institution where the principal language of instruction is English and the student was in residence for at least three years. In some instances, a student's academic dean or director of graduate studies may require that students with an undergraduate degree from English-speaking institutions also pass an oral English exam to satisfy the language requirement. Doctoral students who have not met the oral English prociency standard must enroll in at least one course oered by the Center for Language Study's English Language Program each term. Deferral of Teaching Year In the humanities and social sciences, students in a teaching year, normally years three and four, may defer a teaching year or term into the h or sixth year. Dissertation The dissertation should demonstrate the student's mastery of relevant resources and methods and should make an original contribution to knowledge in the eld. Normally, it is expected that a dissertation will have a single topic, however broadly dened, and that all parts of the dissertation will be interrelated, but can constitute essentially discrete units. Beyond this principle, the faculty will apply the prevailing intellectual standards and scholarly practices within their elds in advising students with regard to the suitable scope, length, and structure of the dissertation, including what constitutes an original contribution to that eld. In accord with the traditional scholarly ideal that the candidate for a doctorate must make a contribution to knowledge, all dissertations that have been accepted by the Graduate School are published on microlm by University Microlms International and then deposited in the Manuscripts and Archives section of the Sterling Memorial Library. As such, classied or restricted research is not acceptable as part of the dissertation. Exceptions must be approved in advance by the Degree Committee. Dissertations must be written in and submitted in English except in some disciplines in which there are strong academic reasons for the submission of a dissertation in a foreign language. At the time of the submission of their prospectus, students must petition for permission to submit all or a portion of their dissertations in a foreign language. The petition should be submitted in the form of a letter explaining the academic reasons for using a foreign language and will be evaluated by the director of graduate studies and the appropriate associate dean. Petitions for writing and submitting a dissertation in a foreign language will not be accepted aer students have advanced to candidacy. A dissertation may not be translated into English by someone other than the student.Policies and Regulations 513 Dissertations must be submitted to the Graduate School by the respective deadlines in the academic calendar to be considered for December or May degrees. No exceptions are made to these deadlines, which have been established to allow sucient time for departments to receive evaluations from readers and recommend students to the Degree Committee. Once the adviser and committee have approved a dissertation for submission and the director of graduate studies has been notied, the student submits one unbound copy of the dissertation, sobound copies that will be distributed to each reader, a completed set of required forms (http://gsas.yale.edu/sites/default/les/ dissertation_checklist_and_phd_petition_02.16.16_secured_for_web.pdf), and any requisite fees to the Graduate School. The department must submit to the Graduate School a fully completed Notication of Readers form that has been approved by the director of graduate studies. Registered doctoral candidates must have a principal adviser with an appointment on the Graduate School faculty. The Graduate School requires that each dissertation be read by at least three people but not more than ve, at least two of whom hold faculty appointments in the Graduate School. All readers must hold the Ph.D. degree as well as a faculty position or be considered otherwise qualied to evaluate the dissertation. The process for assigning readers is determined by the department, which is responsible for conrming the qualications, contact information, and willingness of all readers before notifying the Graduate School of these appointments. All appointments of readers are subject to review by the associate dean. The department is responsible for reassigning readers as necessary, and this process will not extend the deadline for readers' reports to be returned to the Graduate School. The Graduate School will send each student a copy of the readers' reports and place a copy in the student's permanent academic record. Award of the Ph.D. will be considered by the Degree Committee only if all readers' evaluations have been received by the Graduate School and are positive, all other degree requirements have been met, and the department has recommended the awarding of the degree. Should a reader indicate that a dissertation contains signicant errors in typing, grammar, spelling, reference citations, or other textual matters, the student will be required to revise the dissertation by a date provided by the registrar. Corrected pages or a new unbound copy of the dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School, as well as a letter from the director of graduate studies indicating that the student has addressed the readers' concerns, before the dissertation can be recommended for a degree. In the event that a dissertation is evaluated as failing, departmental practice determines the number of reevaluations normally permitted. The Graduate School does not require departments to evaluate the dissertations of degree candidates who are no longer registered. The decision to review such dissertations rests with the department. Requirements for the Degree of Master of Philosophy The Master of Philosophy is awarded en route to the Ph.D. in many departments. The minimum general requirements for this degree are that a student shall have completed all requirements for the Ph.D. except required teaching, the prospectus, and dissertation. Students will not generally have satised the requirements for the Master of Philosophy until aer two years of study, except where graduate work done before admission to Yale has reduced the student's graduate course work at Yale. In no514 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 case will the degree be awarded for less than one year of residence in the Yale Graduate School. Not all departments oer the M.Phil. degree. Information regarding special departmental requirements for the degree, if any, are stated in the individual department listings. Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts or Master of Science Except in the case of programs listed below under Terminal M.A.S./M.A./M.S. Degrees, students are not admitted as candidates for the Master of Arts or Master of Science degree. However, students in most doctoral departments may be awarded the M.A. or M.S. en route to the Ph.D. degree. Although departments may set more stringent requirements, the minimum general requirements must comply with the credit hour standards set by the U.S. Department of Education and include the (1) completion of a minimum of seven courses leading to the Ph.D. or the equivalent of such courses, with grades that satisfy the departmental requirements; (2) completion of one academic year in full-time residence, or the equivalent, at Yale; (3) recommendation by the department for award of the degree, subject to nal review and approval by the Degree Committee. In no case may courses taken prior to matriculation in the Graduate School, or in Yale College or other summer programs, be applied toward the requirements for the Master of Arts or Master of Science degree. Some departments do not oer the M.A. or M.S. en route to the Ph.D., or award it only to students who are withdrawing from the Ph.D. program. For information about this or any special departmental requirements additional to the general requirements stated above, see the department listings. Students enrolled in a Ph.D. program may receive a master 's degree from another department provided that it is in a related eld of study and deemed necessary for the completion of the proposed dissertation research. The student's proposed program of study must receive formal approval in writing from the director of graduate studies in both departments and the appropriate associate dean prior to enrollment in courses that will fulll master 's degree requirements in another department. Courses taken toward a master 's degree in another department must be part of the student's course requirement for the Ph.D., as approved by the director of graduate studies in both departments. However, such course work cannot also be counted toward a master 's degree in the department to which the student was admitted. A student may not advance to candidacy until all requirements have been completed for both the en route master 's degree in the program to which the student was admitted and the proposed master 's degree in a related eld. Students who wish to obtain a master 's degree in a eld that is not directly related to the doctoral degree must apply for a personal leave from the Ph.D. program and submit an application for admission to the master 's program. Any nancial aid oered to the student for a Ph.D. program may not be transferred to a master 's degree course of study. Students enrolled in combined programs normally receive combined en route degrees as well.Policies and Regulations 515 Terminal M.A.S./M.A./M.S. Degrees The M.A.S./M.A./M.S. degrees are oered as terminal degrees in eighteen departments and programs: African Studies, American Studies, Applied Physics, Archaeological Studies, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Computer Science, East Asian Studies, Engineering and Applied Science, English, European and Russian Studies, Global Aairs, History, History of Science and Medicine, International and Development Economics (IDE), Music, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Public Health, and Statistics. The residence and tuition requirements for a terminal M.A.S./M.A./M.S. degree are a minimum of one year of full tuition and course work in residence in one-year programs, or a minimum of two years of full tuition and course work in residence in two-year programs. For information about which departments oer one-year programs and which oer two-year programs, see the department listings. With the approval of the department and the appropriate associate dean, a student may be admitted for part-time study toward the master's degree. In that case, tuition will be charged on a per-course basis. Part-time study does not change the one- or two-year full-tuition obligation described above. Part-time students must complete all degree requirements within ve years of matriculation. Individual departments establish the specic course and language requirements for these degrees. Although departments may set more stringent requirements, the minimum Graduate School requirement for students admitted for M.A.S./M.A./M.S. degrees is an overall grade average of High Pass, including a grade of Honors in at least one full-term graduate course (for students enrolled in one-year programs), or in at least two full-term graduate courses (for students enrolled in two-year programs). In order to maintain the minimum average of High Pass, each grade of Pass on the student's transcript must be balanced by one grade of Honors. Each grade of Fail must be balanced by two grades of Honors. If a student retakes a course in which the student has received a failing grade, only the newer grade will be considered in calculating this average. The initial grade of Fail, however, will remain on the student's transcript. A grade awarded at the conclusion of a full-year course in which no grade is awarded at the end of the rst term would be counted twice in calculating this average. Each course oered in the Graduate School counts for one or one-half credit. Only courses oered by the Graduate School and ocially numbered on the graduate level can fulll requirements for the master's degree, with the exception of certain language courses or when specied in advance by the department or program. A student who has not fullled the course requirements for the degree at the conclusion of the standard duration of the program can, at the discretion of the department and associate dean, be granted one additional term to fulll degree requirements. If the student has not taken the requisite number of courses but has fullled the tuition requirement, the student will be charged the Continuous Registration Fee. If the student must take additional courses beyond the number required, the student will be charged tuition on a per- course basis. No credit will be awarded toward the M.A.S./M.A./M.S. degree for courses taken prior to matriculation in the Graduate School, or taken in Yale or other summer programs. Students in one of Yale's professional schools who matriculate in the Graduate School to516 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 complete a joint master's degree may, however, with the permission of their director of graduate studies, count courses already completed in their professional school program toward the joint degree. See the individual program or department listings. The master's degree may also be earned jointly with the B.A./B.S. in certain departments by students enrolled in Yale College. For further information, see Yale College Programs of Study, available from the Oce of the Dean of Yale College. Requirements for Joint-Degree Programs Students who are candidates for degrees in any of the joint programs sponsored by the Graduate School and Yale's professional schools must meet the requirements established by each school for the degree they are seeking. Degree requirements in the Graduate School include both the Graduate School's general requirements and any special requirements set by the relevant department or program. In all cases the Honors requirement must be fullled in non-research courses oered primarily for Graduate School students, taken aer matriculation in the Graduate School. In addition to the J.D./Ph.D., J.D./M.A., M.D./Ph.D., and Ph.D./M.B.A. programs described below, joint-degree programs with other professional schools have been approved for students in European and Russian Studies, Global Aairs, International and Development Economics, and Nursing. These programs are described in the individual department listings. J.D./Ph.D. and J.D./M.A. Programs Admission to the Graduate School joint-degree programs with the Law School, described below, requires separate admission to both schools as well as approval by the appropriate associate dean in each school, and by the director of graduate studies in the student's Graduate School department. Students must apply for admission to a joint program no later than their rst year of study in a J.D., Ph.D., or two-year M.A. program, and must matriculate in the joint program no later than the beginning of their second year. Students wishing to pursue a J.D./M.A. in a one-year M.A. program must apply for admission no later than their rst year of study in the J.D. program and must matriculate in the M.A. program as a joint-degree candidate. In the J.D./Ph.D. program, the rst year of study is spent principally in the Law School. The second and third years are combined according to the interest of the student. As many as six term courses, designated by the student at the beginning of the term, may be counted toward both degrees. During this time all course work and language requirements for the Ph.D. program are normally completed. The J.D. should be completed by the end of the fourth year. During the h year the student is expected to complete all remaining predissertation requirements and be admitted to candidacy. The teaching requirement for the Ph.D. will normally be completed by this time. Any exception to this pattern of study must be approved by the appropriate associate dean. The minimum residence requirement in the J.D./Ph.D. program is four years. The tuition requirement is two and one-half years in the Law School and three and one-half years in the Graduate School. Financial aid is provided by each school according to its own criteria, typically for two and one-half years in the Law School and three and one- half years in the Graduate School, and is awarded by each school during the terms inPolicies and Regulations 517 which the student pays tuition in that school. Students are not eligible for nancial aid from the Graduate School during terms in which they are registered at another school. In the J.D./M.A. program, the J.D. and M.A. degrees are awarded simultaneously at the end of the fourth year of study in one-year M.A. programs and at the end of four and one-half years of study in two-year M.A. programs. The Graduate School tuition requirement for J.D./M.A. students in one-year M.A. programs is one year of tuition; students in two-year M.A. programs have a one and one-half year tuition requirement in the Graduate School. In all cases students pay three years of tuition in the Law School. Students in J.D./M.A. programs, like other students in M.A. programs, are not ordinarily eligible for University Fellowship aid through the Graduate School. Students usually enroll in the Law School during the rst year of study. The pattern of enrollment in subsequent years depends on whether the M.A. program is a one-year or a two-year program. M.D./Ph.D. Program This program is sponsored jointly by the Graduate School and the School of Medicine. Applications for admission to the joint program are reviewed by a committee composed of faculty members and deans from both schools. Normally, admission to the program includes simultaneous admission to both schools. However, students may apply to the joint program by October 15 of their second year of study in either the M.D. or Ph.D. program, and they must matriculate in the joint program no later than the beginning of the following year. Students request aliation with a particular department or program in the Graduate School by the middle of their third year of study in the joint program, aer their course and research interests have been dened. Although students usually pursue their research in one of the biological sciences, those interested in earning the Ph.D. through work in another department may do so under certain circumstances, with the approval of the M.D./Ph.D. committee and of the relevant department or program. At the time of the student's aliation with a non-biological/biomedical science department or program, permission for any adjustment to the teaching requirement must be obtained from the Graduate School. Requests for adjustments to the program's teaching requirement should be submitted by the director of graduate studies and by the director of the M.D./Ph.D. program, as part of a student's proposed plan of study, to the associate dean for graduate student advising and academic support. The residence requirement in this program is seven years. The full-tuition requirement is three and one-half years in the School of Medicine and two and one-half years in the Graduate School. To qualify for the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, students must satisfy all degree requirements of both schools. Normally, a student admitted to this joint program must satisfy the Graduate School Honors requirement by the end of the second year of study and must complete all remaining predissertation requirements within four terms of aliation with the Ph.D. department. This schedule may be adjusted for students who have been enrolled in either the School of Medicine or the Graduate School before admission to the M.D./Ph.D. program. Ph.D./M.B.A. Program The joint degree combines the two-year M.B.A. degree from the School of Management (SOM) with the six-year Ph.D. It would allow its students to complete518 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 requirements for both degrees in roughly seven years rather than the eight or more years that would be required if the degrees were pursued separately. Both degrees will be awarded simultaneously once the student has fullled the degree requirements of both programs. Like all graduate students, joint-degree students will receive a full nancial aid package from the Graduate School during the terms registered there. For students in the humanities and social sciences, this includes four years of tuition, ve years of stipend, and health insurance for each term registered. Funding for students in the sciences will mirror standard, departmental packages. Students will pay one and one-half years of tuition for the three terms registered at SOM. The School of Management and the Graduate School will use independent admissions processes and make independent admissions decisions. Applicants must take both the GRE tests and the GMAT. Prospective students who are currently enrolled neither in the Graduate School nor in SOM may apply to both schools simultaneously. Students already enrolled in the Graduate School normally apply to SOM aer taking one course at SOM for matriculation any time aer they have passed their Ph.D. qualifying examinations at the Graduate School but prior to beginning the h year of study. This pattern, however, is flexible, and students interested in the joint degree should consult the websites of their departments or programs for further information. Students registered in SOM may apply to the Graduate School during the rst year of study at SOM. Following admission to both programs, each student must complete a form requesting joint-degree status. The form must be signed by the appropriate associate dean at the Graduate School and at SOM and the student's director of graduate studies. A student in the Graduate School who wishes to pursue the joint degree will normally be required to take one course in SOM before applying there. The student will need to obtain the permission of the SOM instructor and state the intention to apply to the joint-degree program. The Graduate School will waive one course during the term in which the student takes this preliminary course at SOM. For students in some disciplines, this prerequisite to admission will be waived. The student is expected to complete the qualifying exams and prospectus according to the standard schedule set by the Graduate School. The student will normally begin study at SOM aer completing the departmental Ph.D. qualifying examinations at the Graduate School, but there are exceptions to this pattern described on the departmental websites. Upon admission to SOM, the joint-degree student will register at SOM for the rst-year core of courses. Students may not fulll any Graduate School requirements during this time, nor may they serve as teaching fellows in the Graduate School in any capacity. The student must register for a third term at SOM and complete four additional courses, normally prior to the beginning of the sixth year of study at the Graduate School. Depending on the schedule of individual students, they may or may not complete all four of these remaining courses within a single term at SOM. If they do not, they may complete outstanding courses while registered at the Graduate School, but in all circumstances, students are required to pay a third term of tuition to SOM. A student who has been admitted to the Graduate School while completing the rst- year core at SOM may begin course work in the Graduate School the following year. Once a joint-degree student has matriculated at the Graduate School, it is expected that the student remain registered continuously until completing the qualifying exams. During this time, the student may undertake limited course work at SOM, but may not register there for the third and nal term until the student has passed the departmentalPolicies and Regulations 519 exams at the Graduate School. Prospective students who apply simultaneously may start the joint degree at either school and follow the schedules outlined above. All joint-degree students are subject to the codes of conduct published in the bulletins of their respective programs. Joint-degree students will receive separate transcripts from SOM and the Graduate School. Each transcript will list the courses required for the respective school's portion of the joint degree. Each course taken may be counted toward one degree only. The transcripts will reflect the joint-degree status. A joint- degree student who decides not to complete both degrees may petition both schools to receive a single degree if the requirements for the single degree, including the two-year tuition requirement at SOM, are met. Professional Ethics and Responsible Conduct in Research Professional Ethics and Responsible Conduct in Research (RCR) training is intended to establish a basis of understanding among graduate students concerning their rights and obligations as scholars and researchers, as noted below. Master's and Ph.D. Students At the start of their rst year of study, all master's and Ph.D. students are required to attend a small-group discussion of professional ethics, including academic integrity, prevention of sexual misconduct, and discrimination and harassment reporting. Students must also complete an approved online training module in professional ethics before they can register for the spring term of their rst year. Additional requirements: (1) Students in the natural sciences must complete a department-based RCR course by the end of their rst year of study. Master's students in the natural sciences will not be charged tuition for this course; (2) Students in the humanities and social sciences who receive funding from a U.S. government grant or fellowship are required to complete an online RCR course oered by CITI within one month of the start of the funding. Students in the Division of Special Registration (DSR) All DSR students in the natural sciences, and DSR students in the humanities and social sciences who receive funding from a U.S. government grant or fellowship, are required to complete an online RCR course oered by CITI. This requirement must be fullled within one month of receiving a Yale NetID and even if RCR training was completed at another university. Additional requirements: (1) All DSR students registered in the fall term must complete an approved online training module in professional ethics before they can register for the spring term; (2) DSR students in the natural sciences who intend to study at Yale for one year or more are required to complete, at no charge, the department-based RCR course taken by degree-seeking students. Petitioning for Degrees Graduate School degrees are awarded twice each year, at Commencement in May and in the fall (normally in December, depending on the schedule of the Yale Corporation). Degrees are not granted automatically. Students must le a petition for each degree by the appropriate date (see Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines). Petitions that have received favorable recommendations from the student's department are520 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 reviewed by the Degree Committee. When the degree committee has given its approval, the petition is forwarded to the faculty of the Graduate School and then to the Yale Corporation. If the petition is successful, the student will be notied in writing by the dean of the Graduate School. Students enrolled in Ph.D. programs should not petition for M.A./M.S. and M.Phil. degrees until the end of the term in which requirements for the degree are completed (e.g., students completing degree requirements during the spring term should petition for award of the degree the following fall). Students who have not petitioned for or received en route degrees (e.g., M.A., M.S., M.Phil.) will automatically be considered for such degrees in the term following advancement to candidacy. Students in terminal M.A.S./M.A./M.S. programs may petition for their degrees in the term in which they expect to complete them. Commencement http://gsas.yale.edu/academics/commencement GScommencement@yale.edu There is only one University Commencement ceremony each year, in May. All degrees awarded for both December and May of each academic year are presented at the May ceremony. Graduating students must complete the Commencement form found at the site listed above by mid-April each year in order to attend the GSAS diploma ceremony in person, or, alternatively, to receive the diploma by mail. Academic Regulations Registration Only registered students may attend classes, receive nancial aid, or use the facilities of the University. Students must register every term for the duration of their degree program (normally six years or less for Ph.D. programs and one or two years for students in M.A.S./M.A./M.S. programs). This regulation applies to all students, whether engaged in course work, preparation for qualifying examinations, or dissertation research, and, in the case of students in Ph.D. programs, whether study is in residence or in absentia. Students who do not register for any term for which they have not been granted a leave of absence (see Leaves of Absence, under Registration Status and Leaves of Absence, below) will be considered to have withdrawn from the Graduate School. Privileges associated with registered status (i.e., library privileges, health care coverage, and e-mail accounts) will likewise be withdrawn. Unless otherwise noted in the letter of admission, students are expected to register on a full-time basis. Part-time employment at the University or elsewhere should not conflict with the obligations of the degree program or interfere with academic progress. Part-time employment beyond an average of ten hours per week requires permission of the director of graduate studies in consultation with the appropriate associate dean. Part-time employment includes teaching outside of the Graduate School's Teaching Fellow Program. International students must consult the Oce of International Students and Scholars (OISS) regarding their eligibility for employment while in the United States.Policies and Regulations 521 No student may register for any term unless the student is making satisfactory progress toward the degree and has been cleared by the Oce of Student Financial Services to register. In compliance with Connecticut state law, no student will be allowed to register unless satisfactory evidence of immunity to measles and rubella has been presented to Yale Health (see Health Services under Yale University Resources and Services for more information). Satisfactory progress means that the student has met all Graduate School and departmental requirements normally expected for each stage of the student's program. For Ph.D. students before admission to candidacy and for M.A.S./M.A./M.S. students, this includes satisfactory completion of courses from the preceding term(s). As indicated in the sections on Course and Honors Requirements and Admission to Candidacy, students in Ph.D. programs must satisfy the Honors requirement before beginning the h term of study and must be admitted to candidacy by the appropriate time. In addition to satisfying these general Graduate School requirements, students must meet any additional requirements specied by their departments. Students who fail to make satisfactory progress may be placed on a probationary status pending satisfactory completion of requirements. Ph.D. students who have been admitted to candidacy must continue to demonstrate satisfactory progress toward the degree in the annual Dissertation Progress Report (DPR). Students who fail to meet departmental or Graduate School requirements by the designated deadlines, and students who have been admitted to candidacy who fail to submit the annual DPR, will be administratively withdrawn. Students must register each term until the dissertation is submitted or until six years (twelve terms) of study have been completed. Registered students who submit dissertations will remain registered until the end of the term (i.e., through December for those submitting during the fall term, through May for those submitting before the spring degree deadline, and through August for those submitting aer the spring degree deadline) and will retain all privileges of registration (e.g., library privileges, health care coverage, and e-mail accounts). Students who complete all Ph.D. requirements within four continuous years of full-time study in the Ph.D. program will be registered and charged full tuition only through the term in which the dissertation is submitted. Students who have registered part-time or taken a leave of absence must complete the four-year, full-tuition obligation, regardless of when they submit the dissertation. Students are expected to complete the dissertation within six years of study or less. Students who have not submitted the dissertation by the end of the sixth year of study may do so subsequently, at the discretion of the department, without registering or may request a period of extended registration by submitting the petition for extended registration, which includes the standard DPR that is required annually by May 1 of all students admitted to candidacy. Before a seventh year of registration is approved, the student and the student's adviser, as well as the director of graduate studies, must complete a report that species the progress the student has already made in writing the dissertation and that also includes a detailed plan for completing the dissertation in the seventh year. Very rarely, students may request an eighth year of registration due to serious circumstances beyond their control that have prevented them from completing the dissertation by the end of the seventh year of study. Students who522 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 receive extended registration must register online each term and are normally expected to be in residence. Alternatively, a doctoral student who is not eligible for full-time registration may request to enroll with the status \"Dissertation Completion.\" This part-time status enables advanced students to maintain an active NetID in order to access electronic library resources and their Yale e-mail accounts while completing their dissertations under the supervision of a member of the Graduate School faculty. A student may hold this status for a maximum of four consecutive terms and will be charged the Continuous Registration Fee in each term for which it is approved. Students on this status are not eligible to teach in the Teaching Fellow Program or to purchase health coverage as Yale aliates. Once a student enters this status, the student may not petition to register as a full-time student in a subsequent term. Noncumulative registration In certain areas of study it may be necessary for a registered student to acquire an academic or methodological skill, such as knowledge of a foreign language, that is essential for a degree requirement or for research in a particular eld and for the overall progress of the dissertation, but is not an inherent part of the dissertation itself. A student may request up to one year of \"noncumulative registration.\" General study in a eld related to or parallel with the topic of the dissertation is not appropriate for noncumulative registration. A student who wishes to have a specic period of study designated as \"noncumulative\" must discuss the reasons for such a period of study with and secure prior approval from the associate dean for graduate student advising and academic support. If prior authorization has been given by the Graduate School, the period of time spent in acquiring the necessary academic skill will not be counted as part of the student's six- year period of registration. Noncumulative registration does not aect the four-year full-tuition obligation. The tuition charge and any University stipend will be postponed if a student registers noncumulatively before the four-year full-tuition obligation has been satised. While registered noncumulatively, students pay the Continuous Registration Fee and doctoral students continue to receive the Health Award from the Graduate School. Part-time study Students in Ph.D. programs are expected to register for full-time study. In extraordinary circumstances a student may petition the Graduate School for permission to register as a half-time student for a limited period. Students may not register for half-time study for more than three of the rst four academic years they are enrolled. Thereaer they must register full-time until the four-year tuition obligation has been satised. Any Ph.D. student who registers half-time at any point in the graduate program must fulll the four-year tuition obligation to receive the Ph.D. (see below). Ph.D. students may not register less than half-time. Students who wish to study part-time should consult with their director of graduate studies and the appropriate associate dean to develop a proposed plan of study, so that both the student and the Graduate School have a common understanding about the time by which the requirements leading to admission to candidacy must be completed. Such a plan of study may be modied with the consent of the director of graduate studies and the associate dean.Policies and Regulations 523 Course Enrollment Any student who wishes to enroll in courses during a term must register through the online course selection process. The deadlines for registration each term are listed in the Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines. Students who submit course enrollment forms aer the appropriate deadline will be assessed a fee. No student may attend any class unless ocially registered in the course. No credit will be given for work done in any course for which a student is not ocially registered, even if the student entered the course with the approval of the instructor and the director of graduate studies. Graduate students who wish to register for courses that are oered on both the graduate and undergraduate levels must register with the graduate-level course number (i.e., 500 or higher) in order to receive credit toward their degrees. In rare instances, a graduate student may be granted permission to register for an undergraduate course that will count toward the fulllment of course requirements for the student's graduate degree. In such cases, the student must le an approved Graduate Credit Request form (http://gsas.yale.edu/sites/default/les/ les-forms/credit_request_form.pdf) with the Registrar's Oce by the end of the registration period. Graduate students may not utilize the \"Credit/D/Fail\" option within the Yale College grading scale. Students enrolling in courses oered by a Yale professional school are subject to all policies and deadlines of both the professional school and the Graduate School. Graduate students taking a course through the School of Management and the Law School must also obtain written permission from the respective schools' registrars to be ocially enrolled. Permission must be obtained within two weeks of the close of registration at the Graduate School. A student who wishes to audit a course must receive permission from the instructor (as not all faculty permit auditors in their classes) and register for the course as an auditor. The minimum general requirement for auditing is attendance in two-thirds of the class sessions; instructors may set additional requirements for auditing their classes. Audited courses appear on the student's transcript. Course Changes Once the online course selection process has closed for a given term, all subsequent changes must be made using the Course Schedule Change Notication Form, approved by the student's director of graduate studies and then led with the registrar. If a student is enrolled in a professional school course, all changes in enrollment status must be reported to the registrar of that school as well as to the Graduate School. Forms for reporting changes to the Graduate School are available at the Graduate School Student Information Oce (Warner House, 1 Hillhouse Ave.), through the student's department, or online at http://gsas.yale.edu/forms. The dates for changing enrollment in a course from Credit to Audit or Audit to Credit and for withdrawing from a course are listed in the Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines. If a student ocially withdraws from a course by the stated deadline, the course will be removed from the student's transcript. If a student ceases to participate in a course without ocially withdrawing from that course by the stated deadline, it is at the instructor's discretion to assign an appropriate qualitative grade or a grade of \"Incomplete.\"524 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Grades The grades assigned in the Graduate School are: H Honors HP High Pass P Pass F Fail TI Temporary Incomplete I Incomplete A mark of \"Y\" is assigned as the grade for the rst term of a full-year course and will be converted to a standard grade once both terms are completed, depending on the number of credits the course fullls. Marks of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory may be assigned only when the department sponsoring the course has designated such marks. In such cases, the grading mode is the same for all students enrolled in the course. The Graduate School does not calculate grade-point averages, nor does it assign numerical or letter equivalents to Graduate School grades. Grades assigned according to grading scales other than those described above will be returned to the instructor for conversion. If a student retakes a course, both grades remain on the transcript, but only the higher grade is counted toward the program requirements. The Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines indicates the dates on which grades are due for the current year. Instructors have the responsibility for assigning dates for submission of course work to meet these grade deadlines. If a student and instructor have agreed that an extension is appropriate, the student must submit to the Registrar's Oce a request for the Temporary Incomplete (TI) (available on the Graduate School website at http://gsas.yale.edu/forms) with the intended completion date, signed by the instructor and the director of graduate studies. Only one TI in a single term is permitted. Temporary Incompletes received in an academic year must be converted to nal grades by October 1 of the following academic year. If a grade is not received by the registrar by this date, the TI will be converted to a permanent Incomplete (I) on the student's record. In certain extraordinary circumstances, such as serious illness or a family emergency, and on the recommendation of the student's department, the associate dean may grant an additional extension. A written request for such an extension must be made by the director of graduate studies on the student's behalf within two weeks of the grade submission deadline. The request should indicate the special circumstances and suggest a date by which the student will complete the work. If the request is approved, the associate dean will inform the student and instructor. If the grade is submitted to the registrar by the new deadline approved by the associate dean, it will replace the Temporary Incomplete. If a grade is not received by the registrar by this date, a Temporary Incomplete (TI) will be converted to a permanent Incomplete (I) on the student's record. \"Provisional\" or \"temporary\" grades (as opposed to Incompletes) are not permitted. Once submitted to the Registrar's Oce, a grade may be changed only in cases ofPolicies and Regulations 525 arithmetical or clerical error on the part of the instructor and only with the approval of the appropriate associate dean. If the registrar has not received a given grade from an instructor within two weeks of the stated deadline for the submission of grades, the student will be assigned a grade of \"Incomplete\" for that course. Students are reminded that the policies stated above are the Graduate School minimum general requirements. Departments or individual instructors may have more stringent policies, and students should consult their departmental handbooks or directors of graduate studies about such requirements. Registration Status and Leaves of Absence Registration in Residence Students who are studying on campus, attending classes, and using University facilities are considered to be in residence. All M.A.S./M.A./M.S. and nondegree (DSR) students must register in residence each term, as do most students in Ph.D. programs (see also Registration in Absentia and Continuous Registration Fee, below). Students who will be in residence during any term are required to register through the online course selection process during the normal registration period at the beginning of that term (see the Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines). A fee will be charged to students who register in residence aer the close of the registration period. Late fees may be waived only if the registrar receives written notication from the student or director of graduate studies before the start of the registration period that the student will register late because of participation in an academic program, such as a summer language course or professional meeting, that coincides with the registration period. A student who cannot register during the registration period because of a sudden serious illness or family emergency should contact the deputy registrar (246 Church St.) as soon as possible. Registration in Absentia Ph.D. students whose program of study requires full-time dissertation research, full- time eldwork, or full-time study at another academic institution outside the New Haven area may request to be registered in absentia. Such registration requires the recommendation of the director of graduate studies. Forms for requesting registration in absentia may be obtained online at http://gsas.yale.edu/forms and should be led at least one month before the beginning of the term during which the student expects to be studying away from New Haven. A student who has not completed the three-year residence requirement will be permitted to register in absentia for compelling academic reasons only, and normally only if the student has completed all other predissertation requirements. Registration in absentia does not reduce the four-year full-tuition or three-year residence requirements. For additional information, see Eligibility for Fellowships under Financing Graduate School. Students who are enrolled in Yale Health and are registering in absentia should consult the sta of the Member Services Department at Yale Health about the policies governing coverage while they are away from New Haven. The Graduate School funds travel insurance for students who have been approved to pursue degree-related activities outside the United States. Such students should register their locations at526 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 http://world.yale.edu/travel to facilitate communication with the University in case of an emergency. Continuous Registration Fee Ph.D. students who have completed the tuition and residence requirements described above must continue to register each term through the sixth year whether in residence or in absentia, or until they submit the dissertation, whichever occurs rst. Students who have met the tuition requirement are charged a Continuous Registration Fee (CRF) for each term in which they remain registered. Students who are granted permission to register beyond the sixth year are also charged the CRF. The Graduate School will cover the cost of the CRF for Ph.D. students registered full-time in year seven and beyond for any term in which they serve as Teaching Fellows. Summer Registration Ph.D. students receive funding and are expected to continue full-time independent study or research during the summer. Continuing students who were registered during the preceding spring term remain registered through August 31. Ph.D. students who wish to interrupt their studies during the summer (e.g., to accept an internship) must notify their associate dean prior to May 15. Many M.A./M.S. students continue full- or half-time independent study or research during the summer. Continuing students who were registered during the preceding spring term remain registered through August 31. Students can obtain verication of summer registration from the Registrar's Oce. Summer Internships Normally, students who take time o from their studies to work full-time must take a leave of absence for the term or terms in which they are employed. However, certain summer internship opportunities may be benecial to a student's academic development and career prospects. Therefore, under certain circumstances students may be permitted to remain registered at Yale while engaged in summer internships. To be eligible, the internship must meet several requirements: Continuous registration while participating in an internship requires the permission of the director of graduate studies. The internship should serve one of two functions: either the student is learning and developing techniques or acquiring data that will be used in the dissertation, or the internship is exposing the student to a potential eld of employment following completion of the Ph.D. The internship must start aer the end of the spring term, and be completed before the start of the fall term. If an internship opportunity overlaps with the fall or spring term, students must request a leave of absence. Students participating in a summer internship normally forgo their summer funding from Yale. The sole exception is if the internship is unpaid and the student is generating data that will be used in the dissertation, or obtaining technical or methodological skills necessary for the dissertation. In this case, the student may request to receive summer support from Yale. In most cases, funding will terminate at the end of May and resume on September 1.Policies and Regulations 527 Students will be limited to two summer internship opportunities. If a student wishes to pursue additional internships, the student must apply for a leave of absence. Students will remain registered full-time and will continue to receive the Health Award and other benets of registration. Internships do not stop a student's \"academic clock.\" Students wishing to pursue internships undertaken primarily for exposure to potential elds of employment are eligible to do so only aer they have advanced to candidacy. To apply for a summer internship: 1.Complete the Request for Summer Internship form. Submit this form with a letter to the director of graduate studies describing the nature of the internship and work to be done. Include the name of the employer, location and dates of employment, contact information, and salary or benets provided by the internship. If the internship restricts the student's rights to use and publish information produced during the experience, a copy of the employer's intellectual property rights agreement or proprietary data agreement should also be submitted. Explain the goals of the internship and how this experience will advance the dissertation research or promote career goals. 2.With the form and letter, students should submit a research plan for the coming year that describes their goals, steps for achieving those goals, and the role of the internship in their plans. Students who have been admitted to candidacy and who have included the internship in their annual Dissertation Progress Report (DPR) may refer to the DPR instead of submitting a new research plan. 3.The student's adviser must include a letter of support explaining how the student will benet from this internship. 4.The director of graduate studies should recommend or disapprove the plan. Recommended plans should be forwarded to the associate dean for nal review. The director of graduate studies should certify that the type of experience gained is consistent with the educational goals of the department. 5.International students wishing to pursue internships should contact OISS eight to ten weeks prior to the start of the proposed internship, as they will require permission for \"practical training\" from the U.S. government. Leaves of Absence Students who wish or need to interrupt their study temporarily may request a leave of absence. There are three types of leave\u2014personal, medical, and parental\u2014all of which are described below. The general policies that apply to all types of leave are: 1.All leaves of absence must be approved by the appropriate associate dean on the recommendation of the department. Medical leaves also require the written recommendation of a Yale Health chief physician or their designee, as described below. 2.Students in Ph.D. programs may be granted a leave for one term or one academic year. A leave extends the eligibility for fellowship aid by a time equal to the duration of the leave, but not for partial terms. The expected last date of registration will be adjusted by one term for each term of the leave.528 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Students in one-year M.A.S./M.A./M.S. programs may be on leave for a maximum of one term. Students in two-year M.A./M.S. programs may be on leave for a maximum total of one year. In exceptional circumstances renewal of a one-term or one-year leave, to a cumulative maximum total of two years of personal and medical leave, may be granted for students in Ph.D. programs. Leaves of absence for students in M.A.S./ M.A./M.S. programs are not renewable. The duration of a parental leave is one term or one year, renewable for each birth or adoption event. 3.International students who apply for a leave of absence must consult with OISS regarding their visa status. 4.Students on leave may complete outstanding work in courses for which they have been granted approved Incompletes. They may not, however, fulll any other degree requirements during the time on leave. (Students who intend to work toward the degree while away from the University must request registration in absentia.) Students who in fact make progress toward the degree while on leave will have their registration changed retroactively to in absentia for the period of the leave. 5.A leave of absence does not exempt the student from meeting the tuition requirement (payment of eight terms of full tuition in Ph.D. programs, or the appropriate established tuition charge in M.A.S./M.A./M.S. programs) or from paying the Continuous Registration Fee (if appropriate), but merely postpones the required charges. 6.A student on leave of absence is not eligible for nancial aid, including loans; and in most cases, student loans are not deferred during periods of nonenrollment. 7.A student on leave of absence is not eligible for the use of any University facilities normally available to enrolled students. 8.A student on leave of absence may continue to be enrolled in Yale Health by purchasing coverage through the Student Aliate Coverage plan. In order to secure continuous coverage from Yale Health, enrollment in this plan must be requested prior to the beginning of the term in which the student will be on leave or, if the leave commences during the term, within thirty days of the date the registrar was notied of the leave. Coverage is not automatic; enrollment forms are available from the Member Services Department of Yale Health, 203.432.0246. 9.Students living in University housing units are encouraged to review their housing contract and the related policies of the Graduate Housing Oce before applying to the Graduate School for a leave of absence. 10.Students on leave of absence do not have to le a formal application for readmission. However, they must notify the registrar in writing of their intention to return. Such notication should be given at least eight weeks prior to the end of the approved leave. 11.Students who fail to register for the term following the end of the approved leave will be administratively withdrawn from the Graduate School. Personal leave of absence A student who wishes or needs to interrupt study temporarily because of personal exigencies may request a personal leave of absence. The general policies governing all leaves of absence are described above. A student who is currentPolicies and Regulations 529 with degree requirements is eligible for a personal leave aer satisfactory completion of at least one term of study. Normally, students in Ph.D. programs are not eligible for personal leaves aer the fourth year of study. In certain exceptional cases, however, personal leaves may be granted to students beyond the fourth year of study. Personal leaves cannot be granted retroactively and normally will not be approved aer the tenth day of a term. To request a personal leave of absence, the student must complete the appropriate form (available online at http://gsas.yale.edu/forms) before the beginning of the term for which the leave is requested, explaining the reasons for the proposed leave and stating both the proposed start and end dates of the leave and the address at which the student can be reached during the period of the leave. If the dean nds the student to be eligible and the department approves, the leave will be granted. In any case, the student will be informed in writing of the action taken. Students who do not apply for a personal leave of absence, or whose application for a personal leave is denied, and who do not register for any term, will be administratively withdrawn from the Graduate School. Medical leave of absence A student who must interrupt study temporarily because of illness or injury may be granted a medical leave of absence with the approval of the appropriate associate dean, on the written recommendation of a Yale Health chief physician or their designee. A student who wishes to take a medical leave of absence may request it from a physician at Yale Health or from the student's associate dean. The general policies governing all leaves of absence are described above. A student who is making satisfactory progress toward degree requirements is eligible for a medical leave any time aer matriculation. The nal decision concerning a request for a medical leave of absence will be communicated in writing by the appropriate associate dean. The Graduate School reserves the right to require a student to take a leave for medical reasons when, on recommendation of the director of Yale Health or the chief of the Mental Health and Counseling department, an associate dean of the Graduate School determines that the student is a danger to self or others because of a serious medical problem, or that the student has refused to cooperate with eorts deemed necessary by Yale Health to determine if the student is such a danger. An appeal of such a leave must be made in writing to the dean of the Graduate School no later than seven days from the eective date of the leave. A student who is placed on medical leave during any term will have tuition adjusted according to the same schedule used for withdrawals (see Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines). Before re-registering, a student on medical leave must secure written permission to return from a Yale Health chief physician or their designee. Eligible Ph.D. students will receive a Health Award from the Graduate School to cover the cost of the Student Aliate Coverage plan for the remainder of the coverage period in which the medical leave is started, if they apply for this coverage through Yale Health within thirty days of the start of their leave. Leave of absence for parental responsibilities A student who wishes or needs to interrupt study temporarily for reasons of pregnancy, maternity care, or paternity care may be granted a leave of absence for parental responsibilities. The general policies governing all leaves of absence are described above. A student who is making530 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 satisfactory progress toward degree requirements is eligible for parental leave any time aer matriculation. Eligible Ph.D. students will receive a Health Award from the Graduate School to cover the cost of the Student Aliate Coverage plan for the remainder of the coverage period in which the parental leave is started, if they apply for this coverage through Yale Health within thirty days of the start of their leave. Students granted a parental leave may continue to reside in University housing to the end of the academic term for which the leave was rst granted, but no longer. Parental Support and Relief Registered Ph.D. students who wish to modify their academic responsibilities because of the birth or adoption of a child may request parental support and relief during or following the term in which the birth or adoption occurs. For the whole of the term in which the support and relief are granted, the student's academic clock stops, eectively adding an additional term to the total time to degree. During this period, students remain registered full-time, receive a standard nancial aid stipend and Health Award, and receive modied departmental academic expectations that best suit the specic situation. The precise nature of the academic responsibilities undertaken or suspended during this period should be a matter of consultation between the adviser and the student, with the understanding that students are entitled to full relief from responsibilities for at least an eight-week period. Most students take an entire term of parental relief, but the relief may be split in two, with a student taking only eight weeks of relief during the term in which, or just aer, a birth or adoption occurs and then receiving an additional eight weeks of stipend funded by the Graduate School postponed to a later term. Parental relief may not be combined with other funding. To arrange for parental relief, a student should contact the associate dean for student progress four months prior to a birth or adoption. This benet is limited to two birth or adoption events. If both parents are graduate students at Yale, only one student may receive this benet per birth or adoption event, though the second student may consult with the associate dean for graduate student advising and academic support regarding a modication of academic responsibilities. Graduate students in terminal M.A.S./M.A./M.S. programs may modify their academic responsibilities because of the birth or adoption of a child. They should contact the associate dean the term before the planned modications would occur. Withdrawal and Readmission A student may withdraw from a program of study voluntarily or may be withdrawn for cause. A student who wishes to terminate a program of study should confer with the director of graduate studies and the appropriate associate dean regarding withdrawal; their signatures on an ocial withdrawal form (available on the Graduate School website at http://gsas.yale.edu/forms) are required. The associate dean will determine the eective date of the withdrawal, upon consultation with the department. The University identication card must be submitted with the approved withdrawal form in order for withdrawal to be recorded.Policies and Regulations 531 Students who are not in academic good standing will be withdrawn for cause, unless an extension or exception has been granted by the appropriate dean or the Degree Committee. Such withdrawals will be noted on the student's transcript. Students who do not register for any fall or spring term, and for whom a leave of absence has not been approved by the appropriate associate dean, will be administratively withdrawn from the Graduate School. A student who discontinues a program of study during the academic year without submitting an approved withdrawal form and the University identication card will be liable for the tuition charge (or Continuous Registration Fee) for the term in which the withdrawal occurs. Tuition charges for students who withdraw will be adjusted as described in the Schedule of Academic Dates and Deadlines. The Continuous Registration Fee for the term is not canceled if a student withdraws aer the fourteenth day of the term. Health service policies related to withdrawal and readmission are described under Health Services, below. Only students who have withdrawn from the Graduate School in good standing may apply for readmission. Normally, students seeking readmission must do so within three years of the original withdrawal. Neither readmission nor nancial aid is guaranteed to students who withdraw. The deadline for making application for readmission is January 2 of the year in which the student wishes to return to the Graduate School. The student's application will be considered by the department, which will make a recommendation for review by the appropriate associate dean. The student's remaining tuition obligation will be determined at the time of readmission. Students may seek readmission only once. If subsequent to a readmission they must again withdraw, they are ineligible for readmission. U.S. Military Leave Readmissions Policy Students who wish or need to interrupt their studies to perform U.S. military service are subject to a separate U.S. military leave readmissions policy. In the event a student withdraws or takes a leave of absence from the Graduate School to serve in the U.S. military, the student will be entitled to guaranteed readmission under the following conditions: 1.The student must have served in the U.S. Armed Forces for a period of more than thirty consecutive days. 2.The student must give advance written or oral notice of such service to the appropriate dean. In providing the advance notice the student does not need to indicate an intent to return. This advance notice need not come directly from the student, but rather, can be made by an appropriate ocer of the U.S. Armed Forces or ocial of the U.S. Department of Defense. Notice is not required if precluded by military necessity. In all cases, this notice requirement can be fullled at the time the student seeks readmission, by submitting an attestation that the student performed the service. 3.The student must not be away from the Graduate School to perform U.S. military service for a period exceeding ve years (this includes all previous absences to perform U.S. military service but does not include any initial period of obligated service). If a student's time away from the Graduate School to perform U.S. military service exceeds ve years because the student is unable to obtain release orders532 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 through no fault of the student or the student was ordered to or retained on active duty, the student should contact the appropriate dean to determine if the student remains eligible for guaranteed readmission. 4.The student must notify the Graduate School within three years of the end of the U.S. military service of the intention to return. However, a student who is hospitalized or recovering from an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the U.S. military service has up until two years aer recovering from the illness or injury to notify the Graduate School of the intent to return. 5.The student cannot have received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or have been sentenced in a court-martial. A student who meets all of these conditions will be readmitted for the next term, unless the student requests a later date of readmission. Any student who fails to meet one of these requirements may still be readmitted under the general readmission policy but is not guaranteed readmission. Upon returning to the Graduate School, the student will resume education without repeating completed course work for courses interrupted by U.S. military service. The student will have the same enrolled status last held and with the same academic standing. For the rst academic year in which the student returns, the student will be charged the tuition and fees that would have been assessed for the academic year in which the student le the institution. Yale may charge up to the amount of tuition and fees other students are assessed, however, if veteran's education benets will cover the dierence between the amounts currently charged other students and the amount charged for the academic year in which the student le. In the case of a student who is not prepared to resume studies with the same academic status at the same point at which the student le or who will not be able to complete the program of study, the Graduate School will undertake reasonable eorts to help the student become prepared. If aer reasonable eorts, the Graduate School determines that the student remains unprepared or will be unable to complete the program, or aer the Graduate School determines that there are no reasonable eorts it can take, the Graduate School may deny the student readmission. Personal Conduct Yale University is an academic community dedicated to the advancement of learning. Its members freely associate themselves with the University and in doing so arm their commitment to a philosophy of tolerance and respect for all members of the community. They pledge to help sustain the intellectual integrity of the University and to uphold its standards of honesty, free expression, and inquiry. They are expected to abide by the regulations of the University. They are also expected to obey local, state, and federal laws, and violations of these may be cause for discipline by the Graduate School. Students are required to report misdemeanor and felony charges to their associate dean. The Graduate School specically prohibits the following forms of behavior by graduate students: 1.Cheating on examinations, problem sets, and any other form of test; also, falsication and/or fabrication of data.Policies and Regulations 533 2.Plagiarism, that is, the failure in a dissertation, essay, or other written exercise to acknowledge ideas, research, or language taken from others. 3.Multiple submission of the same work without obtaining explicit written permission from both instructors before the material is submitted. 4.Misuse of the materials or facilities of the University library. 5.Unauthorized use of University services, equipment, or facilities, such as telephones and photocopying equipment. 6.Violation of University rules for using information technology services and facilities, including computers, the University network, soware systems, and electronic mail. (See Information Technology Appropriate Use Policy, online at https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1607-information-technology- appropriate-use-policy.) 7.Assault on, or coercion, harassment, or intimidation of, any member of the University community, including harassment on the basis of race, religion, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation; sexual harassment; or the use of a teaching position to harass or intimidate another student. 8.Engaging in a relationship with a student while serving as the student's teaching fellow or in any other direct supervisory role over the student (as outlined in the University's policy prohibiting \"Teacher-Student Consensual Relationships\"). 9.Disruption of a legitimate function or activity of the University community, including disrupting classes and meetings, blocking entrances and exits to University buildings, unauthorized occupation of any space on the Yale campus, or preventing the free expression or dissemination of ideas. (See Freedom of Expression, below.) 10.Refusal to comply with the direction of a University police ocer or other University ocial, including a member of the faculty, acting in the performance of their duties. 11.Misuse, alteration, or fabrication of University credentials or documents, such as an identication card or transcript, including grade lists submitted by teaching fellows. 12.Misrepresentation or lying during a formal inquiry by University ocials. 13.Misrepresentation in applying for admission or nancial aid. 14.The, misuse of funds, or willful damage of University property. O-campus misconduct may result in disciplinary action if such conduct imperils the integrity and values of the University community. O-campus violations committed in the course of a Yale-sponsored program anywhere in the world could also be subject to disciplinary charges. 15.Trespassing on University property to which access is prohibited. 16.Possession or use of explosives, incendiary devices, or weapons on or about the campus. 17.Interference with the proper operation of safety or security devices, including re alarms, electronic doors or gates, re extinguishers, and sprinkler systems. 18.

Yale is a drug-free campus.534 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 19.Use of tobacco products on any location on campus, including outdoor spaces. Yale is a tobacco-free institution. Violations of any of the above regulations will be referred to the Graduate School Committee on Regulations and Discipline, composed of three graduate students, three faculty members, normally one from each division, and an associate dean. Violations of regulations pertaining to sexual misconduct or the University's Consensual Relations Policy will be referred to the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct. Students found guilty of such violations will be subject to one or more of the following disciplinary penalties: Reprimand Probation Suspension Dismissal Fines Restitution Restriction Penalties of suspension or dismissal will be noted on the student's transcript. Pending disciplinary charges will be noted on a student's transcript if the student withdraws from the Graduate School aer being formally charged but before such charges have been resolved. A student who has petitioned for a degree will not receive the degree while charges are pending or while serving a suspension. A student who has been dismissed for a disciplinary violation may petition for a degree, to be awarded at the discretion of the Degree Committee, based on work completed before the infraction occurred. A student dismissed for academic misconduct will not receive a degree from the Graduate School regardless of requirements fullled before the infraction occurred. The Graduate School reserves the right to impose nes as appropriate, in addition to requiring payment for costs resulting from or associated with the oenses. In addition to imposing these penalties for oenses subject to disciplinary action, the University may refer students for prosecution, and students found guilty of unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs or alcohol on University property or as part of any University activity may be required to complete an appropriate rehabilitation program. Copies of the procedures of the Committee on Regulations and Discipline may be obtained from the oce of each of the associate deans of the Graduate School or via the Graduate School website (http://gsas.yale.edu/academic-professional-development/ professional-ethics-regulations/student-grievances). The deans may be consulted for further information and advice. A copy of the procedures is sent automatically to any student who is charged with a violation of the Graduate School's regulations. Grievance Procedures To address complaints and grievances of various kinds, the Graduate School maintains a set of procedures. Copies of the grievance procedures of the Graduate School may be obtained from the oce of each of the associate deans of the Graduate School or via the Graduate School website (http://gsas.yale.edu/academic-professional-development/ professional-ethics-regulations/student-grievances). The deans may be consulted for further information and advice.Policies and Regulations 535 The Graduate School Procedure for Student Complaints This procedure governs most student complaints, including, but not limited to, complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, disability, or sexual orientation, against a member of the faculty or administration of the Graduate School. Complaints that involve a misapplication of Graduate School policy are also appropriate for consideration by the Dean's Advisory Committee on Student Grievances. Complaints that require an emendation of policy will be referred to the Graduate School Executive Committee. Complaints of sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment and sexual assault, may be brought to a Title IX Coordinator or to the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct (UWC). For more information on the University's Title IX Coordinators or the UWC, please see Resources on Sexual Misconduct under Yale University Resources and Services. Provost's Procedure The Provost's Procedure governs most student complaints, including, but not limited to, complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, disability, or sexual orientation, against a faculty member who is not a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, or against an employee who is not an administrator in the Graduate School or who is not subject to discipline by the student's dean. This procedure is available at www.yale.edu/equalopportunity/ grievance. Complaints of sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment and sexual assault, may be brought to a Title IX Coordinator or to the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct (UWC). For more information on the University's Title IX Coordinators or the UWC, please see Resources on Sexual Misconduct under Yale University Resources and Services. Freedom of Expression The Yale Graduate School is committed to the protection of free inquiry and expression in the classroom and throughout the school community. In this, the School reflects the University's commitment to and policy on freedom of expression as eloquently stated in the Woodward Report (Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression at Yale, 1974), which states, in part: The primary function of a university is to discover and disseminate knowledge by means of research and teaching. To fulll this function a free interchange of ideas is necessary not only within its walls but with the world beyond as well. It follows that the university must do everything possible to ensure within it the fullest degree of intellectual freedom. The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly demonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable. To curtail free expression strikes twice at intellectual freedom, for whoever deprives another of the right to state unpopular views necessarily also deprives others of the right to listen to those views. We take a chance, as the First Amendment takes a chance, when we commit ourselves to the idea that the results of free expression are to the general benet in the long run, however unpleasant they may appear at the time. The validity of such a belief cannot be demonstrated conclusively. It is a belief of recent historical536 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 development, even within universities, one embodied in American constitutional doctrine but not widely shared outside the academic world, and denied in theory and in practice by much of the world most of the time. Because few other institutions in our society have the same central function, few assign such high priority to freedom of expression. Few are expected to. Because no other kind of institution combines the discovery and dissemination of basic knowledge with teaching, none confronts quite the same problems as a university. For if a university is a place for knowledge, it is also a special kind of small society. Yet it is not primarily a fellowship, a club, a circle of friends, a replica of the civil society outside it. Without sacricing its central purpose, it cannot make its primary and dominant value the fostering of friendship, solidarity, harmony, civility, or mutual respect. To be sure, these are important values; other institutions may properly assign them the highest, and not merely a subordinate, priority; and a good university will seek and may in some signicant measure attain these ends. But it will never let these values, important as they are, override its central purpose. We value freedom of expression precisely because it provides a forum for the new, the provocative, the disturbing, and the unorthodox. Free speech is a barrier to the tyranny of authoritarian or even majority opinion as to the rightness or wrongness of particular doctrines or thoughts. If the priority assigned to free expression by the nature of a university is to be maintained in practice, clearly the responsibility for maintaining that priority rests with its members. By voluntarily taking up membership in a university and thereby asserting a claim to its rights and privileges, members also acknowledge the existence of certain obligations upon themselves and their fellows. Above all, every member of the university has an obligation to permit free expression in the university. No member has a right to prevent such expression. Every ocial of the university, moreover, has a special obligation to foster free expression and to ensure that it is not obstructed. The strength of these obligations, and the willingness to respect and comply with them, probably depend less on the expectation of punishment for violation than they do on the presence of a widely shared belief in the primacy of free expression. Nonetheless, we believe that the positive obligation to protect and respect free expression shared by all members of the university should be enforced by appropriate formal sanctions, because obstruction of such expression threatens the central function of the university. We further believe that such sanctions should be made explicit, so that potential violators will be aware of the consequences of their intended acts. In addition to the university's primary obligation to protect free expression there are also ethical responsibilities assumed by each member of the university community, along with the right to enjoy free expression. Though these are much more dicult to state clearly, they are of great importance. If freedom of expression is to serve its purpose and thus the purpose of the university, it should seek to enhance understanding. Shock, hurt, and anger are not consequences to be weighed lightly. No member of the community with a decent respect for others should use, or encourage others to use, slurs and epithets intended to discredit another's race, ethnic group, religion, or sex. It may sometimes be necessaryPolicies and Regulations 537 in a university for civility and mutual respect to be superseded by the need to guarantee free expression. The values superseded are nevertheless important, and every member of the university community should consider them in exercising the fundamental right to free expression. We have considered the opposing argument that behavior which violates these social and ethical considerations should be made subject to formal sanctions, and the argument that such behavior entitles others to prevent speech they might regard as oensive. Our conviction that the central purpose of the university is to foster the free access of knowledge compels us to reject both of these arguments. They assert a right to prevent free expression. They rest upon the assumption that speech can be suppressed by anyone who deems it false or oensive. They deny what Justice Holmes termed \"freedom for the thought that we hate.\" They make the majority, or any willful minority, the arbiters of truth for all. If expression may be prevented, censored, or punished, because of its content or because of the motives attributed to those who promote it, then it is no longer free. It will be subordinated to other values that we believe to be of lower priority in a university. The conclusions we draw, then, are these: even when some members of the university community fail to meet their social and ethical responsibilities, the paramount obligation of the university is to protect their right to free expression. This obligation can and should be enforced by appropriate formal sanctions. If the university's overriding commitment to free expression is to be sustained, secondary social and ethical responsibilities must be le to the informal processes of suasion, example, and argument.

Students can grant others proxy access to the eBill-ePay system to view the monthly student account statements and make online payments. For more information, see http://sfas.yale.edu/proxy-access-and-authorization. Bills for tuition, room, and board are available during the rst week of July, due and payable by August 1 for the fall term; and during the rst week of November, due and payable by December 1 for the spring term. The Oce of Student Financial Services will impose late fees of $125 per month (up to a total of $375 per term) if any part of the term bill, less Yale-administered loans and scholarships that have been applied for on a timely basis, is not paid when due. Nonpayment of bills and failure to complete and submit nancial aid application packages on a timely basis may result in the student's involuntary withdrawal from the University. No degrees will be conferred and no transcripts will be furnished until all bills due the University are paid in full. In addition, transcripts will not be furnished to any student or former student who is in default on the payment of a student loan. The University may withhold registration and certain University privileges from students who have not paid their term bills or made satisfactory payment arrangements by the day of registration. To avoid delay at registration, students must ensure that payments reach Student Financial Services by the due dates. Payments There are a variety of options oered for making payments. Yale University eBill- ePay (http://student-accounts.yale.edu/ebep) is the preferred means for payment of your monthly student account bill. The ePayments are immediately posted to the student account. There is no charge to use this service. Bank information is password-540 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 protected and secure, and a printable conrmation receipt is available. On bill due dates, payments using the eBill-ePay system can be made up to 4 p.m. Eastern Time in order to avoid late fees. For those who choose to pay the student account bill by check, a remittance advice and mailing instructions are included with the online bill available on the eBill-ePay website. All bills must be paid in U.S. currency. Checks must be payable in U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank. Payments can also be made via wire transfer. Instructions for wire transfer are available on the eBill-ePay website. Yale does not accept credit card payments. A processing charge of $25 will be assessed for payments rejected for any reason by the bank on which they were drawn. In addition, the following penalties may apply if a payment is rejected: 1.If the payment was for a term bill, late fees of $125 per month will be charged for the period the bill was unpaid, as noted above. 2.If the payment was for a term bill to permit registration, the student's registration may be revoked. 3.If the payment was given to settle an unpaid balance in order to receive a diploma, the University may refer the account to an attorney for collection. Yale Payment Plan The Yale Payment Plan (YPP) is a payment service that allows students and their families to pay tuition, room, and board in ten equal monthly installments throughout the year based on individual family budget requirements. It is administered by the University's Oce of Student Financial Services. The cost to enroll in the YPP is $100 per contract. The deadline for enrollment is June 25. Additional details concerning the Yale Payment Plan are available at http://student-accounts.yale.edu/ypp. Transcripts Transcripts may be ordered online through the Registrar's Oce; see https:// registrar.yale.edu/students/transcript-requests. Financial Aid Financial assistance is provided in the form of Yale University Fellowships, tuition fellowships, teaching fellowships, traineeships, and research assistantships. The nature of the assistance varies among the divisions and departments. In most departments and programs, doctoral students are guaranteed ve years of twelve-month stipend and tuition support. Applicants for admission to Ph.D. programs will automatically be considered for all Yale fellowships, traineeships, research assistantships, and teaching fellowships for which they are eligible. These awards of nancial aid are announced in letters of admission, which are usually mailed during the month of March. Applicants for admission to nondegree and terminal master's programs are required to complete the nancial statement contained in the application brochure. Students are strongly encouraged to seek nancial support from external sources (see External Fellowships and Combined Award Policy, below).Financing Graduate School 541 In addition to grants and fellowships for tuition and living costs, Yale Health Basic Coverage is provided at no cost to students enrolled at least half-time in degree- granting programs. Eligible Ph.D. students also receive a Health Award, which covers the full cost of the single-student and the Student + Child/Children Yale Health Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage (including coverage for prescriptions), half the cost of the Student + Spouse coverage, and the Student + Child/Children portion of the Student Family Plan. Eligible Ph.D. students with a child will also receive an annual Student Family Support subsidy in the amount of $4,500, issued in installments of $2,250 per term. The annual subsidy will increase by $1,000 ($500 per term) for each additional child under the age of six. The student can decide whether to use this money for spousal health insurance, childcare, or other expenses. The subsidy is one per family, not one per Ph.D. student, and midterm changes will be prorated on a case- by-case basis. Students who do not participate in Yale Health Hospitalization/Specialty Coverage will not be provided with Health Awards. The graduate dental and vision plans are options that eligible students may choose to purchase for themselves and their dependents and are not covered by the Health Award. (For further information regarding health care options through Yale Health, see Health Services under Yale University Resources and Services.) University Fellowships The Graduate School provides all Ph.D. students with a minimum level of support for ve years upon admission. Fellowships are awarded at admission to entering students on the basis of merit and recommendations made by individual departments. In most departments, the source of stipend support will change aer the rst or second year of study to a teaching fellowship or research assistantship. Students who teach when such teaching is not part of the standard departmental pattern defer their University Fellowships to a later year and do not receive more than the standard departmental stipend while teaching. Students awarded a University Fellowship may not accept any other award without the permission of the appropriate associate dean. The Graduate School is the nal authority on University Fellowships and any combination of University funding with other sources of nancial aid (see External Fellowships and Combined Award Policy, below). Dissertation Fellowships The Graduate School oers University Dissertation Fellowships (UDF) as part of its nancial aid package to eligible advanced graduate students in the humanities and social sciences once they have advanced to doctoral candidacy. Students receive the UDF when engaged in full-time research and writing, normally in the h year of study. The UDF is usually taken in consecutive terms (beginning in either the fall or spring term) and must be completed by the end of the sixth year of study. Students on the UDF may not teach in the GSAS Teaching Fellow Program, but are permitted to accept teaching positions with the Yale Summer Session or outside of the University as long as they are limited to an average of ten hours per week or less. Students who accept a Teaching Fellow position in the fall or spring of the year of nal eligibility will forfeit that term's dissertation fellowship amount. Students receiving external funding542 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 for dissertation research or writing may be eligible for a combined award and should consult the External Fellowships and Combined Award policy. Teaching Fellowships Teaching and Admission Offers Because the Graduate School considers teaching experience to be an integral part of graduate education, doctoral students receive nancial aid packages that include teaching fellowships. In many programs, there are specic years when students are expected to teach. For example, most humanities and social science students will teach in their third and fourth years. In the natural sciences, the timing of teaching is earlier or is flexible across several years. When requested by the student for compelling academic reasons, these patterns may be adjusted with the permission of the director of graduate studies contingent on the student's satisfactory academic progress and on sucient course enrollment. If the associate dean and director of graduate studies determine that no suitable teaching is available in a term in which a student is expected to teach, the student will continue to receive the standard departmental stipend that term. Stipend support will be withheld if a student elects not to teach as outlined in the student's oer of admission. In the humanities and social sciences, students may be guaranteed teaching in the sixth year of study if there are no alternate sources of funding and the director of graduate studies certies that the student will submit the dissertation by the end of the sixth year of study. Access to Teaching Fellowships When departments are considering applications for teaching fellowships, priority is given to qualied graduate students who are expected to teach as indicated in their letter of admission or who are eligible for a guaranteed sixth year teaching position. Students in years two through six who have completed their required teaching may teach if enrollments permit and as long as they have been admitted to candidacy and do not concurrently hold a dissertation fellowship. Students who are permitted to register beyond the sixth year of study may be appointed as TFs or PTAIs, but only if there is no other qualied candidate available in the rst six years of study in any department or program of the Graduate School. In cases where an appointing department must choose between two or more graduate students who are each well qualied to teach a particular course, the student or students who have not yet had a chance to teach or who have taught the least will be given preference. Limits on Teaching Except when specied in their letters of admission, rst-year doctoral students may be appointed as teaching fellows only in exceptional cases, and only aer prior approval by their director of graduate studies and the associate dean. In any year of study, the maximum amount of teaching a student in years one through six may do is one Level 20 assignment (up to twenty hours per week) or one PTAI per term. Students in the natural sciences teaching above the requirement are limited to one Level 10 assignment per term. Seventh-year students may teach up to three Level 20 assignments (up toFinancing Graduate School 543 twenty hours per week) per year. Students may not serve as faculty members while registered in the Graduate School. Students seeking TF appointments outside of their departments should discuss their plans with their director of graduate studies well in advance of the start of a term. Students with outside fellowships are eligible to serve as TFs according to the policies of the Graduate School and the conditions of their outside awards. Assignment Letters Letters of assignment are sent to graduate students via the online Teaching Fellow System (TFS) indicating the course in which a graduate student is expected to teach and the level of the assignment. An assignment is not ocial until the electronic assignment letter has been transmitted via the online TFS. Teaching Fellow Levels All teaching fellows teach at one of two eort levels. Level 10 TFs are expected to teach for 6-10 hours per week. Level 20 TFs are expected to teach for 15-20 hours per week. Science students engaged in required teaching and doctoral students in the humanities and social sciences who teach in years one through six receive the standard departmental stipend irrespective of assignment. All students, including master's and professional school students, who are teaching outside of a doctoral nancial aid package will receive $4,000 for a Level 10 assignment and $8,000 for a Level 20 assignment. Traineeships and Assistantships in Research Traineeships (National Research Service Awards) from the National Institutes of Health are available in most of the biological sciences and in some other departments. These awards support full-time Ph.D. study by U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals of the United States, and permanent residents. In combination with University and departmental supplements, they provide payment of tuition, a monthly stipend, and the hospitalization premium. Federal rules require that trainees pursue their research training on a full-time basis. In some instances, there is a federal payback provision, which is ordinarily satised by serving in health-related research or teaching at the conclusion of training. Information about this obligation and other matters relating to traineeships is available from the director of graduate studies or the principal investigator of the specic training grant in question. Research Appointments Doctoral students in departments where the faculty receive research grants or contracts may be eligible for appointments as assistants in research (AR). In most of the science departments, advanced Ph.D. students are normally supported as ARs by individual faculty research grants. An assistantship in research provides a monthly salary at a rate agreed upon by the department and the Graduate School. It is understood that the work performed not only is part of the faculty principal investigator's research project but also is the student's dissertation research and therefore in satisfaction of a degree requirement. For a standard AR appointment, in addition to the salary, the grant pays half of the tuition or all of the CRF. When the appointee is eligible for a University Fellowship, the other half of tuition is covered by a fellowship.544 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 An appointment as a project assistant (PA) is intended for a student who performs services for projects that are not a part of the student's degree program. A project assistant may normally work no more than ten hours per week. The rate of compensation is based on the department-approved rate paid to assistants in research. With the permission of the director of graduate studies and the appropriate associate dean, a student may receive a combination of project assistant and assistant in research appointments. Questions about AR or PA appointments should be directed to the director of graduate studies or the appropriate associate dean in the Graduate School. External Fellowships and Combined Award Policy To benet both their current work and their future career prospects, students are strongly encouraged to seek funding from external agencies through grants. These awards, sponsored by both public and private agencies, confer distinction on a student who wins an award in a national competition. They are oen more generous than the fellowships the University is able to provide. Students receiving external awards have two options. They may either (1) hold the outside awards in conjunction with University stipends (including research and teaching fellowships) up to the total of the standard department/program stipend plus $4,000 or (2) defer nancial support awarded in their admission oer for up to one year. Students must report to their associate dean any scholarship/fellowship received from an outside agency or organization. The dean will then assist students in considering the benets of each option. Option 1: Supplementation of an External Fellowship During the twelve-month academic year (September 1-August 31), the Graduate School's stipend award, made at the time of admission, may be used to supplement the sum of all external stipend awards to a maximum stipend equal to the total of the standard department/program stipend plus $4,000. If the sum of the Graduate School's initial stipend award and all outside awards exceeds this limit, the Graduate School's stipend award will be reduced accordingly. In instances where an external award does not cover the full twelve-month academic year, the combined award will be determined by prorating the combined award over the period when the internal and external awards overlap. Students who receive external fellowships providing yearly stipends that are more than the total of the standard department/program stipend plus $4,000 will retain the full external fellowship funding and will receive no university supplement. Option 2: Deferral of Graduate School Funding Students receiving external awards in years one through ve of study may defer up to one year of the Graduate School's stipend award made at the time of admission. Stipend awards may not be deferred beyond the sixth year of study. Eligibility for Fellowships Students who hold Yale-administered fellowships are required to be engaged in full- time study. No fellowships will be paid for any period when a student is not registered.Financing Graduate School 545 Students are not eligible for stipend support from the Graduate School aer six years of study, but they remain eligible for private (nongovernmental) student loans as long as they are enrolled at least half-time. A fellowship will be withdrawn and a stipend withheld if the recipient's activities become detrimental to the purpose for which the fellowship was granted or if a student becomes ineligible to register for any reason. Other Means of Financing Graduate Education Part-Time Employment Unless otherwise noted in the letter of admission, students are expected to register on a full-time basis. Part-time employment at the University or elsewhere should not conflict with the obligations of the degree program or interfere with academic progress. International students must consult the Oce of International Students and Scholars (OISS) regarding their eligibility for employment while in the United States. Part-time employment beyond an average of ten hours per week requires permission of the director of graduate studies in consultation with the appropriate associate dean. Students who hold student loans must report all part-time employment earnings to the Oce of Financial Aid. Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the loan(s). Loans and Work-Study U.S. citizens may be eligible to borrow through federally subsidized loan programs. Eligibility is based on federal regulations and University policies. Information is available from the Oce of Financial Aid, 246 Church St. Eligible students in the Graduate School may be able to borrow from the following federal student loan programs: Federal Direct Loans and Federal Perkins Loans. The College Work-Study (CWS) program, which is federally funded, enables eligible graduate students to meet a portion of their academic year nancial need through part- time employment. All students applying for any of these federal programs must ll out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Information on loan and work-study programs is contained in Financial Information for Entering Graduate Students, included with the student's letter of admission. These documents are available from the Oce of Financial Aid. Information and FAFSA applications are also available at the website of the United States Department of Education (https://fafsa.ed.gov). Yale currently oers a loan for international students. Features of the Yale International Loan include no requirement for a co-signer and a ten-year repayment period. Students may apply for the Yale International Loan or any other loan of their choice. Students are encouraged to identify a loan that best suits their needs.546 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Programs and Policies 2018\u20142019 Two Federal Regulations Governing Title IV Financial Aid Programs Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require that students be making satisfactory academic progress each year in order to be eligible for Title IV funding (i.e., federal loans, Javits Fellowships, and College Work-Study). The standards by which satisfactory academic progress is measured are determined by the Graduate School and by individual departments. See Degree-Granting Departments and Programs in this bulletin for more information. Department of Education Refund Policy Students receiving Title IV nancial assistance who withdraw during a term and are entitled to a refund of any University charges will have their Title IV assistance adjusted according to a formula specied by the Department of Education.

Required Immunizations Proof of vaccination is a pre-entrance requirement determined by the Connecticut State Department of Public Health. Students who are not compliant with this state regulation will not be permitted to register for classes or move into the dormitories for the fall term, 2018. Please access the Incoming Student Vaccination Record form for graduate and professional students at https://yalehealth.yale.edu/resources/forms. Connecticut state regulation requires that this form be completed and signed, for each student, by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant. The form must be completed, independent of any and all health insurance elections or coverage chosen. Once the form has been completed, the information must be entered into the Yale Medicat online system (available mid-June), and all supporting documents must be uploaded to http://yale.medicatconnect.com. The nal deadline is August 1. Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella All students who were born aer January 1, 1957, are required to provide proof of immunization against measles (rubeola), mumps, German measles (rubella), and varicella. Connecticut state regulation requires two doses of measles vaccine, two doses of mumps vaccine, two doses of rubella vaccine, and two doses of varicella vaccine. The rst dose must have been given on or aer January 1, 1980, and aer the student's rst birthday; the second dose must have been given at least thirty (30) days aer the rst dose. If dates of vaccination are not available, titer results (blood test) demonstrating immunity may be substituted for proof of vaccination. The cost for all vaccinations and/or titers rests with the student, as these vaccinations are considered to be a pre-entrance requirement by the Connecticut State Department of Public Health.

Resources on Sexual Misconduct Yale University is committed to maintaining and strengthening an educational, working, and living environment founded on civility and mutual respect. Sexual misconduct is antithetical to the standards and ideals of our community, and it is a violation of Yale policy and the disciplinary regulations of Yale College and the graduate and professional schools. Sexual misconduct incorporates a range of behaviors including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, stalking, voyeurism, and any other conduct of a sexual nature that is nonconsensual, or has the purpose or eect of threatening, intimidating, or coercing a person. Violations of Yale's Policy on Teacher-Student Consensual Relations also constitute sexual misconduct. Sexual activity requires consent, which is dened as positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specic sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter. Yale aims to eradicate sexual misconduct through education, training, clear policies, and serious consequences for violations of these policies. In addition to being subject to University disciplinary action, many forms of sexual misconduct are prohibited by Connecticut and federal law and may lead to civil liability or criminal prosecution. Yale provides a range of services, resources, and mechanisms for victims of sexual misconduct. The options for undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students are described at https://smr.yale.edu.
