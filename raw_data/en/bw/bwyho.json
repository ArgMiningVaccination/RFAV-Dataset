There ar e three prevention approaches t hat are crucial in decreasing mortality and morbidity of a disease: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. These levels of prevention were first described by Leavell and Clark 3 and continue to provide a useful framework to describe the s pectrum of prevention activities. Primary Prevention \"Primary prevention denotes action taken to prevent the development of a disease in a person who is well and does not have the disease in question\" (page 6).2 These activities include health promotion as well as disease prevention activiti es. Health promotion activities can be as simple as using appropriate hand washing techniques or can be more sophisticated such as vaccination to prevent disease occurrence. 1. Vaccines The only vaccination for TB on the market is the bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine; however, its use is rarely indicated in the United States. Before putting a vaccine on the market in the United States , the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC) along with the US Food and Drug Administration and ot her government agencies, must evaluate the vaccines efficacy, safety, contraindications, utility, and cost effectiveness. Two controlled prospective community trials before 1955 and studies done in 1947, 1950, and after 1975 using different BCG strains, found poor effica cy ranging from 0% to 80%. 4,5 In addition to poor efficacy, the BCG vaccine is not indicated in the United States because secondary prevention techniques are greatly hindered by t he BCG vaccine, which can interfere with the management of per sons who are possibly infected with M. tuberculosis . EPIDEMIOLOGY FACT SHEET 1: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Fact Sheet - TB Examples STUDENTS OR INSTRUCTORS July 23, 2009 3 Safety is another concern when evaluating a vaccine. High rates of local reaction and infection often leave a permanent scar at the site of a BCG vacci ne. Also, the estimated risk of a complication from a subcutaneous abscess is 387 per 1 million vaccinations, 0.39-0.89 million from a musculoskeletal lesion , and 0.19-1.56 per 1 million fatalities from disseminated lesions. 6 Since the resurgence of TB in the early 1990s, the BCG vaccine was again evaluated for use in the United States. Since then, the CDC has made the following recommendations6 : 1) BCG is considered for children in the United St ates who have a negative tuberculin skin test (TST) and are continually exposed to an untreat ed or ineffectively treated patient who has infectious TB and/or drug-resistant TB and c annot be isolated from the patient; 2) BCG is also considered on a case-by-case basis for health care workers in high-risk settings. Currently, new vaccines for the preventi on of TB are in the development phase.7 2. Environmental controls Another form of primary preventi on for TB is environmental contro l, such as ultraviolet lights and ventilation; however, these measures are taken mostly at hospitals and cannot be practically implemented at places where most TB transmission exists (e.g., nursing homes, prisons, in the community, etc.). 8 However, programs aimed at decreasing overcrowding can also be considered primary prevention measures for TB. Secondary Prevention \"Secondary prevention denotes the identificati on of people who have already developed a disease, at an early stage in the disease' s natural history, through screening and early intervention.\" \"The rationale for se condary prevention is that if we can identify disease earlier in its natural history, intervent ion measures will be more effect ive. Perhaps we can prevent mortality or complications of t he disease and use less invasive or less costly treatment to do so\".2 (page 6) 1. Detection of latent TB infection (LTBI) The CDC recommends a strategy to identify those who have LTBI and, if indicated, the use of chemotherapy to prevent the latent infection from progressing to active TB disease . There are two tests that can be used to help detect LTBI. a. The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) The first is a skin test in which testing mate rial, called tuberculin, is injected intradermally into the individual and in 2 to 3 days, the pat ient returns to the health care worker who checks to see if there is a reaction to the test. 8 b. QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) The second test used to identify LTBI is QFT-G, a blood test that measures how a person's system reacts to t he bacteria that causes TB. 9 EPIDEMIOLOGY FACT SHEET 1: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Fact Sheet - TB Examples STUDENTS OR INSTRUCTORS July 23, 2009 4As mentioned previously, secondary control met hods for TB are greatly hindered by the BCG vaccine. Post-vaccination BCG-induced tuberculin reactivity ranges from no induration to an induration of 19 mm at the skin- test site. Tuberculin reacti vity caused by BCG vaccination wanes with time and is unlikely to persist >10 years after vaccination in the absence of M. tuberculosis exposure and infection. Recent studies have suggested that the QFT-G is more sensitive than the TST.10 Another recent study that co mpared TST and QFT-G found that the QFT-G test was highly specific and unaffected by BCG vaccination status, a major cause of false-positive TST responses.10 Since there is no gold standard for screening tests to determine if someone has TB disease, other specialized tests such as chest X-ray and a sample of sputum may be needed. Table I is a summary of evidence comparing TST to QFT-G, a type of interferon-gamma assay. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Nahid P, Pai M, Hopewell PC. Am Thorac Soc. 2006;3:103-110. (permission pending) Secondary prevention of TB invo lves the identification and test ing of targets groups of people and communities with greater likelihood of being infected. \"Targeted tuberculin testing for LTBI is a strategic component of tuberculosis (T B) control that identifies persons at high risk for developing TB who would benefit by treatment of LTBI, if detected\". 8 Some of these high risk groups are: Health care workers who work with patients at risk of TB Those who have lived or traveled extensively in areas where TB is endemic Immunocompromised individuals Those who have had a recent posit ive conversion of a skin test Persons who live in a congregant setting (e.g. jails and nursing homes) Homeless persons EPIDEMIOLOGY FACT SHEET 1: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Fact Sheet - TB Examples STUDENTS OR INSTRUCTORS July 23, 2009 5 Another type of secondary prevent ion measure is called a contact investigation. During a contact investigation a public health worker in terviews patients with active TB disease in order to identify \"contacts\" or people who ma y have been exposed to that person. Once identified the contac ts will be evaluated for LTBI and TB disease and provided with appropriate treatment , when necessary. 2. Treatment of LTBI Patients who are identified as being infected with TB should be evaluated for active TB disease, by receiving a chest X-ray, and a focused clinical evaluation. Once active disease is excluded, one of the follo wing treatments listed in Table 2 is indicated. Table: Drug Regimens for the Treatment of LTBI Drugs Duration (months) Interval Minimum doses Isoniazid 9 Daily 270 Twice weekly* 76 Isoniazid 6 Daily 180 Twice weekly* 52 Rifampin 4 Daily 120 * Directly observed therapy (DOT) is mandatory for patient s on twice weekly (intermittent) therapy Table source: modified version of CDC table available at: http://www.cdc.gov/TB/pubs/tbfactsheets/treatmentLTBI.htm . Accessed March 19, 2008. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. TB fact sheet. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is suggested for patients with LTBI at high risk of not adhering to the prescribed therapy , and mandatory for those on twice weekly regimens. For EPIDEMIOLOGY FACT SHEET 1: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Fact Sheet - TB Examples STUDENTS OR INSTRUCTORS July 23, 2009 6DOT, a health care worker or other trained per son who is not a family member watches as the patient swallows antituberculosis medicines for at least the first 2 months of treatment. DOT thus shifts the responsibility for cure from the patient to t he health care system. Tertiary Prevention11 The treatment of people who have already developed a disease is often described as tertiary prevention. The final strategy used for prevent ing and controlling TB in the United States is identifying and treating patients with active TB . Each person with infectious TB has the potential to infect many others; however, the site of the infection is im portant in determining its capability to spread. For example, the lungs and larynx are two common organs where TB may be highly infectious. If instead, the TB in fection is localized to areas such as lymph nodes or outside the lung, treatment is necessary, ye t it is not transmissibl e and, therefore, is not a major public health concern. The treatments used for people with active TB will vary depending on whether the TB is resistant to some of the standard TB medications. Treatment can take 6 months or longer. Some of the most common drug s used to treat TB are: isoniazid (INH) rifampin (RIF) ethambutol pyrazinamide DOT is used to be sure that patients who have ac tive disease to remember to take their TB medications.
