Advancement between cohorts will be reviewed by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) and occur upon review of safety data through 7 days after the 3rd dose (approximately 2 -4 weeks between cohorts). The clinical phase of the study will last for approximately 1 year followed by another year of data analysis and report writing. Study Objectives Primary: Evaluate the safety Evaluate immune responses (serum IgG/IgA and IgG/IgA) following IM immunization with Invaplex AR-DETOX . Exploratory: Collect samples from vaccinated subjects for exploratory immunological assays. Perform secondary immunology analyses . Collect samples for evaluation of C -reactive protein (CRP) responses to the vaccine and placebo . Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 7 Study De sign This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial in which a total of 60 subjects will receive one of three doses of Invaplex AR-DETOX or placebo (saline), as shown in the table below. The vaccine will be administered via IM injection on study days 1, 22, and 43. Each subject will receive the same formulation at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. The study will be initiated with the lowest dose level (2.5 \u00b5g) and will proceed to the next highest dose in an escalating fashion. A dose -level with no occurrence of stopping criteria in the 7 days following the third vaccine dose will prompt moving to the next higher level. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed by the PSRT prior to dose -escalation. For the initial cohort, enrollment will be limited initially to 4 subjects receiving 2.5 \u00b5g of Invaplex AR-DETOX alone and 1 subject receiving placebo . If no unexpected symptoms occur within 7 days following initial vaccination, enrollment of the remaining subjects in the cohort may proceed. Cohort Group n Route Invaplex AR-DETOX (\u00b5g) A A-1 16 IM 2.5 A-2 4 IM Placebo B B-1 16 IM 10 B-2 4 IM Placebo C C-1 16 IM 25 C-2 4 IM Placebo Specimens will be collected at prescribed intervals to examine systemic and mucosal immune responses. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days following the third vaccine dose. Additionally, a telephone follow -up will be performed at 6 months follow ing receipt of the final vaccinati on to assess for adverse events. Primary Clinical Outcome The primary clinical outcome for this study is the assessment of safety and tolerability of Invaplex AR-DETOX . All subjects receiving investigational product will be included in the safety assessment. For safety laboratory data, including hematology, serology , and chemistry parameters, blood will be collected at screening and study days as per the Time and Events Schedule ( Table 8). Post - vaccination safety monitoring will include laboratory and clinical evaluations following each vaccine/placebo administration, including assessment of post - vaccination local and systemic reactions through targeted physica l exams, symptom surveys , symptom diaries , and other adverse event (AE) monitoring. Immunology Outcomes Primary Immunology Outcomes : The primary immunological outcomes will be Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) and antibody (IgG and IgA) titers against Invaplex using methods previously established. Seroconversion will be defined as a 4 -fold increase in endpoint titer between pre-and post - vaccination samples. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will be collected to determine antigen -specific IgG and IgA titers in ALS samples. High - titer specimens will be included on each plate to track day to day inter -assay variation. For each antigen, pre - and post -vaccination serum samples will be assayed side -by-side. The antibody titer assigned to each sample will represent the geometric mean of duplicate tests. Reciprocal endpoint titers less than the starting dilution of the assay will be assigned a value of half the starting dilution for computational purposes. Secondary and Exploratory Evaluations : Serologic and ALS (IgG and IgA) responses to additional antigens ( S. flexneri 2a LPS, IpaB, IpaC) may be assessed depending on sample availability. IgM and IgG subclass responses (serum and ALS) to key antigens may also be assessed. Serum bactericidal (SBA) titers against S. flexneri 2a 2457T will be determined for pre - and post -vaccination samples. An SBA responder will be defined as 9-fold increase in SBA titer as Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 8 compared to baseline SBA titers. Samples will be collected, processed, and archived for analysis. PBMCs will be collected for antigen -specific memory B and T cell analysis, antibody secreting cell assay and 47+ B cells. Stool samples will be collected to assess antigen -specific fecal IgA and IgG responses. A fecal response will be defined as a 4 -fold increase from baseline. Concurrently, saliva samples may be collected to assess mucosal IgA and IgG antibody responses. Hypotheses Safety: One or more of the proposed dosing regimens will have an acceptable frequency and severity of adverse events. Immunogenicity: IM administration of Invaplex AR-DETOX will induce serum IgG antibody responses to S. flexneri 2a Invaplex in 50% of subjects in at least one of the study groups. IM administration of Invaplex AR-DETOX will induce antibody responses to either IpaB or IpaC in 50% of subjects in at least one of the study groups. Estimated Number of Subjects Screene d Based on prior studies with similar study designs, sample collections and inclusion/exclusion criteria, we anticipate screening approximately 5 subjects for every one subject that is enrolled in the study. Therefore we anticipate approximately 300 indivi duals will be screened. Maximum Number of Subjects Enrolled A maximum of 60 subjects are planned for this study. Up to four alternates per group will be selected that may be enrolled in the event a subject becomes ineligible prior to receipt of the investigational product. Subjects receiving at least one dose of the vaccine (or placebo) will not be replaced. Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria: Healthy, adu lt, male or female, age 18 to 50 years (inclusive) at the time of enrollment. Completion and review of comprehension test (achieved 70% accuracy , two attempts allowed ). Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures. Agrees to complete all study visits and procedures and to provide a screening stool sample. Women of childbearing capacity : Negative pregnancy test with understanding (through informed consent process) to not become pregnant during t he study or within three (3) months following the last vaccine dose. Exclusion Criteria: General health Health problems (for example, chronic medical conditions such as psychiatric conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertension , or any other conditions that m ight place the subjects at increased risk of adverse events) - study clinicians, in consultation with the PI, will use clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to assess safety risks under this criterion. The PI will consult with the Research Monitor as ap propriate. History of autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular and renal disease. Use of immunosuppressive medications (systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutics that may influence antibody development), or immunosuppressive illness, including IgA deficien cy (defined by serum IgA <7mg/dL) . Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period plus 3 months beyond the last vaccine dose and currently nursing women. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 9 Participation in research involving another investigational product (de fined as receipt of an investigational product or exposure to an invasive investigational device) 30 days before planned date of first vaccination or anytime throughout the duration of the study until the last in-clinic study safety visit. Positive blood t est for HBsAG, HCV Ab, HIV -1/HIV -2 Ab. Clinically significant abnormalities o n basic laboratory screening tests. Systemic antimicrobial treatment (i.e., topical treatments are not an exclusion) within 1 week before administration of the first vaccine dose. Research specific Allergies that may increase the risk of AEs. Regular use (weekly or more often) of antidiarrheal, anti -constipation, or antacid therapy. Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3 stools per day) on a regular bas is; loose or liquid stools on other than an occasional basis. Personal or family history of an inflammatory arthritis. Positive blood test for HLA -B27 (associated with increased risk of reactive arthritis secondary to Shigella infection) History of allergy to any vaccine. Exclusionary skin disease history/findings that would confound assessment or prevent appropriate local monitoring of AEs, or possibly increase the risk of a local AE. Prior Exposure to Shigella Serum History of microbiologically confirmed Shigella infection. Received previous licensed or experimental Shigella vaccine or live Shigella challenge. Travel to countries where Shigella or other enteric infections are endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to dosing (clinician judgement ). Occupation involving handling of Shigella bacteria currently, or in the past 3 years. Sample Size The sample size of this study is limited by the early stage (Phase 1) of the product concept/testing and is designed to evaluate preliminary safety data but not designed to show statistically significant differences between groups. Given the small number o f subjects per group, the precision of our estimate for adverse events is limited. For example, using binomial probability formula for no observed adverse events within the 16 subjects per group yields a 95% confidence interval of 0 -21%. Follow -on studies evaluating seemingly safe and immunogenic doses will be required with larger numbers of volunteers in order to better define the safety profile. Statistical Methods Rates of all adverse events will be analyzed by Pearson's Chi -square test (or Fisher's exact test if assumptions are not met for Pearson's Chi -square), to compare groups, if applicable. Summary tables will be created to indicate the number of subjects who experience events. Vaccine -related events ( definitely, probably , or possibly related) w ill be tabulated by study group. In addition, tables will be prepared to list each adverse event, the number of subjects in each treatment group who experienced an event at least once, and the rate of subjects with adverse event(s). Adverse events will be divided into defined severity grades (mild, moderate, seve re, potentially life -threatening ). The tables will also Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 10 divide the adverse events by relationship to the investigational product if applicable. All immunized subjects will be included in the safety analysis. For immunology responses, both qualitative (responder rates) and quantitative (e.g., log 10 transformed values) results will be analyzed. Geometric mean titers will be calculated for serologic and ALS responses along with their 95% confidence inte rvals (or standard deviation). If appropriate, between groups comparisons will be examined with nonparametric median tests (Kruskal -Wallis for continuous data and Fisher's exact tests for categorical data) unless assumptions are fulfilled for Student's t o r 2. Additional comparisons may be made using repeated measures analysis of variance with study group as the between subject factor and sample collection time-points as the repeated factor. All statistical tests will be interpreted in a two - tailed fashi on using an alpha = 0.05 to represent statistical significance. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 11 3.

Introduction There are approximately 4.6 billion global annual diarrheal cases [1]. Dia rrhea is a leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years and negatively impacts growth and cognitive development. Further more, bacillary diarrhea is a continuing problem for American military personnel and civilian travelers regions where Shigella is endemic . Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery is a food - and waterborne disease predominantly implicated in children < 5 years of age. Estimates of Shigella -associated morbidity and mortality range from 0.1 to 1.1 million deaths (60% in children under 5) and from 90 to 165 million cases of dysentery annually [2, 3] . In military populations, Shigella species are a common cause of travelers' diarrhea (TD) responsible for approximately 7% of TD cases [4]. In addition to the acute morbidity of diarrhea in this population, shigellosis is linked to several post -infectious sequelae including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and reactive arthritis [5-7]. As Shigella species invade the intestinal mucosa, the disease is less am enable to the salutary effects of oral rehydration compared to enterotoxigenic pathogens that cause dehydrating diarrhea [8]. Therefore, antibiotics are frequently required for treatment; however, increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins (extended spectrum -lactamases ) is undermining efficacy. As therapeutic options narrow, the need for a safe and effective Shigella vaccine becomes more pressing. An expert panel convened by the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) of the World Bank identified Shigella as one of the highest priorities for long -term vaccine development [2]. Furthermore, the Department of Defense (DoD) has issued directives for the development of vaccines against Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia [and 47 antigenically distinct serotypes of Shigella , divided on the basis of differences in their outer membrane lipopolysaccharide antigen (LPS)], which are Shigella dysenteriae and sonnei (1 serotype) [2]. The multiple and evolving serotypes require the development of polyvalent vaccines [9]. Recent vaccine development efforts have targeted S. flexneri 2a, 3a, and 6 as well as S. sonnei in an effort to provide broad coverage against the most predominant Shigella strains. Shigella pathogenesis and immunity are attributed to the organism's ability to invade, replicate intra-cellularly, and spread inter - and intra-cellularly within the colonic epithelium [8]. This invasion eventually results in extensive inflammation and tissue destruction of the villous epithelium adjacent to lymphoid follicles resulting in the formation of mucosal micro -abscesses and ulcerations [8]. As contiguous epithelial cells die, additional areas of mucosal ulceration and hemorrhage are formed. To initiate infection, Shigella utilize a Type -III Secretion System (T3SS). The T3SS consists of proteins that comprise the needle complex (> 12 proteins) and nonstructural secreted proteins forming a conduit f or the passage of virulence proteins from the pathogen to the enterocyte. The needle apparatus consists of a membrane -embedded basal anchor -like structure, an external needle that protrudes from the bacterial surface (which allows passage of effector prote ins), and a tip complex that caps the needle and functions to sense the presence of eukaryotic cells (also serving as a platform of the translocon and regulating the effector protein secretion). Upon host Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 18 cell contact, a translocon is assembled between the needle tip complex and the host cell, serving as a gateway for translocation of effector proteins by creating a pore in the host cell membrane. IpaD, located at the needle tip senses the environment and the location in the gastrointestinal tract, recruiti ng IpaB to the needle tip upon host cell recognition. The needle complex then interacts with the host cell and inserts itself to deliver Shigella effector proteins. Because the Ipa proteins are conserved across all Shigella spp. and are directly responsibl e for initiating infection , immune defenses against the TT SS effector proteins may confer broad -spectrum protection against multiple serotypes overcoming the homologous protection afforded by an LPS only strategy [10]. Immunization strategies for Shigella vaccines to date have included killed whole -cell bacteria, live-attenuated bacteria, recombinant carrier organisms, polysaccharide conjugates, and LPS - protein mixtures. These approaches have often proven either too reactogenic or poorly immunogenic in human testing. Oral vaccines may activate multiple effector arms of the immune system; however, they are difficult to administer in doses that are immunogenic, safe, and well tolerated and suffer from delivery rest rictions [erratic absorption, degradation in acidic environment], particularly for inactivated or subunit vaccines compromising reproducible responses. Development of an immunogenic, safe intramuscular (IM) Shigella vaccine is crucial to harmonize immuniza tion with other vaccines administered globally, particularly as use of alternate routes would necessitate specialized training for administering personnel. 5.1. Invaplex NAT The Shigella invasin complex (termed, Invaplex) containing IpaB, IpaC and LPS underwent manufacturing and initial preclinical and clinical testing in the early 2000s. That formulation, termed S. flexneri 2a native Invaplex or S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT macromolecular isolated S. flexneri 2a via Ion -exchange chromatography purification. In addition to IpaB, IpaC, and LPS, this formulation contained other invasins (IpaA, IpaD), the VirG protein, two non -virulence specific proteins of 72 and 84 kDa molecular weight (DnaK and elongation factor -G, respectively) and several other proteins of various molecular weights and limited immunogenicity. S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT was safely administered intranasally (IN) in small animals and stimulated robust mucosal and serum intestinal and pulmonary immun e responses [humoral, Th1 and Th2 directed at The S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT vaccine was protective in guinea pigs using the keratoconjunctivitis model and in mice using the lethal pneumonia model against both S. sonnei and S. flexneri [11, 13 -15]. The optimal immunization schedule in mice (5 g per dose) and guinea pigs (25 g per dose) was 3 doses given at 2 -week intervals. Immunological memory was observed in mice 15 weeks after the final immunization. 5.1.1. Synopsis: Human S. flexneri 2a Invaplex IN Investigations S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT were adminis tered to 117 human subjects in 3 investigations at doses ranging from 10 to 690 \u00b5g [12, 16] . The first clinical trial of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT was a dose -escalation study conducted using doses ranging from 10 to 480 \u00b5g with an initial lot of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT (Lot 0994) [12, 16] . A total of 3 doses (2 weeks apart) of vaccine were adm inistered IN to each subject using a pipette. The most commonly reported Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 19 symptoms were rhinorrhea and nasal congestion seen in 50% and 47%, respectively. Mild nasal discharge and nasal turbinate edema were observed on clinical exam in 63% and 50% of volunt eers. There were no significant differences in the frequency of these adverse events across dose levels or by dose. The majority (99%) of symptoms/signs were mild. High pre -vaccination laboratory tests showed no significant changes from baseline among any of the study groups. Doses 240 g induced increasing frequency of immune responses (Table 3); however , the magnitude of immune responses was moderate.

The results of this study led to a second in human clinical investigation, a randomized, double - blind, placebo -controlled study with four groups [3 groups with 12 subjects each were randomized to 1 of 3 S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT dose levels \u2014240 \u00b5g, 480 \u00b5g, or 690 \u00b5g]. The test article wa s administered with the Dolphin nasal delivery device [purported to optimize IN delivery via nasal mucosal deposition subsequently improving the immune response]. Additionally, a cohort of 8 subjects received 240 g of the new vaccine Lot 1307 via pipette as a bridge to the first in human clinical trial [to compare the relative superiority in the delivery devices (Dolphin to pipette)]. The 690 g dose of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT (Lot 1307) was selected based on data from the phase 1 clinical trial. Simi lar to the first -in-human clinical trial, the most commonly reported symptoms were rhinorrhea (31%) and nasal congestion (33%). Sneezing and nasal itching were also observed relatively frequently (both seen in 28% of the subjects). The majority (98%) of al l vaccine -associated adverse events were classified as mild. No subjects reported any related severe or serious adverse events. Table 4 shows the frequ ency of individual immune responses to the immunizing antigens ( S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT, LPS). Serologic responses were relatively uncommon with no more than 20% of the vaccine recipients exhibiting a 4 -fold rise over baseline titers to either of the 2 antigens ( S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; and LPS). Antibody -secreting cell ( ASC ) responses were more common and seen in 50%-60% of the vaccine recipients depending on the antigen evaluated. Positive antigen -specific ASC responses were detected in vol unteers from all study groups. In general, antigen -specific IgA and IgG ASCs peaked following the second vaccination in the majority (75% -77%) of volunteers regardless of vaccine dose (data not shown). The 690 g dose elicited the greatest response rate (m aximum with IgA ASC \u201475%) and magnitude of response. Of importance, vaccination with comparable doses of the S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT LPS/protein subunit complex via the Dolphin resulted in higher plasma and ASC immune responses as compared to pipette de livery confirming the importance of optimizing IN deposition in eliciting optimal immune responses.

Groups A, B , and C were immunized with nasal delivery device; group D was immunized with a micropipet te In a follow -on double -blind, placebo -controlled, vaccination -challenge study, a total of 52 subjects were randomized to receive 690 g of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT (n=31) or placebo (n = 21). Other than sneezing, which was more common in vaccine recipients (Chi -square p = 0.03), there were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse events between the 2 study groups. Additionally, the majority of all adverse events were of mild severity and no adverse events were coded as severe. Further, there were no adverse events that met the vaccination stopping criteria, nor were there any vaccine -related serious adverse events. Based on a priori subject selection criteria, 10 vaccinees and 12 placebo recipients advanced to the challenge phase of the study. All 22 subjects were admitted and challenged with 800 cfu of live S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T. There were no significant differences in the rate of fev er, diarrhea, or any of the diarrhea severity indices between vaccine recipients selected to advance to challenge and placebo recipients. Throughout the course of several clinical trials with S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT, there were no adverse events that me t the vaccination stopping criteria, nor were there any vaccine -related Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 21 serious adverse events . Table 5 details the vaccine -related, surveyed signs and symptoms of subjects across the 2 lots and the range of doses. The most common adverse symptoms include nasal congestion (33.3%), rhinorrhea (29.9%) , and sneezing (25.6%), all of mild severity. Placebo recipients have experienced similar rates of solicited symptoms. The only solicited local physical exam finding or solicited symptom that appeared to be significantly different between vaccinees and plac ebo recipients (18.8% and 0.0%, respectively; p = 0.03) was mild nasal itching; however, there was no significant increase in the rate of nasal itching with increasing vaccine doses (chi -square test for trend p = 0.70).

Artificial Invaplex Despite the excellent safety profile of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT, inconsistent immune responses and lack of protection from disease in a human challenge model highlighted the need for further vaccine development. The composition of Invaplex NAT includes a high molecular weight compl ex and several undefined proteins. The high molecular weight complex contains the known major Shigella -virulence factors and immunogens, including IpaB, IpaC, and LPS and is associated with protective activity of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT. Other, undefine d proteins are not considered active ingredients of the vaccine and , therefore , may have diluted the potency of key antigens (IpaB, IpaC and LPS) [11] in the high molecular weight complex and thus undermining the optimal potential immune response solicited . In addition, the undefined components may contribute destabilizing activities, such as protease activity, that may have contributed to inconsistent immunogenicity of the S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT vaccine observed over time. Subsequently, to improve the overall definition and immunogenicity of the high molecular weight component of Invaplex the development of a more refined vaccine [ S. flexneri 2a artificial nd IpaC purified from separate recombinant Escherichia coli [17, 18] . LPS was purified from 2a strain 2457T by the Westphal procedure [19]. The individual components (IpaB, IpaC and LPS) were assembled into the high molecular weight S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR complex , which was subsequently purified by ion - exchange size exclusion chromatography using conditions similar to that used to purify S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT. The vaccine was then sterile filtered, stored frozen, and available for vaccine studies. Initial studies compared S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT to S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR. Figure 1 shows the overall composition of each vaccine and demonstrates that the research grade S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR has only 3 components (IpaB, IpaC , and LPS) at much higher proportions on a weight basis as compared to S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 24 Figure 1: Comparison of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR and S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR is assemble d from purified IpaB (lane 1, 1 \u00b5g), purified IpaC (lane 2, 1 \u00b5g), and purified S. flexneri 2a LPS (lane 5, 2.5 \u00b5g). After assembly the complex is isolated by ion -exchange chromatography. The purified Invaplex AR (5 \u00b5g) is in lane 3. For comparison purposes Invaplex NAT (5 \u00b5g) is also run on these gels (lane 4). The panel on the left is a Coomassie stained SDS -PAGE gel, the middle panel is a western blot probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for IpaB and IpaC and the panel on the right is a silver -staine d gel that is used to show both the protein and LPS components of the Invaplex product. In this gel, HTIpaC (HisTag -IpaC) is used; in later stages of Invaplex AR development, only non -his-tagged IpaC was used. The Invaplex NAT preparation consists of many proteins in addition to IpaC and IpaB thereby reducing the proportion of the key antigens (IpaB, IpaC , and LPS) in the overall product composition. 5.2.2. Comparative Efficacy of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR (research grade) and S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT To demonstrate that the increased proportions of the key antigens in S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR resulted in improved immunogenicity groups of mice (5 per group) were intranasally immunized on Day 0, 14, and 28 with a research grade lot o f S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT (0.1, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 \u00b5g), and a research grade lot of S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR (0.1, 1, 2.5, or 5 \u00b5g) or saline. Blood was collected on Day 42 and analyzed by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay titers. The mean endpoint titers + 1 standard error are shown in Figure 2. The results clearly demonstrate that lower dose amounts of Invaplex AR could be used to stimulate higher titers than that possible with S. flexneri 2a Invaplex NAT. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 25 Figure 2: Comparative Immune Responses in Mice Receiving S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR or S. flexneri S. AR-DETOX While Invaplex AR has demonstrated immunogenicity when administered by IN route, there is concern that the LPS moiety of the vaccine could lead to excessive reactogenicity when used parenterally. Additionally, i ntranasal immunization may not be practical or acceptable as a route of administration to infants and children. In light of this concern, the \"detoxified\" Invaplex AR- Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 DET OX was developed using -attenuated Shigella flexneri lacking acyl transferases A mutants that are underacylated. This underacylated LPS is used in combination with recombinant IpaB and IpaC in similar fashion as Invaplex AR under cGMP. Underacylated LPS induces less pro -inflammatory cytokine re lease from macrophages i n vitro , and Invaplex AR-DET OX has been demonstrated to induce lower reactogenicity as compared to Invaplex AR after ID vaccination in mice, while still inducing the same levels of Shigella -specific antibodies in mice and guinea pigs. 5.4. Nonclinical Toxicology A nonclinical toxicology study was conducted in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits to evaluate the toxicity and local site reactogenicity of Invaplex AR-DETOX when administered intramuscularly at up to 25 \u00b5g protein content. This study also included an adjuvant, dmLT, which is not included in the clinical protocol due to formulation challenges. This study was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices. As shown in Table 6, a total of 88 (44 male and 44 female) NZW r abbits were randomized into each designated group. Animals were administered four biweekly intramuscular doses of saline (Group 1), 10 25 \u00b5g Invaplex AR-DETOX + dmLT (Group 4) on days 1, 15, 29, and 43. Animals were followed for standard vaccine toxicology endpoints, including detailed physical exams, ophthalmological exams, body weight measurements, evaluation of body temperature and assessments of dose site inflammation following each dose, and clinical pathology. Six animals of each sex from each group were euthanized and underwent full necropsy on study day 45 (2 days post final vaccination). The remaining five animals per sex from each group were euthanized and underwent a full necropsy on day 73 following a 28 day recovery period. Microscopic evaluation of major organ systems and local injection sites was conducted on all animals sa crificed on study day 45. Only injection sites were evaluated microscopically from those animals sacrificed on study day 73. Table 6: Nonclinical Toxicology Study Design Group Invaplex AR-DETOX Dose dmLT Dose Number of Animals Termination Day 45 Termination Day 73 1 N/A N/A 6M/6 F 5M/5F 2 well -tolerated following four bi -weekly doses, with no adverse effects observed in NZW rabbits at either 10 or 25 g. Non -adverse apparent effects of treatment included decreased food consumption without correlating changes in body weights, gross and microscopic inflammation at the injection sites, temporary shifts in clinical pathology indicating an immune and/or inflammatory response following vaccination, increased relative and absolute spleen weights, and microscopic changes in the spleen and sciat ic nerve. These findings were consistent with the pharmacology of the vaccine and/or were not associated with a chronic or Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 27 disease effect. While Invaplex AR-DETOX appears to induce an acute systemic inflammatory response, this response appears to be in a do se-related manner. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 28 6. Trial Objectives Primary: Evaluate the safety of immune responses (serum IgG/IgA and following IM immunization with Invaplex AR-DETOX . Exploratory: Collect samples from vaccinated subjects for exploratory immunological assays. Perform secondary immunology analyses. Collect samples for evaluation of C -reactive protein (CRP) responses to vac cine and placebo. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 29 7. Hypotheses Safety: One or more of the proposed dosing regimens will have an acceptable frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs). Immunogenicity: IM administration of Invaplex AR-DETOX will induce serum IgG antibody responses to S. flexneri 2a Invaplex in 50% of subjects in at least one of the study groups. IM administration of Invaplex AR-DETOX will induce antibody responses to either IpaB or IpaC in 50% of subjects in at least one of the study groups. 8. Clinical Study Design This is a double -blinded, placebo -controlled, dose -escalat ing study in which a total of 60 subjects will receive three vaccinations (Days 1, 22 and 43) of one of three doses of Invaplex AR- DETOX (2.5, 10, or 25 \u00b5g) or placebo as per Table 7. A complete 3 -dose series will be completed for an entire cohort at one dose level prior to advancing to the next dose level. Prior to advancing to the next dose level, a safety analysis (i ncluding events up to 7 days after the third dose) will be completed and reviewed by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) . If no halting criteria are met, the next cohort and dose level will be initiated. As an added precaution in the event of severe re actogenicity when Invaplex AR-DETOX is administered intramuscularly, five subjects of Cohort A will be enrolled in a pilot group prior to enrolling the remaining subjects. In this pilot group, four subjects will receive 2.5 \u00b5g of Invaplex AR-DETOX and one subject will receive placebo (saline) . These subjects will be monitored for 7 days post vaccination for solicited and systemic reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events. If no unexpected symptoms occur within 7 days of vacc ination, enrollment of the remaining subjects in Cohort A may proceed.

Vaccine safety will be actively assessed at vaccination and for 28 days following receipt of the third vaccine dose (see Table 8). The decision to advance to the next cohort (higher dose level) will be based on the safety assessment (not immunogenicity). A dose level with no occurrence of stopping criteria will prompt moving to the next cohort. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed by the PSRT prior to dose -escalation. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 30 The study consists of 11 visits not including the screening visit or the Day -7 visit. Additionally, subjects are expected to be available for a telephone follow -up approximatel y 6 months after receipt of the last vaccine dose. The study time and events schedule is shown in Table 8.

A missed PBMC collection on Day -7 will not be consider ed a protocol deviation. 8 Additional sample collection may include saliva. 9Day 223 assessments will be performed via telephone.Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 33 8.1. Screening and Study Schedule The screening visit is scheduled -60 to -9 days before the first vaccination. Fully informed, written consent must be obtained from each subject prior to conducting any study procedure. Two consent forms will be signed; a consent form for study participation and a separate consent form for HIV testing. To assess understanding, a comprehe nsion assessment will be administered after the subjects sign the study participation written consent. The following evaluations/procedures will be carried out: Oral and/or video presentation of clinical trial design, risks and study schedule Review of inf ormed consent document One-on-one discussions with principal investigator or subinvestigator Signature of informed consent document (see section 9.2 for informed co nsent process) Comprehension test (minimum of 70% accuracy required for participation , two attempts allowed ) Medical history - between Days -60 to -9 Physical examination - between Days -60 to -9 Vital Signs - between Days -60 to -9 Screening laboratory an alysis (allowable time period for accepting test): Complete blood count (between Days -60 to -9) Serum transaminases (ALT/AST) (between Days -60 to -9) CL -, HCO 3, glucose, BUN and creatinine (between Days -60 to -9) Total serum IgA (between Days -60 to -9) Pregnancy test (urine -hCG) for women, as well as 0 -24 hours before each vaccination HLA -B27 (between Days -60 to -9) Serology screening (Anti LPS Antibody ) for prior Shigella exposure (between days -60 to -9) Serum HIV 1/2 antibody (between days -14 to -2) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (between days -14 to -2) Hepatitis C virus Ab (between days -14 to -2) Additionally, approximately 7 days prior to vaccination (allowable range: Days -14 to -2), subjects will have a follow -up medical history and brief physical exam to ensure ongoing eligibility. If the initial screening is within the -14-day window, it can count as both the initial screening and pre -vaccination visit (and all screening activities will be conducted at the one visit). Blood, saliva, and stool will be collected for baseline serology testing. Additional Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 34 instruction will be reviewed with each subject to include review of the study visit schedule, preparation procedures for saliva collection, and procedures for stool collection an d storage. The following screening laboratory analyses will be carried out (below tests will not be repeated if the initial screening visit occurs during the day -14 to -9 window) : Repeat complete blood count Repeat serum transaminases (ALT/AST) Repeat Na, K+, CL -, HCO 3, glucose, BUN and creatinine Serum HIV 1/2 antibody (between Days -14 to -2) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) (between Days -14 to -2) Hepatitis C virus (anti -HCV antibody) (between Days -14 to -2) A screening test for any of the above as sessments may be repeated in the event of a laboratory error (i.e., hemolyzed sample) or in the event the screening physician believes: 1) the laboratory test has identified a normal variant of a healthy state (i.e., below normal hemoglobin in a menstruati ng female, or cyclic reductions in absolute neutrophil count in subjects of African descent) and 2) the variant is no mo re than a Grade 1 abnormality. This repeat screening applies to the initial screen ing tests [(executed between -60 to -9 days) and the r epeat screening labs if execut ed (between days -14 to -2)]. If a repeat screening blood test is performed, only the results of the second test will be used to determine eligibility. The WRAIR Clinical Trials Center (CTC) may use a screening protocol in re cruiting volunteers for this study. All screening procedures outlined in this section may be completed under this screening protocol. During this screening process, the laboratory assays will be reviewed to determine if any clinical laboratory abnormalitie s exist that would preclude study participation. Subjects who have only 1 mild (grade 1) abnormality may be included if the PI determines that their participation will not present undue risk to the subject. Subjects with 2 or more mild abnormalities may be included in the study only with the consensus of the PI and the research monitor. Subjects with clinical laboratory abnormalities of greater than mild severity will not participate in this clinical trial. The clinical toxicity grading scale that will be u sed as a guideline is based on the scale used by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) for adverse events and the guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. If any additional safety labs are performed, eith er scale may be utilized. 8.2. Randomization Within each cohort, 20 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 2 different treatment groups using block sizes of 5 . The first cohort will be enrolled in a staggered manner in order to evaluate the safety and tol erability of the vaccine in a limited number of subjects before exposing a larger number of subjects to the study product . The pilot group will assign subjects to each treatment group with a ratio of 4:1, so that 4 subjects will receive Invaplex AR-DETOX and 1 subject will receive placebo. After review of the safety data through Day 7 of this pilot group, if no safety concerns are identified, the remaining 15 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 35 groups in the same ratio ( 4:1) with 12 subjects receiving Invaplex AR-DETOX and 3 subjects receiving placebo. Subsequent dose-escalating cohorts will be randomized after review of safety data including 7 days after the final vaccination of the previous cohort. Depending on the safety profile , the PSRT will make a recommendation to the sponsor and investigator to proceed or not with the vaccination of the next cohort at a higher dose level. Participant randomization will be generated from the Advantage eClinical system based on the enrollment sequence in the treatment table, therefore the randomization plan will also provide the maximum number of sequence numbers by site. An Emmes statistician will write code using SAS and the seed(s) for the random number generator will be documented. When a p articipant is randomized in Advantage eClinical only the cohort, coded treatment assignment and the sequence number will display. A second Emmes statistician will conduct and document quality control (QC) of the randomization plan, treatment table and all other related documents using the statistical considerations in the protocol. Once the treatment table has been finalized, the Emmes Systems Programmer will transfer the treatment table into the Advantage eClinical environment and the Emmes Project Manager will approve the treatment table. The person performing vaccine formulation will be provided a list of the coded treatment numbers with their corresponding unblinded treatment assignments, as well as the sealed back -up manual randomization list. 8.3. Blinding The study is designed to keep subjects and investigators blinded until completion of the clinical phase of the trial and monitoring of the clinical data. Members of the study staff not involved in clinical outcome assessment will perform formulation of the test articles. During the course of the study, all effort s will be made to keep subjects and investigators unaware of subject assignment . 8.4. Unblinding In the event of emergency, the site Investigator may require that the blind be broken for the subject expe riencing the emergency when knowledge of the subject's treatment assignment may influence the subject's clinical care. Emergency unblinding can occur by contacting Emmes during business hours or by contacting the unblinded vaccine formulation expert after business hours. Every effort will be made not to unblind the subject unless it is considered necessary for the welfare of the subject. Prior to unblinding, the site Investigator is encouraged (to the extent possible, without jeopardizing the subject's heal th) to contact the Sponsor (or designee) to discuss the decision to break the blind. The site PI will be expected to provide a rationale for the necessity of unblinding based on the expectation that knowledge of the subject's treatment assignment will have a meaningful impact on the subject's medical care in the short term. If a subject's treatment assignment is unblinded, the subject will remain in the study and continue with protocol -defined study visits, but not receive further vaccinations. The decision to unblind will be communicated to any regulatory bodies (e.g., institutional review boards [IRBs]) as required. At the end of the study, documentation of all unblinded subjects (and the rationale for unblinding) will be incorporated into the Trial Master File. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 36 8.5. Vaccination After initial screening and informed consent, eligible volunteers will be vaccinated with S. flexneri 2a Invaplex AR-DETOX Lot 1972 or placebo (saline) . The vaccine will be administered IM on Days 1, 22, and 43. The investigational product administration procedure is outlined in detail in the Manual of Procedures (MOP) . Briefly, the IM vaccination site (deltoid muscle) will be pre-treated with an alcohol pad and the vaccine will be administer ed using a 1 -inch needle . Approximately 10 0 \u00b5L of appropriately formulated vaccine product or placebo will be administered. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes post -vaccination and given symptom diaries to record local and systemic reactions for 7 days post vaccina tion for each dose. After the 30 -minute observation period, an assessment will be performed including vital signs and the recording of all adverse events. Subjects will return approximately 24 hours after vaccination for a follow -up examination. For each subsequent immunizat ion, the injection will be given in alternate deltoid regions from the previous vaccination. An exception may be needed if there is pain/tenderness, erythema, edema, pruritus, induration, or rash at the planned site of vaccination . In this case, the Principal Investigator, following discussion with the Independent Research Monitor, may exercise the discretion to administer the vaccination on the same arm as the previous vaccination. The site of vaccine administration will be recorded in the source documents . 8.5.1. Vaccination Follow -Up The timing and number of follow -up visits are delineated in the Time and Events Schedule (Table 8) and are scheduled to coincide with vaccinati on or specimen collection visits. These visits may include a brief history, targeted exam, blood, stool, and salivary specimen collection , and a reminder to the volunteer to contact the investigator if s/he experiences any medical problems. Subjects will r eturn approximately 24 hours and 7 days after vaccination for follow - up. Approximately 6 months from final vaccination all subjects will be contacted via telephone to assess for a final safety assessment. A history for any additional serious new diagnoses or hospitalizations will be solicited. Three attempts will be made and documented; after 3 unsuccessful attempts a certified letter and/or email will be used to request the subject to contact the study team. 8.6. Endpoints 8.6.1. Safety Safety monitoring will be und ertaken using in -person symptom surveillance, symptom diaries, and targeted physical exams. Solicited adverse event monitoring will survey and specifically inquire about symptoms listed in section 11.6.2 . Abnormalities will be described in detail in order to monitor progress. This will include the name of the adverse event, the date and time of onset and offset (du ration), severity, and Principal Investigator determination of relationship to the investigational vaccine. Safety monitoring labs will also be performed on Days 8, 29, and 50. Clinical outcomes will be prospectively defined and actively surveyed during the study. The study procedures are detailed in Table 8. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 37 Clinical definitions will be used to grade the severity of symptoms in accordance to the severity scale included in section 11.8.3 . 8.6.2. Immunology A secondary objective is to assess IgG and IgA serolog ic and Antibody in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) responses to S. flexneri 2a Invaplex using methods previously e stablished . Seroconversion will be defined as a 4 -fold increase in endpoint titer between pre - and post - vaccination samples. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will be collected to determine antigen -specific IgG and IgA titers in ALS samples. An ALS response is defined as 4-fold increase in antibody titer at any point post -vaccination as compared to baseline titers. For serologic and ALS assays, high -titer specimens will be included on each plate to track day -to- day interassay variation. For ea ch antigen, pre - and post -vaccination serum samples will be assayed side -by-side. The antibody titer assigned to each sample will represent the geometric mean of duplicate tests. Reciprocal endpoint titers less than the starting dilution of the assay will be assigned a value of half the starting dilution for computational purposes. Secondary immunologic evaluations (an e xploratory objective ) may include serologic and ALS responses LPS, (SBA) titers against S. flexneri 2a 2457T (responders defined as 9 -fold increase in SBA titer at any point post -vaccination compared to baseline titers). Stool samples will be collected to assess anti gen-specific fecal Ig responses. A fecal response will be defined as a 4 -fold increase from baseline. Samples will also be collected, processed, and archived for potential future analysis as follows . PBMCs will be collected for antigen -specific memory B /T cell analys es, antibody secreting cell (ASC) assay, and 47+ B cells. Concurrently, saliva samples may be collected to assess mucosal IgA and IgG antibody responses. CRP responses in serum after initial v accination will be collected for exploratory cor relation with immune responses and AEs. 8.7. Investigational product 8.7.1. Invaplex AR-DETOX S. flexneri 2a Invaplex under cGMP at the WRAIR Pilot Bioproduction Facility, Silver Spring, MD. The individual components IpaB (Lot 1757), IpaC (Lot 1771) and detoxified LPS (Lot 1902) were assembled into the Invaplex AR-DETOX complex and subsequently purified by ion -exchange chromatography yielding the bulk drug product (Lot 1954). The drug product, designated as Lot 1972, was filled in 2mL glass vials, stoppered and sealed, and stored at -80 \u00b1 10 \u00b0C. Figure 3: Label from a vial \u00b1 10\u00b0C Caution: New Drug - Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use. Date of Mfg.: 15 Jan 16 Manufactured By: WRAIR, Silver Spring, MD 20910 Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 38 8.7.2. Investigational Product Preparation On the day of vaccination, the product will be used to formulate the appropriate vaccine preparations for the clinical groups. The vaccine will be used within 6 hours of preparation. Prepared v accine or open vials will not be saved for use on another study day. Any remaining vaccine product will be properly disposed of in accordance with the MOP . Vaccine formulation for each of the groups is described in detail in the MOP . 8.7.3. Investigational Product Accountability The spons or is responsible for authorizing th e release for distribution of the investigational products to the study site. The NMRC Enteric Diseases Department and/or WRAIR will arrange for shipment, under appropriate conditions, of the investigational products to the clinical site. At the WRAIR CTC, investigational product inventory logs will be maintained in the accountability files. The Release for Use Memo signed by the sponsor's representative gives permission to the WRAIR Pilot Bioproduction Facility to release product to the PI. After the inves tigational product is distributed, the PI is responsible for and will maintain logs of investigational product receipt, storage, reconstitution, accountability by subject, and investigational product remaining before final disposition. These logs will be m aintained in the regulatory files at the WRAIR CTC . The PI may delegate, in writing, this responsibility to another individual, but the PI is ultimately responsible for the investigational product and its proper storage upon receipt at the study site until it is transferred back to the sponsor or designee, utilized as directed by the sponsor or destroyed. Any excess formulated vaccine remaining from vaccination day will be disposed of or used for research purposes as authorized by the sponsor . All used or p artially used investigational product and empty vials will be destroyed or used for nonclinical research purposes as per the MOP . 8.8. Duration of Subject Participation Screening of volunteers will occur during a period of up to 60 days prior to initial vaccinations. Subjects will receive 3 vaccinations on Days 1, 22, and 43. Clinical follow -up will occur as delineated in the Time and Events schedule ( Table 8). A phone survey will occur at approximately 6 months after the final vaccine dose. This phone survey will specifically inquire if the subject has experienced any new serious heal th problems or hospitalizations since their last study follow -up. Inclusion criteria require that a subject be available for the required follow -up period and scheduled clinic visits. Therefore, no military subjects will be enrolled in the study if a known deployment is to conflict with his or her involvement. If there is an unexpected deployment, efforts (e.g., telephone, e -mail, command mail) will be undertaken to obtain safety follow -up data per the protocol schedule. 8.9. Dose Escalation Criteria The decisio n to advance to the next dose level will be based solely on the safety assessment. A dose level with no occurrence of stopping criteria will prompt moving to the next higher level. The Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) comprised of the Principal Investiga tor, the PATH Medical Officer, and the Independent Research Monitor will review blinded safety data for the recommendation to proceed with dose escalation. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 39 8.10. Stopping Criteria The study will use a dose -escalation design to evaluate increasing doses of Invapl exAR-DETOX . The PI, along with the PSRT, may determine a subject's local site reactions warrant discontinuation of subsequent vaccinations for that subject . If it is determined that a subject will not continue with future vaccine doses, they may remain enr olled in the study for follow -up. If any of the following events occurs, administration of investigational product will be discontinued for the group until a thorough review of the event is undertaken by the investigators and the PSRT : The occurrence of on e serious adverse event determined to be related to the investigational vaccine (definitely, probably, or possibly) at any time post -vaccination. Severe diarrhea, defined as six or more liquid stools within 24 hours of vaccination. A severe local rash, def ined as one that makes the subject unable to perform normal daily activities and which is not attributable to another cause. Systemic rash, including but not limited to generalized urticarial, generalized petechiae, or erythema multiforme, occurring in two or more subjects in a group will result in stopping further vaccination in subject's group. One vaccine -related serious or unexpected AE evaluated by the principal investigator (PI), Independent Research Monitor, and sponsor and determined to be an unacce ptable risk to the health and safety of other investigational product recipients. If a subject experiences grade 2 or greater hypotension in the 30 minutes following vaccination, they will not be eligible to receive subsequent vaccinations. Further vaccination, in accordance with the protocol, may be resumed with the concurrence of the PRST , sponsor 's representative , the PI, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An interim analysis for each cohort will be prepared and reviewed to in clude all safety data through seven days after the third vaccination dose for each cohort. This report will be provided to the PSRT for their review to determine whether the study can continue to enroll for the next, dose-escalating cohort or whether the study should be stopped. In addition to the interim safety analyses, the PI, sponsor's representative along with the PSRT will stop the study until further review by the PSRT if any of the following criteria that are thought to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the investigational vaccine are identified: One or more SAEs, including grade 4 adverse events or laboratory abn ormalities. Two or more grade 3 adverse events or laboratory abnormalities of the same type. One or more grade 3 laboratory abnormalities. Two or more grade 2 laboratory abnormalities. 8.11. Identification of Data to Be Recorded on Case Report Forms The electron ic case report form (eCRF) data will be entered from source documentation. No source data will be recorded directly in eCRF (i .e., without prior record of data). These data will be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies will be explained . No personally Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 40 identifying data will be recorded on eCRFs. The investigator is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of data transcribed on the eCRF. Data monitoring and management will be performed in the electronic data capture (EDC) database system b y the study monitor and the designated data management group. A detailed data management plan will be written and approved by the study team and the PI prior to study start. All updates to the data management plan must be approved before study closeout and database lock. 8.12. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 8.12.1. Risks/Discomfort to Subjects and Precautions to Minimize Risk Outlined as follows are anticipated and unexpected adverse reactions with a brief description of procedures to ameliorate risks and symptoms. In general, dose escalation is being performed to ensure an acceptable safety record for IM administration of the vaccine product in this study. Prior to proceeding with the next dose in the next group of subjects, all safety data will be reviewed by the PSRT , and a determination will be made as to whether the study can continue to enroll subsequent cohorts (at the dose escalation planned) based on the observed safety record from the preceding dose level. In addition to this overall saf eguard, individual risks will be closely monitored and any AEs will be quickly identified and managed. 8.12.1.1. Local Reactions Local reactions at the vaccination site are expected from IM immunization. The IM route of vaccination, in general, has been shown to be a safe and effective route of administration. There may be some mild discomfort and irritation from an IM vaccination from the initial injection. These are typically mild and transient in nature. In addition, there is the possibility of local erythema, pru ritus, swelling, and/or induration that appears over time. In addition, subjects may develop temporary swelling in the lymph nodes under the arm where vaccination occurred. 8.12.1.2. Systemic Reactions Any vaccine may be associated with a wide range of systemic rea ctions, such as fevers, constitutional symptoms (fatigue, malaise, appetite change), and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) as well as others to include allergic reactions (bronchospasm, urticaria, anaphylaxis). The frequency and type of systemic symptoms will be assessed and analyzed with respect to study product. 8.12.1.3. Pregnancy During initial screening and prior to each vaccination, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. Subjects with a positive test will be excluded from the study. A fina l urine pregnancy test will be conducted during the last clinic visit. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control (birth control pills, injection hormonal contraceptive, implant hormonal contraceptive, hormonal patch, IUD, sterilization by hysterectomy or tubal ligation, spermicidal products and barrier methods such as cervical sponge, diaphragm, or condom) during the study and 3 months following the last vaccination. Abstinence is acceptable. While fema le subjects will not be required to disclose their method of birth control, they will be counseled during the initial screening on acceptable forms of birth control required for study enrollment. At each visit, female subjects will be reminded that they mu st agree to use effective Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 41 contraception to remain in the study. Female subjects should not become pregnant during the study and for at least 3 months after the last vaccine dose . 8.12.1.4. Lactation Risks to nursing infants are unknown at this time; breastfeeding fe males wi ll be excluded from this study. 8.12.1.5. Venipuncture Blood sampling carries a minimal risk of minor discomfort and the possibility of minor bruising at the site of the needle puncture and, rarely, the possibility of infection at the needle puncture site. 8.12.1.6. Allergic Reaction As with any Investigational New Drug (IND) product administration and no matter what precautions are taken, there is always the risk of a serious, or even life -threatening, allergic reaction. Although anaphylactic reactions are not anticip ated, as with any vaccination, the rare possibility exists. For this reason, all subjects will be observed at the study si te (WRAIR CTC) for a minimum of 30 minutes following vaccine dosing. Appropriate emergency equipment (e .g., automated external defibri llator, air -shields manual breathing unit bag) and medication [e .g., antihistamines and adrenaline (epinephrine)] for initial treatment of an allergic reaction will be available at the WRAIR CTC whenever immunizations are given. This equipment is available to handle emergencies such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm. Existing staff standard operating procedures at the WRAIR CTC are also in place for these events. 8.12.1.7. Theoretical Risks Post-infection reactive arthritis , characterized as an asymmetric , oligoarticular arthritis commonly involves the knees, ankles, or wrists is known to occur following Shigella infection. Some data suggests that the risk of reactive arthritis following shigellosis may be higher in persons c arrying the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) -B27 antigen [20]. There is enough uncertainty as to the etiology of arthritis, that a specific entry criteria related to this theoretical risk is included and will exclude volunteers with a persona l or immediate family history of inflammatory arthritis or HLA -B27 positivity. 8.12.1.8. Unknown Risks As with all research, there is the remote possibility of risks that are unknown or that cannot be foreseen based on current information. This would include late ef fects that have been seen with some vaccines. 8.12.2. Alternatives to This IND Product or Study At this time, there are no known alternative , licensed vaccines directed at Shigella . An alternative choice is not to participate in this study. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 42 8.12.3. Intended Benefit for Su bjects There is no benefit that can be guaranteed to volunteers for participating in this research study. However, there is potential societal benefit of the development of a n effective Shigella vaccine. 8.12.4. Risks to Study Personnel and the Environment The pri ncipal risk in the clinical setting is in the handling of needles that may be contaminated and the attendant risks including hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other human pathogens. Adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for wor king with infectious agents and universal precautions will reduce the risk of exposure. There are no known risks to the environment other than those associated with the generation of biohazardous waste attendant to vaccination of humans. All biohazardous w aste will be disposed of as stipulated by local, state, and federal regulations and in accordance with study -site SOPs. 8.13. Route of Administration, Dosage Regimen, Treatment Period, and Justification On days 1, 2 2, and 43 subjects will be administered Invaple xAR-DETOX or placebo. Each subject will receive the same formulation at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. Dose formulations will be prepared each day of immunization at the clinical site using the Invaplex AR- DETOX drug product. Because Inva plex AR-DETOX has not been previously administered to humans, limited information is available to estimate the dose needed to induce suitably robust immune responses while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Guinea pigs have been immunized intranasall y with 25 \u00b5g or intramuscularly with and 25 \u00b5g of cGMP Invaplex AR-DETOX . The vaccine was well -tolerated and induced a robust immune response. This study is designed as a placebo -controlled, dose -escalating study starting with the lowest dose of Invap lexAR-DETOX (2.5 \u00b5g) and progressing upwards through higher doses up to 25 \u00b5g. Following completion of each of the vaccination series, an interim safety report will be compiled and a dose -escalation decision will be made in concert with the PSRT . If the vaccine is safe and immunogenic, future studies will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of this vaccine using a homologous enteric S. flexneri 2a strain in a human challenge model . The overall goal of the current Shigella development plan is to creat e a broadly protective multivalent Shigella vaccine from a combination of Invaplex vaccines encompassing the conserved invasin proteins and the combination of serotype specific LPS for each proposed strain to integrate. The proposed multivalent vaccine wou ld integrate the major Shigella flexneri S. flexneri 6, and S. sonnei . 8.14. Compliance Statement The study will be conducted according to the protocol and in compliance with International Council on Harmoni sation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Belmont Principles, and other applicable regulatory and DoD requirements. All identified study personnel will be trained to perform their roles and will carry out their responsibilities in accordance wit h ICH GCP guidelines and clinic site study procedures. 8.15. Study Population In this initial study, it is important to restrict enrollment to a small number of healthy subjects without factors that may limit or confound assessment of AEs and vaccine -induced imm une Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 43 response. The study population will consist of healthy male and nonpregnant, nonlacta ting female subjects, ages 18 -50 years (inclusive) , from the greater Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland areas, who can give informed consent and understand the ris ks and benefits of the study and are willing to comply with all protocol procedures and time commitments. A maximum of 60 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Four alternates per cohort may be asked to go to the clinic on vaccination days in the event a planned subject cannot/does not enroll in the study. 8.16. Study Site The study will be conducted at the WRAIR CTC, Silver Spring, Maryland. Immunologic assays will be conducted at the subunit enteric vaccines and immunology laboratory of the WRAIR, Silver Spr ing, Maryland. 9. Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects 9.1. Recruitment of Subjects/Study Population Healthy adults, both males and nonpregnant females, will be recruited from the Baltimore/Washington, DC, area through the WRAIR CTC by the use of advertisement in multiple media formats, to include but not limited to: newspapers, fliers, e -mails, the WRAIR CTC web site, public listservs, social media (such as Facebook), posters, bus ads, and generic radio advertisements . E-mail announcements and web site postings (e .g., WRAIR CTC) will include information found on recruitment scripts (excluding any compensation information) or posters excluding any photos unless attached as a complete flyer. Recruitment may also include oral presentations at events, meetings, and bri efings wherein the desired recruit population might reasonably be expected to attend. All forms of recruitment, printed media, handouts, and briefs will have IRB approval prior to being used. When a subject calls the WRAIR CTC recruitment office and discl oses an interest in the study, the recruitment staff will discuss details of the trial from a prepared, IRB -approved script. If the subject is still interested, contact information will be obtained and an appointment for briefing/screening will be arranged . Up to 60 subjects will be recruited for enrollment in this Phase 1 trial. Additionally, there will be up to 4 alternates recruited for each cohort. 9.2. Informed Consent Process All subjects will undergo an informed consent process consisting of a detailed informational presentation of study -related material using a pre -recorded brief. Following the briefing, one of the study investigators will reiterate the purpose, procedures, a nd risks of the study as needed and answer any questions. This process will take place at the WRAIR CTC immediately preceding the screening procedures. During the briefing session, an investigator or designee will brief prospective subje cts using the briefing slides. The briefing may be provided by a pre -recorded slide set. An investigator will be available to answer any questions raised during the session. Following the briefing, the coordinator or designee will provide the subject with ample time to read the consent and will Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 44 answer any questions. The subject will be asked to sign the consent, as will the investigator conducting the informed consent discussion. The subject will be allowed to take the consent document home to consider and discuss it with others and can return it to the WRAIR CTC at a later time to sign it. After signing the consent (to include future use of specimens), the subject will take a comprehension test (\"open book\" format). Any questions missed will be explained to the subject, and the subject's questions will be answered. The test is administered to aid study personnel in identifying gaps in understanding. If the subject appears not to understand the content of any of the questions, one of the study facilitators wi ll be informed and must document whether the subject understands the risks, benefits, procedures, and time commitment as well as the answers to the questions that he or she missed. Any subject who, in the opinion of the PI, does not understand the study we ll enough to consider his or her consent truly informed will be excluded. The subject will be given one additional opportunity to take the comprehension test. A passing score of at least 70% will be required to participate in the study. The informed conse nt process will include a recruitment script, briefing material, and an informed consent document. Throughout the study, all questions and concerns of the subject will be addressed. If the subject has additional concerns, the research monitor will be avail able to answer any medical questions, and the NMRC Office of Research Administration is available to answer any human use -related concerns. No study procedures will occur before the subject provides written informed consent. Active duty military will not be specifically recruited for this study. Active duty military members interested in participating will need to obtain supervisor approval. To minimize any possible coercion, supervisors or anyone in the chain of command or in a dominant position will not be permitted to consent the subject. 9.3. Eligibility Screening Each subject must meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria. The PI or designee will make the final decision of the eligibility. Only eligible subjects will be given the investigational product . 9.4. Subject Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study: 1. Healthy, adu lt, male or female, age 18 to 50 years (inclusive) at the time of enrollment. 2. Completion and review o f comprehension test (achieved 70% accuracy , two attempts allowed ). 3. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures. 4. Agrees to complete all study visits and procedures and provide a screening stool sample. 5. Women of childbearing capacity : Negative pregnancy test w ith understanding (through informed consent process) to not become pregnant during the study or within three (3) months following the last vaccine dose. 9.5. Subject Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the stu dy. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 45 9.5.1. General Health 1. Health problems (for example, chronic medical conditions such as psychiatric conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or any other conditions that might place the subject at increased risk of adverse events) - study clinicians, in con sultation with the PI, will use clinical judgment on a case -by-case basis to assess safety risks under this criterion. The PI will consult with the Research Monitor as appropriate. 2. History of autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular and renal diseases. 3. Use of immunosuppressive medications (systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutics that may influence antibody development), or immunosuppressive illness, including IgA deficiency (defined by serum IgA <7mg/dL) . 4.

Prior Exposure to Shigella to History of microbiologically co nfirmed Shigella infection. 18. Received previous licensed or experimental Shigella vaccine or live Shigella challenge. 19. Travel to countries where Shigella or other enteric infections are endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to dosing ( clinician judgment). Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 46 20. Occupation involving handling of Shigella bacteria currently, or in the past 3 years. 9.6. Subject Withdrawal Criteria Each subject may withdraw consent at any time during the study without penalty. Counseling about the subject's health wil l be provided if he or she decides to discontinue participation in the study. Medical advice regarding what is in the best interest of the subject will be provided. The PI may discontinue the subject's activity without the subject's consent if any of these criteria is met: A subject fails to comply with study procedures A subject's safety or health may be compromised by further participation It is determined to be in the subject's best interest 9.6.1. When and How to Withdraw Subjects A subject may end his or her participation in the study at any time. If a subject withdraws, the investigator will make a reasonable effort to determine the reason for the withdrawal from the study and to complete termination procedures. Telephone calls, registered letters, and e -mail correspondence are considered reasonable effort. For subjects leaving the study, a targeted examination may be performed if medically indicated and if permitted by the subject. A subject may be withdrawn for an AE or SAE resulting in a safety concern or f or noncompliance with protocol requirements. When a subject withdraws or is withdrawn by the PI due to an AE that results in a safety concern, the sponsor must be notified within 72 hours. Investigators must follow specific policy at each institution regar ding the timely reporting of AEs and SAEs to the local IRB (section 11.9.1.2 ). In all cases, the PI will make a reasonable effort to complete study termination procedures. Subjects who do not receive subsequent vaccine doses but who continue in follow -up for safety and immunogenicity are not considered to be withdrawn from the study. If a subject meets withdrawal conditions for a concomitant medicatio n violation or noncompliance, this should clearly be stated in the source document and the study termination eCRF. 9.6.2. Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects Attempts will be made to follow all subjects for safety up to 28 days after receipt of the last vaccine dose. Short -term safety follow -up 7-days post vaccination will also be attempted. 9.6.3. Data Collected for Withdrawn Subjects All data collected up to the time of withdrawal will be reported , unless consent is withdrawn . If the subject proceeds with the specific follow -up procedures for withdr awn subjects , this data will also be collected and reported. The study termination eCRF will be completed with the reason for withdrawal specified. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 47 9.6.4. Replacement of Subjects Alternates recruited for each cohort will be asked to come to the day of the first vaccination for each cohort. If an assigned subject does not present on the first day of vaccination, elects to withdraw, or is found to no longer be eligible , an alternate will be enrolled. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn after the first vaccination will not be replaced. 10. Treatment of Subjects If the subject is acutely ill on the day of first vaccination, the subject will not be vaccinated and may be asked to return to be enrolled in a subsequent dose group. If a subject returns to be enrolled in a subsequent dose group whose scre ening was performed more than 60 days prior to the vaccination date, he or she will be screened again for eligibility. This screening will inc lude the labs required 7 days prior to vaccination (between Days -14 to -2) as delineated in section 8.1 (Study and Screening Schedule). If the subject is acutely i ll on the day of vaccine Dose 2, the subject may return for vaccination after recovery from the acute illness if the return visit is within the compliance range for receiving that dose. 10.1. Dose Administration/Vaccination and Follow -up Periods/Study Visits 10.1.1. Administration of Vaccination The vaccine or placebo will be administered intramuscularly to alternating deltoid regions, per the Time and Events Schedule (Table 8). The vaccine or placebo will be administered in accordance with formulation and vaccination procedures outlined in the MOP. 10.1.2. Handling of Study Samples Samples collected under this protocol will be used to conduct protocol -related safety and immunogenicity eval uations. Sera and whole blood will be stored at the WRAIR in quality - controlled environments. Transport and storage of these biological samples will be handled according to appropriate procedures. Any study for the future use of these biologica l samples will undergo appropriate regulatory review . All subjects will consent for the future use of their specimens. 10.2. Concomitant Medications Subjects taking regular medication (i .e., birth control pills) prior to enrollment in the trial will be allowed to continue to take this medication unless it is specifically excluded as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the trial. Subjects needing to take non -approved or excluded medication will not be eligible for enrollment in this study. Investigators will make determinations of continued eligibility throughout the trial. Any medication ordered by the study physician during the course of the trial will be documented on appropriate source documents. Medications being taken prior to and duri ng the course of the trial will also be documented in this manner. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 48 10.3. Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance All vaccines will be administered or witnessed by a study investigator, clinical research coordinator, or designee. 11. Laboratory and Clinical Asse ssment 11.1. Blood Sample Collection Study serology and immunological analyses will be performed from blood samples drawn at several of the follow up clinic appointments. Blood for serologic assays will be obt ained per the Time and Events Schedule . 11.2. Stool Sampl e Collection Stool will be collected from subjects for immunogenicity testing for fecal IgA. Subjects will be provided stool hats to self -collect all stools which will be processed within two hours of receipt in the CTC and within 8 hours of collection by the subject, according to study specific procedures that have been utilized successfully for other enteric disease studies. 11.3. Saliva Sample Collection Collection of saliva samples will be performed utilizing synthetic oral swabs ( Oracol Swab; Malvern Medical ). The subject will gently rub the sponge portion of the Oracol Swab along their gum line for approximately one minute. Subjects will be instructed not to eat or drink anything, including chewing gum or tobacco , for 10 minutes prior to saliva collection. S ubjects will be instructed to avoid drinking alcohol or using mouthwash for 24 hours and to avoid caffeinated beverages for 12 hours prior to collecting the sample. Saliva collection will proceed regardless of subject compliance with these instructions. No ncompliance with these instructions will not be considered a protocol deviation but will be documented. 11.4. Study Safety Management The IRB, research monitor, and PI will review any safety concerns. Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; th erefore, safety concerns will be identified by continuous review of the data by the PI, clinic staff, Research Monitor, and PSRT. 11.4.1. Protocol Safety Review Team The Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT), comprised of the Principal Investigator, the PATH Medical Officer, and the Independent Research Monitor will routinely monitor safety throughout the duration of the trial. The PSRT will be chaired by the Independent Research Monitor , and may seek additional independent expert medical opinion as dictated by needs. Emmes will prepare blinded safety reports for review by the PSRT. These reports will provide at a minimum the following information: 1) accrual and participant status data with regard to completion of study vaccinations and study visits; and 2) summaries of solicited and unsolicited adverse events including safety labs. The PSRT safety review will be conducted electronically (or by teleconference when needed). In addition to safety review, the PSRT may elect to discuss trial conduct issues that impact stu dy integrity and participant safety. These may include but are not limited to data quality, critical monitoring findings, study product, research specimens, etc. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 49 Emmes will also notify the PSRT of ad hoc safety reviews whenever it is aware of SUSAR or adve rse events that meet pre -specified study pause criteria as per section 8.10. In addition to routine review of safety information, a central role of the PSRT is the blinded review of safety data for the recommendation of whether to progress to the next dose level in each cohort and to the next cohort. Cumulative safety data will be available continuously for review by PSRT members, and safety reports will be prepared for each PSRT deliberation of dose escalation and progression to subsequent cohorts. 11.4.2. Research Monitor The research monitor will function as an independent safety advocate for subjects per Army Regulation 70 -25 and DoD Instruction 3216.02. An independent r esearch monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, SAEs, and all subject deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event. At a minimum, the research monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and, in the case of an SAE or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The research monitor should also indicate whether he or she concurs with the details of the report provided by t he study investigator. Reports for events determined by either the investigator or research monitor to be possibly or definitely related to participation and reports of events resulting in death should be promptly forwarded to the IRB. 11.5. Specification of Saf ety Endpoints 11.5.1. Local and Systemic Reactions Signs and symptoms will be specifically surveyed at each visit as well a s by patient self -report using a symptom diary. Symptoms that will be specifically solicited are listed in section 11.6.2 . Additionally, we will record all unsolicited symptoms. These local reactions will be coded for severity based on the subject and investigator severity grading scale. 11.5.2. Vital Signs Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate) will be obtained at each study visit (Table 9). Table 9: Reference Ranges and Adverse Event Coding for Vital Sign Parameters Vital Signs Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Heart Rate Tachycardia 101-115 116-130 > 130 ER visit or hospitalizati on for arrhythmia Bradycardia 50-54a 45-49 < 45 Pressure Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 50 Vital Signs Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Hypertension (systolic, mm Hg) 141-150 151-155 > 155 ER visit/hospitalizati on for malignant hypertension Hypertension (diastolic, mm Hg) 91-95 96-100 > 100 ER visit/hospitalizati malignant hypertension (systolic, mm Hg)b 85-89 80-84 < 80 ER visit/hospitalizati on for hypotensive shock a Grade 1 bradycardia will not be considered an abnormality for this study unless judged to be clinically significant by the PI or the PI in consultation with the research monitor and sponsor. b If a subject has a baseline systolic blood pressure in the 90s then a decrease in blood pressure < 10 without associated clinical symptoms will not be considered an abnormality for this study unless judged to be clinically significant by the PI. c If a subject visits an emergency room for a non -life-threatening illness or symptoms (i.e., visi ts emergency department on weekend for mild problems because the physician 's office is closed), the severity of the AE will be assessed according to the subject's clinical signs and symptoms. 11.5.3. Physical Examination A complete physical exam will be conducted during the screening visit as part of the screening process. Subsequent focused clinical examinations will occur at each study visit with specific attention to the identification of local, systemic, or other adverse reactions. 11.5.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessme nts Venous blood samples will be collected for chemistries and hematology. Hematology and chemistry analyses (BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT, electrolytes, and glucose) w ill occur per the Time and Events Schedule . Hematology and chemistry analyses will be perfo rmed by a commercial laboratory (Quest Diagnostics, Incorporated). Additional specimens may be collected to confirm and evaluate any abnormal values. The clinical toxicity grading scale that will be used as a guideline is based on the Guidance for Industry : Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. Final grading determination will be made by the PI based on normal lab values for the specific lab and clinical symptoms. If any additional safety labs are performed, the FDA Guidance for Industry will be utilized. 11.5.4.1. Hematology The following hematology parameters ( Table 10) will be assessed: White blood cell count (and differential) Red blood cell count Hematocrit Platelet count Hemoglobin Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 51 Table 10: Reference Ranges and Ad verse Event Coding for Clinical Hematology Parameters Test Quest Normal Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Hemoglobin (g/dL) (for screening purposes only) M: LLN of normal (used to grade toxicity)a 0.5-1.5 125-139 100-124 25-99 < 25 a In an instance where a post -vaccination hemoglobin result is below the Quest normal range, an AE is recorded when the post -vaccination value represents a decrease of 0.5 g/dL from that subject's baseline value. If a subject has a decrease in hemoglobin 0.5 g/dL but remains within the Quest normal range, that will not be documented as an AE. 11.5.4.2. Blood Chemistry The following clinical chemistry parameters listed in Table 11 will be assessed: Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 52 Table 11: Reference Ranges and Adverse Event Coding for Blood Chemistry Parameters Test Quest Normal Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Sodium 135-146 C-Reactive Protein (CRP) will be assessed on study days 1, 2, and 8. CRP assessment is for exploratory purposes only (immunologic response and safety endpoints) and will not be used as an eligibility criterion or safety signal. There are few published reports addressing healthy subjects' CRP response s after vaccination. Both the correlation of CRP to immune responses and to systemic AEs (malaise, fever) has been performed in these trials [21-24]. In this trial, collection of CRP will be limited to baseline and two time points after initial vaccination. 11.5.4.4. Virus Testing Testing for evidence of HIV -1/HIV -2, HCV, and HBV infections will be obtained during the screening process as delineated in the ti me and events schedule ( Table 8) and no earlier than 14 days before initial vaccination. Evidence of infection will make a subject ineligible. Additional diagnostic testing will not be performed as part of this study. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 53 11.5.4.5. HLA -B27 Screen Serologic evidence of HLA -B27 will be obtained durin g the screening process (Days -60 to -9). Evidence of HLA -B27 positivity will make a subject ineligible. 11.5.4.6. Drug Screen No drug scr eening is planned for this study described herein. 11.5.4.7. Pregnancy Screen A urine sample for pregnancy testing (female subjects of childbearing capacity ) will be collected at the screening visit. Pregnancy tests will also be obtained on each day of vaccination a nd at the final in-clinic study visit. A positive pregnancy test prior to vaccination will result in no additional study vaccinations being provided. Any subjects who become pregnant during the study will be removed from receiving further treatment with In vaplex AR-DETOX and followed until the end of their pregnancy. Procedures to be followed in the event a study participant becomes pregnant during the study period are outlined in 11.9.2.1 . 11.6. IND Safety Reporting The following terms, as defined by 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32, apply to IND safety reporting. 11.6.1. Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE, as defined by the ICH guideline for GCP, is \"Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. \" Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable poss ibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, \"reasonable\" possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of c ertainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. An AE is considered any adverse change or exacerbation from a baseline condition that occurs following the initial administration of an investigational product whether or not the event is considered to be related to the investigational product. Examples of this include but are not limited to the following: Adverse changes including new signs and symptoms, intercurrent illness modifying the clinical course, or the worsening of a baseline condition including the increased frequency of an event or an increased intensity of a condition Concomitant disease with onset or increased severity after the start of study product administration A new pattern in a preexisting co ndition occurring after the receipt of investigational product that may signal a clinically meaningful change Clinically significant changes in laboratory values Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 54 11.6.2. Solicited Adverse Event s A solicited AE is a predetermined event, identified in the Investigat or's Brochure, which may reflect safety concerns related to the investigational product. The solicited AEs for this study include: Site pain Site tenderness Swelling Induration (determined by investigator exam) Site redness Pruritus Fever Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Diarrhea (loose stools) Appetite change Fatigue Headache Myalgias ( general pain or soreness in muscles) Arthralgias ( general pain in joints) Malaise 11.6.3. Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"serious\" if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor it results in any of the following outcomes: Death Life-threatening AE Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Persistent or significan t incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions Congenital anomaly/birth defect (Abortion, stillbirth, and any malformation/disease must be reported as an SAE.) An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"life threatening\" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 55 does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have cau sed death. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic reactions or bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 11.6.4. Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"unexpected\" if it is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. It can also be considered \"unexpected\" if an Investigator's Brochure is not required or available and is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzy mes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator's Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, also refe rs to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particu lar drug under investigation. 11.6.5. Other Adverse Event Other AEs will be identified by the PI during the evaluation of safety data. Significant AEs of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuatio n of the subject from the study will be classified as other AEs. For each, a narrative may be written and included in the clinical study report. 11.7. Relationship to Investigational Product (Assessment of Causality) The PI must assign a relationship of each AE to the receipt of the investigational product. The investigator will use clinical judgment in conjunction with the assessment of a plausible biologic mechanism, a temporal relationship between the onset of the event in relation to receipt of the investigational product, and ide ntification of possible alternate etiologies including underlying disease, concurrent illness, or concomitant medications. The following guidelines will be used by investigators to assess the relationship of an AE to study product administration. Not relat ed: No relationship to the study product. Applies to those events for which evidence exists that there is an alternate etiology. Unlikely: Likely unrelated to the investigational product. Likely to be related to factors other than the study product but can not be ruled out with certainty. Possible: An association between the event and the administration of the investigational product cannot be ruled out. There is a reasonable temporal association, but there may also Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 56 be an alternative etiology such as the sub ject's clinical status or underlying factors including other therapy. Probable: There is a high degree of certainty that a relationship to the investigational product exists. There is a reasonable temporal association, and the event cannot be explained by known characteristics of the subject's clinical state or factors including other therapy. Definite: An association exists between the receipt of the investigational product and the event. An association to other factors has been ruled out. 11.8. Recording Advers e Events 11.8.1. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints AEs, solicited AEs, and SAEs will be assessed at all study visits, documented in the source records, and recorded on the eCRFs using accepted medical terms and/or the diagnose s that accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The investigator will assess all AEs for seriousness, relationship to the investigational p roduct, severity, and other possible etiologies. When an event has not resolved by the prescribed reporting period, it will be documented on the AE eCRF as \" unknown .\" The time frame for the collection of AEs and SAEs begins at the first administration of investigational product through 28 days after the last dose of investigational product is administered. Additionally, subjects will be contacted by t elephone approximately 6 months after the final vaccination to assess for any new -onset SAEs since particip ation in the trial . 11.8.2. Duration of Follow -up of Subjects After Adverse Events The PI and/or subinvestigators will follow SAEs to resolution, even if this extends beyond the prescribed reporting period. Resolution is the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the probability that it will become chronic. SAE outcomes will be reported to the sponsor using the supplemental Serious Adverse Event Report Form. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs in former subjects ; however, if an SAE, considered to be related to the investigational product is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time following completion of the study, the event will be reported to the sponsor as defined in sectio n 11.9.1.1 . 11.8.3. Severity Assessment All AEs will be assessed for severity by the investigator. The investigating team will execute the investigator severity scale below . Inherent in this assessment is the medical and clinical consideration of all information surrounding the event including any medical intervention required. Each event will be assigned one of the following categories: mild, moder ate, severe , or potentially lif e-threatening . See section 11.5.2 for vital signs and section 11.5.4 for laboratory values for further guidance in the assignment of severity. The following criteria may be used for any symptom not included in the grading scale. The eCRF for AEs will reflect only the highest severity for con tinuous days an event occurred. Mild Grade 1 Does not interfere with routine activities Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 57 Minimal level of discomfort Moderate Grade 2 Interferes with routine activities Moderate level of discomfort Severe Grade 3 Unable to perform routine activities Significant level of discomfort Potentially life -threatening Grade 4 Hospitalization or ER visit for potentially life-threatening event FDA guidelines for toxicity will be followed; however, if a subject is evaluated in an emergency room for a non -life-threatening illness or symptoms (i .e., visits emergency department on weekend for mild problems because the physician's office is closed), the information from that visit will be reviewed, and severity of the AE will be assessed according to the subject's clinical signs and symptoms. 11.9. Reporting Adverse Events The PI will report all AEs to the sponsor and the local IRB in the appropriate safety, annual, and/or final reports. The investigative team will prepare annual reports and final reports f or submission to the FDA. 11.9.1. Reporting Serious and Adverse Events Contact information for reporting SAEs and unanticipated problems is provided in Table 12. 11.9.1.1. Reporting to the Sponsor All SAEs and unexpected AEs must be reported promptly (wi thin 72 hours) to the sponsor , whether or not the event is considered related to the study product. Further, the investigator should comply with relevant study -site SOPs on reporting SAEs. The information that t he investigator will provide to the sponsor is specified in Table 13. The sponsor may request additional informa tion for purposes of the study .

The sponsor will report unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the drug to the FDA as specified in 21 CFR 312.32 (c). Investigators must follow all relevant regulatory require ments as well as specific policy at each institution regarding the timely reporting of SAEs to the NMRC IRB, and the research monitor. 11.9.1.2. Reporting to the IRB Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, SAEs related to participation in the study, and all subject deaths should be promptly reported by phone, e -mail, or fax to the local IRB. It is the NMRC's policy to report to the IRB within 24 hours after determination of the event. A formal written report is due within 5 business days of AE re porting. The following AEs should be considered as unanticipated problems that must be reported to the IRB: A single occurrence of a serious, unexpected, and uncommon event that is strongly associated with exposure to the investigational product. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 59 A single or small number of a serious, unexpected event that is not commonly associated with exposure to the investigational product but is uncommon in the study population. Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on aggregate analysis, is determined to be an un anticipated problem. There should be a determination that the series of AEs represents a signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and involve risk to human subjects. An AE that is described in the Investigator's Brochure, protocol, or informe d consent documents but occurs at a specificity or severity that is inconsistent with prior observations. An SAE that is described in the Investigator's Brochure, protocol, or informed consent documents but for which there is a clinically significant incre ase in the expected rate of occurrence. Any other AE or safety finding, including those based on animal or epidemiologic data that would cause the sponsor to modify the Investigator's Brochure, protocol, or informed consent documents or would prompt other action by the IRB to ensure the protection of human subjects. All SAEs will be reported to the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) by the sponsor according to the WIRB guidelines and using the WIRB Promptly Reportable Information Form. WIRB Phone: 800-562-4789, Fax: 360 -252-2498 PATH is required to report SAEs or other events that fit the following criteria within 5 working days of the time of becoming aware of them: New or increased risk Protocol deviation that harmed a subject or placed subject at risk of harm Protocol deviation made without prior IRB approval to eliminate an immediate hazard to a subject Audit, inspection, or inquiry by a federal agency Written reports of federal agencies (e.g., FDA Form 483) Allegation of Noncompliance or Finding of Noncompliance Breach of confidentiality Unresolved subject complaint Suspension of premature termination by the sponsor, investigator, or institution Incarceration of a subject in a research study not approved to involve prisoners Adverse events or IND safety reports that require a change to the protocol or consent State medical board actions Unanticipated adverse device effect Information where the sponsor requires prompt reporting to the IRB Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 60 11.9.2. Reporting Additional Immediately Reportable Events to the Sp onso r and the NMRC IRB 11.9.2.1. Pregnancy Each pregnancy must be reported immediately (within 72 hours of identification) by e-mail or fax to the sponsor and the NMRC IRB. Subjects who become pregnant after receiving the first dose of vaccine or up to 3 months after the last vaccination will be followed to term, and information will be gathered for outcome, date of delivery, and health status of the mother and child including the child's gender, length, and weight. Complications and/or abnormalities should be report ed including any premature terminations. A pregnancy is reported as an AE or SAE only when there is suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of contraception or there was a serious complication in the pregnancy including a spontaneous abortion or an elective termination for medical rationale. Principal investigator will notify study monitor, the local IRB, the research monitor and the sponsor for subjects that become pregnant during the study. The subject will be asked to provide serial follow -ups on the status of her pregnancy as well as provide health information on her infant following delivery. The subject will be asked to provide copies of clinic visits only if needed. The Subjects will receive no further vac cinations but will continue safety monitoring and all follow up visits as noted in the study schedule. 11.9.2.2. Adverse Event -related Withdrawal of Consent Any AE-related withd rawal of consent due to a safety concern during the study must be reported immediately (within 72 hours of identification) by e-mail or fax to the sponso r and the NMRC IRB. 11.9.2.3. Pending Inspections/Issuance of Reports The knowledge of any pending compliance inspection/visit by the FDA, Office for Human Research Protections (Department of Health and Human Services), or other government agency concerning clinical investigation or research, the issuance of Inspection Repor ts, Form FDA 483, warning letters, or actions taken by any regulatory agency including legal or medical actions, and any instances of serious or continuing noncompliance with the regulations or requirements will be reported immediately to the NMRC IRB and the sponsor . 11.9.3. IND Annual Report to the FDA The PI will be responsible for the preparation of a detailed annual synopsis of clinical activity, including AEs, for submission to the sp onsor . Each annual report will summarize IND activity for 1 year beginning a pproximately 3 months before the IND FDA anniversary da te. The sponsor will notify the PI of the due date with sufficient time for the PI to assemble the required information. 11.9.4. Final Report A final study report will be prepared in accordance with Guidance for Industry: Submission of Abbreviated Reports and Synopses in Support of Marketing Applications and ICH E3 Guideline Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 61 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Report s and provided to the spo nsor for rev iew and approval. The sponsor will use this report to prepare the submission to the FDA. 12. Statistics Detailed statistical procedures, listings, table shells, and figures will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) written shor tly after protocol approval but before any subject enrollment. The SAP will be finalized before study closeout and database lock. The following key statistical components will be considered, and a detailed description will be documented in the SAP: Primary and secondary endpoints and how they will be measured, Statistical methods and tests that will be used to analyze the endpoints, Strategy that will be used if the statistical test assumptions are not satisfied, Indication of whether the comparisons will b e one -tailed or two -tailed (with justification of the choice) and the level of significance to be used, Identification of whether any adjustments to the significance level or the overall p value will be made to account for any planned or unplanned subgroup analyses or multiple testing, Specification of potential adjusted analyses and a statement of which covariates or factors will be included, Planned exploratory analyses and justification with their importance, and Any subgroup effects with biological just ification and support from within and outside the study. 12.1. Description of Statistical Methods 12.1.1. Analysis Addressing the Primary Study Objective (Safety Analysis) The primary objective of this study is safety of the Invaplex AR-DETOX vaccination. All immunized subjects will be included in the safety analysis. AE data will be listed individually and summarized by system organ class and preferred terms within a system organ class for each treatment group. Serious and/or unexpected AEs will also be discussed on a ca se-by-case basis. For the tabulation of AEs by system organ class , a subject will be counted only once in a given system organ class . For example, a subject reporting nausea and diarrhea will be reported as one subject, but the symptoms will be listed as t wo separate AEs within the class. Therefore, the total number of AEs reported within a system organ class may exceed the number of subjects within the system organ class reporting AEs. Rates of all adverse events will be analyzed by Pearson's Chi -square te st (or Fisher's exact test if assumptions are not met for Pearson's Chi -square), to compare groups, if applicable. Summary tables will be created to indicate the number of subjects who experienced events. Vaccine -related events (definitely, probably, or po ssibly related) will be tabulated by study group. In addition, tables will be prepared to list each adverse event, the number of subjects in each treatment group Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 62 who experienced an event at least once, and the rate of subjects with adverse event(s). Advers e events will be divided into defined severity grades (mild, moderate, seve re, potentially life - threatening ). The tables will also divide the adverse events by relationship to the investigational product if applicable. All immunized subjects will be includ ed in the safety analysis. Clinical and laboratory data regarding safety, which include vital signs and safety laboratory measures, will be included in the primary analysis. Changes in pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and respirat ory rate will be compared within each group and among groups using analysis of variance procedures. For hematology and serum chemistry tests, the mean, mean change, median, median change, and range of all values for each test for each treatment group at ba seline and for the final \"on therapy\" values will be tabulated. The tables will also divide the adverse events into those considered at least possibly related to the vaccine and those considered not related. If serious adverse events occur, they will be li sted separately delineating outcome, tre atment, concomitant medication, relevant medical history , and laboratory measurements. 12.1.2. Analysis Addressing the Secondary Study Objective For immunology responses, both qualitative (responder rates) and quantitative (e.g., log 10 transformed values) results will be analyzed. Geometric mean titers will be calculated for serological responses along with their 95% confidence intervals (or standard deviation). If appropriate, between groups comparisons will be examined wit h nonparametric median tests (Kruskal -Wallis for continuous data and Fisher's exact test for categorical data) unless assumptions are fulfilled for Student's t or 2. Additional comparisons may be made using repeated measures analysis of variance with stud y group as the between subject factor and sample collection time -points as the repeated factor. Only subjects who receive at least 2 vaccine doses will be included in the immunology analysis. All statistical tests will be interpreted in a two -tailed fashio n using an =0.05 to represent statistical significance. 12.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Data Analyses Hemat ology and serum chemistry test values will be analyzed and evaluated. These evaluations will be reviewed by the PI or research monitor to evaluate whether any s ignificant trends in laboratory values occurred. 12.2. Planned Enrollment and Reason for Sample Size A total of 60 subjects are planned for this study. The sample size for this study is limited by the early stage (Phase 1) of the product concept/testing and is designed to evaluate preliminary safety data but not designed to show statistically significant differences b etween groups. Given the small number of subjects per group , the precision of our estimate for AEs is limited. For example, using binomial probability formulae for no obser ved adverse events within the 16 subjects yields a 95% confidence interval of 0 -21%. Follow -on studies evaluating seemingly safe and immunogenic doses will be required with larger numbers of volunteers to better define the safety profile. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 63 12.3. Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data Non-analyzable data will be documented in the devia tions. 12.4. Procedures for Reporting Deviations from the Original Statistical Plan Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan as indicated in the protocol will be described in an amendment to the protocol and the SAP. Deviations from the SAP will be do cumented in accordance with NMRC SOPs. 12.5. Selection of Subjects to Be Included in Analyses All subjects who receive at least one dose of the investigational product will be included in the safety analyses. All subjects who receive at least two doses of the i nvestigational product will be included in the immunological analyses . 13. Direct Access to Source Data/Documents Subjects will be identified on eCRFs by a unique subject identification number and on source documents by name and date of birth. No personal iden tifier will be used in any publication or communication used to support this research study. The subject identification number will be used if it becomes necessary to identify data specific to a single subj ect. Representatives of the sponsor , the local IRB , and the FDA are eligible to review medical and research records related to this study as a part of their responsibility to protect human subjects in clinical research. Personal identifiers will be removed from photocopied medical and research records. 13.1. Study Monitoring Study monitoring will be the re sponsibility of the clinical monitoring team . Upon successful approval of the protocol and establishment of the regulatory file, the clinical monitor will establish a clinical monitoring plan. To ensure that th e investigator and the study staff understand and accept their defined responsibilities, the clinical monitor will maintain regular correspondence with the site and may be present during the course of the study to verify the acceptability of the facilities , compliance with the investigational plan and relevant regulations, and the maintenance of complete records. The clinical monitors may observe study procedures as needed to ensure subject safety and rights are protected and verify compliance with the prot ocol. Monitoring visits will be scheduled to take place at the initiation of the study, during the study at appropriate intervals, and after the last subject has completed the study. A report of monitoring observations will be provided to the PI (for corre ctive actions), the sponsor , and the product manager. 13.2. Audits and Inspections Authorized representatives of the sponsor, the FDA, the Independent Ethics Committee or IRB, and the Department of the Navy Human Research Protections Program may visit the site t o perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of the audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted and d ata were recorded, Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 64 analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should cont act the sponsor and the NMRC IRB immediately (within 24 hours) if contacted by a regulatory age ncy about an inspection. 13.3. Institutional Review Board s The PI must obtain IRB approval for the study. Initial IRB approval and all materials approved by the IRB for this study, including the subject consent form and recruitment materials, must be maintained by the investigator and made available for inspection. The PI will be responsible for preparing and submitting continuing review reports per institution and IRB policies. The PI or a designee will submit the approved continuing review reports and the local IRB approval notifications to HRPO (if applicable) as soon as the documents are available. WIRB will provide sponsor level review for PATH Vaccine Solutions (PVS) for this study. PVS will submit the AE/SAE to WIRB only if it is considered unanticipated an d related to study product(s) according to the WIRB defined procedures. 14. Quality Control and Quality Assurance During the study, the investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation for the study, including records detailing the progress of th e study for each subject; laboratory reports; eCRFs; a signed informed consent form for each study subject; drug disposition records; correspondence with the IRB, the study monitor and the sponsor; AE reports; and information regarding subject discontinuat ion and completion of the study. All required study data will be recorded clearly and accurately by authorized study personnel in the eCRFs. Only designated study -site personnel shall record or change data in the eCRFs. During the study, the investigator w ill be responsible for ensuring the quality of data recorded in the eCRFs as per written eCRF completion guidelines. To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requiremen ts, the sponsor may conduct quality assurance audits. Auditing of th e clinical trial may be conducted at any time during the study to ensure continued compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures. Auditing will be undertaken, as needed, by independ ent personnel designated by the sponsor. Audit findings will be doc umented in a formal audit report that will detail the conduct of the audit and summarize the observations noted. 15. Ethics 15.1. Ethics Review The study is based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation and will be conducted under a protocol re viewed by the NMRC IRB. The study is to be conducted by scientifically and medically qualified persons. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 65 respected, the physicians conducting the study will ensure that the hazards do not outweigh the potential benefits, the results to be reported will be accurate, subjects will give their informed consent and will be competent to do so and not under duress, and all study staff will comply with the ethical principles in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Belmont Principles. 15.1.1. Review/Approval of Study Protocol Before a clinical study can be initiated, the study protocol and other required documents wil l be submitted to the following for review and/or approval. Additionally, the protocol may be presented to the USAMRMC Commanding General prior to study initiation. The timing of that presentation will vary depending on other extraneous factors. NMRC Scientific Review Board PATH NMRC IR B Commander, WRAIR FDA WIRB (sponsor level review) Enrollment in this protocol may not begin until all approvals have been obtained and the sponsor has authorized study start. The investigator will not take actions that require protocol amendment for any r eason without obtaining appropriate review/approval, except in cases of medical emergencies. 15.1.2. Protocol Modifications All modifications to the protocol and supporting documents (informed consent, MOP , SOPs, recruitment materials, etc .) must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Any protocol amendment will be agreed upon by the sponsor prior to submission to the local IRB and prior to implementation of said change or modification. The informed consent document must be revised to concur with any am endment as appropriate and must also be reviewed and approved with the amendment. Any subject already enrolled in the study will be informed about the revision and asked to sign the revised informed consent document if the modification directly affects the individual's participation in the study. A copy of the revised, signed, and dated informed consent document will be given to the subject. All original versions of the informed consent document will be retained in the protocol regulatory file, and a copy w ill be retained in the clinic medical record. Any modification that could potentially increase risk to subjects must be submitted to the NMRC IRB, WIRB, and the FDA for approval prior to implementation. Documentation that the local IRB reviewed and approve d the modifications also will be submitted. All other amendments will also be submitted to the NMRC IRB for inclusion in the HRPP study file. 15.1.3. Protocol Deviation Procedures All subject -specific deviations from the protocol (e .g., failure to return for follo w-up visits or blood collection within the time indicated in the protocol) are to be documented. The PI or Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 66 designee will be responsible for identifying and reporting all deviations, which are defined as isolated occurrences involving a procedure that did n ot follow the study protocol or MOP . Deviations will be reported annually in the continuing review report to the IRB and HRPO, if appropriate. The PI or subinvestigator will assess action taken in response to the deviation and the impact of the deviation. Any protocol deviation that adversely affects the safety or rights of a subject or the scientific integrity of the study will be reported immediately to the sponsor and the NMRC IRB. 15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study This study will be conducted in accordance w ith all applicable federal and DoD human research protections requirements and the Belmont Principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The procedures set out in this study are designed to ensure t hat the sponsor and all study personnel abi de by the principles of the ICH GCP Guideline and the CFR. The PI confirms this by signing this study protocol and Form FDA 1572. 15.2.1. Confidentiality In this research, the subject's health information will be collected and used to conduct the study; monitor th e subject's health status; measure effects of the investigational product; determine research results; and possibly to develop new tests, procedures, and commercial products. Health information is used to report resul ts of research to the sponsor and feder al regulators and may be reviewed during study audits for compliance with study plans, regulations, and research policies. After the study ends, each subject has the right to see and receive a copy of his or her information. The sponsor , the DoD, and the F DA are eligible to photocopy and review records related to this protocol as a part of their responsibility to protect the participants of this treatment protocol. No personal identifier will be used in any publication or communication used to support this research study. The subject's identification number will be used in the event it becomes necessary to identify data specific to a single subject. All study procedures will be conducted per GCP guidelines, and every effort will be made to protect volunteer privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible. All study -related information will be stored securely at the study site or at a designated, secure off-site location. While not in use and under immediate control of study staff, all volunteer information will be stored in locked areas with access limited to study staff. Data collection, process and administrative forms, laboratory specimens, and other reports will be identified exclusively by a coded number to maintain volunteer confidentiality. All local databases will be secured with password -protected access systems. Volunteers' study information will not be released without their written permission, except as necessary for monitoring or compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Additionally, th e study team does not foresee any commercial value for the samples collected in this study. Medical records containing identifying information may be made available for review when the sponsor or an authorized regulatory agency monitors the study. Direct a ccess may include Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 67 examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the study. 15.2.2. Compensation for Participation Compensation will occur at the time of each designated visit. Compensation will be provided only for completed study procedures designated for compensatory payment. Subjects will only be eligible for compensation outlined in the informed consent documents at the time their consent is obtained. If a subject is eligible to participate in t he investigation protocol after screening, he or she will receive the following compensation: Civilian/off -duty Day 8: $100 + $20 (if subjects return and complete symptom Day 22: $150 Day 23: $100 Day 29: $100 + $20 subjects return complete symptom 43: $150 Day 44: $100 Day 50: $100 +$20 57: $100 Day 71: $160 Total: $1,495 (maximum if subjects return all symptom diaries) If subjects do not complete the study, their compensation will be less in proportion to the amount they did not complete. Visits that are not specifically planned in the protocol, such as may be required to repeat labs to verify/clarify re sults or labs drawn to better evaluate abnormal lab values or adverse events may be compensated at the discretion of the PI relative to the severity of the event and scope of evaluation. Subjects asked to come to the clinic as an alternate on the first vac cination day of a cohort may be compensated $50 if they are not enrolled in the cohort. Federal Employee/on -duty military compensation: By regulation, active duty personnel and federal employees can be compensated only for visits in which blood draws occur , and then only $50 per visit, unless the visits occur during off -duty hours or when they are on leave. If the volunteer is off -duty or on leave, he or she will be paid Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 68 the same as non -military/non -federal personnel. The total amount of compensation may va ry depending on the number of visits completed. Screening: $25 Day -7: $50 Day 1: $50 Redress of Research -Related Injury All study -related medical care will be provided without cost. Should a subject be injured as a direct result of participating in this research project, he or she will be provided medical care by the staff at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (or other military -affiliated medical center), at no cost to the subject, for that injury. Subjects will not receive any injury or disability compensation, only medical care. Subjects will not be compensated for care if they choose to seek care from their own physicians. All nonexempt research involving human subjects shall, at a minimum, meet the requirement of 32 CFR 219.116(a)(6). If a subject is injured because of participation in this research and is a DoD health care beneficiary (e .g., active duty in the military, military spouse or dependent), the subject is entitled to medical care for that injury within the DoD health care system as long as the subject remains a DoD health care beneficiary. This care includes, but is not limited to, free medical ca re at Army hospitals or clinics. If a subject is injured because of participation in this research and is not a DoD health care beneficiary, the subject is entitled to free medical care for that injury at an Army hospital or clinic. It cannot be determined in advance which Army hospital or clinic will provide care. If the subject receives care for research -related injuries outside of an Army hospital or clinic, the subject or the subject's medical insurance will be responsible for medical expenses. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 69 For all subjects: Transportation to and from Army hospitals or clinics will not be provided. No reimbursement is available if the subject incurs long-term medical expenses to treat research - related injuries. No compensation is available for research -related injuri es or related disability . The subject is not waiving any legal rights. The subject should contact the PI if the subject believes he or she has sustained a research -related injury. The subject should contact the PI for any questions. Requests for other bene fits, such as compensation for lost time from work, are processed independently of this protocol. Military members retain the right to pursue military disability benefits, and federal civilian employees retain the right to pursue relief through established workers' compensation processes, but neither military disability benefits nor workers' compensation benefits are guaranteed. The right of other parties to seek redress against the US Government is limited to that set forth by existing agency regulations a nd the Federal Tort Claims Act. The subject should understand that this does not constitute a waiver or release of legal rights. This issue is addressed in the informed consent and will be discussed with the subject by the investigator or designee before t he subject signs the informed consent to participate in the study. 15.3. Written Informed Consent The informed consent process and document(s) will be reviewed and approved by the IRB and sponsor prior to initiation of the study. The consent document(s) contains a full explanation of the possible risks, advantages, and alternate treatment options, and availability of treatment in the case of injury, in accordance with 21 CFR 50. The consent document indicates that by signature, the subject, or where appropriate, legal guardian, permits access to relevant research records by the sponsor and by represent atives of the FDA. The sponsor will submit a copy of the initial IRB- and sponsor - approved consent form to the FDA and will maintain copies of revised consent docum ents that have been reviewed and approved by the IRB/ethics committee. A written informed consent document, in compliance with 21 CFR Part 50, 32 CFR Part 219 and the Belmont Principles will be signed by the subject before any study -related procedures are initiated for that subject. This consent document must be retained by the investigator as part of the study records. The investigators or their designees will present the protocol in lay terms to individual subjects. Questions on the purpose of the protoco l, protocol procedures, and risks to the subjects will then be solicited. Any question that cannot be answered will be referred to the PI. The subject will be allowed to take the consent document home to consider and discuss it with others and can return t o the CTC later to sign it. The subject should understand that the study product is an investigational drug and is not licensed by the FDA for commercial use but is permitted to be used in this clinical research. Informed consent includes the principle tha t it is critical the subject be informed about the principal potential risks and benefits. This information will allow the subject to make a personal risk versus benefit decision and understand the following: Participation is entirely voluntary, Subjects m ay withdraw from participation at any time, Refusal to participate involves no penalty, and Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 70 The individual is free to ask any questions that will allow him or her to understand the nature of the protocol. A description of this clinical trial will be availa ble on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by US law. Should the protocol be modified, the subject consent document must be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. If a previously enrolled subject is directly affected by the change, the subject will receive a copy of the revised informed consent document. The approved revision will be read, signed, and dated by the subject. Military personnel may be recruited by CTC personnel. No recruitment of military personnel will occur in the presence of his or her supervisor. There is no benefit to military personnel for participating in this study. There will be no coercion or disciplinary actions for not participating or withdrawing if enrolled. 16. Data Handling and Recordkeeping The primary source document for this study will be the subject's research record. If separate medical records are maintained by the investigator(s), the medical record and the research records will be considered the source documents for the purposes of aud iting the study. The source documents will be retained at the site. For this study, an EDC database system will be used for the collection of study data in an electronic format. The EDC database system will be designed based on the protocol requirements, t he approved eCRF layouts and specifications, and in accordance with 21 CFR Part 11. The eCRF layouts and specifications define and identify the applicable source data that will be collected and captured into the EDC database system. The applicable source d ata will be electronically transcribed by the site designee onto the eCRF (data entry screens) in the EDC database system. The investigator is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of data transcribed on the eCRF. Data monitoring and management will be p erformed in the EDC database system by the study monitor and the designated data management group. A detailed data management plan will be written and approved by the study team and the PI prior to study start , with approval by the sponsor . All updates to the data management plan must be approved before study closeout and database lock. 16.1. Inspection of Records The sponsor or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. T he investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, investigational product stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts, study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. Subjects' health information is used to report results of research to the sponsor and federal regulators and may be reviewed during study audits for compliance with study plans, regulations, and research policies. The consent document indicates that, by signature, the subject permits access to relevant research records by the sponsor and by representatives of the FDA. Invaplex AR-DETOX Version 6.0; 22 May 2019 71 The investigator must be aware that representatives from regulatory authorities or the IRB may wish to inspect the eCRFs and associated study records. The investigator will notify the sponsor within 24 hours following contact by a regulatory agency. The investigator and study coordinator must make the relevant records available for inspection and will be available to respond to reasonable requests and audit queries made by au thorized representatives of regulatory agencies. The investigator will provide the sponsor with copies of all correspondence that may affect the review of the current study or his or her qualification as an investigator in clinical studies conducted by the sponsor. The sponsor will provide needed assistance in responding to regulatory audits or correspondence. 16.2. Retention of Records The PI must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 2 years after the last marketing application approv al or, if not approved, for 2 years following the discontinuance of the investigational product for investigation. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor , their designee, or the FDA to review any documentation relating to the study, the investigator must permit access to such records. Completed, monitored records will be stored in a secure location . The PI will be responsible for retaining sufficient information about each subject, that is, name, address, telephone number, social security number, and subject identifier in the study, so that the sponsor , the local IRB, the FDA, employees of USAMRMC, or other regulatory authorities may have access to this information should the need arise. It is the policy of USAMRMC that data sheets are to be completed for all subjects participating in research (Form 60 -R, Volunteer Registry Data Sheet). The data sheets will be entered into this Command's Volunteer Registry Database. The information to be entered into this confidential database includes the subject's name, address, and social security number; study title; and dates of participation. The intent of this da tabase is twofold: first, to readily answer questions concerning an individual's participation in research sponsored by USAMRMC; and second, to ensure that USAMRMC can exercise its obligation to ensure research subjects are adequately warned (duty to warn) of risks and provided new information as it becomes available. The information will be stored at USAMRMC for a minimum of 75 years. The Volunteer Registry Database is a separate entity and is not linked to the study database. 17. Publication Policy All data c ollected during this study will be used to support this IND. All publications and presentations are governed by the standards and norms detailed in NAVMEDRSCHCENINST 5721.1. All authors will submit the proposed publication/presentation at least 30 days pri or to the submission date. Prior to submission, the directorate will conduct a substantive scientific and professional review. The document is routed to the Office of Research Administration (ORA) for review and routing for Command review and approval, ult imately by the NMRC Public Affairs Officer (PAO). Once it is cleared at NMRC, it may be forwarded to BUMED through NMSC, if appropriate. Prior to publication, an author must have a completed Publication Clearance Request Submission Form with signatures fro m all approving and reviewing authorities.
