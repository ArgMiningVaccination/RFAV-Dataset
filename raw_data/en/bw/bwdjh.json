Available Therapies We are proud to offer a wide range of integrative therapies. Click on the links below to learn more about each modality. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. A key component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is most commonly used to treat pain. But, increasingly, it is being used for overall wellness, including stress management. Massage Therapy involves using different pressures, movements, and techniques to manipulate muscles and other soft tissues in the body to slow down your nervous system. Massage therapy can be used to release stress and tension, provide relief from symptoms, heal injuries, and support wellness. Mental Wellness is defined by the World Health Organization as: \"A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\" At Middlesex Health Mental Wellness program, behavioral health and other specialty and primary care providers work together to form a Collaborative Care Team to best address multiple medical, psychiatric and psychosocial stressors that may be affecting one's life and partner with patients toward making changes that will bring them to overall greater health and well-being. Nutrition counseling is an ongoing process in which a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist (RD/RDN) works with an individual to assess their usual dietary intake and identify areas where change is needed. The nutrition counselor provides educational materials, support, and follow-up care to help the individual make and maintain the needed dietary changes. Reflexology is the stimulation of points on the hands and feet. Reflexology is generally relaxing and may help alleviate stress. The theory behind reflexology is that areas of the foot correspond to organs and systems of the body. Pressure applied to the foot is believed to bring relaxation and healing to the corresponding area of the body. Several studies indicate that reflexology may reduce pain or neuropathy and offers psychological benefits such as reducing stress and anxiety, and enhancing relaxation and sleep.
