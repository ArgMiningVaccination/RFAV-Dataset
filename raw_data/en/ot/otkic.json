This CHNA will help us develop strategies to address the priority needs of the communities we serve. The goals of this assessment are to: Engage public health and community stakeholders including low-income, minority and otherunderserved populations. Assess and understand the community's health issues and needs. Understand the health behaviors, risk factors and social determinants that impact health. Identify community resources and collaborate with community partners to develop collective strategies. Use findings to develop and implement a Community Health Plan (implementation strategy) based onthe Adventist Health Sonora's prioritized issues. Partnering with our communities for better health While conducting the CHNA, we solicited feedback and input from a broad range of stakeholders. Contributors to our CHNA process included Area 12 Agency on Aging, Sonora Area Foundation and Spiritual Road. Data sources Primary and secondary data sources are included in this report. Secondary sources include publicly available state and nationally recognized data sources available at the zip code, county and state level. Health indicators for social and economic factors, health system, public health and prevention, and physical environment are incorporated. The top leading causes of death as well as conditions of morbidity that illustrate the communicable and chronic disease burden across Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties are included. A significant portion of the data for this assessment was collected through a custom report generated through CARES Engagement Network CHNA (https://engagementnetwork.org/assessment/). Other sources include California Department of Public Health, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, and California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. When feasible, health metrics have been further compared to estimates for the state or national benchmarks, such as the Healthy People 2020 objectives. Adventist Health Sonora worked to identify relevant key informants and topical focus groups to gather more insightful data and aid in describing the community. Key informants and focus groups were purposefully chosen to represent medically under-served, low-income, or minority populations in our community, to better direct our investments and form partnerships. Results of the qualitative analysis, as well as a description of participants, can be found in Appendix D.Executive Summary2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 5 In addition, an online survey in English and Spanish was created and distributed for greater community input. It should be noted that the survey results are not based on a stratifi ed random sample of residents throughout the hospital' s service area. The perspectives captured in this data simply represent the community members who agreed to participate. In addition, this assessment relies on several national and state entities with publicly available data. All limitations inherent in these sources remain present for this assessment. Top priorities identified in partnership with our communities On August 26, 2019, HC2 Strategies, Inc. facilitated a strategy meeting with the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee to review the r esults of the CHNA and determine the top 3 priority needs that the Adventist Health Sonora will address, over the next three years. To aid in determining the priority health needs, the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee, which includes community leaders agreed on the criteria below to consider when making a decision. The criteria listed recognize the need for a combination of information types (e.g, health indicators and primary data) as well as consideration of issues such as practicality , feasibility , and mission alignment. Top health needs identified for 2019-2022 : Access to healthcare Mental and behavioral healthAddresses disparities of subgroups Availability of evidence or practice-based approaches Existing resources and programs to addressproblems Feasibility of intervention Identified community need Importance to communityMagnitude Mission alignment and resources of AdventistHealth Sonora Opportunity for partnership Opportunity to intervene at population level Severity Solution could impact multiple problems Access to providers including geriatric services and primary care providers Preventative care Transportation Substance abuse Trauma and isolation Chronic disease Asthma Obesity2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 6 Making a Difference: Results from our 2016 CHNA Adventist Health Sonora wants to ensure that our efforts are making the necessary changes in the communities we serve.

Under the leadership of Mr. Tyler Newton and his team \u2014 Mr. Mario DeLise and Mr. Matthew Rose, collaborated with Ms. Laura Acosta of HC2 Strategies, Inc. to conduct key informant interviews, focus groups, and establish priority health needs for the 2019-2021 community health needs cycle. The analysis method and rankings were invaluable in providing 'at a glance' information for informed decision making. Many of the key health indicators presented in this report were collected from the CARES Engagement Network CHNA. Other sources include California Department of Public Health, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, and California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Finally, we would like to express our sincere gratitude and thank our community members and organizations and all those who gave input for this report through key informant interviews and focus groups. Their perspectives ensure that we are taking into consideration the most vulnerable in our communities to better create initiatives, more meaningful partnerships, and strategic investments into our communities.Acknowledgments2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 11 Dear Friends and Colleagues, At Adventist Health Sonora, it is our greatest privilege to love and care for our community and improve lives by helping those around us achieve better health. Our mission, to live God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope, is at the heart of everything we do and is not constrained by the walls of our facilities. We live God's love at work, at home and out in our community. To truly provide a meaningful impact on the overall wellness of our community, we must fully understand the many factors affecting the health of the people we serve and work to address their greatest needs. Our 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment provides an in-depth analysis on the social, economic, environmental and health care determinants of health, including employment, housing, chronic disease, longevity, nutrition and physical fitness. This assessment allows us to identify opportunities and develop innovative ways of working together to provide programs and services that will have the greatest impact. Through effective partnerships we can improve the health of our community and influence the well-being of our families, friends and neighbors now and for generations to come. I look forward to working together with you as we discover new ways to serve our community. Thank you for your interest in creating a healthier Tuolumne County. Sincerely, Michelle Fuentes President Letter from the President2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 12 Introduction The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) represents our commitment to improving health outcomes in our community through rigorous assessment of health status in our region, incorporation of stakeholder's perspectives, and adoption of related implementation strategies to address priority health needs. The CHNA is conducted not only to partner for improved health outcomes, but also to satisfy our annual community benefit obligations by meeting requirements that are outlined in section 501(r)(3) of the Federal IRS Code, as well as, under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The goals of this assessment are to: Engage public health and community stakeholders including low-income, minority and otherunderserved populations. Assess and understand the community's health issues and needs. Understand the health behaviors, risk factors and social determinants that impact health. Identify community resources and collaborate with community partners. Use Assessment findings to develop and implement a Community Health Plan (implementation strategy)based on the Hospital's prioritized issues. Adventist Health overview Adventist Health Sonora is an affiliate of Adventist Health, a faith-based, nonprofit integrated health system serving more than 80 communities on the West Coast and Hawaii. Community has always been at the center of Adventist Health's mission \u2014 Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope. Founded on Seventh-day Adventist heritage and values, Adventist Health provides compassionate community care. Adventist Health entities include: 20 hospitals with more than 3,200 beds More than 280 clinics (hospital-based, rural health and physician clinics) 13 home care agencies and seven hospice agencies Four joint-venture retirement centers Compassionate and talented team of 35,000 associates, medical staff physicians, allied healthprofessionals and volunteers2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 13 We owe much of our heritage and organizational success to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has long been a promoter of prevention and whole person care. Inspired by our belief in the loving and healing power of Jesus Christ, we aim to bring physical, mental and spiritual health and healing to our neighbors of all faiths. Every individual, regardless of his/her personal beliefs, is welcome in our facilities. We are also eager to collaborate with members of other faiths to enhance the health of the communities we serve. Our commitment to quality health care stems from our heritage, which dates back to 1866 when the first Seventh- day Adventist health care facility opened in Battle Creek, Michigan. There, dedicated pioneers promoted the \"radical\" concepts of proper nutrition, exercise and sanitation. Early on, the facility was devoted to prevention as well as healing. They called it a sanitarium, a place where patients\u2014and their families\u2014could learn to be well. More than a century later, the health care system sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church circles the globe with more than 170 hospitals and more than 500 clinics, nursing homes and dispensaries worldwide. And the same vision to treat the whole person\u2014mind, body and spirit\u2014continues to provide the foundation for our progressive approach to health care. Mission Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope. Our values Integrity Compassion Respect Excellence Our vision Compelled by our mission to live God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope, we will transform the health experience of our communities by improving physical, mental and spiritual health; enhancing interactions; and making care more accessible and affordable.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 14 Adventist Health Sonora (AHSR) is located in the city of Sonora in Tuolumne County. Tuolumne County is located in the beautiful Sierra Nevada foothills and is located at the gateway to Gold Country. Bay Area natives move to Tuolumne County to retire and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The majority of our market is made up of retired and midscale mature adults with no kids. Tourism is a large part of Tuolumne County, as tourists escape from the heat of the summer in the Central Valley to go to one of many reservoirs for boating or swimming or visit Yosemite National Park. Winter tourists enjoy skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. The main industries for employment are government, logging, gaming industry (casino), health care and tourism. A 152-bed (72 med/surg, 68 skilled nursing and 12 transitional care) medical center in Sonora, California, serving nearly 100,000 residents of Calaveras and Tuolumne counties with key services including cardiology, imaging, home health, hospice, intensive care, long-term care, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, rural health, surgical services, wellness education, and a large network of primary care, rapid care and specialty medical offices Healthcare facilities & services that can respond to the health needs of the community.

Including metrics from multiple sectors ensures a holistic assessment that views the health of a community through multiple sectors, helping to identify everyone's role in making improvements. The community health needs assessment (CHNA) ensures we can target our community investments into interventions that best address the needs of our community. The domains used in this regional CHNA encompass national and state community health indicators. While we recognize that health status is a product of multiple factors, each domain influences the next and through systematic and collective action improved health can be achieved. The domains explored in the CHNA are: Social and Economic Factors: Indicators that provide information on social structuresand economic systems. Examples includepoverty, educational attainment, and workforcedevelopment. Health Systems: Indicators that provideinformation on health system structure,function, and access. Examples include healthprofessional shortage areas, health coverage,and vital statistics. Public Health and Prevention: Indicatorsthat provide information on health behaviorsand outcomes, injury, and chronic disease.Examples include cigarette smoking, diabetesrates, substance abuse, physical activity, andmotor vehicle crashes. Physical Environment: Indicators that provide information on natural resources, climate change, andthe built environment. Secondary data sources Secondary data sources include publicly available state and nationally recognized data sources. A significant portion of the data for this assessment was collected through a custom report generated through CARES Engagement Network CHNA (https://engagementnetwork.org/assessment/). Other sources include California Department of Public Health, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, and California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. When feasible, health metrics have been further compared to estimates for the state or national benchmarks, such as Healthy People 2020 objectives. Please see Appendix C for a complete listing of data sources.Social & Economic Factors Physical EnvironmentHealth Systems Public Health and PreventionCHNA Overview2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 20 Primary data sources To validate data and ensure a broad representation of the community, Adventist Health Sonora engaged our community partners to conduct a community health survey. Questions from the survey focused on: use of and access to healthcare services, visions of a healthy community, and priority community health needs. In addition, Adventist Health Sonora conducted key informant interviews and focus groups to gather deeper and richer data and aid in describing the community. Results of the qualitative analysis can be found later in this document. Data limitations and gaps It should be noted that the survey results are not based on a stratified random sample of residents throughout Tuolumne County. The perspectives captured in this data simply represent the community members who agreed to participate and have an interest. In addition, this assessment relies on several national and state entities with publicly available data. All limitations inherent in these sources remain present for this assessment.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 21 Social & Economic Factors Health starts in our homes, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, and communities. We know that taking care of ourselves by eating well, staying active, establishing a medical home, living a smoke-free life, getting recommended immunizations and screenings, seeing a medical provider regularly and when sick, all influence health. Our health is also determined in part by access to social and economic opportunities. Positive health outcomes are influenced by the resources and supports available in our homes, neighborhoods and communities as well as the quality of our schooling, safety of our workplaces, cleanliness of our water, environment and our social interactions and relationships. The conditions in which we live explain in part why some Americans are healthier than others and why some are not as healthy as they could be. Social determinants of health are environmental conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. These determinants affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) are referred to as \"place.\" In addition to the more material attributes of \"place,\" the patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well-being are also affected by where people live. Quality of life resources can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and an environment free of life-threatening toxins. This section details the indicators related to social and economic factors in our community which play a role in maintaining good health. Education Early education is an important factor in health status. Independent of its relationship to behavior, education influences a person's ability to access and understand health information. Education is also correlated with a host of preventable poor health outcomes including increased rates of childhood illness, respiratory illness, renal and liver disease, and diabetes, to name a few. Higher educational levels are associated with lower morbidity and mortality. Multiple studies show that smart investments in the early years of development can result in profoundly better outcomes for children, families, and the economy. Attending a Head Start program can be an important part of this development. Head Start programs promote school readiness for children ages birth to five from low-income families by supporting their development in a comprehensive way through early learning, health and wellness screenings, and programs that promote family well-being. Across the two-county region, for every 10,000 children, Calaveras County has a higher rate of Head Start Facilities at 35.1 than Tuolumne County at 21.5. Comparatively, for the state of California the rate was 5.9 per 10,000.35.1 21.5 5.9 0510152025303540 Calav eras County Tuolumne County CaliforniaHead Start Programs Rate (Per 10,000 Children) Data Source: CARES Engagement (2019).

Casey Foundation found that children who do not read proficiently by the end of third grade are four times more likely to leave school without a diploma than a proficient reader. At the end of the 2018 school year, testing for third graders found that there was a higher percentage of students in Calaveras County (32.7%) who did not meet the 'Level 1' standard as compared to Tuolumne County (28.6%) and the state (28.3%) estimate. The state average showed that Tuolumne County third graders exceeded 'Level 4' standard (19.5%) as compared to Calaveras County (18.2%). However, both counties were lower than the state estimate. Graduation from high school or a post-secondary education such as receiving a Bachelor's or Associates degree is linked to better health outcomes and increased earning potential. Averages for those aged 25 and older without a high school diploma in Calaveras (9.9%) and Tuolumne Counties, (9.3%), is lower than the state estimate at 17.5%. When examining attainment of a Bachelor's Degree or higher, one finds that across the two-county region, Calaveras (19.3%) and Tuolumne (20.6%) Counties are lower than the state of 32.6%.19.3%20.6%32.6% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% Calav eras County Tuolumne Standard Met: Level 3 Standard Nearly Met: Level 2 Standard Not Met: Level 1English/Language Arts Age 25+ with No High School Diploma2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 23 Employment Addressing unemployment levels is important to community development. Unemployment can lead to financial instability and serve as a barrier to health care access and utilization. Many people secure health insurance through an employer. However, even with Medicaid expansion, the lack of gainful employment may prevent some from affording medical office co-pays or medications. When looking at unemployment figures, Calaveras County's unemployment rate is at 3.6%, while Tuolumne County unemployment rate is at 6%. Calaveras County unemployment rate is lower than the state estimate at 4.7%. Calaveras County (6.3%) has a lower percentage of population age 16-19 not in school and not employed than Tuolumne County (7.9%) and also compared to 7.0% for the state. Measures of poverty Poverty is a particularly strong risk factor for disease and death, especially among children. Children who grow up in poverty are eight times more likely to die from homicide, five times more likely to have a physical or mental health problem, and twice as likely to be killed in an accident. Additionally, family poverty is consistently correlated with high rates of teenage pregnancy, failure to earn a high school diploma, and violent crimes. Across the two-county region, Calaveras and Tuolumne County have a lower percentage of total population and children under age 18 living under the 100% federal poverty level, compared to the state estimate at 15.1% and 20.8%, respectively.

Public assistance income includes general assistance and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Separate payments received for hospital or other medical care (vendor payments) are excluded. This does not include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or non-cash benefits such as Food Stamps. These indicators are relevant because they assess vulnerable populations which are more likely to have multiple health access, health status, and social support needs. When combined with poverty data, providers can use this measure to identify gaps in eligibility and enrollment. Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties both have lower percentages of populations receiving Public Assistance Income as compared to the state estimate. However, Calaveras County (12.1%) has a higher percentage of the population receiving SNAP benefits than Tuolumne County (10.3%) and the state estimate (11.2%). Housing and homelessness A lack of affordable housing and the limited scale of housing assistance programs have contributed to the current housing crisis and to homelessness. The lack of affordable housing leads to high rent burdens (rents which absorb a high proportion of income), overcrowding, and substandard housing. These phenomena, in turn, have not only forced many people to become homeless; they have put a large and growing number of people at risk of becoming homeless. Housing affordability Quality of housing has a major impact on overall health. High housing costs may force trade-offs between affordable housing and other needs. According to the 2018 National Low Income Housing Coalition report, Out of Reach, the High Cost of Housing, in California the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,699. This means that in order to afford rent and utilities, without paying more than 30% of their income, a household must net $5,666. In the two-county region, Calaveras County FMR is $902 for a two-bedroom apartment and Tuolumne County, FMR is $957 for a two-bedroom apartment. Data Source: CARES Engagement Network (2019).

It currently calls housing affordable if housing for that income group costs no more than 30 percent of the household's income. Families with such cost burdens may have difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care. Substandard housing conditions include the number and percentage of owner-and renter-occupied housing units having at least one of the following conditions: 1) lacking complete plumbing facilities, 2) lacking complete kitchen facilities, 3) with 1.01 or more occupants per room, 4) selected monthly owner costs as a percentage of household income greater than 30%, and 5) gross rent as a percentage of household income greater than 30%. Selected conditions provide information in assessing the quality of the housing inventory and its occupants. This data is used to easily identify homes where the quality of living and housing can be considered substandard. In Tuolumne County, 36.2% of households exceed 30% of total household income and 41.9% have substandard housing conditions. These figures are better than Calaveras County at 39.8% and 38.5%, respectively. In the two-county region, these percentages are lower than the state estimates at 41.9% and Burdened Households(Over 30% of Income) Percent Occupied Housing Units with One or More Substandard Conditions2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 26 2019 Homeless Data by County County Sheltered Unsheltered Couch Surfing Households People Households People People Calaveras 5 10 121 176 30 Tuolumne 36 84 255 301 33 Total 41 94 376 477 63Homelessness and health When looking at the homeless population by various conditions and experiences, one finds that the largest portions suffer from chronic homelessness, mental illness, or substance abuse. A smaller, but still substantial portion have experienced domestic violence/intimate partner violence or have a physical disability. Homelessness results in high levels of stress, which puts individuals and families at greater risk of violence and injury, food insecurity, unhealthy food options, infectious disease and frequent moves. Homelessness has also been linked with negative childhood events such as abuse, neglect, household dysfunction and increased likelihood of smoking and suicide in children. The 'Point-in-Time Count' surveys the number of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness on a single night. Counts are typically provided by household type and are further broken down by subpopulation categories, such as homeless veterans and homeless people in families. In 2019, The Central Sierra Continuum of Care conducted the Point-in-time Homeless Count. The Homeless Data by County represents everyone the COC considers to be homeless including couch surfers. Tuolumne County had a higher count of sheltered households (36) and people (84) as well as the Unsheltered count than Calaveras County. The second table represents reporting only homeless using the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data. HUD excludes couch surfers as homeless, thus they are subtracted. One finds that the total population of people is higher in Tuolumne County (385) as compared to the Calaveras County at 186. This is also true for number of households. Tuolumne County has 291 households of homeless population and 116 for Calaveras County. 2019 Tuolumne HUD Defined Homeless Population Households People ES Households w/children 11 34 ES Adults Only 17 18 TH Households w/children 7 31 TH Adults Only 1 1 Unsheltered w/children 6 17 Unsheltered Adults Only 249 284 Unsheltered Children Only 0 0 Total 291 3852019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 27 2019 Calaveras HUD Defined Homeless Population Households People ES Households w/children 3 8 ES Adults Only 2 2 TH Households w/children 0 0 TH Adults Only 0 0 Unsheltered w/children 10 43 Unsheltered Adults Only 101 133 Unsheltered Children Only 0 0 Total 116 186 Violent Crimes 2014 2015 2016 2017 Calaveras County 113 129 178 208 Tuolumne County 151 227 187 206Note: ES denotes Emergency Shelter and TH Transitional Housing.

Injury not only includes violence, but also unintentional injuries, such as harm caused by motor vehicle crashes. When looking at violent crimes across the region, Tuolumne County had the highest counts of reports from 2014 to 2016 compared to Calaveras County. However, in 2017, it dropped slightly lower than Calaveras County. When examining rates of substantiated child abuse cases between 2012 and 2015, Calaveras County had the highest number of cases in 2013 at 24.7 per 1,000 and the lowest rate at 14.6 per 1,000 in 2015. During the same time period, both counties exceeded the state rates.

In order to strengthen linkages to care, we must first understand the current state of our health system. This begins by understanding the outcomes associated with receiving or not receiving good maternal health care, as well as how one accesses the health care system. Live births are an indication of population growth and demand on a community's existing resources, infrastructure, schools, and the health care system/services. An adequate health care system is capable of providing preventive, diagnostic, and treatment care according to the requirements of the people being served. Tuolumne County has lower teen birth estimates (12.8) in comparison to the state (15.7) estimate. It is important to note that although the number is smaller than the state estimate, the teen birth rates are deemed unreliable when based on fewer than 20 data elements. Prenatal care and birth indicators Health System Teen Births (per 1,000 female population aged 15 to 19 years old) Percent of Women who Received Adequate or Adequate Plus Prenatal CarePercent of Women who Received Prenatal Care in the First Trimester Percent of Women who Initiated BreastfeedingCalaveras County Tuolumne County California Needs Assessment | 31 Percent of Low Weight Births (Under 2,500g)Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births)5.9% 6.4% 6.9% 7.8%Prenatal care and outcomes after birth (Continue) \"Early prenatal care\" is care started in the 1st trimester (1-3 months). Adequacy of prenatal care calculations are based on the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index (APNCU), which measures the utilization of prenatal care based on the timing of initiation of such care using the month prenatal care began as reported on the birth certificate and the ratio of the actual number of visits reported on the birth certificate to the expected number of visits. Adequate-Plus care is defined as prenatal care begun by the 4th month of pregnancy and 110% or more of recommended visits received. Adequate care is defined as prenatal care begun by the 4th month of pregnancy and 80-109% of recommended visits received. These indicators are relevant because engaging in prenatal care decreases the likelihood of maternal and infant health risks. These indicators can also highlight a lack of access to preventive care, a lack of health knowledge, insufficient provider outreach, and/or social barriers preventing utilization of health care services. For indicators of prenatal care denoted in the graphs (early first trimester prenatal care and adequate care), in the two-county region, Calaveras County (77.9%) demonstrated a higher proportion of woman receiving care in comparison to Tuolumne County (70%). Notably, Calaveras County meets the Healthy People 2020 performance target of 77.6%. Calaveras County (13.3*) and Tuolumne County (12.8*) had lower teen birth rates than the state (15.7). The Healthy People 2020 objective was not established due to there was fewer than 20 data elements for this indicator and deemed statistically unreliable. Breastfeeding has many health benefits for both the mother and infant. Breastfeeding protects against diarrhea and common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia, and may also have longer-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. Across the two-counties, Tuolumne County demonstrated a higher proportion of women across the region initiating breastfeeding at 96%, exceeding the Healthy People 2020 performance target for 81.9% of infants to have \"ever been breastfed.\"<11.0 <11.0 4.4 6.0 Note: (*) Rates are deemed unreliable when an indicator is based on fewer than 20 data elements.

Infants born at low birth weights are at a heightened risk of complications, including infections, neurological disorders, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and even chronic diseases. Calaveras County (5.9%) had the lowest proportion of low birth weights than the state estimate of 6.9% and the Healthy People 2020 goal of 7.8%. Finally, the infant mortality rate (IMR) is critical as it is indicative of the existence of broader issues pertaining to access to care and maternal child health. Such rates can further provide insights on community health outcomes and areas of needed services and interventions. In the two-county region, Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties infant mortality rates were too small to report on the Health Status profile for 2019. The data for this indicator was suppressed as rates were fewer than 11.0 per 1,000 live births and for the purpose of confidentiality, statistical reliability and DDG compliance. Healthy birth outcomes and early identification can help predict future public health challenges for families, communities, and the health care system. Access to health care Access to health care is arguably the most critical component of measuring community health. Access can be measured at both the individual level (i.e., health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage) and at the system level (i.e., primary care provider rate, health professional shortage areas). When an individual has the means to secure treatment and quality comprehensive treatment is readily available, then access to health care is highest. Understanding provider rates per 100,000 population can be useful for determining areas in most need of providers and potential stresses on existing providers. Across each provider indicator (dental, mental health, and primary care), Tuolumne County recorded higher proportions of providers to population for dental (117.9) and primary care providers (83.6) than Calaveras County and state estimates. For mental health providers, both Calaveras (157.7) and Tuolumne (156.7) Counties were lower than that state estimate at 327.8 per 100,000 population.

Mental health providers are defined as psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and mentalhealth providers that treat alcohol and other drug abuse, as well as advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care. PrimaryCare Provider rate includes: the number of primary care physicians in a county. Primary care physicians include practicing non-federalphysicians (M.D.s and D.O.s) under age 75 specializing in general practice medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 33 Health insurance Health insurance coverage is also an important indicator to consider when determining the health of a community or health system. Lack of insurance is a key barrier to health care access, regular primary care, specialty care, and other health services, contributing to poor health status. Additionally, knowing the proportion of the population receiving Medi-Cal is important. This information allows for an assessment of vulnerable populations most likely to have multiple health access, health status, and social support needs. When combined with poverty data, providers can use this measure to identify gaps in eligibility and enrollment. Across the two-counties, Calaveras (6.6%) and Tuolumne (6.7%) Counties had the lowest proportion of persons who are uninsured as compared to the state, 10.5%. Both counties also had the lowest percentage of persons covered through the Medi-Cal/Medicaid program. Preventable hospital events Ambulatory or primary care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are those conditions for which hospital admission could be prevented by interventions in primary care. This indicator reports the discharge rate (per 1,000 Medicare enrollees) for conditions that are ACSCs. ACSC conditions include pneumonia, dehydration, asthma, diabetes, and other conditions which could have been prevented if adequate primary care resources were available and accessed by those patients. This indicator is relevant because analysis of ACSCs discharges demonstrates a possible \"return on investment\" from interventions that reduce admissions through better access to primary care resources. Calaveras County (28.4) has a slightly higher discharge rate for ACSC, in comparison to Tuolumne County (27.8). However, both counties are lower than the state, 36.2 per 1,000 Medicare enrollees.

Health status measures the level of wellness and illness, while health care utilization is the use of services by people for the purpose of preventing and curing health problems. The leading causes of death in the United States are overwhelmingly the result of chronic and preventable disease. Nearly 75% of all deaths in the United States are attributed to ten causes, with the top three of these accounting for over 50% of all deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the top three causes of death in the U.S. in 2016 were from heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries. The top three leading causes of death for Calaveras and Tuolumne County are: coronary heart disease, unintentional injuries and chronic lower respiratory disease.

This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease and injury prevention, and detecting, preventing and responding to infectious diseases. When these factors are addressed, a community will enjoy an overall higher level of physical and emotional well-being. Health status Health status is determined by more than the presence or absence of any disease. It is comprised of a number of factors, including measures of healthy life expectancy, years of potential life lost, self-assessed health status, chronic disease prevalence, measures of functioning, physical illness, and mental well-being. These measures go hand-in-hand with measures related to health behaviors such as physical activity, nutrition, and alcohol consumption. Measuring health behaviors provides a deeper understanding of health status. When looking at overall health status, across the two-region counties, Calaveras County had a lower proportion, 12.8%, of adults who rate their health as \"fair\" or \"poor,\" than the state estimate of 17.5%, while Tuolumne County had a proportion of 13.8%. In addition, both counties (3.7) had a slightly higher number of poor mental health days reported in a 30-day period than the state estimate e of 3.5. The rate of poor physical health days within a reported 30-day period was slightly lower in Calaveras County (3.4) than Tuolumne County (3.5). The state estimate is 3.5. Physical activity Increased physical activity is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, independent of obesity. Individuals who live closer to sidewalks, parks, and gyms are more likely to exercise. In California, 17.2% of adults answered \"yes\" to the question: \"During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?\" In Tuolumne and Calaveras County, the percentage of adults who answered yes to this same question was 16.7% and 20.3%, respectively.

Locations for physical activity are defined as parks or recreational facilities. Tuolumne County had a lower percentage of individuals with adequate access to exercise opportunities at 86.3% and Calaveras was even lower (53.5%) as compared to the state at 93%. Chronic disease Successfully managing risk factors for chronic diseases is important for preventing unnecessary hospitalizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), six in ten Americans live with at least one chronic disease, like heart disease, cancer, stroke, or diabetes. These and other chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in America, and they are also a leading driver of health care costs. Tuolumne County Medicare population have lower rates of heart disease (18.9%) and diabetes (19.2%) as compared to Calaveras County. However, Calaveras County had lower rates of Medicare population with depression (14.3%) and high blood pressure (49.2%). Childhood weight and physical activity According to a 2015-2016 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of U.S. children ages 2-19 are overweight or obese. The childhood obesity rate has more than tripled over the past four decades, though rates have leveled off in recent years. Measuring morbidity and mortality rates allows assessing linkages between social determinants of health and outcomes. This indicator is relevant because excess weight is a prevalent problem and indicates an unhealthy lifestyle and puts individuals at risk for further health issues. Calaveras County has the highest percentage of students in grade 5, 7 and 9 who were overweight or obese as compared to Tuolumne County. It is important to note that both counties fare better than the state estimate of 40.5%, 39.0% and 37.3%, respectively.Chronic Disease Indicators Calaveras County Tuolumne County California Adults with a Body Mass Index Greater than 3023.5% 23.2% 22.5% Medicare Population with Depression Population with Diabetes 19.8% Population with Heart Disease 21.2% Population with High Blood Pressure49.2% 49.8% 52.7% Note: Percentages in red are the poorest outcomes as compared to the state.

Tuolumne County has the highest percentage of adults who are current smokers as compared to thestatewide average of 11.0%.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 41 We interact with the environment constantly, therefore our physical environment can affect our health behaviors, quality of life, years of healthy life lived, and health disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines environment, as \"all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviors.\" This can include air quality and exposure to toxic substances as well as the built environment (human-made surroundings) and housing. CalEnviroScreen is a science-based mapping tool that was developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. This tool helps identify California communities that are affected by many sources of pollution and that are particularly vulnerable to pollution's effects. CalEnviroScreen uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce a numerical score for each census tract in the state. A census tract with a high score (colored dark orange to dark red) is one that experiences higher pollution burden and vulnerability than census tracts with low scores (colored shades of green). Indicators that are considered include but are not limited to, ozone, PM 2.5, drinking water quality, pesticides, and hazardous waste. According to the most recent CalEnviroScreen 3.0 results, Calaveras County (25-30%) and Tuolumne County (30-35%) ranked among the lower percentile in the state on the index. This means that these areas have lower pollution burden.Physical Environment Data Source: Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

Three indicators are important to consider: the fast food restaurant rate, the grocery store rate, and the number of retailers authorized to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (all calculated as establishments per 100,000 population). Areas with a high fast food rate, low grocery store rate, and low SNAP authorized retailers will inevitably have populations with higher rates of food insecurity, due to lack of access to healthy and affordable foods. Across the two-county region, both counties fared better than the state estimate for fast food restaurant, grocery and SNAP authorized retailers rates per 100,000 population. Food insecurity The US Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as a lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods. Food insecurity may reflect a household's need to choose between important basic needs, such as housing or medical bills, and purchasing nutritionally adequate foods. Food insecurity averages in Calaveras and Tuolumne County for the overall population and children are higher than reported averages for the state (11% and 18.1%, respectively).

It has been defined as \"the human-made space in which people live, work, and recreate on a day-to-day basis.\" Factors to consider include access to recreational facilities and fitness centers and access to broadband internet access. Access to high-speed internet is important because access to technology opens up opportunities for employment and education. Access to recreational facilities encourages physical activity and other healthy behaviors. Across the two-county region, both counties have the lowest access to high-speed internet (90.5% and 91.3%) and the fewest recreational facilities (8.78 and 9.03) per 100,000 population than the state at 97.7% and 10.75, per 100,000 population conversely.

Those chosen to provide input, represent the diversity of our community and those who are medically under-served, low-income and minority populations. Overview From March 1, 2019 to May 11, 2019, focus groups, key informant interviews and surveys were administered. Approximately 163 people were surveyed to obtain input from the community in the form of 3 focus groups (with a total of 33 focus group participants), 12 key informant interviews and 118 people responded to the online survey. A full description of key informants and focus group participants can be found in Appendix D of this document. Focus group Focus group participants were end-users of programs and services provided by AHSR or members of the community. Populations represented by focus group members included seniors, low-income, homeless/at- risk and a group of stakeholders from an array of agencies who serve families, low-income, domestic abuse woman and other sectors. The majority of focus group participants live in Sonora, Jamestown, and Twain Harte. Additionally, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to convene a group representative of the Mi Wuk and Black Oak Mi Wuk Tribe. Future reporting cycles will seek to establish and strengthen partnerships to ensure this population is adequately represented. Key informant interview Key informant interviews consisted of key leaders in our community from an array of agencies, including those that represent youth services, including schools and education, elderly services, mental and behavioral health, and human services. Public safety, non-profit community, business retention, law, and charities were also represented. Most key informants hold titles such as physician, director positions. Survey Survey participants lived in areas similar to that of focus group participants and key informants. Over 93 percent of the survey respondents live in Tuolumne County. Sonora was selected almost 7 times more than any other city, including Jamestown, Groveland, Twain Harte, and Columbia for survey responses.Voices from the Community2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 45 Methodology To determine focus groups and key informants, Adventist Health Sonora team members were provided with a list of sample sectors for consideration that included: community-based organizations, local businesses, foundation/funders, school board/districts, city council, public health department, law enforcement, legal, faith-based organizations, and hospital leaders. Additionally, they were asked to consider the following criteria: Does this person represent a vulnerable populations? Does this person represent the uninsured/underinsured population? Does this person's role transcend over more than one county? Do we have representation from all sectors? Does it meet the requirement of community health needs assessments? Does this person's role cross sectors? Additionally, they were asked to consider the following populations for inclusion in focus groups: those dealing with mental health issues or substance abuse, minorities, low-income, uninsured/underinsured, and youth populations. While members considered potential groups and venues, they were asked to keep the following criteria in mind: Does this focus group represent a medically underserved, low income, or minority population(s)? Can this focus group speak to pressing health care issues in our community (i.e. children's health, mental health, or access to care)? Does this focus group represent diverse populations or health issues? Can this focus group speak to the social determinants of health in our community? Finally, AHSR team members were encouraged to send survey links to any partner organizations that did not make the key informant list. In addition, a press release was issued to bring awareness of the survey to ensure broader community participation. Objectives Through engaging the community our objective was to discover strategies in which our hospital could collaborate to better serve communities and elevate the health status of our region. To better understand the needs, the focus groups and key informant interviews concentrated on these themes: Visions of a Healthy Community Health and Social Needs Existing Resources Barriers to Accessing ResourcesHospital Perception and Opportunities Additional Feedback2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 46 Additionally, key informants were asked about the greatest health and social needs of children. Respondents to the survey were asked about health problems and needs of the community, including what is healthy in the community, what is not healthy in the community, and what the community needs to be healthy. They were also asked about the greatest health and social needs of children, services that could improve health in the community, barriers for clients from an organizational perspective, and for any additional feedback. Finally, the codebooks and survey results were instrumental in discovering commonalities in themes to inform this report. The key informant codebook, with frequencies, can be found in Appendix E. Findings \u2014 Significant health and social needs The focus groups, key informants, and surveys contained questions about the most significant health needs in the community. Based on those responses, prioritization was given to issues most frequently mentioned in all three data sources. The top five mentioned below are a combination of all three data sources based on frequency of response. The overarching themes based on the amount of times the issue was mentioned across all three data sources are: The priority needs were identified by first creating codebooks based on the focus group, key informant interviews, and open text responses from the online survey. The codebooks assisted in combining the separate themes for comparison and analysis. The three sources were coordinated to supply richer interpretation when applicable. Using secondary sources, county information was gathered and compared with the themes found in the focus groups, key informant interviews, and surveys. Table 1 displays the separate ranking of most frequently mentioned health issues by focus group, key informant interview, and online surveys and corresponding data from the secondary sources. Table 1. Order of Most Frequently Mentioned by Data Source Type Focus Groups Key Informant Interviews Surveys 1 Mental and behavioral health Access to health care Access to health care 2 Access to health care Mental and behavioral healthHigh rates of youth or adults engaging in risky health or sexual behaviors 3 Housing and Homelessness Elderly servicesLack of affordable housing options 4 Immunization ImmunizationLack of access to mental health services 5 Smoking Poverty/housing High rates of chronic diseases2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 47 Supporting quotes \"I think it's pretty simple here, it's just a matter of timely access. Just the well-known lack of providers, not just unique to Tuolumne but everywhere. That ranges from physicians to psychiatrist to nurse practitioners, counselors you name it. I mean trying to find a doctor and get him the timely appointment up here is an issue.\" \"Again, back to the rural nature of things and people feel isolated. Getting information disseminated it might be difficult as well. This county is not entirely covered by cell service range. You don't have to drive too far for that to drop off. So, some people are probably living without cell service in their homes or maybe even internet. So that can delay information or just make it not the habit of accessing it.\"\"Health issues that we see at our organization medication mismanagement I think it would be probably number one. We see a lot of health issues, a lot of things that go around medication mismanagement overprescribing medications and medication mismanagement. And also, there seems to be looked from again, my perspective, we do have a lot of individuals in our communities with memory loss/dementia, some form of a dementia.\" Findings by themes Visions of a healthy community The main themes surrounding the vision of a healthy community included inclusiveness and equity of voices. Having adequate, low-income housing, especially for homeless were mentioned. A community that has services, identifies and prioritizes issues, sense of well-being, safety, and connections within the community make it healthy were also indicated as visions of a healthy community. Additionally, finances and economy, safe activities, medical needs healthy environment, education, quality food, transportation, and adult services were also mentioned. Supporting quotes \"It's a multiple combination of course, healthy just in the context of being healthy. In other words, less diseases, bad habits like smoking, excessive drinking and stuff like that. But then there's also healthy when it comes to the environment we raise our kids in. Whether it's the education system, whether it's parks, whether it's having opportunities for them to stay here after they graduate from high school or college. Or if they go away to university and come back that there's opportunities for them to come back and have their family here. And then you know jobs and opportunities for those who want it and also opportunities to help transitioning populations. Like everything from homeless to prison individuals you know ex-prisoners who need to reintegrate into the community and tie all of that into on the other side providing workers for our companies who then in turn provide good paying jobs, benefits, opportunities for advancement but then also they bring profits back to the community which are reinvested in numerous ways including you know employee salary so on and so forth but also donations to charitable foundations and hospitals and the such.\" \"My dream is that we would look at our community through a lens of equity.\"2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 48 Social factors The top social factors mentioned were poverty, isolation, jobs, childcare, housing and homelessness. Education, health insurance, lack of diversity, and mental and behavioral health. Many respondents indicated a multi-factor nature of social issues as effects on health in the community. Supporting quotes \"Another component is are there is our family structure is up here. So, we have generational poverty as well as you know new poverty that a lot of this is generational poverty. So how do you help? How do you help families break from those barriers that have been in place for a long time? And part of that has to do with changing perspectives and outlook in how the world is. And so, it's not just so you can provide somebody all of the interventions and support that you possibly can. But if the social network around them continues to promote or to say in some way, well this is the way we've always done it and this is the way we've survived. It's almost like a betrayal sometimes to their family and their social systems in which they live in. So, it becomes very hard to change and love that's driven by fear.\" \"Social factors definitely come into play. You know there are job opportunities in our county but not necessarily a lot of job opportunities. So, we are somewhat limited in that. Obviously, I don't think that poverty has hit our county necessarily the same as what you'd see in some of the cities, but it certainly exists, and we've seen it increase as I've mentioned in our homeless population. So those factors are concerning. Again, I think a lot of the social factors that we're seeing that are impacting health and overall services as are mental health illnesses.\" Health and social needs of children Among focus groups, key informants and surveys, participants felt parenting education and health education focused on nutrition were among the highest needs for children. Other concerns included: affordable and opportunities to engage in physical activities, access to providers, and poverty/homelessness. Additionally, early educational resources/daycare/academic after-school programs, access to health care, and access to educational and mentorship/enrichment opportunities were noted. Many of the comments were focused on issues surrounding drugs, educational needs, and parenting. Supporting quotes \"One particular area is health education in general. An example, we fund a program in the schools where we have a dental hygienist go in and do basic dental exams and cleaning for fluoride treatment and there is a significant number of children who are not receiving dental care and to me that goes directly back to education and I'm making an assumption that if they're not educated about basic dental care that they're probably not getting to see a primary care physician as they should either.\" \"The greatest need for kids, young kids is just good parenting. You know I think that some of our parents, they're not well. And so, they're now they've got this young person that they're trying to raise. I think their intentions are they want to do it right. They want to do it well they maybe don't want to have happen to their kids what maybe happened to them. One of the greatest challenges for young people are just good parents.\"2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 49 Existing community assets and resources The most commonly mentioned community assets and resources for focus groups and key informants were those around community connectedness among services such as access to services, school system, and transportation. Respondents indicated physical activities, health fairs, and mentoring programs as resources in the community. Education programs in the community were a major concern among both the focus groups and key informant interviews. Education programs for youth, such as meals and activities, and parenting program needs were provided as resources in the community. Supporting quotes \"One of the greatest assets that we have as a community is that we do work well together. When as a community we identify an issue and we rally around that, we can be very effective in addressing that issue.\" \"We've got a pretty dynamic school system. We have the junior college which is available. There is a lot within our community, there are so many people that want to help and do things within our community. It's a matter of being organized. We have all these different groups focusing on helping a bit of the same thing. I'm going to step away from kids for a second and look at look at homeless. There are 7 different places that feed the homeless just within the City of Sonora. If we could focus and organize those types of events or types of groups.\" Barriers to access The highest responses to barriers from focus group participants, key informants and surveys include transportation, mental and behavioral health, inadequate health services (i.e., addiction services, primary care and physicians who are properly trained). In addition, recent outbreaks of measles and shingles and lack of access to vaccinations, and lack of young people in the community were mentioned. Supporting quotes \"We live in a very rural area, so we do have a county bus system that's pretty amazing as well as dial a ride. However, they are unable to reach some of our outlying areas. It depends on what the road conditions are like. It depends on where they live, how far out they live. We have folks who, you know, who live as far as you know 45 minutes or more away from the hospital and so that's a huge impact. And when they don't drive any longer or they don't have family involved. Now how are they going to get back and forth to their medical appointments. Again, if they don't drive in need that assistance if they have to go out of county for their medical assistance how are they going to get out of county as well. Transportation is a huge barrier.\" \"The greatest barrier is stigma. You know, I deal with this a lot with suicide and just any mental health trainings and stuff that I do. There's so much stigma around someone that is struggling with any issue. But I think it really shows up with mental health issues. It shows up with people that are struggling with thoughts of suicide. I think part of it is that we're a small community and there's this kind of belief that you have to be careful what you say to the person that you're having lunch with because you don't know who they know that you know. And so, I think because of that, it just doesn't feel safe for someone that's struggling to seek help. So, I think one barrier that's huge in our small rural community is stigma.\"2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 50 Hospital perception and opportunities Focus group participants and key informants were asked their perception of the hospital and were asked to offer suggestions for new activities or strategies. Common themes for improvement included: communication and partnership, health care infrastructure investment (i.e.,including mental illness facility, and education programs). In addition, inadequate advertisement, lack of conference room use availability for community meetings, and corporate feeling of the hospital were also mentioned. Supporting quotes \"They do offer a number of outreach programs smoking cessation, diabetic education and nutrition. Trying to think of the others in cardiac rehab, respiratory rehab. My perception is the way most people find out about this is following your hospitalization. The discharge planner gives some of this information and helps them sign up for other than smoking.\" \"The biggest thing that we all need to do including Adventist Health is just make sure that our lines of communication are open with each other.\"\"As a community member I used to know who the main person was at the hospital and I can't even tell you their name at this point. and I used to be able to call by their first name and know who it was and I could not tell you anybody that works other than Tyler going to see it meetings as the only person I really know at the hospital that isn't a doctor or nurse.\"2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 51 Priority health issue and baseline data The 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee met to collectively review the findings of this assessment and prioritize the top priority needs Adventist Health Sonora and partners involved will focus through 2022. Identified community health needs Priority Health Issue Rationale/Contributing Factors Access to health care Access to providers including geriatricservices and primarycare providers Preventative care TransportationAs a critical component of measuring community health, access to health care was a major theme in the focus groups, key informant interviews, and survey responses. Primary care provider and dentist rate per 100,000 population is higher in Tuolumne County than Calaveras County and California, but the mental health provider rate is nearly half the state estimate. Care providers, specifically geriatric, pediatric, and mental health, were most frequently mentioned in the focus groups and key informant interviews. Additionally, the need for preventative care and caregivers was mentioned. Mental and behavioral health Substance Abuse Trauma and isolationMental and behavioral health was in the top 2 mentioned health needs among the focus groups, key informant interviews, and survey responses. Substance abuse was mentioned across all three, and trauma and isolation in focus groups and key informant interviews. Both counties are slightly above the state average of reported poor mental health days. Additionally, Medicare populations with depression were slightly less than the state estimates. Housing and HomelessnessHigh rent burden, substandard housing, and homelessness are results of lack of affordable housing. In Tuolumne and Calaveras Counties, the fair market rent for a 2-bedroom home were nearly half the price of the state. Although lower than the state, substandard housing conditions are at least 39% percent in both counties. Consistent with the views in the focus groups and key informant interviews, mental illness and poverty intersect with the chronic homelessness. This year, 385 adults and children in Tuolumne County and 186 in Calaveras County have experienced homelessness.Prioritization of Health Needs2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 52 Priority Health Issue Rationale/Contributing Factors Chronic disease Asthma Obesity4 of the 5 leading causes of death in Tuolumne County and Calaveras County were chronic diseases. Asthma visits to the emergency department were much higher than state estimates, but asthma hospitalizations were lower. Medicare populations with diabetes and heart disease were lower in both counties than the state rates. Just slightly higher than the state, obesity was approximately 23% in both counties. Medication mismanagement, especially among isolated aging populations, was one of the issues mentioned related to chronic disease in the focus groups. The survey responses indicated high rates of chronic disease as the 5th top health and social needs in the community . PovertyPoverty puts people, especially children, at a higher risk of premature death, mental health, malnutrition, and overall poor health. Tuolumne and Calaveras counties are lower that the state for population under 100% poverty level and children under 100% poverty level. Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties have a lower percent of populations receiving Public Assistance Income as compared to the state estimate. However, Calaveras County (12.1%) has a higher percentage of the population receiving SNAP benefits than Tuolumne County (10.3%) and the state estimate (11.2%). One key informant mentioned that although the census and other sources show the county as a retired and wealthier community, there is a large amount of young families in poverty. Prioritization process and criteria On August 26, 2019, the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee met to collectively review the findings of this assessment and determined the top priority needs that Adventist Health Sonora and partners involved will address over the next three years. Stakeholders agreed on the criteria below to consider when making a decision. The criteria listed recognize the need for a combination of information types (e.g, health indicators and primary data) as well as consideration of issues such as practicality, feasibility, and mission alignment.

The top health issues for the 2016-201 9 CHNA and CHP were: Priority Need: Heal thy Beginnings Interventions: Family Fit - A partnership with Tuolumne County Schools that brings nutrition and exercise education to the students in our local elementary schools. Students received education and instruction, as well as before and after tests, to assess their knowledge and physical fitness gains from participating in the program. Community Members Served: 755. AHSR invested $84,417 into this program aimed at local 3rd graders for staffing and supplies. Adventist Health Sonora (AHSR) - Tuolumne County Public Health Department (TCPHD) collaborative for substance abusing pregnant women. In 2016 AHSR and the TCPHD began a new collaboration to address what was a growing and disturbing trend in our community, pregnant women presenting to our Obstetrics Department (OB) to deliver their baby who were substance abuse dependent. In this collaborative, the AHSR OB Director met monthly for one hour with the Tuolumne County Maternal Child Adolescent Health Program (MCAH). During this time, they discussed cases and approaches to help the addicted women. This collaborative also grew to include direct hand-off referrals of qualifying OB patients to MCAH programs, which increased the likelihood of success for the mothers seeking help. During the time that this partnership began, and numbers were gathered on women presenting to the OB to deliver who were abusing substances, the numbers have dropped from 24 in 2016 to 18 in 2017, a 25% decrease. Since 2017 the numbers have remained the same at 18 in 2018. 2019 numbers have yet to be determined. Number of Community Members Served: 36.

One outcome from this coalition was adding six emergency department physicians with Sierra Emergency Medical Group (who serve at Adventist Health Sonora). The received their x-waiver license which enables them to treat opioid dependency with approved buprenorphine products. Another outcome of the coalition was talks Dr. Ralph Retherford gave to local 9th grade students, as well as to nursing students, about opioids and substance abuse issues. Number of Community Members Served: 537 Addiction Therapy Clinic To address the increase in Opioid and substance abuse in Tuolumne County, Adventist Health Sonora began an Addiction Therapy Clinic in 2016, where Dr. Ralph Retherford treats patients for opioid dependence. Number of Community Members Served: 184 Prescription Drug Take Back Days Adventist Health Sonora has annually supported, endorsed and collaborated with the Tuolumne County Drug Take Back Days, led by the YES! Partnership and the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office. Number of pounds collected: 1,076 lbs. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training The Youth MHFA training was a partnership between Adventist Health Sonora (AHSR), ATCAA and YES Partnership. The Adult MHFA training was a partnership between AHSR and SOAR (SSI/SSDI Outreach Access and Recovery). Each course provided 8 CEUs for attendees and was open to the entire community. In Youth MHFA, participants were trained to: Recognize the potential risk factors and warning signs of a variety of mental health challenges common among adolescents, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, eating disorders, AD/HD, disruptivebehavioral disorders, and substance use disorders. Use a 5-step action plan to help a young person in crisis connect with appropriate professional help.

Housing cost burden Measures the percentage of household income spent on mortgage costs or gross rent. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development currently defines housing as affordable if housing for that income group costs no more than 30 percent of the household's income. Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered cost burdened; families who pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing are severely cost burdened.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 68 Housing units with substandard conditions Housing that poses a risk to the health, safety or physical well-being of occupants, neighbors, or visitors. Substandard housing increases risk of disease, crime, social isolation and poor mental health. Substandard housing is associated with one or more of the following conditions: 1.Is dilapidated; 2.Does not have operable indoor plumbing; 3.Does not have a usable flush toilet inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family; 4.Does not have a usable bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of a family; 5.Does not have electricity, or has inadequate or unsafe electrical service; 6.Does not have a safe or adequate source of heat; 7.Should, but does not, have a kitchen; or 8.Has been declared unfit for habitation by an agency or unit of government. Infant mortality rate Expressed as a rate per 1,000 births, this is defined as the death of a child prior to its first birthday (should be read, for example, as 7.8 infant deaths for every 1,000 births). Low birth weight Expressed as a rate per 1,000 births, this refers to infants born with a weight between 1,500 and 2,500 grams or between 3.3 and 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight infants are born with a weight less than 1,500 grams. Prenatal care Adequacy of prenatal care calculations are based on the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index (APNCU), which measures the utilization of prenatal care on two dimensions. The first dimension, adequacy of initiation of prenatal care, measures the timing of initiation using the month prenatal care began reported on the birth certificate. The second dimension, adequacy of received services, is measured by taking the ratio of the actual number of visits reported on the birth certificate to the expected number of visits. The expected number of visits is based on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology prenatal care visitations standards for uncomplicated pregnancies (1), and is adjusted for the gestational age at initiation of care and for the gestational age at delivery. The two dimensions are combined into a single summary index, and grouped into four categories: Adequate Plus, Adequate, Intermediate, and Inadequate. Adequate Plus: Prenatal care begun by the 4th month of pregnancy and 110% or more of recommendedvisits received. Adequate: Prenatal care begun by the 4th month of pregnancy and 80-109% of recommended visits received.2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | 69 Intermediate: Prenatal care begun by the 4th month of pregnancy and 50-79% of recommended visits received. Inadequate: Prenatal care begun after the 4th month of pregnancy or less than 50% of recommended visits received.
