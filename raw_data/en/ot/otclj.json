All you do is add a few drops of your favourite essential oil to some base oil or neutral cream. If not used properly, however, essential oils can do more harm than good. Since they are concentrated, it is best not to apply them directly to skin. Dilute them in a base first, following the recommended concentration. Just to be on the safe side, you might want to test it in the crook of your elbow, wait 24 hours and check for a reaction.

Safety precautions when using any essential oil If you plan on using essential oils for therapeutic purposes, be sure to consult an expert. Some essential oils are toxic when ingested. They should not be taken internally without the advice of an expert. If ingestion occurs, contact the poison control centre at 1 800 463-5060. Keep the bottle of essential oil handy so you can answer the questions the nurse will ask you to evaluate the toxic risk and the need for treatment. Never apply essential oils to mucous membranes or to the eye contour area. In case of accidental contact, wash the affected area with a cotton ball heavily soaked in vegetable oil - not water!
