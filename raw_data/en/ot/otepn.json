By that time, all the [regulatory agencies]were long [bought and paid for already.] Guy is a troublemaker, just like Shiva, both pretending to be the opposition, asking people to support them then leading them to nowhere.

A sort of a dream, an idyllic childhood land. Something some call the American Dream, a land where people can get rich, where justice eventually wins, where people are healthy, where you can make real change with lawsuits, a land of the free and brave, I can\u00b4t describe it better.
