Since October 10 the authorities have recorded around 344,000 second booster vaccinations. In total, around 535,000 people in Switzerland and Liechtenstein have received a second booster vaccination, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) said on Tuesday, confirming a report by Swiss public radio, SRF. By the end of October at least one vaccination dose had been given to 69.7% of the population. In the past six months, 697,398 people - just under 8% of the population - received a jab. It is not possible to determine from the FOPH figures what proportion of this was a booster vaccination. However, almost a quarter (23.4%) of people in the over-65 risk group have been vaccinated in the past six months. In this age group, 90.1% of the population have been vaccinated at least once. Among 16- to 64-year-olds, the proportion of those vaccinated in the past six months was 5.2%. More than 13,700 people have died in Switzerland, which has a population of 8.7 million, in connection with Covid-19. In compliance with the JTI standards More: [SWI swissinfo.ch "}
