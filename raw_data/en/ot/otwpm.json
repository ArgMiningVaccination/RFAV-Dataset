It combines the vibrations of colour therapy and crystal therapy, to help restore and recharge the body's energy system. A chakra is thought to be an energy centre, with the seven main chakras aligned from the base of the spine to the top of the head. Each chakra is associated with a certain colour, certain specific functions of the body and an aspect of conciousness. They are thought to vitalise the physical body and extend the aura. [Crystal Light Therapy helps to re-establish physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing by helping to realign the chakras. It can benefit all sorts of conditions, from specific issues to more general complaints. Coloured light radiates to each chakra in controlled rhythms to cleanse, balance, and align the energy of the chakras.](https://www.complementarytherapiesnewmills.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/chakra-energy-centres.jpg) Quartz crystal has extraordinary properties helping to heal the sick and improve energies, concentration, decisiveness, and empathetic qualities and to restore the body's balance to achieve harmony in body and spirit.
