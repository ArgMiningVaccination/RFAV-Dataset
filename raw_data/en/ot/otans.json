Flu Season hit hard and hit early this year! I like how Dr. Mercola states it here: \"According to a recent review of published research, flu vaccines are ineffective at best, and produce neurological complications at worst, while having no effect at all on hospitalizations or working days lost.\" Sounds like we need to have some better strategies! Another issue is how can people eat poorly, not get adequate rest, live overly toxic lives and expect one little shot to save them? Investing in a healthy immune system starts with healthy habits and is supported by natural immune boosters. 5 Important Steps to Building a Healthy Immune System 1. Be a good hand washer and remind your children to do the same. More flu is spread via hand to hand contact. 2. Get 7-8 hours of sleep a night. A healthy immune system requires adequate rest! 3. Avoid eating processed sugars. Scientific evidence shows immune system suppression occurs 30 minutes after ingesting processed sugar! 4. Make sure your vitamin D levels are adequate! Even here in the sunbelt, I often find patients are deficient! Vitamin D isn't only necessary for healthy bones but helps us to resist viral and bacterial infections (but also prevents many cancers as well!). If you don't know your level, ask that a blood test be performed to assess your levels. 5. Take supplements that can potently support your immune system. Herbs, vitamins, probiotics can be powerful allies for you and your family with no side effects! (See suggested protocol below). Colostrum Dramatically Better Than Flu Shot Colostrum is the first substance every infant mammal receives from their mother's breast in the first days after birth. It is jam-packed with immunoglobulins to bolster the baby's immature immune system. Mother's colostrum provides them with crucial protection against infections. Most colostrum used medicinally today comes from cows. A number of studies on Colostrum and substances contained within it have been shown to be effective in treating a variety of infections. Colostrum in a dessicated powder that undergoes a special process to deliver intact immunoglobulins can be a very impactful tool for supporting a weakened immune systems and fight different kinds of infections. Whether using colostrums for flu prevention or to fight viruses associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (such as Epstein Barr Virus, CMV, HHV6), colostrum can be a powerfully effective yet safe treatment or preventative therapy. In 2007 a study was conducted comparing the effectiveness of the flu vaccine with a single capsule of colostrum each day. The study looked at the effects in healthy adults and people with advanced cardiovascular disease. This clinical trial examined the incidence of influenza occurring in four matched groups: flu vaccine, colostrum, flu vaccine plus colostrum, and no flu prevention treatments. The results showed that Colostrum was over 4 times more effective at preventing influenza than the flu vaccination. Colostrum was 3 times more effective than doing nothing. The group receiving only the flu vaccine actually had more cases of flu than the group that had no treatments (57 vs 41)! The combination of the flu vaccine and Colostrum were equally effective as the Colostrum only group. Among those with advanced heart disease, Colostrum was twice as effective as the flu vaccine. Flu Prevention Protocol Investing in a healthy immune system starts with healthy habits and is supported by natural immune boosters. The following supplements are ones I find most effective to stay healthy this Flu Season. Russian Choice Immune: 2 caps a day maintenance during flu season and double when in high-risk situations (i.e. traveling, being around others who are sick, school and hospital workers). Russian Choice Immune is a preparation of cell-wall fragments made from a specific strain of Lactobacillus, first identified by Russian researchers as Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. These capsules have remarkable immune stimulating properties and have very impressive research behind them. (For more detailed information on this product, ask our staff for a copy of the scientific data sheet.) Colostrum Immune Formula: 2 caps a day maintenance and take this dose 2-3 times a day if starting to get ill or in high risk of infection situations. This formula contains New Zealand source colostrum, proprietary enzymes, Lactoferrin, Beta Glucan, Arabinogalactacan, and Olive Leaf Extract. Colostrum contains natural immunoglobulins that support the mucosal defense system (reduces cold and flu). Colostrum supports a healthy immune response to invading pathogens (viral, fungal and bacterial). Now, what if you have the first signs of flu? Flu Treatment Protocol Triple Immune Tincture: This is my combination I put together with 3 immune heavy hitters! It's a mix of the most potent form of Echinacea, elderberry concentrated syrup and Umcka, an herb from Africa known for its ability to shorten duration of colds and flues! It's great for adults and children alike and even tastes good! Take 3 droppersfuls (amount that comes up when you pinch the rubber bulb 3-4 times a day until you feel well again (and maybe a 2 day buffer after to avoid backsliding!) Occillococcinum: Homeopathic remedies are mild and safe for everyone and when the remedy picture fits, the results can be dramatic! Timing is everything, so start early, within an hour to 24 hours of the first sign of flu (fever, chills, body aches, nausea and malaise). Take a 1/4 vial under the tongue every 20-30 minutes for a total of 6-10 doses. Repeat this for 2-3 days. I've seen many flues stop dead in their tracks with this remedy! Black Seed Oil: This gem hails from the Middle East and can be a powerful immune booster. Derived from black cumin seed, available in oil or caps, can powerfully bolster the immune system, reduce fever, relieve lung congestion, etc. Myer's Cocktail IV: This [ IV](http://www.naturemedica.net/vitamin/) is full of high-dose vitamins and minerals that get your immune system back on track in a flash!
