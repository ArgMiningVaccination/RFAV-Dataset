ABSTRACT Objectives Na turopathy is a traditional medicine system informed by codified philosophies and principles, and an emphasis on non- pharmacologic thera peutic interventions. While naturopathy is practised by approximately 75 000-100 000 000 naturopathic practitioners in at least 98 countries, little is known about the international prevalence of history of consultation with a naturopathic practitioner. This study reports a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies describing the global prevalence of history of consultation with a naturopathic practitioner by the general population.Setting The inc luded literature was identified through a systematic search of eight databases between September and October 2019, as well as the grey literature.Participants Studies were inc luded if they reported the prevalence rate of consultations with a naturopathic practitioner by the general population.Interventions Sur vey items needed to report consultations with a naturopathic practitioner as defined in the country where data was collected, and not combine naturopathic consultations with other health services or only report consulations for illness populations.Primary and secondary outcome measures Primar y measures used for the analysis was consultations in the previous 12 months. Other prevalence timeframes were reported as secondary measures.Methods Meta- analysis of prevalence da ta was conducted using random effects models based on individual countries and WHO world regions.Results The litera ture search identified eight manuscripts summarising 14 studies reporting prevalence for inclusion in the review. All included studies had a low risk of bias. Meta- analysis of the inc luded studies by world region found the 12- month prevalence of histor y of naturopathy consultations ranged from 1% in the Region of the Americas to 6% in the European and Western Pacific Regions.Conclusions There are up to sixfold differences in the prevalence of na turopathy consults over 12 months between and within world regions, which may be driven by a range of policy, legislative and social factors.PROSPERO registration number CRD42020145529. INTRODUCTION Naturopathy is a traditional medicine system underpinned by six philosophical principles (see box 1), which were codi- fied by the profession in the 20th century.1 These philosophical principles charac-terise naturopathic practice and are glob-ally accepted by the profession. 2 Other defining tenets of naturopathic practice are patient- centredness and individualisa - tion, with naturopaths typically drawing on a range of therapeutic interventions (eg, diet and lifestyle counselling, herbal medi-cine, nutritional supplementation, manual therapies and mind-body practices) to best meet the healthcare needs and pref-erences of the patient. 3 Globally, naturop- athy is practised in at least 98 countries with representation in every world region. 4 Naturopathy is practised widely in Europe (n=54 practicing countries), followed by Latin America (n=51), Africa (n=47) and the Western Pacific (n=37). 4 Estimates from the World Naturopathic Federation suggest there are between 75 000 and 100 000 naturopaths currently in clinical practice across the world.5STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY Naturopathy is one of the most commonly used traditional and complementary medicines in the Western world and this is the first systematic review and meta- analysis reporting the prevalence of con - sutations with a naturopathic practitioner. This study only includes data published after 2010 to ensure the results are contemporary, however this may have excluded some studies in countries with older data. The included studies were all determined to have a low risk of bias. The results are limited by the poor availability of data reporting consultations with a naturopathic practitioner, including in countries where a large number of naturopathic practitioners are known to provide care. on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the prevalance of a history of consultations with naturopathic practitioners globally, including potential differences across world regions. METHODS AimThis study aims to describe the global prevalence of a history of consultation with a naturopathic practitioner by the general population. Study design A systematic review and meta- analysis of prevalence studies were undertaken in accordance with the AMST AR 2 guidelines.16 The protocol for this review was submitted to PROSPERO on the 2 September 2019 and was regis-tered on the 28 April 2020. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Articles were included that reported original data from cohort studies, cross- sectional studies, sur vey research, case-control studies, prevalence studies or epidemio-logical studies. Studies reporting on the general popu-lation prevalence of consultations with a naturopathic practitioner either in the previous 12 months or over the user's lifetime were considered for inclusion. All relevant papers were included irrespective of language of publi-cation or risk of bias score. Articles were excluded that presented results from specific subpatient populations (eg, children, female or male specific, age limitations, illness populations). Studies were also excluded if they only presented the prevalence of consultations with other health professionals that may use treatments commonly associated with naturopathy (eg, herbal medicine, hydro-therapy, yoga) but were not explicitly named as naturo-pathic practitioners, or where naturopathic consultation rates were conflated with a cumulative group of health services (such as complementary and complementary alternative medicine (CAM)). To ensure the analysis reflected contemporary patterns of use, studies were excluded if they were published before 2010. Search strategy A systematic electronic search of the following databases was conducted between 6 September 2019 and 2 October 2019: MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, Global Health, WHO Iris, PROQUEST dissertations database and Lilac. The complete search strategy for MEDLINE, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms where appropriate, is presented in box 2. A search for grey liter - ature was also performed. The search targeted countries where, according to the WHO Global Report on Tradi-tional and Complementary Medicine (2019), 17 naturo- pathic practitioners provide care to the community. The search was performed using the Google search engine and the terms prevalence, use, naturopathy, report and the country name. Article identification and selection A list of all citations identified through the search were exported from each database by AM and uploaded to Covi-dence 18 for filtering and selection. Initial screening of title and abstracts against the inclusion/exclusion criteria was conducted by AM. Two members of the authorship team (AM and AS) then independently reviewed the full text of the remaining citations to determine their suitability against the same criteria. Any differences were resolved through discussion between both reviewing authors. The list of bibliographic references and subsequent citations (identified through Google Scholar) of included papers were also checked by AS to identify additional articles otherwise missed through the database search. JEH and JS extracted data from the included papers. AS and JS assessed the papers for quality of reporting against the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist 19; risk of bias was assessed using the tool developed by Hoy et al20 by JG and JA. Differences in scoring for both tools were resolved through discussion until consensus was achieved.

Articles with unclear numerators or denominators were calculated by the research team where the neces-sary information was provided or checked against source documents for the same study. Authors were contacted to verify information not able to be determined through these other methods. Prevalence rates and standard errors were calculated using a standardised Microsoft Excel (V.12.3.5, Microsoft, Redmond, USA) spreadsheet. 22 Review Manager software (V.5.3, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to conduct the meta- analysis, using random effects models by the generic inverse variance method. W eighted prevalence rates with 95% CI were calculated for 12- month prevalence and lifetime prevalence sepa - rately. Separate analyses were conducted for (1) country of origin and (2) WHO world regions. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated on the basis of the raw proportions, by using the I 2 statistic. Intervals were defined as per published guidance23 24: low of 75%-100%). In order to assess heterogeneity, 2 tests were conducted with p0.10.24 We intended to perform sensitivity analyses to compare differences between outcomes on all studies to studies with low risk of bias only (defined as <4 items recorded as 'no' on the Hoy et al tool). However, as all studies were classified as low risk of bias, this was not possible. RESULTS Search characteristicsThe article selection process is presented in figure 1. The database search identified 13 968 citations including 2509 duplicates. Of these, 11 374 were excluded through title and abstract screening. The full text of the remaining 85 articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 78 were excluded for the following reasons: not reporting natu-ropathic consultations (n=54), conference abstract only (n=9), not original research (n=7), wrong outcomes reported (n=5), overlooked duplicate (n=2) and wrong study design (n=1) (full list of excluded studies available in online supplemental file 1). This resulted in seven arti-cles being retained. A search for grey literature using the Google Search engine was also performed, and targeted countries where, according to the WHO Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine (2019), 4 naturopaths/naturopathic doctors are providing care to the community. The reference lists and subsequent cita-tions of the remaining articles were checked and when combined with the results of the Google Search, resulted in identification of an additional 19 articles (3 references and 16 citations), of which one report was found to meet the inclusion criteria for this review.

BMJ Open 2022;12:e056075. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056075Open access of eight included studies, one of which was published in a report. Study characteristics The included studies reporting 12- month prevalence of naturopathy use in a national population were repre - sented across four of the six WHO world regions: Euro-pean (n=2), 25 26 Eastern Mediterranean (n=1),27 Region of the Americas (n=3)28-30 and the Western Pacific (n=1)31 (see table 2). One of the studies from Canada presented the lifetime prevalence of naturopathy use,30 and an addi- tional study from India (South East Asian World region) did not specify the time period during which naturopathy was used 21 (see table 3). All included studies sampled the general adult popu - lation and reported data from a nationally representa-tive sample or demonstrated a distribution of economic categories, except for one study from Israel whereby the majority of participants' subjective economic status was rated as 'very good' or 'good'. 27 Four studies included prevalence data from more than one time point,26-28 30 with the earliest data collected in 1993.27 Two papers reported data from the same national cohort study, but from different time points. 28 29 All studies included participants from both urban and rural locations. Risk of bias Critical appraisal of the included studies is presented in table 4 . All studies were determined to have a low risk of bias, except for one study that was suspected of having non- response bias.27 All but one study31 had problematic reporting of the numerator and denominator, however, this was able to be addressed by the research team by interrogating the provided data or checking source docu-ments from the primary cohort studies. One study was identified as not having an acceptable case definition 21 as it did not specify the period of time covering naturopathy use (eg, previous 12 months or users' lifetime). Assessment of the reporting quality of included studies identified several issues. More than one- half of studies did not clearly identify the study design in the title.21 27-31 None of the included studies provided reasons for non- participation or provided information about missing data. Four of the included studies did not acknowledge the limitations of their research. In one case, some of the omissions in reporting may be explained by the nature of the publication (ie, grey literature report rather than a peer - reviewed journal article).30 Summary of findingsThe 12- month prevalence reported in studies from the European region ranged between 2% in the UK25 to 7.7% in Switzerland.26 One study from the Eastern Mediterra- nean region (ie, Israel)27 reported multiple prevalence rates ranging from 20% in 1993 through to 18% in 2007. Three studies from the Region of the Americas reported 12- month prevalence rates of naturopathy use between 3% (in 1997) and 5% (in 2016) in Canada,30 and between 0.25% (in 2002) and 0.4% (in 2015) in the USA.28 29 One study from the Western Pacific region (ie, Australia) reported a 6.2% prevalence rate. 31 Two studies reported prevalence of naturopathy use over other time periods. One study from the Region of the Americas (Canada) indicated 6% of the general population in 1997, 9% in 2006, and 11% in 2016 used naturopathy at some point in the user's lifetime. 30 A study from the South- East Asian world region indicated 10% of the population had used naturopathy and yoga, but the time frame of use was not specified. 32 Meta-analysis resultsThe estimated 12- month prevalence rates of naturop- athy use for different countries are shown in figure 2. Prevalence rates significantly differed between countries (p<0.001) and ranged from less than 1% of the popula-tion in the USA to 8% in Switzerland. While the primary studies were subject to wide heterogeneity, significant heterogeneity was only found for Canada (p=0.01) and the USA (p<0.001). Regarding WHO world regions, 12- month prevalence of naturopathy use ranged from 1% in the Region of the Americas to 6% in European and Western Pacific Regions, again with significant differences between regions (p<0.001; figure 3 ). Relevant and statistically significant heterogeneity was present in studies involving the European Region (p<0.001), and Region of the Amer - icas (p<0.001). Since all studies were classified as having low risk of bias, no sensitivity analyses were conducted. No meta- analysis could be per formed on studies reporting prev- alence of naturopathy use over other time periods due to the paucity and heterogeneity ofstudies reporting this outcome. DISCUSSION This review presents the most recent synthesis of evidence of the global prevalence of consultations with naturo-paths/naturopathic doctors. The prevalence of natu-ropathy/naturopathic medicine use was reported in seven countries, across five WHO designated regions of the world. However, it should also be acknowledged that data were only available for a small number of countries in each world region. Intra- region variability limits the overall generalisability of such findings to the relevant region and, as such, aggregate regional results should be interpreted with caution. Of the regions reporting 12- month prevalence rates, the highest was in the Eastern Mediterranean region (Israel), with 18% (2007) to 20% (1993) of the general population seeking the ser vices of a naturopath/naturopathic doctor. The lowest reported 12- month prevalence of naturopathy use was obser ved in the Americas (USA), with a rate of 0.4% (2012). Lifetime prevalence of use was reported in two countries: Canada (6% in 1997 to 11% in 2016); and India (7% rural, 12% urban in 2011/12).

BMJ Open 2022;12:e056075. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056075Open access data was available, there was a relative amount of consis- tency across time suggesting naturopathy/naturopathic medicine use is temporally stable in these countries. The wide range in the rates of consultation with a natu- ropath/naturopathic doctor may reflect differences in the perception and availability of naturopathy in specific countries. For example, while national prevalence of consultations with naturopaths in the USA is relatively low, this may obscure significant heterogeneity within that region. For example, insurance data from Washington state show prevalence of naturopathic consultation to be four times higher than the national prevalence (1.6% vs 0.4%).33 Such heterogeneity may be similarly observed in other regions and may be due to several factors. In the USA recognition of the naturopathic profession through licensure is not uniformly applied across that nation, 33 and distribution of the naturopathic workforce has histor - ically been determined by the proximity to naturopathic educational institutions. 34 Insurance coverage is also known to be a significant driver of naturopathic use,35 and variable insurance coverage arrangements for natu-ropathy\u2014as observed in the USA 36\u2014may also result in regional differences. Further attention towards regional variations and heterogeneity, particularly as it relates to specific barriers and facilitators to appropriate utilisation of naturopathic services\u2014is warranted. The wide range in rates of naturopathy use may also reflect differences in scope of practice in each world region. For example, in the USA, naturopathic physicians are considered to bridge conventional medicine and traditional medicine systems and treatments, 37 while in Germany, naturopathic practitioners known as 'Heilprak-tiker' are a distinct category and reportedly have incon-sistent training and clinical abilities. 38 As such, the term naturopathy may be differentially classifying practitioners due to professionalisation, resulting in an underestimate of use in some countries and overestimate in others. Further consideration of the implications associated with the inconsistent 'protection' of professional titles and defined scopes of practice for naturopaths/naturopathic doctors by country is likely to influence the prevalence of use by the public. 2 Prevalence data from some countries may also be impacted by definitional difficulties or confusion around the term 'naturopathy'. For example, naturopathy is often grouped under a broader nomenclature as one of the many modalities or therapies considered 'comple-mentary approaches to healthcare' 39 or 'integrative medi- cine' and thus may not be individually represented in the publications included in our analysis. Multiple prac-titioner types may also present difficulties for data collec-tion. For example, a review of complementary medicine services in Europe found that of the (22 300) practi-tioners of naturopathy, 15 000 were identified as (mostly German) medical doctors.40 Thus, patients may not iden- tify obtaining naturopathy as a service per se, but as part of the standard care they receive from a medical doctor who integrates naturopathic principles or modalities into Table 3 Summary information of included studies r eporting prevalence of use of naturopathy over other time periods WHO regionCountry (WHO region) Author Economic status Design (measure) Year data collected PopulationNaturopathy descriptorSetting (eg, urban, rural) NDuration of exposure Overall use Region of the AmericasCanada Esmail (2017) 30Evenly distributed (<US$20 General Both occupation, social group, education, and religionCross- sectional (survey)2011-2012 Households in the general populationNaturopathy and yogaBoth Total: 65 Urban: n=3227 (12)Rural: n=2607 (7) on September 2023 by guest.

This may be one reason why three of the largest European countries by naturopathic workforce (Germany, Portugal and Spain 2) were not represented in this review. Thus, the true prevalence of naturo-pathic consultations is likely under- reported. Further , an examination of government administered national health surveys of the general population in the countries represented by World Naturopathic Federation (WNF) member organisations, found only Switzerland, Northern Ireland, USA, Mexico and India currently included items that specifically measured consultations with a naturo-path/naturopathic doctor (see online supplemental file 2 and figure 4). While some non- government research has undertaken to measure the prevalence of naturopathy use in additional countries, data are not available in more than 90% of countries with WNF member organisations, and 95% of all countries reported by the WHO as having a naturopathic profession. To evaluate the potential role of naturopaths in care delivery, it is imperative that natu-ropathic health services and workforce research data is captured in all countries where there is a significant natu-ropathic presence. Furthermore, although naturopathic practice is rela- tively consistent globally, local, and regional variations in preferred therapies may result in point- of- ser vice differences that may impact prevalence of naturopathic CriteriaManuscript Hunt et al25Klein et al26Shmueli et al27Esmail30Su and Li 28Clarke et al 29McIntyre et al 31Srinivasan and Sugumar 32 21\u2014Generalisability Y Y Y Y Y Y Y N Other information 22\u2014Funding Y Y Y Y N N Y Y N/A, not available.Table 4 Continued Figure 2 A 12- month pr evalence of naturopathy use in different countries.

For example, in the UK, historical connections between osteopathy and natu-ropathy may drive naturopathic use for musculoskeletal conditions in that country more than in countries like Australia, where naturopathy and herbalism have had a larger shared history and connection. 41 Some studies in this review explicitly combined queries about naturo-pathic utilisation with other complementary medicine practices\u2014for example, herbalism and naturopathy in the Australian study. Thus, it is important that a reliable validated instrument is developed for collecting more specific data about naturopathic service utilisation within and across countries to establish 'true' prevalence of use information. While prevalence data provides a snapshot of a given populations' use of naturopathy, less is known about the factors associated with that use. For example, factors that have previously been raised as impacting the use of naturopathy/naturopathic medicine, include licen-sure and regulation, scope of practice, training of new Figure 3 A 12- month pr evalence of naturopathy use in different who world regions.

For example, Austra-lian studies published before 2010 show a self- reported prevalence of naturopathic use among the general popu - lation of mid- aged women to be 8.7%, while rates of use for cancer (15.7%) and depression (22.2%) were signifi - cantly higher.9 Similar variations were seen in insurance data from Washington state in the USA, where 7.1% of insured cancer patients made claims for naturopathic treatment, compared with 1.6% of general enrollees. 33 With this in mind, future research should more closely examine the characteristics of users of naturopathy in different countries and world regions both for the general population and within subpopulations. One of the limitations of prevalence studies in the context of naturopathy, is they fail to capture the breadth of treatments that is unique to naturopathy and they do not capture data associated with the quality of care, role within healthcare systems, nor the efficacy and safety of naturopathic approaches to the management of specific conditions. 43 Thus, research into the quality, safety, effi- cacy and cost- effectiveness of naturopathy/naturopathic medicine would provide pragmatic understanding about the contribution of naturopathy to healthcare within populations and more broadly across the world. Addi - tionally, although limiting data collection to studies published after 2010 helps to ensure prevalence data most accurately reflects contemporary utilisation, such time limits may have excluded some studies in regions that were missing from the review. Additionally, observing changes in prevalence of naturopathic consultations over time may also be able to offer insights into the changing role of naturopathy/naturopathic medicine in relation to health systems changes or generational health needs. 44 CONCLUSIONAlthough the naturopathic workforce has a significant presence globally, there is limited detailed data on the prevalence of naturopathic consultations. As such, there is a need for a reliable validated instrument to be developed for collecting more specific data about naturopathic service utilisation within and across coun-tries. Nevertheless, current evidence reports a 12- month prevalence of naturopathy use ranging from 1% in the Region of the Americas to 6% in European and Western Pacific Regions, though there are significant differences between and within world regions. Differences in natu-ropathic utilisation in these regions may be indicative of a range of policy, legislative and social factors impacting the naturopathic profession. Despite these ongoing factors, further research attention is warranted to develop evidence- based responses to the WHO recommendation that naturopathy and other traditional medicines be inte - grated, where appropriate, into healthcare systems so that consumers have access to safe and effective multidis-ciplinary care.
