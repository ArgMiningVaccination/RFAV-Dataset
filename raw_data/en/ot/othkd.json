The FY 2024 Budget Request directly supports the United States' ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the conseque nces of a wide range of natural and man-made medical and public health security threats and includes the FY 2024 budget justification for the HHS Office of the Chief Information Officer Cybersecurity Program, the Office of National Security (ONS), the Office of Global Affairs (OGA) pandemic programs, the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps led by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), and other HHS-wide preparedness proposals. The FY 2024 Budget requests resources for the Admi nistration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in a new account, separate from PHSSEF where funding has historically been appropriated. Please see the ASPR Congressional Justification for details on the FY 2024 Budget request. Cybersecurity The HHS Cybersecurity program main tains the security of an array of unique systems and sensitive data within the Department. To meet its mission, HHS ma intains a vast array of secure information. The Department awards more grants than any other Fede ral agency, requiring system s in place to keep such financial data secure. Additionally, the Department's systems are utili zed across the Federal Government and maintain sensitive data, including personally identi fiable information, health records, sensitive biodefense research, and proprietary data. The evolving cyber threat landscape coupled with the rapid proliferation of information assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased mobility of the HHS workforce, and the need to derive value and intelligence from information assets has forced HHS to redefine its appr oach to managing and protecting information assets. The Cybersecurity program plays a key role in the security and privacy of HHS Protect and its respective sub-component system s, including information stored, processed, and transmitted. The FY 2023 President's Budget for the HHS Cybe rsecurity program is $188,326,000, which is $88,326,000 above FY 2023 Enacted. The FY 2024 request will allow HHS to manage existing solutions, address cybersecurity mandates through targeted initi atives, and complement current network protection tools. The requested funds continue support and sust ainment of the Department's existing cybersecurity and privacy programs while also enabling deployment of cybersecurity initiatives aligned to the HHS priorities. In addition to the existing and emer ging priorities supported by the cybersecurity program, requested funding provides support for the implementati on of Zero Trust, improvement of multifactor authentication and encryption, improved logging, an d expanding support of the H ealth and Public Health sector. These activities are mandated by Executiv e Orders, Office of Management and Budget memoranda, and law. Office of National Security The Office of National Security (ONS) provides strate gic all-source information, intelligence, defensive counterintelligence, insider threat, cyber threat in telligence, enterprise supply chain risk management (E-SCRM), security for classified information, and communications security support across the Department. ONS increases the Department's securi ty and threat awareness and its ability to respond swiftly and effectively to national and homeland security threats. ONS engages with Federal partners and others to analyze all-source intelligence/information and identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and it identifies and assesses trends and patterns across the Department while de veloping and implementing Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 3 mitigation strategies. ONS is responsible for the safe guarding of all classified information, equipment, and facilities across the Department and is HHS's Federal Intelligence Coordination Office and the Secretary's Senior Intelligence Official. The FY 202 4 President's Budget for ONS is $11,983,000, which is $3,000,000 above the FY 2023 Enacted. U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (Corps) is a cadre of full-time and part time officers dedicated to promoting and advanci ng public health and disease prevention programs. As one of America's seven uniformed services, the Corp s fills essential public health leadership and service roles within the nation's federal government agencies and programs. Officers serve as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, den tists, dietitians, engineers, environmental health officers, health service officers, scientists, therapists, and veterinarians. In addition to their regular duties such as providing patient care to underserved populations or conducting biomedical research, Corps officers respond to public health crises, natural disast ers, disease outbreaks, and terrorist attacks and serve on humanitarian assistance missions around the world. To protect the health of the American people for the next century, the Corps has engaged in an historic modernization initiative that will transform its force structure and ensure its readiness in order to meet the full spectrum of public health challenges facing the nation. The FY 2024 budget provides $20 million for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health within the Office of the Secretary. This funding will provide fo r the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. These new resources will support: $2 million for U.S. Public Health Serv ice Readiness and Training activities, $4 million for the Public Health and Em ergency Response Strike Team, and $14 million for Commissioned Corps Ready Reserve. These investments will ensure the Commissioned Corp s is equipped to effectively respond to future public health emergency response operations, as rapidly as possible, while being equipped with surge capacity. Office of Global Affairs Influenza and Pandemic Negotiation The PHSSEF supports the HHS Office of Global Affairs in their work to lead global health diplomacy and policy coordination efforts for HHS to strengthe n international pandemic preparedness, especially pandemic influenza preparedness. OGA will continue to enhance international influenza preparedness by providing strategic coordination and technical exper tise on health policy development and diplomacy to global partners, including nearly 200 Ministries of Health. Pandemic Preparedness Mandatory Funding The budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding, available over five years, across the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH ), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of pandemic preparedness and biodefense priorities as outlined in the 2021 American Pandemic Preparedness Plan and the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan . Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 4 Public Health Emergency Fund The FY 2024 Budget provides $50 million for the Public Health Emergency Fund, authorized by section 319(b) of the Public Health Service Act, to allow the HHS Secretary to immediately respond to a public health threat or declared emergency. These flexible funds are available to address the breadth of the Department's responsibilities and will allow HHS to rapi dly deploy resources early in a response effort. Potential uses for the funding in clude deploying human services resources after a natural disaster, responding to the public health effects of a terrori st attack, addressing emergency nutritional needs for vulnerable populations, or responding to any other public health threat. Secretary's 1% Transfer Authority The FY 2024 President's Budget proposes to expand th e HHS Secretary's one percent transfer authority such that the PHSSEF appropriation could be increased by up to ten percent instead of three percent. As learned from public health threats such as COVID-19, it is critical for the Department to have the flexibility needed to respond as quickly as possible wh en such threats arise. An expanded one percent transfer authority would allow the Secretary to tr ansfer more resources to emergency programs funded by the PHSSEF appropriation in order to accelerate critical public health and medical response activities.

Direct Federal Program Description OGA serves a unique role within HHS by providing l eadership in global health diplomacy, fostering critical international relationships, providing strategi c coordination for international health engagements across HHS and the U.S. Government (USG), and u tilizing its expertise in global health and emerging infectious diseases for the development of policy. OGA synthesizes, integrates, and translates policy, science, and diplomatic issues and challenges into actionable steps and initiatives that support core principles (e.g., equity, accountability, transparency ) and achieve progress on priorities for HHS, as well as for the many global partners with whom we work, in cluding on international issues that impact or may be impacted by U.S. domestic considerations. On behalf of the Secretary, OGA manages key relationships with: nearly 200 Ministries of Health across the globe; key multila teral and international institutions involved in health security [e.g., the Un ited Nations (World Health Organization [WHO], and Food and Animal Organization), the World Bank Group, the World Organization for Animal Health, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, etc.]; and with numerous foreign governments (including throu gh partnerships in the G7 and G 20), particularly in developing countries.

Direct Federal Program Overview, Cybersecurity Cha llenges, Requirements, and Priorities Program Overview: The Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sect or continues to be a primary target for some of the most advanced cybercriminals in the world. As a matter of national security, the HHS Cybersecurity program requires the requested levels in support of the challenges that accompany rapidly changing technologies and the influences of hostile actors. The cybersecurity threat landscape continues to evolve at a rapid pace with a heightened focus on the HPH sector as a prime target for bad actors. The unpreced ented volume of threat activ ity in the sector over the last several years, the COVID-19 pandemic, and high -profile global cybersecuri ty events pose significant challenges to the HHS Cybersecurity program missi on. These activities demonstrate cybersecurity vulnerabilities have the potential to dramatically imp act the critically necessary HHS mission and the HPH sector. The HHS Cybersecurity program, within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), under the Assistant Secretary for Administration (ASA), assure s that all information systems throughout HHS are designed, operated, and maintained with the appropria te information technology security and privacy data protections. HHS continues to increa se its protections agai nst cyberthreats, which pose great risk to HHS' critical functions and services, in addition to the c onfidentiality, integrity, and availability of HHS data. These threats include unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data, denial of service, malicious code, inappropriate usage of HHS information and information systems, and insider threats. Cybersecurity Challenges: Cybersecurity, privacy, and end-of-life legacy systems remain the top three IT challenges facing HHS. As the capabilities of bad actors evolve and expand - specifically increased sophistication in phishing, malware, and ransomware campai gns - so must HHS capabilities to detect and respond to those threats. The HHS cyber program must also be proactive, responsive, and able to stay ahead of adversarial innovation. To do this, HHS must be able to invest in tools, technologies and talent that provides focus on timely and proactive detec tion of previously unseen approaches by malicious actors. Cybersecurity Requirements: The HHS Cybersecurity program and its many functions are mandated, in whole or in part, by increasing federal mandates, many of which also impact the HPH sector and HHS' role in the sector. The number of mandates exceed s over 100 including notable Executive Orders such as EO 14017 - America's Supply Chains, EO 14028 - Nation's Cybersecurity, and EO 14034 - Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries. These Executive Orders cover a broad range of activities. HHS is focused on three cybersecurity requirements: 1. Modernizing federal HHS cybersecurity Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 29 2. Improving the detection of cybersecurity vul nerabilities and incidents on HHS networks 3. Improving HHS investigative and remediation capabilities. Cybersecurity Priorities: Executive Order 14028 calls for the Fede ral government to improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and r espond to cyber threats and actors. To accomplish the requirements under these directives, HHS has the following Cybersecurity priorities: 1. PRIORITY ONE: Implementation of a Zero Trust architecture throughout the HHS environment. 2. PRIORITY TWO: Improving the adoption of multifactor authentication (MFA) and encryption. 3. PRIORITY THREE: Enhancing logging and remediation. 4. PRIORITY FOUR: Continuing the deployment of previously identified capabilities across HHS, such as the capabilities provided under the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) pr ogram for inventory, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), MFA and encryption. 5. PRIORITY FIVE - Expand HPH sector support by maturing established programs such as the HHS Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3), the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 (CSA) program, and Section 40 5(d) programs (405d), while establishing an HPH sector cybersecurity incident management capability. Incident management, HC3 and 405d programs strengthen the cybersecurity posture of the healthcare and public health sector. HHS Cybersecurity Program Description and Accomplishments The HHS Cybersecurity program implements a compre hensive, enterprise-wide program to protect the critical information with which the Department is entrusted. HHS continually increases its protections against cyber threats, such as unauthorized access, deni al of service, malicious code, inappropriate usage, and insider threat, all of which pose risks to HHS cr itical functions, services, and data. HHS already has achieved significant maturity in identity management and automation and has made large improvements in multi-factor authentication for both citizen-facing and internal services. Currently the program oversees approximately 800 system s, 381,000 endpoints, and 63 high value assets. The program identifies and oversees the disposition of nearly 8,000 managed cyber incidents. The program maintains an internal ethical phishing progr am demonstrating 96% of the total phishing exercises result in user detection and avoidance. The phishin g exercise demonstrates users are gaining the ability to spot attempts to infiltrate HHS systems. Add itionally, through the program , HHS Healthy Technology program trains thousands of HHS users throughout the year. The program's cyber-focused on-demand resources, called CyberCARE, saw 73,000 website view s this year. The HHS cybersecurity program conducted over 3,000 web applicati on web vulnerability scans resulting in the scanning of nearly a million web pages. Approximately 260,000 vulner abilities were prevented from being exploited. The program partners with over 25 Federal groups including the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the Department's cybersecurity posture in real time. The Cybersecurity program has streamlined collabora tion during cyber events across the Department and established relationships with both th e public and private health sectors . The program continues to lean forward; the integration of cybersecurity in the Department's overarching Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program has led to HHS being regarded as a risk management thought leader. The program continues to bolster the healthcare sector's cybersecurity posture. The HHS 405(d) Program, though the HHS HC3, routinely creates HPH fo cused cybersecurity awareness materials that are utilized in any size organization. The program h as released more than 80 cybersecurity awareness Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 30 resources which organizations across the HPH sector leverage to implement best practices and raise cybersecurity awareness within their organizations. Twenty-five of these resources were released in the first half of 2022 alone. This public-private part nership program has become one of the leading HPH focused cybersecurity platforms with an average of 80,000 visits per month to the 405(d) public website and over 2,000 subscribers representing a cro ss-section of entities in the HPH sector. HHS has consistently demonstrated the ability to pr otect its networks, data and systems while providing much-needed support and guidance to the HPH sector. Investments is needed now to ensure these initiatives can continue and can be scaled to meet the continually evolving threat landscape. Cybersecurity Program Capabilities: The HHS comprehensive, enterprise-wide Cybersecurity program can be grouped as a tactical delivery of cybersecurity capabilities and a mo re strategic information security modernization program. Th ese cybersecurity capabilities and services include: Cybersecurity Operations and Engagements Cybersecurity Risk, Governance, FISMA Compliance, and Privacy Management Cybersecurity Technologies, Innova tions, and Enterprise Solutions Funding History for the HHS Cybersecurity pr ogram is $188,326,000, which is an increase of $88,326,000 compared to FY 2023 Enacted. The FY 2024 request will allow HHS to manage existing solutions, address cybersecurity mandates through targ eted initiatives, and complement current network protection tools. The requested funds continue supp ort the sustainment of the Department's existing cybersecurity and privacy programs while also enabli ng deployment of cybersecur ity initiatives aligned to the HHS priorities. In addition to the existing a nd emerging priorities supported by the cybersecurity program, requested funding provides support for the im plementation of Zero Trust, improvement of MFA and encryption, improved logging, and expanding support of the HPH sector. These activities are mandated by Executive Orders, OMB memoranda and law.

In addition to these activities, HHS is responsible for implementing the requirements of EO 14208, a key cybersecurity driver. Other key cybersecurity mandates include: Coordinating and supporting the de ployment of Zero Trust architectures across HHS operating environments, including on-prem ise and cloud platforms, and Enhancing data logging, event correlation, endpoi nt detection and incident response including implementing a consolidated enterprise security and network operations capability. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 31 Cybersecurity Funding Alignment: Changes in cybersecurity priorities and response drive funding levels. The FY 2024 Budget reinforces HHS' ability to provide vulnerability response while putting in place greater more proactive cybersecurity protections mo re quickly and effectively. Lack of funds at the requested level puts these efforts at risk. Th e FY 2024 Budget request di rectly aligns the HHS Cybersecurity and en sures ongoing continuation for: Enhancing HHS' cybersecurity strategy to meet th e evolving threat landscape and sophistication of attackers. HHS' protections, tools, technologies, and talent must evolve, or HHS information and networks will be compromised. Engaging and expanding HPH sector-wide collaborat ion and information sharing. HHS has a responsibility to its components and the sector to cultivate partnerships a nd share information. Lack of continuous information sharing may resu lt in the HHS or its sector partners facing significant threats and vulnerabilitie s for which they are unprepared. The FY 2024 Budget request also enhances: Support for the implementation of a Zero-Trust architecture Expanding identity and access ma nagement tools and services Executing Zero-Trust policy-based access Modernizing the enterprise network to enable Ze ro-Trust principles, capabilities, competencies (maintaining, enhancing, and deploying tools and t echnologies that enable us to stay ahead of our attackers). Program Initiatives: Requested funding will also enable depl oyment of cybersecurity initiatives aligned to the expanding threat environment, legislative ma ndates, and Presidential directives. Program initiatives supporting the HHS cybersecurity priorities include: Establishing a zero-trust architecture and strate gy requiring HHS components to meet specific cybersecurity standards and objectives. Reinforcing the Department's defenses against in creasingly sophisticated and persistent threat campaigns. Improve predictive, investigativ e, and remediation capabilities related to cybersecurity events. Strengthen the ability to pr edict and respond to incidents when and even before they occur. Prioritizing recruitment, capture, maturing, a nd retaining an effectiv e cybersecurity federal workforce. HHS must invest in expanding cybersecu rity technologies, but it must also ensure an evolving remote cyber workforce to stay ahead of challenges. Improving information sharing between Public a nd Private sectors and encourage healthcare to augment and align investments with the goal of minimizing vulnerabilities and future incidents Significant funding levels are requi red to maintain existing cybersecu rity capabilities, execute initiatives supporting HHS cybersecurity prior ities, and implementation of the requirements under EO 14028 (and associated directives). Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 32 Summary of Cybersecurity FY 2022-2024 Funding by National Institute of Standards and Technol ogy (NIST) Cyb ersecurity Framework (Dollars in FY 2022. $104.4 million reached by including $33 million in COVID-19 supplemental resources. Summary of Cybersecurity FY 2022-2024 Funding by Activity (Dollars in Thousands) Cybersecurity Activities and Initiatives FY 2022 Final $30,720 $34,787 $38,459 $100,000 $188,326 $88,326 and Social Services Emergency Fund 33 HHS Cybersecurity Program Enterprise Activities Cybersecurity Programs: As part of its total funding cybe r funding request, the HHS Cybersecurity Program performs many activities to ensure cybersec urity across the HHS enterprise. The program provides cybersecurity operations and engagement activities which in clude engagement with the HPH sector, cyber threat hunting, intelligence, and awaren ess including cybersecurity situational awareness functions. The program also executes cybersecurity risk management, governan ce, Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) compliance, and privacy management functions across the Department. These programs also provide for cybersecu rity solutions, systems, and resources in support of and leveraged by the Department. Cybersecurity Initiatives: The Department must invest in complia nce with federal directives, mandates, and legislation and respond to a quickly evolving thre at environment. Funding from this request also supports maturing and increasing cybersecurity tools a nd enterprise cybersecurity solutions Department- wide. These tools and solutions include licenses, secu rity infrastructure, software, and next generation security technologies (including solutions addressing, cloud logging, encryption, enterprise malware, content filtering, data loss prevention, vulnerability- scanning, automated reporting, logging, analysis, and security weakness tracking). Program and Initiative Funding Totals: Total funding for programs and initiatives results in a total increase of $88,326,000 compared to FY 2023 Enacted. Increased funding synergistically with more targeted execution of program funding is necessary to respond to both increasing legislation, mandates, and directives, and an evol ving cyber threat landscape. Coupled with the rapid proliferation of information assets, the increased mob ility of the HHS workforce, and the need to derive value and intelligence from information assets, th ese actions collectively have forced HHS to redefine its approach to managing and protecting information assets. An investment in programs and initiatives such as Zero Trust and security logging is a response to the most cu rrent threat environment, mandates, legislation, and Presidential Directives. Alignment of funds is de tailed by the Program's activities and cybersecurity initiatives as follows: Cybersecurity Operations and Engagement (CSO) Activities ($21,892,000): The request is an increase of $505,000 compared to FY 2023 Enacted. Funding accounts for stronger program activity and supports enhancement and expa nsion of proactive cyber hunting, threat intelligence, and risk qualification capabilities to improve the Department's c ybersecurity situational awareness. CSO has coordinated response across the Department and Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector . As the number of cybersecurity incidents in the h ealthcare industry continue to increase, HHS must establish a stronger ability to support the HPH sector wh en incidents occur. Funding will strengthen the existing HPH sector support and establish an enhanced incident management team that can better: Track incidents when they occur Reach out to targets of th ese attacks to offer support Document and communicate the nature of the attack s to enhance threat warnings to others. CSO capabilities are deployed to proactively prevent att acks or, in the event of a successful attack on the enterprise, minimize the impacts. CSO addresses many threat vectors simultaneously by having a central view into all Department networks. As threats e volve and become more sophisticated and technology changes, attention to consolidated data automati on, proactive threat hunting capabilities, and machine learning (artificial intelligence) will enable the Departme nt to evolve and keep pace with those threats. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 34 The FY 2024 President's Budget provides for security capabilities impacting both the public and private health sectors. Funding as requested strengthens and enables CSO to expand and mature tracking, event research and analysis, quali fy and quantify threats, resolve incident s, protect, and defend the Department's network perimeter. Requested f unding provides collaboration of the cybersecurity environment with government and industry part ners and st akeholders: HHS and its component organizations: Managing cybersecurity engagements and response within the Department through the CSIRC and adva nced cyber defense capabilities.

Zero-Trust and Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Initiative ($50,818,000.00): The request is an increase of $42,931,000 compared to FY 2023 Enacted. Funding more effectively responds to EO 14208. In addition to the cybersecurity focused EO 14028, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued additional requirements under the directives M-21-31, \" Improving the Federal Government's Investigative and Remediation Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents \" and M-22-09, \" Federal Zero Trust Strategy .\" The requested levels are necessary to fund implementation of Zero Trust and associated requirements, per HHS Priority One. With these funds, HHS intends to enable better prevention, detection, assessment, and remediati on of cybersecurity threats by coordinating and supporting the deployment of Zero Trust architectur es across HHS operating environments, including on- premise and cloud platforms. Funding allows HHS to implement smart automation more effectively protecting data based on risk levels and principles of least privilege access. Specific initiatives from this request include: Supporting the development of a Zero Trust architect ure, which will be integrated into a selection of tools for next generati on secure cloud implementation. Modernizing the enterprise network to enab le Zero Trust principles and capabilities while improving cybersecurity supply chain capabilities and competencies. Expanding identity and access management tools a nd services to enable Zero Trust policy-based access. Reprioritizing workforce and cybersecurity s upport services to implement supply chain risk management, endpoint detection and response, insider threat, and counterintelligence. Specific implementation requirements at the HHS Op Div level are not covered in this budgetary submittal and are addressed through the appropr iate OpDiv Congressional Justifications. Resources required to support the implementation of Zero Trust, as mandated by the EO, cannot be avoided. Without baseline funding increases from Congress, full implementation of the EO and OMB Directives will not be possible and will leave HHS wi th diminished capacity to prevent and respond to hostile cyber activities. Smartphones, mobile, Virtual Private Networks (VPN ), and cloud computing significantly changed the way the HHS stores, accesses, and secures data while me eting the protection and accessibility demanded by the public's interest. Funding enables prevention, det ection, assessment, and remediation of cybersecurity threats by coordinating and supporting the deployment of Zero Trust strategy and architectures across the Department, including on-premise and cloud platforms. Funding directly addresses systems and services to implement EO 14028, specifically focusing on Zero Trust architecture across the Department and complia nce within OS. This activity includes specific resources to coordinate a Cybersecurity Supply Chai n Risk Management (SCRM) program and ensure its integration into HHS' overarching suppl y chain risk management capabilities. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 37 Funding addresses resources to develop an activ e and ongoing assessment of the Department's core architecture required to implement Zero Trust architectures. Implementation requires significant investment to prioritize use cases and redesign networ ks. The request enables the program to apply a granular analysis of the context, device, and user iden tity to strictly enforce least-privilege authorizations for each access request. Security Event Logging Initiative ($32,632,000.00): The request includes an increase of $29,337,000 compared to FY 2023 Enacted. Increased funding accounts for supporting the current cyber mission needs while ensuring that HHS is responsive to the requirements of the EO and M-21-31, Improving the Federal Government's Investigative and Remedia tion Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents . Lack of requested funds brings increased risk to th e Department's effectiven ess for threat intelligence, behavior profiling and analytics, and limits the cap abilities for a comprehensive, unified security event logging initiative causing HHS to fall short of fu ll implementation of a federal requirement. Multiple initiatives regarding EO14028 and associat ed memorandums including enhanced logging, endpoint detection and response, and Zero Trust architecture (e.g., M-21-31, M-22-01, and M-22-09) have dramatically elevated the need for expanded S ecurity Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) log collection capabilities and centralized visibility throughout HHS. Executive Order 14028, directs \"...decisive action to improve the Federal Governme nt's investigative and remediation capabilities.\" Specifically, section 8 of the EO addresses \" logging, log retention, and log management .\" Funding dedicated to expanding HHS enterprise ability to captu re, store, share, and apply automated correlation activities is essential. Funds aligned for FY 2024 supplement current activity with increases and advancements across the Department. The Security Event Logging initiative (HHS Priority Three) includes add itional threat intelligence, threat logging, threat analysis, and threat response across the entire Department. The initiative enables security event logging strategies to leverage cloud service providers, increase the volume of telemetry data collected, and accelerated aggregation and correlation of logs. Aligned funding supports the ability to manage logs with updated storage capabilities and expa nded retention periods. This also accelerates compliance expanding current initiativ es while providing flexibility to le verage both old and new data in respond to cyber threats. Security Event Logging Initiative strengthens: Collection and storage of data from multiple sources in multiple formats and developing automation to enrich threat intelligence. Correlating more expansive data across the Depa rtment increasing the ability to isolate threat vectors. Categorizing data to help perform threat an alytics, better recognize tactics, techniques, procedures, and correlating relationships through modeling and visualizations. Automate updates to threat information and risk mitigations, integrating intelligence workflow processes to further enrich and communicate findings from existing data. Supporting various integrations via Application Pr ogram Interfaces (APIs), bidirectional feeds, and email notifications; and supporting the shar ing of intelligence across the Department and trusted communities. Without these funds HHS has increased risk to th e ability to respond and comply with increasing mandates and threats. Additionally, the Department's effectiveness for threat intelligence, behavior profiling and analytics limits the capabilities for a comprehensive, unified security event logging initiative. Limitations include: Continued manual reliance on human driven updates to threat information and risk mitigations as opposed to efficiencies from automated data analysis. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 38 Lack of real-time detection and lack of ag ility through visual reviews of limited data. Aging assets and technology not in tune with ever-evolving threats. Obstacles and potential inability to meet fe derally mandated expectations and the Administration's aggressive approach to cyber protection Inability to ensure Department-wide understanding of threats in real-time. Continued reliance on outdated analysis capabilities combined with outdated communication and alert processes. The Budget request proposes a Department-wide servi ce to collect and transmit centralized cloud log in conjunction with a Security and Network Operations Capability (SNOC). This capability consolidates network performance and traffic teleme try along with cybersecurity event and incident data enabling better visibility and reporting acro ss the Department. The content provided by SNOC will improve awareness and decision making across HHS and depict network and security status and readiness at near real time. Funding will directly address the EO's expectation \"...ensuring centralized access and visibility fo r the highest-level enterprise secur ity operations center (SOC) of each agency.\" Funding supports ensuring centralized access and visib ility through consolidated security operations and network monitoring capabilities. National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) compliance requirements also exist for cloud log collection and reporting to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW). Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 39 HHS Cybersecurity - Outputs and Outcomes Table The HHS Cybersecurity Program transitioned to new measures during FY 2022. Legacy measurements reported in prior years, and required under quarter ly and annual FISMA reporting requirements, were rescinded by OMB and DHS in FY22 and are no longer tracked or collected.

Direct Federal Program Description and Accomplishments The Office of National Security (ONS) was estab lished in 2007 and in 2012 was designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) a nd the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) as the Department's Federal Intelligence Coordination Office (F ICO). In this capacity, ONS is the HHS point of contact with the Intelligence Community (IC) and is responsible for coordination with the IC and for intelligence and national security support to the S ecretary, senior policy makers and consumers of intelligence across the Department. Additionally, ONS is responsible for safeguarding classified national security information across the Department and the ap propriate sharing of intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement information externally and in ternally within HHS among the Operating and Staff Divisions. ONS is headed by the Director, who repor ts directly to the HHS Deputy Secretary. The Director serves as the HHS Secretary's Senior Inte lligence Official on nationa l security, intelligence and counterintelligence issues, the Senior Designated Official for insider threat issues, and as the Department's Federal Senior Inte lligence Coordinator (FSIC). The Director has also been delegated original classification authority by the Secretary. Besides the Immediate Office of the Director, ONS is comprised of five divisions, including the Intelligence and Analysis Division (IAD), the Sta ffing and Business Services Division (SBSD), the Personnel Security (PerSec) Division, the Operations Division, and the Enterprise Supply Chain Risk Management Division. These divisions are res ponsible for integrating intelligence and security information into HHS policy and operational decision s; assessing, anticipating, and warning of potential security threats to the Department and our nati onal security; and providing policy guidance on and managing the Office of the Secretary's implementati on of the Department's national security, intelligence (including cyber intelligence), and defensive counterintelligence/insider threat programs. ONS divisions identifies, assesses, and mitigates the risk to the integrity, trustwor thiness, and authenticity of mission- critical products, materials, information, and servi ces within the Department's internal supply chain. Many of these come from supply chains that interface with or operate in a global marketplace. Addressing the activities of adversaries and having a greater unders tanding of the risks inherent to the Department's participation in the global marketplace is crucia l to safeguarding the Department's mission and the nation's health and wellness. ONS integrates and synthesizes intelligence and all-s ource information on public health, terrorism, national security, weapons of mass destruction and ho meland security, in order to support HHS missions, enhance national security and help keep American s safe. More specifically, ONS programs include classified national security information manageme nt, secure compartmented information facilities Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 41 management, communications security, safeguarding and sharing of classified information, cyber threat intelligence and intelligence analysis and counter intelligence/insider threat. This operational responsibility is in support of th e Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA); Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information; and other relevant Executive Orders (including Executive Order 12333), Intelligence Comm unity Directives, Presidential Directives, and policy guidance. ONS has responsib ilities to establish implementing guidance, provide oversight, and manage the Department's policy for the sharing, safeguarding, and the coordinated exchange of information related to national or homeland security with other federal departments and agencies, including law enforcement organizations and the IC , in compliance with HHS policies and applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Operational Environment HHS is the world leader for medical research, medical product and pharmaceutical regulation, the administrator for billions of program dollars suppor ting health and human services programs domestically and internationally, and the principa l repository for personal medical a nd health related data. As such, HHS is a primary target for physical attacks as we ll as cyber-attacks, theft of intellectual property, technical data, or sensitive information from insider th reats, and foreign intelligence services or actors. ONS established a cadre of intelligence, counterintelli gence and cyber threat intelligence analysts, and special security professionals, to acquire, synthesi ze, analyze, and report on open source and classified information and assess its usefulness in supporting an d furthering the HHS mission. ONS utilizes all- source classified and unclassified information fro m the IC, as well as from Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, and other stakeholder organizations to pr ovide a comprehensive national or homeland security assessment to HHS senior leadership and others acros s the Department. In addition, ONS represents HHS on a number of external committees and councils res ponsible for interagency coordination on security threats, intelligence, counterintelligen ce, insider threat and cyber threat intelligence issues, including the sharing and safeguarding of national security information. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY The FY request for ONS is $11,983,000 which is a $3,000,000 increase over the FY 2023 Enacted. ONS continues to maintain its capability to provi de timely, appropriatel y tailored and relevant intelligence, and other strategic (including law en forcement sensitive) information to inform HHS decision-makers and their programs on potential na tional security threats domestically and abroad. Intelligence/Information is used by HHS to anticipate and warn of emerging threats that may require the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 42 department to adjust policy/programs; achieve global health security goals such as those related to the Ebola Epidemic; address major cyber intelligence-related threats (especially threat s directed at healthcare infrastructure); and support broader national security interests. In addition, the continuing cyber threats to the Depart ment's vital systems and information, and threats to the Healthcare and Public Health sector (including ra nsomware), make cyber threat intelligence critical to preventing and mitigating these incidents. ONS' ability to maintain and work closely with other federal departments and agencies, including law enforcemen t organizations and the IC, will help ensure the protection of both federal critical infrastructure and th e public health and health care sector, and provide deterrence and mitigation strategies from cyber security threats. Additionally, ONS continues to maintain the Department's capability to address 1) supply chai n risk management, 2) vetting of foreign national visitors, 3) assessing potential damage to HHS and national security from unauthorized disclosure of classified and/or sensitive information, and 4) addr essing potential cyber threats to the Nation's public health and medical infrastructure. The 2024 Budget includes an increase of $3 million fo r 18 additional FTE to enable ONS to address the increased workload and take a more proactive appro ach in the four programs noted below in order to better protect the Department. Program #1 - Enterprise Supply Chain Risk Management (E-SCRM): HHS faces significant challenges in managing agency risk across its dynami c mission and its extensive array of networks and information systems. The E-SCRM Program identifies, assesses, and mitigates the risk to the integrity, trustworthiness, and authenticity of mission-critical pr oducts, materials, informa tion, and services within the Department's internal supply chain. Many of thes e come from supply chains that interface with or operate in a global marketplace. Addressing the activities of adversaries and having a greater understanding of the risks inherent to the Department's participation in the global marketplace is crucial to safeguarding our Department's missions and the nation's health and wellness. The Department's approach to meeting the requirement s of statutes, Executive Orders, and regulations is an enterprise approach to managing threats and risks associated with the lifecycle (acquisition, sustainment, and disposal) of mission-critical pr oducts, materials, information, and services used throughout the Department and Divi sions. This will be accomplished by establishing a Department-level E-SCRM program in ONS to oversee and coordinate E-SCRM matters. The development of a strategy and implementation plan will lay out the roadmap for implementing effective Department E-SCRM capabilities, practices, processes, and tools within th e enterprise and support HHS's vision, mission, and values. This roadmap includes E-SCRM governance and coordination through policies, Cyber SCRM policies, role-based training, threats and risks an alysis, and information sharing with coordinated decisions. The HHS E-SCRM program is intended to shape polic ies, guidance, practices, processes, and procedures needed to implement a robust supply chain risk ma nagement capability. It is understood that E-SCRM policy at the Federal level is rapidly evolving, ther efore, the E-SCRM program will be postured to adapt to the evolving policy environment. Program #2 - Information Security Program: HHS houses a plethora of info rmation on public health and operations that may be considered unclassified but if released could cause a detriment to the agency or the United States. The Information Security Progr am includes the protection of sensitive unclassified and classified information. Currently, ONS has just one part-time employee supporting the protection of sensitive unclassified information and requires add itional FTEs to begin mee ting National Archives and Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 43 Records Administration (NARA) requirements for the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information. The Budget includes additional FTEs to support the pr otection of sensitive unclassified information for the Department as required by NARA regulations. Program #3 - Insider Threat Program: As security concerns arise in the Department, HHS ONS must further the development of a robust and effective In sider Threat Program to follow E.O. 13587. This threat mitigation program needs additional resources to be able to detect and identify improper or illegal actions, assess threats to determine levels of risk, and implement solutions to manage and mitigate the potential consequences of insider incidents across the department. ONS serves as the insider threat lead and coordinates with other offices (e.g., OIG, HR, se curity) through a Hub con cept to ensure insider threats are properly addressed as they arise. The furt her development of this team will also allow for strategic case processing/tracking, more in-depth coor dination with federal part ners, and more analysis. Program #4 - Cyber Threat Intelligence Program: HHS ONS, in partnership with the HHS Office of Information Security within the Office of the Ch ief Information Officer, is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the Cyber Threat Analysis Program (CTAP). The CTAP serves to address risks and maintain situational awareness on na tional security related cyber threats to increase the overall security posture of the Department. The CTAP is responsible for the integration of forensic and analytical capabilities to address the prevalent nationa l security related cyber threats and support the operational mission of HHS Operating Divisions (OpDiv s) most targeted for their highly sought-after intellectual property, sensitive technical data, researc h, economic data, personal identifiable information (PII) and protected health informati on (PHI). As the principal agency for protecting U.S. PHI, HHS must maintain a vigilant Department-wide advanced cybe r threat analytical capab ility to prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate national security related th reats. Cyber threats to the Department have significantly increased in recent y ears. Additional FTE will enable ONS to proactively focus on these threats instead of just having a reactive stance.

Permanent Allocation Method ............................................................................................................. ...... Direct Federal Program Description The Assistant Secretary for Health is the head of the USPHS Commissioned Corps (Commissioned Corps), which is one of the eight uniformed servi ces. The Commissioned Corps includes the Regular Commissioned Corps, Ready Reserve, and Public H ealth Emergency Response Strike Team (PHERST). The Surgeon General oversees the day-to-day opera tions of the entire Commissioned Corps, and Commissioned Corps Headquarters (CCHQ) is res ponsible for personnel, administration, medical, training, readiness, deployment ope rations, and policy for both the activ e duty and reserve components of the Commissioned Corps. Regular Corps officers fill clinical and service positi ons across more than 21 federal departments, both within the Department of Health and Human Servic es (HHS) (e.g., Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Contro l), as well as non-HHS agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Department of Defense, and Depa rtment of Homeland Security). The PHERST is also comprised of Regular Corps officers. Ready Reserve o fficers serve on a part-time basis, and together with PHERST officers, provide the Department with a critical public health and readiness resource. All officers must maintain readiness to deploy and res pond to public health crises, disease outbreaks, and humanitarian missions, because they deploy at the di rection of the President and the Secretary during public health emergencies and national disaster declarations. Examples of such deployments include but are not limited to national and global crises involving natural disasters, infectious disease threats, urgent public hea lth needs, and biological security threats. In recent years, requests for deployment of Public Health Se rvice officers expanded considerably. Deployments include critical medical and public health supp ort such as providing medical support along the southwestern border and Operations Allies Welcom e where the USPHS Commi ssioned Corps supported medical operations for repatriated Afghans. The U SPHS Commissioned Corps deployed over two-thirds of its officers in support of COVID-19, the highest historic deployment of officers. In addition, the USPHS Commissioned Corps continues to provide pu blic health and medical support at large scale national events including the State of the Union, Bo ston Marathon, and Independ ence Day Celebrations in Washington, D.C. Budget Request The FY 2024 President's Budget request for Co mmissioned Corps Readiness and Training is $2,000,000, which is an increase of +$2,000,000 over FY 2023 Enacted. This funding will fund two training FTEs, support and sustain three trai ning contracts, and provide training related Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 45 travel for approximately 10 percent of the Corp s. The funding will support training enhancement and development of officers to better meet the Corp s' regional, national, and global public health emergency responses. Five Year Funding Table Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 -- FY 2021 -- President's Budget $2,000,000 Program Accomplishments The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secur ity (CARES) Act included $16.7 million for readiness and training for Public Health Service officers. The funding is being utilized to ensure 25 percent of Public Health Service officers are trained in public health emergency response which includes access to training on chemical, biological, radiological, and en vironmental threats. CARES Act funding supports one additional training FTE to support the program. CCHQ has developed a new USPHS Commissioned Corps training standard that includes clinical, emergency management, and leadership skills. CCH Q has developed new career development courses that target mid-grade officers to enhance leadership skills to ensure the USPHS Commissioned Corps is building public health leaders. Finally, additional tr aining staff are working with partner organizations to develop a comprehensive catalogue of current training to enhance USPHS Commissioned Corps professional development in leadership, officersh ip, and clinical deployment skills. The training and modernization contract was aw arded to the University of Nebraska Medical Center to develop and deliver training focused on the safety of officers deployed to highly hazardous environments. 41 officers have recei ved training through two Deployment -Safety Academy Field Experience courses. The emergency response training contract was awarded to Emory University. 913 officers received training through the Emerge ncy Response Training course. The advanced leadership training was awarded to the Technical Management Services to develop leadership skills required to lead departments of highly trained personnel pr oviding public health services to diverse population. The training delivery services contract was awarded to AFC Development Inc. to provide administrative and event planning activities as well as technical training support to the CCHQ Training Branch to deliver deployment events. CARES Act funding also supports a partnership w ith the DoD via Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) and Military Facility Annual Training (MFAT), focu sed on improvement clinical deployment skills. For the IRT, teams of over 70 Public Health Service o fficers were embedded with DoD soldiers and officers in rural settings across the country (e.g., Alaska, Tennessee, Hawaii, Georgia and Oklahoma). For MFAT, a team of four Public Health Service officers we re embedded with DoD's Tripler military treatment facility in Hawaii. These trainings are a critical compone nt of training in engineering, occupational health, clinical care, and clinical support. As of January 25, 2023, a total of 2,899 officers have been trained with CARES Act funding.

The PHERST is also comprised of Regular Corps officers. Ready Reserve officers serve on a part-time basis, and together with PHERST officers, provide the Department with a critical public health and readin ess resource. PHERST officers are a rapid deployment force located throughout the country and have broad p ublic health expertise, including in areas such as behavioral health, social work, and public health sci ence. Ready Reserve officers also have specific skills needed for public health emergencies ( e.g., ICU nurses). They sign a six-year commitment contract and are available to bolster Commissioned Corps missions. Ready Reserve officers are paid when on active duty (including both trainings and deployments); officers are required to train (\"drill') for a minimum of 2 weekends/month (on average) and 14 days/year for annual training. In addition, Ready Reserve officers may be placed on temporary or part-time active duty to address personnel shortages at government agencies. In addition, Inactive Duty Training (IDT) allows Ready Reserve officers to maintain their skill sets monthly. Budget Request The FY 2024 President's Budget Request for the Rea dy Reserve is $13,600,000, which is an increase of $13,600,000 above FY 20 23 Enacted. At this funding level, the Ready Reserve will allow for sustaining the Reserve Corps at approximately 400 officer s with 31 management FTEs. These officers will be available to bolster the Department's public health needs and emergency response. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 47 Five Year Funding Table Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 -- FY 2021 -- FY 2024 President's Budget $13,600,000 Program Accomplishments The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act established the Ready Reserve Corps and provided the initial funding to build the infrastructure for the R eady Reserve program, recruitment, and training of its initial cohort. The USPHS Co mmissioned Corps has onboarded and deployed Ready Reserve officers, expanding its deployment capabiliti es. Thus far, the Ready Reserve team established and implemented recruitment, training, communicat ion plans, IT infrastructure and corresponding standard operating procedures to operationalize the Ready Reserve. This includes hiring of critical personnel in CCHQ. As of February 7, 2023, the Ready Reserve has onboarded 91 officers.

Performance Analysis The USPHS Ready Reserve continues to develop a recruitment strategy and operations plan. The framework for this new strategy consists of thr ee key areas of focus: Communication and Stakeholder Engagement, CCHQ Infrastructure, and Performance Ma nagement. Each focus area contains a series of activities with high impact on the overall strategy as well as a detailed plan of operation. In addition, the strategy includes a performance management plan that consists of milestones, key performance indicators, and a risk management plan. There remains a critical need for administrative and le gislative support to eliminate significant barriers to recruitment, emergency and public health prep aredness response, and continued support for non- emergency health care. The Ready Reserve still requi res authority for dual compensation, extension of TRICARE benefits, leave rights, authority for the S ecretary to call officers to active duty for training amongst others. The 2024 Budget includes legislative proposals to align Commissioned Corps' rights and benefits with those of other uniformed services. Th e descriptions for these proposals are included in the General Departmental Management Congressional Ju stification in the chapter titled \"Legislative Proposals\"). This coupled with the need for improve ments in IT infrastructure and operations will be critical focus areas for the full implementation and continued expansion of the USPHS Commissioned Corps Ready Reserve.

Direct Federal Program Description The Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) is the head of the USPHS Commissioned Corps (Commissioned Corps), which is one of the nation' s eight uniformed services. The Commissioned Corps includes the Regular Commissioned Corps, Ready Reserve, and Public Health Emergency Response Strike Team (PHERST). The Surgeon General ove rsees the day-to-day operations of the entire Commissioned Corps, and Commissioned Corps Hea dquarters (CCHQ) is responsible for personnel, administration, medical, training, readiness, depl oyment operations, and policy for both the active duty and reserve components of the Commissioned Corps. Regular Corps officers fill clinical and service positi ons across more than 21 federal departments, both within the Department of Health and Human Servic es (HHS) (e.g., Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Contro l), as well as non-HHS agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland Security). Ready Reserve officers serve on a part-time basis, called upon to serve their country when needed in underserved communities and during public health emergencies. PHERST officers are full-time Regular Corps officers w ho can deploy within 8 hours, serving as \"first on the ground teams.\" Together with Ready Reserve offi cers, PHERST officers provide the Department with a critical rapidly deployable public health and read iness resource. PHERST officers have broad public health expertise, and this group includes public health scientists, social workers, and behavioral health providers. Budget Request The FY 2024 President's Budget request for PH ERST is $4,400,000, which is an increase of +4,400,000 above FY 2023 Enacted. At this funding level, the Commissioned Corps can sustain approximately 20 PHERST officers and four admini strative FTEs. This funding will continue to allow the USPHS Commissioned Corps to rapidly respond to urgent, emergency public health events with highly trained professional staff. Budget History The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secur ity (CARES) Act provided $7 million for OASH to build the initial infrastructure for the PHERST co mponent of Commissioned Corps, including hiring and training of the first cohort. CCHQ has used this fund ing to develop and implement plans for recruitment, training, and communications, infrastructure and ma nagement development, and standard operating procedures for PHERST operations. As of February 7, 2023, there are 75 PHERST officers selected, and 58 officers on board readily available for deployment. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 50 Five Year Funding Table Program Accomplishments PHERST officers have deployed in support of numerous incidents. In September of 2021, PHERST officers responded within four hours of notification to suppor t the Operation Allies Welc ome (OAW) airport mission and continue to support other no-notice missions. They currently serve and support global USPHS trainings, such as Officer Basic Course and numerous deployments skills trainings. The following is a summary of PHERST deployments to date.

Public Health Serv ice Act, Sec. 319(b) 42 U.S.C. 247d Authorization ............... Indefinite Allocation Method ................................................................... Direct Fede ral/Intramural, Contracts, Gra nts Program Description The Public Health Service (PHS) Ac t created the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF) in 1983. The Secretary of HHS may use the PHEF to rapidly respo nd to the immediate needs resulting from declared or potential public health emergencies. In response to a declared or potential public health emergency, the PHS Act authorizes the Secretary to use the fund to: facilitate coordination am ong Federal, State, local, Tribal and territorial entities and public and private health care entities make grants, awards, and enter into contracts support advanced research and development of countermeasures and products, and strengthen biosurveillance and laboratory capacity support initial emergency operations related to preparation a nd deployment of intermittent disaster response personnel and the Medical Reserve Corps, and other actions determined appropriate and applicable by the Secretary. Despite the Public Health Emergenc y Fund being authorized by the Public Health Service Act, it does not receive an annual appropriation and it has not recei ved appropriations in decades. Congress appropriated funding to the PHEF twice - once in 1987 in resp onse to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic, and once more in 1993 to respond to a ha ntavirus outbreak in the Southwest United States. The Public Health Emergency Fund is distinct fro m the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 -- FY 2021 -- FY FY 2024 President's Budget $50,000,000 Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 52 Budget Request The FY 2024 budget provides $50 million for the Pub lic Health Emergency Fund to allow the HHS Secretary to immediately respond to a public health th reat or declared public health emergency, pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. These funds would be available until expended, consistent with the PHS Act author ization, and would allow HHS to ra pidly deploy resources early in a response effort. The PHEF is a valuable tool for th e government to respond rapidly to public health threats, but it has not been utilized due to a lack of available funding. Congress has frequently provided HHS with emergency supplemental funding when the need arises, including in recent years to respond to Ebola, hurricanes, and Covid-19. An annual appropr iation to the PHEF would allow HHS to act without delay in response to a public hea lth emergency, which could speed up critical public health responses while allowing Congress sufficient time to consider supplemental funding bills. The PHEF appropriation will be held in reserve for potential use in response to any public health emergency or potential public health emergency as de termined by the Secretary, consistent with section 319 of the PHS Act. These funds would complement the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF) authorized for use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for an infectious disease emergency if the emergency is 1) declared by the Secretary of HHS under section 319 of the PHS Act to be a public health emergency, or 2) determined by the Secretary of HHS to have the significant potential to imminently occur and potentia l, on occurrence, to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens domestically or internationally. HHS can transfer or obligate funds from the IDRRRF to prevent, prepare for, or respond to an infectious disease emergency after notification to Congress. Funds are available to CDC and may be tr ansferred to the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. In contrast, PHEF would be available to respond to a public health emergency, not limited to in fectious diseases, immediately upon declaration or determination of a public health emergency by the Secret ary of HHS. Further, funds would be available to all HHS agencies, which would allow for a robust and tailored response to a variety of public health emergencies. Potential uses for th e funding include deploying human services resources after a natural disaster, responding to the public health effects of a terrorist attack, addressing emergency nutritional needs for vulnerable populations, or responding to any other public health threat.

HHS's long history of lead ing responses to outbreaks such as H1N1, Zika, and Ebola highlights the importance of speed to saving li ves\u2014in detecting biological threats before they spread; scaling system capacity to respond to and mitig ate the impact of bioincidents; and developing, securing, distributing, and communicating about tools like vaccines and therapeu tics needed to prevent and lessen the impact of disease. To create the c onditions for speed, effective and scalable preparedness and response systems must be put in place long be fore emergencies strike. The United States must catalyze advances in science, technology, and core capab ilities to prepare for future biological threats. The FY 2024 Budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding, available over five years through the PHSSEF across the Administration for Strategic Prep aredness and Response (ASPR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to prepare for and respond rapidly and e ffectively to future pandemics and other high- consequence biological threats. Mandatory fundin g is requested for PHSSEF and will be allocated to these HHS agencies. This funding will support critical priorities outlined in the 2021 American Pandemic Preparedness Plan and 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security2, and build on knowledge and experience gained during recent responses and prior do mestic and global pandemic preparedness efforts. This funding, alongside a suite of complementary legi slative proposals, will allow HHS agencies to take critical steps to transform our nation's capabilities acr oss the full spectrum of preparedness and response before the next pandemic hits, including by: 1. Enhancing early detection and warning systems 2. Advancing and securing safe and effective s upplies and medical countermeasures; and 3. Strengthening public health systems and core capabilities. 2 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/ 10/National-Biodefense-Str ategy-and-Implementation- Plan-Final.pdf Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 54 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 -- FY 2021 -- FY $20,000,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget requests $20 billion in mandatory funding, available over five years, for ASPR, CDC, NIH, and FDA. Throughout this proposal, HHS agencies invest in cross-cutting and threat-agnostic approaches that can help prepare the nation for any biological threat and bolster America's biodefense posture. To strengthen early detection, HHS will invest through CDC to modernize detection infrastructure, improving early warning systems like wastewater su rveillance and strengtheni ng our nation's public health laboratory system. ASPR will thr eat agnostic pathogen Ne xt Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics for use in laboratory and re mote settings\u2014a cornerstone technology for rapid response in the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy. NIH will further strengthen early detection by supporting RADx's highly effective program to accelerate the design, validation, regulatory authorization, and manufacturing of not only laboratory tests but al so point-of-care and over the counter (OTC) tests to help identify cases and inform effective treatment plans early. To enhance the availability of tool s needed to defend and protect against biological threats, HHS will invest further in basic and applied research, advan ced development and licensure, and manufacturing of medical defenses. Experience has shown that inv estments to accelerate product development pay off \u2014as do focused resources to accelerate their availab ility. The record-breaking mRNA COVID-19 vaccine development was only possible through approximately 30 years of basic research investment across NIH to understand mRNA and how it coul d be applied in medicine, as well as many years of research on coronavirus biology and vaccine development. This effort, coupled with BARDA's prior investments in mRNA-based vaccine development and manufacturing fo r Zika, allowed for a rapid pivot of technology to address the COVID-19 outbreak. Accelerating deve lopment and commercialization was further made possible by BARDA's extensive investment in advanc ed development, utilization of longstanding NIH clinical trials networks, and the prioritization of FDA regulatory resources towards COVID-related tools. To help replicate this success for any future pa ndemic, NIH will make significant investments to accelerate early-stage discovery, design, and deve lopment of vaccines and vaccine platforms, therapeutics, and adjuvants . ASPR will further support late-stage development and manufacturing of vaccines against high-consequence threats\u2014including investments for pandemic influenza and other Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) , Sudan Virus (SUDV) and Marburg Virus (MARV), and other viruses with pandemic potential. ASPR will also invest in late-stage developm ent and manufacturing of therapeutics - including those th at that target SUDV and MARV , broad-spectrum antivirals new rapid response therap eutic platform technologies. Additionally, to ensure these innovations can be fully leveraged by the public, ASPR will also invest in advancing manufacturing capacity and securing needed supplies. These invest ments will secure additional mRNA manufacturing capacity, develop and advance new technologies in manufacturing, enhance bulk and fill/finish manufacturing for viral vectors, and help build a res ilient supply chain and mainta in key products within Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 55 the Strategic National Stockpile. Finally, to track e ffectiveness, safety, and utilization of such medical defenses, this funding will allow CDC to invest in its Medical Countermeasures Effectiveness Network. And, to build core capabilities cutting across all pa ndemic preparedness work, ASPR will additionally support program management and mission execution, including by obtaining the required response personnel and information technology products and services. FDA will additionally invest $670 million to help build the regulatory capacity need ed to support the activities above. Administration for Strategi c Preparedness and Response Advanced development and licensure of vaccines, th erapeutics and diagnostics against viral families with the highest pandemic potential Vaccines: Development of faster pandemic influenza and ot her Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) vaccine response capability and en hanced manufacturing capacity. This funding will enable BARDA to rapidly address the need for a faster vaccine platfo rm to respond to pandemic influenza which currently relies on recombinant, cell- and egg-based manufactur ing, none of which allow for the required rapid manufacturing of strain-matched vaccines to meet th e challenges of evolving influenza viruses, including the H5N1 clades that are currently circulating in birds and mammals. BARDA will invest in domestic mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity and advancem ent of an mRNA-based pre-pandemic influenza vaccine to licensure. To exercise this manufact uring and development capacity, the agreement will include advanced development of at least three a dditional vaccines against viral families with pandemic potential for which licensed vaccines do not currently ex ist, such as Lassa, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and others. Vaccines: Advanced development of Sudan Vi rus (SUDV) and Marburg Virus (MARV) vaccines. The frequency of filovirus (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg and ot her viruses) outbreaks has increased in recent years with four outbreaks in 2022 and another already in 20 23. In addition to the outbreak potential inherent in the increased frequency of emergence via spillover fro m natural reservoirs and re-emergence of human- to-human transmission in regions that have recove red from recent outbreaks, the filoviruses also have been determined to be a material threat to nationa l security by the Department of Homeland Security. Due in part to supplemental funding that was pr ovided to accelerate the development of p medical countermeasures against Ebola Zaire, the species that caused the 2014 West African outbreak, BARDA successfully advanced several MCMs to FDA licensure (e.g., ERVEBO, INMAZEB and EBANGA). Funding will leverage lessons lear ned from the development of these countermeasures to rapidly advance SUDV and MARV vaccines to FDA lic ensure and build stockpiles of each that will be sufficient to respond to domestic and international outbreaks. Vaccines: Advanced development of additional vaccines that protect against viruses with pandemic potential. Recognizing that the mRNA vaccine platform may not be the best approach for all viruses with pandemic potential, BARDA will also support advanced development of 4-6 vaccine candidates produced using non-mRNA platforms (e.g., VSV, ChAd3, protein antigen, and others). The vaccine candidates will be selected from both existing candidates for which a dvanced development fundi ng is not available and for novel vaccine candidates developed by NIH/NIAI D as part of its work to support pandemic preparedness, further discussed below. As part of this effort, this funding will also support the advancement of 1-2 vaccines to FDA approval. Therapeutics: Advanced development of Sudan Viru s (SUDV) and Marburg Virus (MARV) therapeutics . As stated above, the filovirus family continues to be one of the largest pandemic threats the world faces. This funding will support advanced development a nd FDA approval of therapeutics against SUDV and Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 56 MARV and also support manufacturing of a stockpile of treatment courses for disease caused by both viruses that, based on recent history, will be su fficient to address naturally occurring outbreaks. Therapeutics: Advanced ectrum antivirals and host-directed ASPR antiviral and threat -agnostic therapeutic pr ograms by developing both pathogen-directed antivirals that inhibit key viral f unctions as well as host-directed therapies capable of mitigating the outcomes of severe disease. Preferre d antivirals will target entire virus families, thus allowing development of products that can protect against known and unknown threats. Proposed viral targets include antivirals that could be efficacious in the treatment of disease caused by Arenaviridae viruses. Threat-agnostic approaches will target acu te respiratory distress syndrome or other severe outcomes of infectious disease and candidates can be placed into a phase 2 platform trial within 12 months of funding being made ava ilable. Candidate drugs will have the ability to alleviate symptoms of disease, prevent severe disease and hospitalizations, and/or lower mortality. Therapeutics: Advancement of new rapid response therapeutic platform technologies. New technologies and approaches are needed to accelerate therapeutic development and decrease costs. These include accelerating development of small molecule antiviral candidates to shorten the two years it took for COVID-19 oral antivirals to become widely available. Similarly, m onoclonal antibodies, while currently our best option for several viral families, have co st and technology barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential. An array of new technol ogies has been developed that could overcome these challenges, such as utilizing mRNA to express m onoclonal antibodies and leveraging CRISPR and siRNA technologies to eliminate viral infection. Utilizing pathogens, including filoviruses and other pathogens of high pandemic potential, as target s, BARDA will incorporate these new platform approaches into the advanced development portfolio of therapeutics. This will not only provide MCMs against these known threats, but it will also support broader US innovation in the manufacturing and product development sector, much as was done with mRNA in the vaccine sector. Diagnostics: Advanced development of diagnostics . ASPR will develop threat agnostic pathogen Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics for use in laboratory and remote settings, which is a cornerstone technology for rapid response in the Nati onal Biodefense Strategy. The envisioned clearance would include a pre-approved change protocol to allow rapid addition of a novel emerging pathogen to the reference database, thus enabling use of the tec hnology in an emerging path ogen response. ASPR will also invest in development and clearance of high testing performance platforms for use in remote and access constrained environments, in creasing access to testing and improving the quality of healthcare in these settings. Lastly, investments will be made to develop specific diagnostics to complement vaccine and therapeutic efforts discussed in this requ est, thus creating a full MCM toolbox that spans identification of cases, treatment of patients, and pr e-exposure protection from infection for contacts and others at risk of infection. Biologics Manufacturing and Supply Chain Manufacturing of vaccines and other biological products in response to a public health emergency is critical. In an outbreak response, supply chains a nd manufacturing capacity often become rate limiting. To address this gap, BARDA has developed plan s for a Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Partnership (BioMaP). This partnership seeks to strengthen the U.S. government and industry's response to current and future public health emergencies by strengtheni ng and expanding the critical enabling capabilities and infrastructure-physical facilities, workforce training, supply chain, and manufacturing platforms-required for a robust and nimble vaccine-based response. Fund ing will be critical for this effort to successfully launch as currently envisioned - to both a ddress recommendations from the 2023 GAO report on planning for medical countermeasures (MCM) development and manufacturing risks, as well as fund the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 57 required manufacturing capacity reservation. In short, this funding will allow the program to have a significant and immediate impact on the Nation's pa ndemic preparedness and response capabilities. The focus will include three efforts, each of which is sp ecifically designed to complement the previously described vaccine development efforts: Securing additional mRNA manufacturing capac ity and maintaining c apabilities developed during COVID-19 response . This action will secure additional manufacturing capacity for mRNA-based vaccines which will ensure that the Nation can a void supply chain issues similar to the 2004-2005 influenza vaccine shortage, retain ability to meet surg es in demand that would occur if a more virulent SARS-CoV-2 strain emerges and rely on domestic ra ther than international manufacturing during a period of crisis. This capacity/capability will be \"exercised\" twice annually to pressure test its ability to rapidly advance new vaccines on a compressed timeline in a lignment with the National Biodefense Strategy and other US and Global objectives (e.g., American Pandemi c Preparedness Plan, 100 Days Mission, etc.). These \"exercises\" will complement the product-specifi c development plans described earlier and be applied to candidate vaccines for pandemic influenz a and other viruses with high pandemic potential and, in addition to confirming processes, staff and critical infrastructure are ready for rapid response when needed, this strategy will accelerate development of novel vaccines and pro duce limited stockpiles of doses that can be used for clinical trials and, as appropriate, outbreak response. Innovation in manufacturing and other technologies. Develop and advance new technologies and approaches that will reduce the time to first dose, re duce costs, and shrink manufacturing footprint. In many instances, promising technologies have been disc overed, but lack of funding has prevented rapid advancement and integration into cGMP manufacturi ng. Funding may also be used to develop new technologies to improve biosurveillan ce and early warning systems to enable rapid response to emerging threats. Bulk and fill/finish manufacturing for viral vectors over a four-year period. Many companies are developing vaccines against viruses with pandemic poten tial based on different viral vector platforms. Advanced development of these platforms is slow ed in part by lack of access to specialized manufacturing and fill/finish capability necessary to pr oduce these products. Further, these efforts, when they do occur, are spread amongst multiple manufactur ers, preventing both economies of scale, as well as 'lessons learned' from being broadly applied. A ddressing this gap via partnership with contract manufacturing organizations, pharmaceutical compani es and other industry partners will have an out- sized impact on vaccine advanced development. Industrial Base Management and Supply Chain and Strategic National Stockpile. Funding will advance pandemic preparedness as it relates to personal prot ective equipment and critical medicines supply chain resiliency, maintenance of key holdings within th e Strategic National Stockpile, expanded distribution capacity, and efforts designed to alleviate stresses to national supply chains for critical products (e.g., syringes, needles, vials, stoppers, etc.) during outbreak/pandemic response. Managing the mission Program Management. Funding will support pers onnel and information t echnology products and services required for the execution of the scope described here, coordination across HHS and reporting to the Office of the Secretary of HHS and other US Government stakeholders. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention To create the conditions for speed, effective and scalab le preparedness and response systems must be put in place long before emergencies strike. However, th ese systems are beyond the scope of current agency base budgets. Making strategic investments based on these lessons during the pandemic would set Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 58 America's public health system on a path to save co untless lives and livelihoods in the future. Starting in FY 2024, CDC proposes a $6.1 billion investment in preparedness. With these resources, CDC will modernize and build laboratory capacity and strengthen public health data systems; enhance domestic and global disease surveillance, biosafety, and biosecurity efforts; and support capabilities for monitoring and evaluating vaccine and medical countermeasur e safety, effectiveness, and utilization. Early detection of emerging pandemic threats is the foundation for rapid response and countermeasure development activities. Public health surveillance pr ovides an ongoing picture of the patterns of disease, which is critical to implementation and evaluation of control measures and detection of new and emerging threats. Since pathogens do not recognize internationa l borders, public health surveillance cannot stop at the border either. For the United States to be prepar ed for a pandemic, we must support and contribute to a globally connected network of public health su rveillance systems. This proposal would make investments across CDC to help detect new pathoge ns or variants weeks or months earlier. This investment would strengthen existing surveillance pr ograms as well as build novel, pathogen-agnostic approaches like rapid genomic sequencing directly from clinical samples, so that we can get more and faster information from a sample. Investments woul d expand support for sentinel surveillance systems, novel pathogen-agnostic approaches, and influenza-like illness and other respiratory disease surveillance. With this funding, the United States could also significantly increase our investments in early warning including by the addition of thousands more wastewater testing sit es across the country to increase geographic representation and breadth/depth of sampl ing and allow for the addition of facility-based testing sites (e.g., in nursing homes, other congregat e settings, and more). Techniques and infrastructure involving metagenomics, for example, that sequence a collection of genes in a single sample without the need for isolation or lab cultivation of a specific species, could greatly improve the speed and quality of clinical and public health decision making. Modernizing the public health data system is critic al to pandemic preparedness as it supports the sharing of complete, accurate, and timely information essential fo r detecting and controlling emerging threats. To address long-standing deficits, CDC will invest in impr oving bidirectional data flow to bring more timely and complete information through these data syst ems, reducing the burden on data providers, and enhancing access by STLT users as well as CDC and our fe deral partners. This will provide high-quality information that will support decision makers with early warnings and insights into outbreaks. This funding will also invest in integrating and impr oving the nation's public health laboratory system. It will improve the physical infrastructure and technolog ic capacity to enable large-scale response without compromising other ongoing critical activities. It will also allow public health laboratories around the nation to operationalize surge testing when needed, a nd support partnership betw een clinical and public health laboratories to improve speed and depth of pathogen detection. To mitigate the risks associated with advanced international laborator y capacity, CDC will work with its partners to accelerate the adoption of biosafety and biosecurity practices at the regional, national, and subnational levels, such as improving the safe and appropriate handling, testing, storage, and transportation of unknown pathogens. Finally, after products are authorized, we must ha ve real-world data on safety, effectiveness, and utilization of MCMs to inform usag e, and guide rapid, equitable prio ritization and distribution of these tools. Funding will also be used to invest in CDC's Medical Countermeasures Effectiveness Network for monitoring of vaccines and therapeutics, Vaccine Sa fety Network monitoring of post-illness conditions and modernization, and MCM distri bution network improvements. As ju st one example, investments will help expand and automate vaccine safety monitoring systems by utilizing electronic health records to increase the volume of data going into the system, while decreasing the burden on healthcare providers. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 59 National Institutes of Health Early detection and response Recent responses have highlighted the importance of having wide availability of diagnostics early in a response. This proposal includes funding to su pport the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative's highly effective Innovation Funnel and In dependent Test Assessment Program (ITAP). Between 2020 and 2022, RADx accelerated design, validation, regulatory authorization, and manufacturing of point of care (POC), over the counter (OTC), and laboratory COVID-19 tests, leading to 50 emergency use authorizations (EUAs) and incr easing national capacity by >5 billion tests. These technology advances would be leve raged in order to develop ne xt-generation POC and OTC home diagnostics that target high-priority pathogens and diseases, with a fo cus on improving rapid home test performance to match laboratory-level accuracy, reduc ing test cost and accessibility barriers, detecting multiple pathogens at once, and adva ncing digital health platforms for at home \"Test to Treat\" and test reporting programs. Funding also supports RADx's ITAP collaboration with the FDA to accelerate authorization and clearance of new tests, using standardized methods and protocols to reduce time to authorization to as little as two months. ITAP would also continue to gather data needed by FDA to support decision- making, including assessing authorized platforms for performance with new vari ants and pathogens, and getting real world evidence to inform us e guidance and next-generation design. and pathogens, and getting real world evidence to inform use guidance and next-generation design. Protective countermeasures Building on the vaccine development successes of th e COVID-19 pandemic, funding will support efforts directed at several pathogens of concern along the full R&D continuum. This investment will accelerate early-stage discovery, design, and development of vaccines and vaccine platforms, therapeutics, and adjuvants. Though the precise nature of the next threat is unknown, we know that climate change and habitat disruption are increasing contact between humans and an imal reservoirs of dive rse pathogens, enhancing the likelihood of spillover events leading to epidem ics and pandemics. We also know which viral families pose the greatest risk of sparking a pandemic a nd must advance our foundational understanding of representative pathogens from each of these families simultaneously. The request will support NIH's preclinical R&D, si milar to the foundational work completed in the decades leading up to the COVID-19 vaccine develo pment; expand laboratory ca pacity and pilot cGMP manufacturing infrastructure for phase 1/2 clinical studies of candidates discovered through preclinical initiatives; and fund Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the most promising vaccines and therapeutics (including hos t-tissue-directed therapeutics), which can be transitioned to ASPR/BARDA or other advanced deve lopment partners for late stage development. Funding will establish, expand, and/or improve large a nd rapidly scalable clinic al trials networks and infrastructure to generate real-world evidence on the performance of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. And, to support the safe and secure conduc t of all early-stage activities, we propose biosafety and biosecurity investments that will sustain the capabilities and increase the availability of BSL-3/-4 laboratories. Food and Drug Administration The COVID-19 pandemic has reiterated FDA's unique a nd cross-cutting role, which is central to the whole-of-government response to protect and prom ote public health. The Budget provides $670 million Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 60 to improve FDA's core capabilities and regulatory cap acity to respond rapidly and effectively to any future pandemic or internationally significant biolog ical incident. To maintain FDA's gold standard for science-based product review and regulatory decisi on-making, the Budget will help modernize FDA's regulatory capacity, information technology, and laboratory infrastructure. These funds would support the Agency's biodefense e fforts, domestic and globally, by bolstering FDA's cadre of medical product reviewers and strengtheni ng foundational processes. It would also increase FDA's capacity to leverage a One Health approach to respond to emerging threats in recognition of the inter-connectedness of human, animal, and environm ental health. The Budget also will improve FDA's laboratory facilities so that FDA has modern and saf e physical spaces necessary to conduct our regulatory pandemic preparedness and response work. And lastly, these resources would help strengthen unde rlying technology platforms to improve electronic information exchange among stakeholders. The fundi ng will further build FDA's data infrastructure capabilities such as advanced predictive modeling data an alytics capacity, real-world data analysis tools, and business continuity systems. With these resource s, FDA will have the opportunity now to build on lessons learned and provide transformational investme nts to help ensure that FDA can respond quickly and effectively in times of a public health crisis. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 61 OVERVIEW OF PREPAREDNESS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HHS had to overcome real administrative chal lenges and a patchwork of authorities and flexibilities while responding to the once-in -a-century COVID-19 pandemic and other recent emergencies, including the infant formula shortage and Hurricanes Ian and Fiona. The 2024 Budget includes legislative proposals to improve preparedness and response, incorporating lessons learned from these recent public health emergencies. Together, the proposals discussed below will help bridge key gaps and barriers to enable a robust and timely response to future emergencies. These proposals complement di scretionary investment s and the $20 billion in mandatory funding requested across HHS public hea lth agencies to prepare for pandemics and other biological threats. Additional information about thes e proposals may be found in the respective Operating Division's Congressional Ju stification. 1. Early detection and response Data and laboratory capacity New authorities are needed to address challenges HHS faces in getting high-quality data needed to quickly identify and respond to new public health threats. For example, during COVID-19, it took six months for CDC to get ju risdictions to agree to sign 61 Data Use Agreements before the federal government could get critical data fr om jurisdictions\u2014and in some cases it took 18 months to two years to negotiate with a st ate or local immunizati on information system. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secr etary will have the new authority to require data from health care providers, facilities, suppliers, pharmacies, laboratories, service organizations, and state, local, Tr ibal, and territorial agencies, fo r the purposes of public health threat detection and monitoring; evaluation a nd distribution of medical countermeasures and critical supplies; and connection of communities with resources a nd services. This authority will allow for more complete and timely data sharing to support decisions at th e federal, state, and local levels. Data collection will be coordina ted across HHS agencies to minimize reporting burden and be subject to federa l privacy and security protecti ons to protect confidentiality. To support scaling of laboratory cap acity itself, we also propose a domestic construction authority for ASPR and CDC , allowing the construction and a lteration of non-federally owned facilities to support public health requirements . This authority coul d provide grants for construction and major renovation of public health la bs to support early de tection, as included in the CARES Act (this is coupled with c onstruction authorities supporting medical countermeasures [MCMs] and s upplies, discussed later). Supply risks and accountability To support identification and monitoring of poten tial and existing drug shortages, we propose expanding authorities to requi re drug manufacturers to notify FDA of drug demand increases that manufacturers are unlikely to meet. This would supplement existi ng data on supply-side Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 62 disruptions that may result in shor tages. Allowing FDA to require enhanced drug manufacturing amount information \u2014namely, identification of suppliers relied on to manufacture drugs and the extent of such relian ce, would further allow FDA to better work with manufacturers proactively to di versify their supply chain. Additio nally, we seek authority for FDA to require Site Master Files (SMFs) for Drug Manufacturing Facilities, which will assist FDA when conducting risk identi fication for sites for surveill ance and for-cause inspections. Requiring the SMFs for facilities manufacturing also has the potential to make inspections more efficient. To help address identified drug shortages, we also propose providing FDA the authority to require expiration dates to be lengthen ed to mitigate critical drug shortages . This authority would allow FDA to require, when likely to help pr event or mitigate a shortage, that an applicant evaluate, submit data to FDA, and label a product with the longest expiration date (shelf-life) that is scientifically justified and include that failure to comply is a prohibited act and authority for FDA to levy civil money penalties. A recent focus on firms manufacturing non-applica tion drugs has identified a high rate of non- compliance with current good manuf acturing practice (CGMP) require ments, especially when a facility is first inspected. To address this , FDA is seeking authorities with respect to non- application drugs (finished dosage forms and active pharmac eutical ingredients) to provide the agency time to determine if an inspection of the manufacturing f acility is necessary before the drug can be distributed, and to conduct the inspection. Beyond drugs, we also propose amending th e Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorities to help identify and address critical device shortages, which proved deadly early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This include s requiring firms to both notify FDA as soon as possible after an interruption in the manufactur ing of a critical device\u2014not ju st during or in advance of a declared public health emerge ncy\u2014and to implement other mit igation steps. Without this amendment, FDA's ability to proactively respon d to early signs of supply constraints or a potential shortage situation will be limited in situations like recalls, cyberattacks, and natural disasters that may not lead to the declaration of a public health emerge ncy but which can result in significant device shortages and impact patient care. This proposal would also provide FDA the clear authority to review risk management plans (RMPs) for cr itical devices to help ensure manufacturers have plans in place to enhance resiliency a nd mitigate future supply chain disruptions. . We also propose similar authorities for FDA to require firms to notify FDA of food shortages. FDA is seeking authority to require firms to provide shortage notification for FDA-designated categories of food during a declared public he alth emergency. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for timely and accurate information about confirmed or likely supply chain challenges to help ensure the continuity of the food supply so that consumers have access to a safe and adequate food s upply during public health crises. . 2. Safe, effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) and supplies Before the development of the first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in less than a year, the fastest vaccine to go from development to deployment was for mumps, taking four years. Much of this Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 63 success is due to unprecedented fi nancial investments, interagenc y collaboration, and years of foundational vaccine research and development. However, several authorities made available to HHS uniquely during the COVID-19 public he alth emergency helped make these accomplishments possible. At present, many of these authorities are not available for the next public health emergency, and additional authorities would further strengthen our ability to bridge gaps in ensuring availability and access to MCMs and other critical supplies. Innovative research and development To build on our R&D successes and best leverage our investment s in medical countermeasures, we propose expanded authorities to foster public-private inno vation. This includes permanently extending BARDA's Medical Countermeasure s Innovation Partner (MCIP) Authority . This authority allows the USG to partner with non profit entities to use venture capital practices to address health security needs. To help bring these promising products through au thorization and/or approval, we propose providing FDA the explicit authority to establish a Pandemic Preparedness Program to enhance regulatory capabilities and readiness to rapidly review new vaccines and other medical products in response to emerging pathogens. In consultation with Health and Human Services partners, the program would: pr ovide recommendations and guidan ce to developers of vaccines and other medical products and re levant federal partners; use real-world data or real-world evidence to study the safety and effectiveness of products for a ddressing biological incidents and identify which products may be best suited fo r specific pathogens or for use in different populations; and facilitate product developm ent including advances in manufacturing. Manufacturing and availability Readily available, large-scale, domestic ma nufacturing capability acce lerates response. To ensure adequate domestic manuf acturing capacity of MCMs and s upplies, we propose authorities for HHS to use funding in ways that effectivel y support sustainment of existing manufacturing capacity and expansion of new domestic capacity. Authority for acquisition, construction, or alteration of non-federally owned facilities would allow ASPR to support efforts to develop net new domestic manufacturi ng capacity for MCMs and relate d products, in addition to allowing CDC to support public health laborat ory improvements discussed above to support early detection and response. Currently, this authority is often granted in emergency supplemental appropriations acts, which means constructe d/altered facilities can only support a specific product\u2014this is inefficient as manufac turing lines can often be flexed for different products. This authority would both ensure HHS's ability to support cros s-cutting manufacturing investments, and to make these i nvestments when they're needed. Procurement and acquisition At the outset of the pandemic, HHS did not ha ve the authority to execute acquisitions and contracting actions as quickly or efficiently as needed to ensure widespread access to needed supplies. For example, HHS does not have the authority to award follow-on production contracts from prototypes without recompeting the requ irements; this authority was used by the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 64 Department of Defense (DOD) to procure 5 of the 6 COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of HHS. HHS also does not have the authority to procur e experimental supplies, including diagnostic reagents and ancillary supplies like needles and sy ringes to be used in the development of the best supplies, and lacks contracting mechan isms like the DOD's comme rcial solutions opening authority that can faci litate rapid and effici ent acquisition of technol ogy and services in a response. HHS had to form and rely on a part nership with the DOD to get the supplies and services it needed, at the speed required for resp onse. This partnership was a critical asset during COVID-19 response, but DOD's surge support is ending and has been transitioned to the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response's (ASPR) HHS Coordination Operations and Response Element (H-CORE) . HHS will no longer have access to these authorities without relying on DOD, including for the next public health emergency. To support procurement of these products and critic al supplies, as well as the tools and services to distribute them, we must codify the successes of HHS's partnership with the DOD over the course of the COVID-19 pande mic. We propose expanding ASPR's Other Transaction Authority (OTA) such that ASPR could fund development of a product\u2014likely a vaccine, therapeutic, or diagnostic\u2014and th en move directly into large-s cale manufacturing of the product, whether for a response or for stockpiling, reducin g timelines to begin production by months. To better position HHS to rapidly acquire the qu antities of supplies need ed for experimentation, technical evaluation, and strong ope rational capabilities in future emergencies, without relying on DOD or other Federal agencies, we also propose providing ASPR the authority for procurement and acquisition of supplie s for experimental or test purposes , similar to that of DOD's. These materials and assets would include chemical materials and reagents, medical supplies, PPE, and ancillary supplies (e.g., needle s and syringes) for the development of supplies needed for national public heal th and health security. Further, providing ASPR the authority to acquire i nnovative commercial products, services, processes, and/or methods \u2014like the DOD's Commerc ial Solutions Opening authority\u2014would allow ASPR to acquire products or services such as technology investment agreements, research and development activities, and other capabilities needed to respond to an outbreak in the future without relying on other Federal agencies. Access and adoption Increasing availability of needed products and services alone is not sufficient for effective response; investing in the infrastructure that pr ovides access and facilita tes adoption is critical. As demonstrated in the pandemic response, no-co st products and services drives equity in adoption and ultimately outbreak control of vaccine-preventabl e diseases. To learn from the successful focus on equity during recent responses, we propose providing CDC with the legislative authority and funding to es tablish the Vaccines for Adults program to begin expanding access to Advisory Committee on Im munization Practices (ACIP)-recommended routine and outbreak vaccines for uninsured adults at no cost. This capped mandatory program would be modeled on the successful Vaccines for Children (VFC) program and tailored to meet the unique needs of adults, and would fund the purchase of ACIP-recommended vaccines for eligible adults, provider f ees, and program operations. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 65 To further support broader access to medical products and services directly related to diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention (such as immunization) of specific disease or conditions that are pandemic-related as determin ed by the World Health Or ganization, we also propose modifying Section 1135 emergency waiver authorities to ensure Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries and the uninsured have access to critical products and services, including unapproved drugs, vaccines, and devices in a pandemic. Under this proposal, the Secretary could authorize or require c overage of unapproved drugs, vacc ines, or devices, that are authorized by FDA for emergency use, or other ite ms and services used treat a pandemic disease during a public health emergency (PHE). Patient cost-sharing would be waived for vaccines authorized under an EUA, and the administration of such vaccines. Reconciliation may be used to make Part D and Part C plan sponsors whol e for drug, vaccine, device, and administration costs -including costs associated with vaccine co unseling\u2014 that were not incorporated in their bids, if the cost is estimated to exceed 0.1 percent of the nation al average per capita costs. The Secretary will provide Congress ce rtification and advance written notice before exercising this authority. Safety and accountability Lack of transparency has constrained accountability for safety and efficacy of critical supplies\u2014 for example, FDA often cannot always trace manu facturers along the supply chain to hold them accountable. FDA also cannot requir e advance records or remote in spections or share critical data with states without manufacturer consent, limiting inspection efficiency and the ability for states to support investigations. We propose allowing FDA to require labeling to include the original manufacturer and supply chain information . This authority could support investig ations in events such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, when methanol conta mination in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for hand sanitizer led to more than 20 deat hs\u2014in that event, were not able to identify original API manufacturers a nd hold them accountable. We also propose expanding FDA's existing oversight authorities vis-\u00e0-vis drug manufacturers to all FDA-regulated product ma nufacturers. This proposal woul d allow FDA to request records or other information in advance of or in lieu of inspections from manufacturers of any FDA- regulated products, improving effici ency of any subsequent inspect ions by helping to identify specific risks on which to focus inspectional ti me. This proposal would also allow FDA to require\u2014not just request\u2014remote evaluations, whic h have helped FDA verify post-inspection corrective actions have been taken and otherwise gain compliance insight. To support safety of other medical products, we propose an authority to expand FDA information disclosures with states . This proposal would facili tate FDA sharing non-public information with states, territori es, or localities, without manuf acturers' express consent, to support joint inspections of firms, inventory, and distribution record s. The ability to collaborate with state partners would allow FDA to focus on enforcement where it is needed most, such as investigations of fraudulent me dical products. This proposal woul d also advance an integrated food safety system and more effective use of federal and state oversight tools. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 66 3. Resilient public health and health care systems Attracting, hiring, and retaining workforce Traditional mechanisms are not sufficient to fill positions rapidly and maintain them during public health emergencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated the estimated global shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030. To provide HHS with the ability to quickly fill relevant positions in the event of future public health emergencie s\u2014including to detect threats and support development and procurement of the tools needed to respond\u2014we propose a Direct Hire Authority for ASPR and CDC during Public Health Emergencies for mission critical professionals. This would include for skills in specialized biological sciences, emergency management, and acquisitions - allowing HHS to reduce time to hire when it matters most. We similarly propose extending the National Disaster Medical System Direct (NDMS) Hire Authority , which will expire in September 2023\u2014this authority has successfully expanded the NDMS intermittent workforce by approximately 25% and cut hiring time in half (from an average of one year to six months). Ability to hire is insufficient without the ability to attract workforce with competitive offers. We propose authorizing appropriate and flexible pay authorities to allow HHS and its agencies (CDC and ASPR in particular) to provide compensation th at is more competitive with market salaries and improve recruitment and retention of indivi duals with mission critical positions. This would include authority for HHS to provide overtime and danger pay to any employee serving with threat to well-being and to waive the statutory pay cap on aggregate basic and premium pay during a public health emergency (as reflected in HHS's Genera l Provisions). And, to better attract clinicians and othe r highly sought-after techni cal experts, we propose a student loan repayment tax code exclusion for CDC's Educat ion Loan Repayment Program for Health Professionals , like HRSA's National Health Service Corps (NHSC) authority. This would relieve CDC of a high tax burden on a key talent recruitment mech anism\u2014 the true cost to CDC for $100,000 in loan repayment is nearly $150,000 due to the f act CDC has to pay taxes on behalf of the individual and the employer portion of Social Securi ty and Medicare in addition to the loan repayment. Savings could be used to recruit more public health workers. We also propose allowing CDC to waive maximum hour/dual compensation restrictions for reemployed annuitants (REA) for up to one year: This would allow CDC to fully use the skills and expertise of reemployed annuitants to fill full-time roles in emerge ncy responses and work the hours needed to meet emergency respons e needs during a declared PHE response. Finally, to allow us to further supplement our workforce with volunteers, we propose amending the authority for the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) Program. Notably, the authority to deem MRC volunteers as time-limit ed Federal employees for purposes of liability coverage and medical license credentials w ould support greater staffing pool s for CDC, ASPR, and others broadly. This would allow us to better tap into over 300,000 MRC volunteers nationwide for federal responses such as hurricanes. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 67 Optimizing existing capacity In addition to attracting and retaining workforce, optimizing existing capacity is a critical lever for building adaptive pub lic health systems. For this, we propose allowing CDC to dedicate a small percentage of funding across CDC's appropriations for th e purpose of funding a response- ready cadre of staff who can quickly deploy for any Pub lic Health Emergency or other emerging threats, and then return to their regular duties when the event is resolved. Without this authority, CDC is limited in its ability to rapidly engage it s full workforce to support an emergency response because only staff w hose regular positions are funded by appropriations consistent with prospective response duties can undertake those activ ities without formal personnel processing. In addition, even when CD C's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is formally activated, which allows all CDC staff to s upport the EOC without reimbursement, there are still current limitations such as a limit on the length of the detail assignments and required Congressional tracking and reporting of all staff suppor ting the EOC. 4. Enhancing recovery Capacity building and response authorities Programs need but often do not have the funding authorities and flexibilities to support coordinated, targeted human services delivery following a disaster. We propose to establish a disaster human services emergency fund to strategically respond to disasters by promptly directing funds to support disa ster-caused human service needs. This fund would also address issues related to fiscal year limitations by allo wing for funding for disast ers occurring near the end of the fiscal year\u2014which overlaps with At lantic hurricane and Western wildfire seasons. Using this fund to help meet surges in service demands, recover from losses, and address immediate needs would significantly improve disast er response for some of the most vulnerable populations, including people with disabilitie s, older adults, children and families. We also propose authorities to provide comprehensive case management services, to address survivors' additional human services needs aris ing during crisis response to achieve stability. Currently, HHS (via ACF) is constrained in the scope, scale, and frequen cy of case management services it can provide to disa ster survivors. This mechanism would complement the disaster human services emergency fund and reduce furt her harm to disaster survivors by ensuring resources and services are linked through a robust, coordi nated continuum of care. 5. Cross-cutting priorities Flexibility to manage funds and waive certain statutory requirements are cross-cutting needs for effective operations. We propose providing ASPR the authority to establish a working capital fund , to ensure resources are available to fu lly support adminis trative requirements, even through periods of funding uncertainty and surge operations. The working capital fund will help cover ASPR's requirements across informa tion technology, human resources, and financial management including acquisi tion policy and oversight. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 68 NONRECURRING EXPENSES FUND Office of National Security Budget Summary (Dollars in Thousands) .............................. Section 223 of Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 Allocation Method ............................................................................... Direct Federal, Competitive C ontract Program Description and Accomplishment The Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF) permits HHS to transfer unobligated balances of expired discretionary funds from FY 2008 and subsequent ye ars into the NEF account. Congress authorized use of the funds for capital acquisitions necessary for the operation of the Department, specifically information technology (IT) and facilities infrastructur e acquisitions. The Office of National Security (ONS) will enhance established programs to take a more proactive role toward our national security mission and protecting the Department. Budget Allocation FY 2024 The following projects are planned uses of the NEF for ONS in FY 2024, totaling $7,200,000: Sensitive Compartmented Informat ion Facility (SCIF) Expansion ONS plans to expand the SCIF in the Humphrey Build ing due to increased workload and staff levels. The expanded space will add areas to currently existing space and will support the current and new programs and staff as well as provide enough room for interd epartmental partners to work collaboratively. ONS Case Management System ONS NEF funds will be used to add a case management system within its secured network to ensure Insider Threat, Counterintelligence, and Intelligen ce & Analysis teams are able to secure their information on one platform. This update will allow user s to conduct internal research and analysis (with query capability), secure inform ation access to need-to-know, and house a record of cases. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Program Equipment Refresh The ONS TSCM Program is required to ensure equipm ent is updated every three years. Currently, much of the equipment is beyond five years old and c onsidered out-of-date. To meet the current TSCM standards updated equipment is needed. Budget Allocation FY 2023 Enterprise Supply Chain Risk Management System - $1,900,000 NEF funds are used to purchase an Enterprise Supply Chain Risk Management system/platform licenses for research, analysis and assessment deve lopment for vulnerable HHS acquisitions. 3 Notification submitted to the Committees on Appropriations in the House of Representa tives and the Senate on September 23, 2022 . 3 This represents the total amount to be notified as a pl anned use of funds in a FY 2024 notification letter. 4 Pursuant to Section 223 of Division G of the Consolidated A ppropriation Act, 2008, notification is required of planned use. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 69 IDEA DIGITAL MODERNIZATION ACT Modernization of the Public-Facing Digital Services - 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA) was signed into law on Dec. 20, 2018. It requires data-driven, user-centric website and digital services moderniza tion, website consolidation, and website design consistency in all Executive Agenci es. Departments across the federal landscape are working to implement innovative digital communicati ons approaches to increase efficiency and create more effective relationships with their intended audiences. The American public expects instant and impactful communications - desired, trusted content ava ilable when they want it, where they want it, and in the format they want it. If the consumer is not satisfied, they move on and our opportunity for impact is lost. Modernization Efforts In FY 2019 HHS engaged Department leadership a nd developed a Digital Comm unications Strategy that aligns with the requirements of IDEA. In FY 2020, HHS Digital Communications Leaders began implementation of the Strategy in alignment with ID EA, beginning to align budgets to modernization requirements. As the result of a comprehensive review of costs asso ciated with website development, maintenance, and their measures of effectiveness, HHS will prioritize: modernization needs of websites, including pr oviding unique digital communications services, and continue developing estimated costs a nd impact measures for achieving IDEA. Over the next four years HHS will continue to implement IDEA by focusing extensively on a user- centric, digital first approach to both external and internal communications and developing performance standards. HHS will focus on training, hiring, and tools that drive the communication culture change necessary to successfully implement IDEA. Over the next year, HHS Agencies and Offices will work together to continue to implement IDEA and the HHS Digital Communications Strategy across a ll communications products and platforms.
