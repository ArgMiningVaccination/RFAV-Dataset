The most-common test for HIV is the [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay](https://www.britannica.com/science/enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay) (ELISA). If the result is positive, the test is repeated on the same blood sample. Another positive result is confirmed by using a more-specific test, such as the Western blot. A problem with ELISA is that it produces false-positive results in people who have been exposed to parasitic diseases such as [malaria](https://www.britannica.com/science/malaria); that is particularly troublesome in Africa, where both AIDS and malaria are [rampant](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/rampant). [Polymerase chain reaction](https://www.britannica.com/science/polymerase-chain-reaction) (PCR) tests, which screen for viral [RNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/RNA) and therefore allow detection of the [virus](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus) after very recent exposure, and Single Use Diagnostic Screening (SUDS) are other options. Because those tests are very expensive, they are often out of reach for the majority of the population at risk for the disease. Pharmaceutical companies are developing new tests that are less expensive and that do not need refrigeration, allowing for greater testing of at-risk populations worldwide. One such test\u2014the OraQuick at-home test, a mouth-swab antibody-detection system that produces results within about 20 to 40 minutes\u2014was approved for in-home use in the United States in 2012. The test was made available for over-the-counter purchase and was more than 99 percent accurate in the detection of HIV-negative persons and 92 percent accurate in the detection of HIV-positive individuals. [Antiretroviral medications](https://www.britannica.com/science/antiretroviral-drug) HIV infection is treated with three classes of antiretroviral medications. [Protease inhibitors](https://www.britannica.com/science/protease-inhibitor), which [inhibit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inhibit) the action of efavirenz, delavirdine, and nevirapine) both inhibit the action of reverse transcriptase. Each drug has unique side effects, and, in addition, treatment with combinations of those drugs leads to additional side effects, including a fat-redistribution condition called lipodystrophy. [ More From Britannica HIV/AIDS: Just the Facts ](/story/hivaids-just-the-facts) Because HIV rapidly becomes resistant to any single antiretroviral drug, combination treatment is necessary for effective suppression of the virus. [Highly active antiretroviral therapy](https://www.britannica.com/science/highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy) (HAART), a combination of three or four RT and protease inhibitors, has resulted in a marked drop in the mortality rate from HIV infection in the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States) and other industrialized states since its introduction in 1996. Because of its high cost, HAART is generally not available in regions of the world hit hardest by HIV. Although HAART does not appear to [eradicate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eradicate) HIV, it reduces plasma viral load, thereby allowing the immune system to reconstitute itself. Levels of free virus in the blood become undetectable; however, the virus is still present in reservoirs, the best known of which is a latent reservoir in a subset of helper T cells called resting memory T cells. The virus can persist in a latent state in those cells, which have a long life span because of their role in allowing the [immune system](https://www.britannica.com/science/immune-system) to respond readily to previously encountered infections. Those latently infected cells represent a major barrier to curing the infection. Patients successfully treated with HAART no longer suffer from the AIDS-associated conditions mentioned above, although severe side effects may accompany the treatment. Patients must continue to take all the drugs without missing doses in the prescribed combination, or they will risk developing a [drug-resistant](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-resistance) virus. In general, resistance develops because drug concentrations are too low, and though that can occur as a result of poor patient [compliance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compliance), it also may occur as a result of drug interactions or poor absorption of drug by the body. If HAART is discontinued or fails, viral replication resumes, reflected in increased plasma viral load. That necessitates a change in the patient's treatment [regimen](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimen). Resistance testing is used to determine which individual drugs and classes of drugs have been rendered ineffective by viral resistance, thereby allowing [health](https://www.britannica.com/topic/health) care providers to tailor the new HAART regimen, which is known as a salvage regimen, to the patient. Salvage [regimens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimens) often entail multiple drug rescue therapy (MDRT), or mega-HAART, the use of between five and nine different drugs, including RT and [protease inhibitors](https://www.britannica.com/science/protease-inhibitor) and sometimes hydroxyurea. Antiretroviral therapy may be either immediate or delayed. In the past, delayed antiretroviral therapy was the preferred approach, with treatment initiated once CD4 levels had fallen to 200 cells per microlitre of blood, which generally coincides with the establishment of symptomatic disease. In most patients, initiating treatment at that point provides maximal therapeutic effectiveness, in that it minimizes the severity of drug toxicities and thus the risk for [discontinuance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discontinuance) of treatment and development of [drug resistance](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-resistance). However, studies have indicated that in patients with morbidity-increasing factors, such as coinfection with a [hepatitis](https://www.britannica.com/science/hepatitis) virus or unusually rapid CD4 decline or high viral load, initiating treatment earlier, when CD4 levels have declined to 350 cells per microlitre, can improve survival and delay the onset of AIDS-related diseases significantly. Other studies have indicated that beginning antiretroviral treatment in infants immediately following [diagnosis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diagnosis), rather than waiting until symptoms appear, can reduce infant mortality and disease progression dramatically. Taken together with the ability of antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of disease transmission, such studies have resulted in treatment recommendations that are more [dynamic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamic) today than in the past, thereby improving treatment outcomes for certain subsets of patients with HIV. Individuals whose HIV levels are undetectable, who have a normal CD4 count, and who are free of opportunistic infection may serve as organ donors to other HIV-positive persons in need of organ [transplant](https://www.britannica.com/science/transplant-surgery). [Condoms](https://www.britannica.com/science/condom), [vaccines](https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine), gels, and other prevention methods There is no cure for HIV infection. Efforts at prevention have focused primarily on changes in sexual behaviour such as the practice of abstinence or the use of [condoms](https://www.britannica.com/science/condom). Attempts to reduce intravenous [drug use](https://www.britannica.com/topic/drug-use) and to discourage the sharing of needles led to a reduction in infection rates in some areas. Antiretroviral therapy represents another important prevention strategy. Research has indicated that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in which uninfected persons take an antiretroviral pill daily, can be highly effective in preventing infection. PrEP studies conducted in [Kenya](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kenya), [Uganda](https://www.britannica.com/place/Uganda), and [Botswana](https://www.britannica.com/place/Botswana), for example, revealed that the Truvada pill, which contains the antiretroviral medications tenofovir and emtricitabine, reduced the risk of HIV infection by between 63 and 73 percent in sexually active individuals. Other study participants took a pill known as Viread, which contained only tenofovir; those individuals experienced 62 percent fewer infections relative to participants who did not take the pill. Truvada had been approved in 2004 by the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Food-and-Drug-Administration) (FDA) as a combination therapy (used with other drugs) for HIV infection; in 2012, following further clinical investigation of its effectiveness for PrEP, it became the first drug to be approved by the FDA specifically for use in the prevention of HIV [transmission](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/transmission). The first vaccination strategy to demonstrate some level of effectiveness in preventing HIV infection involved two different vaccines given in succession, a strategy known as \"prime boost.\" Each vaccine was designed to work against strains of HIV circulating in [Southeast Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Southeast-Asia). In 2009 results from a [clinical trial](https://www.britannica.com/science/clinical-trial) known as RV 144, which involved more than 16,000 volunteers in [Thailand](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand), suggested that the vaccination strategy reduced the risk of HIV infection by 31.2 percent in healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 30. The findings of the study, however, were controversial, because of variations in the [statistical significance](https://www.britannica.com/topic/statistical-significance) of risk reduction produced by different statistical analyses. In 2010 scientists reported the discovery of naturally occurring antibodies that neutralize (inactivate) about 90 percent of HIV strains and hence have considerable potential for [facilitating](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitating) the generation of vaccines for HIV prevention. The antibodies neutralize virus particles through interactions with highly conserved CD4 receptors, which are similar or identical to each other and which are found on most strains of HIV. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the antibodies and the CD4 receptors was being used for investigation into the development of [synthetic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synthetic) molecules that mimic the antibodies and stimulate their production. [Vaginal](https://www.britannica.com/science/vagina) antimicrobial gels also have been investigated for the prevention of HIV infection. Those agents are particularly valuable for [women](https://www.britannica.com/topic/women) in relationships in which mutual monogamy or [condom](https://www.britannica.com/science/condom) use has failed or is not possible. Some of the first gels tested in large trials included Ushercell, which was made up of cellulose sulfate, and PRO 2000, which contained a [polymer](https://www.britannica.com/science/polymer) of naphthalene sulfonate. Each of those gels was designed to prevent the binding of HIV to cells in the [vagina](https://www.britannica.com/science/vagina). Although initial investigations were promising, both gels failed to demonstrate effectiveness when tested in large numbers of women (more than 1,400 women in the Ushercell trial and nearly 9,400 in the PRO 2000 trial). In 2010 scientists reported that a newer vaginal gel, formulated to contain 1 percent tenofovir, demonstrated success in early trials. The study involved 889 women in [KwaZulu-Natal](https://www.britannica.com/place/KwaZulu-Natal), [South Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa), and indicated that, on average, the gel reduced the risk of HIV infection in women by 39 percent. Women who used the gel regularly experienced a 54 percent reduction in risk. A large-scale trial [sponsored](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/sponsored) by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) subsequently found the tenofovir gel to be ineffective when tested among women in Africa. The identification of gene variations in HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-G, and HCP5 has opened avenues of drug and vaccine development that had not been previously explored for HIV infection. Scientists anticipate that therapies aimed at those genes could serve as ways to boost immune response. "}
