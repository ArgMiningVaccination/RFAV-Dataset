Make sure to watch his past videos at https://www.youtube.com/paulthomasmd. The Dr. Paul Approved Vaccine Plan Dr. Paul Thomas, M.D., F.A.A.P. Get your children the protection from infectious di seases while minimizing vaccine side effects. Since 2008, the team at Integrative Pediatrics have been honoring informed consent, with most parents choosing to use the plan outlined below. Combining this vaccine plan with exclusive breastfeeding, eating a diet of real food, getting enough vitamin D, exercising, and avoiding toxins like acetaminoph en, aspartame, and glyphosate, the children in his prac tice have experienced superior health, and a significantly lower rate of autism (0 in 1098) than the national average, which is 1 in 45. There were also no cases of autism or ASD in the 238 unvaccina ted children. If you have autism in the family, a history of auto immune disorders, or an MTHFR mutation: delay vaccines until at least age five, o r never. Do discuss this with your provider and know the risks of not vaccinating. The CDC schedule is the \"recommended\" schedule. Many choose to modify that schedule after informed consent. Pregnancy: No vaccines (No Tdap, No flu) Birth: No Hep 2 3 or Menactra (meningococcal), Menveo or Menactra & consider meningococcal B, Hepatitis A CONSIDERATIONS 1. If you are travelling to a part of the world where measles is prevalent, giving the MMR after age 1 should be considered. Always give this vaccine b y itself waiting at least a month before any other vaccines. 2. The Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine can be given aft er age 1 if you don't want your child to get natural chickenpox. 3. Consider the IPV (at least two doses 2 months apart ) before travel to high- risk countries. 4. Use these low aluminum options if offered- Daptacel for DTaP, Acthib for the Hib. 5. Only give one aluminum containing vaccine at a time (Aluminum containing vaccines: DTaP, Hep B, Bexero, Wait 2 - 4 weeks between aluminum containing vaccin e injections. 6. No HPV vaccines - side effects too frequent and sev ere. No long term testing. 7. No Rotavirus vaccine unless you will live where the re is no access to health care. 8. Flu shots annually age 6 months on for asthma and c hronic disease patients. (most elect to skip) 9. If birth mom has Hepatitis B, baby should get the H epatitis B vaccine at birth, 1-2 months and at 6 months along with Hepatitis B immune globulin at birth. 10. If after assessing risks and benefits of vaccines, the choice is always yours. Abbreviations, Brand Choices and Ingredients Hib. This is the vaccine against Haemophilus influenza type B, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. Choose the ActHIB brand, which has the HIB sugar wi th tetanus toxoid, saline and sugar water. The PedVax brand has 225 micrograms aluminum and should be avoided. DTaP. This vaccine covers Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertus sis. The little \"a\" DTaP stands for \"acellular.\" Prior to 1990 we used a whole cell DPT in the USA t hat caused severe side effects, including seizures, brain damage, and death. I prefer the Daptacel. T he Tripedia brand contains trace amounts of mercury in addition to aluminum. The Infarix brand has the most aluminum: 625 micrograms. All available brands contain 100 micrograms of formaldehyde, whic h helps trigger an immune response. Formaldehyde can trigger autoimmune disorders, wher e your body attacks itself and is a carcinogen. Prevnar - 13. This vaccine replaced the Prevnar - 7 by adding m ore strains of the pneumococcus, the bacteria that is the second leading cause of bacter ial meningitis in children. This vaccine has 125 micrograms of aluminum. MMR. Measles, mumps and rubella are all viral infection s that used to be a routine childhood illnesses prior to vaccines and could sometimes cause severe complications. The MMR vaccine contains human albumin, cow fetus serum, neomycin and chick embryo proteins. This live-vaccine is also perhaps the most controversial as time and time again (I've hea rd it over 100 times) parents have seen that after this vaccine their previously normal child became autist ic. Though no study has definitively linked the MMR vaccine to autism, there is a case to be made f or caution. Until a large double-blind study comparing unvaccinated children with vaccinated chi ldren is done, we cannot rule out the current American vaccination schedule as a contributing fac tor in autism. My own clinical experience has shown that waiting until age 3 is safer and healthi er for children, significantly reducing the chance of neurological and immunological damage that may be t riggered by this vaccine. Menveo, Menactra, Meningococcal B (Trumenba, Bexero). Meningococcal disease can cause rapidly fatal meningitis and blood infections. The disease is treatable if you catch it early. Menveo and Mena ctra both use safe technology and contain no aluminum. I feel comfortable giving these vaccines starting at age 11. These two brands do not cover meningitis ty pe B which is prevalent in Oregon, and other parts of the world. Enter the new kids on the block: Trum enba and Bexero, which have 500 micrograms and 1500 micrograms of aluminum respectively. These are extremely high doses of aluminum, a known neurotoxin, and I do not feel comfortable recommend ing either of these vaccines, unless your college bound child is heading into an active meningococcal B outbreak. Hepatitis B. The hepatitis B vaccines contain 250 micrograms of aluminum per dose. This is simply too much for a newborn. Since you catch hepatitis B fro m exchanging bodily fluids during sex, as well as from IV drug use and contaminated blood, I recommen d waiting until the teenage years or your child becomes sexually active. If you plan to travel to a country where hepatitis B is endemic, this vaccine may be necessary. Varicella. Chickenpox was a rite of passage for every Americ an born before 1995. Deaths were rare indeed (historically fewer than 50 people a year di ed from complications from the chickenpox in the United States, which has a population of over 318 m illion). It was more dangerous to take a shower. This live virus vaccine appears to be safe for most children, however it appears we are having more shingles as a result of the vaccine, which prevents adults from ongoing exposures that would have boosted immunity. Since chickenpox is highly contag ious and can be fatal when immune-compromised people are exposed, this is one vaccine where havin g community immunity benefits the most vulnerable. Those of us who can safely get this vaccine probabl y should. IPV. The Injectable Polio Vaccine (Ipol) contains forma ldehyde, along with a host of other ingredients you probably wouldn't want to inject into an infant with an immature immune system, including: human albumin, calf serum, 2-phenoxyethanol and antibioti cs. Since the last case of wild polio acquired in t he USA was 1979 and it is essentially eliminated from the world, I recommend babies skip this vaccine unless you plan to travel to higher risk areas of t he world. HPV . Gardasil and Cervarix. Human Papilloma Virus come s in many strains. The vaccines for HPV have tried to target the strains most associated wi th cervical cancer in women and genital warts (Gardasil). These vaccines have large doses of alum inum and seem to cause significant and frequent sid e effects. Because of these safety issues, I cannot r ecommend the vaccines against HPV at this time exce pt for teens who are sexually promiscuous and refuse t o practice safe sex. Rotavirus. RotaTeq and Rotarix. Rotavirus has been blamed for the majority of the vomiting and diarrhea of childhood. The vaccine was marketed as a money saver as there were so few deaths in the USA from rotavirus illness that they couldn't justi fy it any other way. The thing is, we never needed it. The reduced hospitalization rates are likely due to our use of anti-vomiting medications as to anythin g else. This is one vaccine your children do not need if you have access to modern health care. Flu shots. Influenza. There is no question that influenza ha s historically been a killer of the weak, elderly, and malnourished. Getting the flu is never any fun and some strains can make children extremely ill. However, if you are otherwise health y, the flu rarely causes death or even hospitalizat ion. It is difficult to recommend a vaccine that is usua lly not very effective and has been associated with side effects but I recommend this vaccine for high-risk children, health care providers, and educators with the hope that it will help us do our part in reducing t he chances we will bring the flu to the vulnerable. Always insist on the single dose (mercury-free) bra nd. The multi-dose flu shot has 25 micrograms of mercury (thimerosal). Avoid this like it is pure po ison, which it is! Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is usually contracted from uncooked c ontaminated food. The disease of hepatitis A is usually mild in children. Unless you are in the food service business, you can skip thi s aluminum-containing vaccine. Consider having your c hildren get this two-shot series (6 to 18 months apart) before adulthood. Disclaimer: The medical information given here is n ot medical advice and should not be interpreted as such. This approach is one that Dr. Paul has suc cessfully used with patients in his practice. It is done in the context of extensive education on the r isks and benefits of various vaccines during the process of obtaining informed consent. Dr. Paul is not recommending that you, who are not his patients, follow anything but the recommended CDC schedule. Please consult with your own physician on what approach would be best for your children. A note about new vaccines When a new vaccine comes to market, or a new recomm endation is made (for example, vaccines during pregnancy), it is wise to wait a few years before t rying them, observe the reports, and read any ongoi ng research. There is greater pressure to bring vaccin es to market before extensive testing, and there is rarely any long-term safety testing done on these v accines. We the population, become the long-term experiment. Sadly, the only ongoing, long-term stud y is the voluntary and inadequate use of the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System). Most phy sicians who should be reporting vaccine side effects believe that \"vaccines are safe and effecti ve,\" dismiss severe vaccine reactions as \"coinciden ce,\" and often refuse to file VAERS reports, even when p arents urge them to do so. For this reason, vaccine side effects may be grossly underreported. This is especially true when it comes to the chronic side effects of the slow poisoning that may be occurring from the cumulative negative effects of toxic vaccine ingredients, or the slow damage to the immu ne system that may be occurring from aluminum adjuvants.
