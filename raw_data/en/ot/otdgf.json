Medical/surgical/procedural are used interchangeably throughout the report. Universal masking of HCW: is synonymous to continuous masking of HCW. Full PPE: will refer to the use of contact and droplet PPE (i.e. medical masks, eye protection, gowns and gloves ; and use of a N95 respirator only if there is an aerosol generating medical procedure occurring in the room ) and is used interchangeably with \"contact and droplet\" throughout the report. Continuous masking of patients: refers to the conti nuous use of medical/surgical/procedural masks or cloth masks among patients. The type of mask (i.e. cloth vs medical) is captured verbatim from the individual studies or guidelines in the report. Eye protection: refers to face shields, goggles or visors and will be used interchangeably within the report. Personal prescription eyewear does not count as eye protection. Probable, Suspected or Confirmed COVID -19: Alberta -based definitions for probable, suspected or confirmed are assumed; except for the evidence summaries where terminology is captured verbatim from the literature. Context The incidence of COVID -19 has increased dramatically across all jurisdictions. On December 9, there were 75054 total cases in Alberta since the start of the pandemic with 20,163 active cases in Alberta reflective of a current epidemic surge (GoA website). On December 8, 2020, new COVID -19 restrictions were introduced in Alberta. These restrictions included mandated masks in all indoor public places, including workplaces and places of worship. During the first wave of the pandemic, the peak number of new daily cases was 319 (23 April 2020), whereas currently during the second wave, the peak number of new cases to date has been 1872 (2 December 2020) (chi-csm.ca) Increasing community transmission increases the probability that healthcare workers, patients and visitors to the healthcare system may be COVID -19 positive with consequent risk of introduc tion and transmission within hospitals and long- term care. Currently, approximately 18 acute care facilities and 52 long-term care facilities are experiencing outbreaks, and 83 additional outbreaks are occurring in other supportive living/home living sites (https://www.alberta.ca/covid -19-alberta- data.aspx#p25721s5 ). In the last months an increased number of outbreaks and hospital -acquired cases of COVID -19 have been seen, that were not as evident during the first wave. Healthcare workers assessed as exposed in outbreaks require 14 days quarantine, and the P PE in use affects the assessment of potential exposure events and quarantine decisions . This has implications on availability of the healthcare workforce to manage surges in COVID -19 related admissions. In addition, differences between local and national PPE guidelines, and changes to guidelines over time have been seen as non-reassuring because of evolving, and sometime contradictory data, around the effectiveness of masks and other forms of PPE. The AHS PPE Task Force has been asked to review current guidelines regarding PPE, with some advocating for contact and droplet PPE (i.e. mask, eye protection, gown and gloves) for every patient encounter. Moving to a contact and droplet PPE policy for every patient encounter, if not supported by evidence that it will improve safety, has the potential for adverse and unintended consequences for both patients on isolation and staff, while also increasing concerns over maintaining PPE supply, which may or may not be offset by reduced HCW risk. In the midst of this review, AHS guidance changed with a recommendation for healthcare staff to use continuous eye protection in addition to previous measures of continuous masking, careful hand hygiene for all direct and indirect patient care, and comprehensive point -of-care risk assessments during a patient's stay to screen for new COVID19 compatible symptoms. This report is intended to collate evidence to inform the PPE Task Force on whether current PPE guidelines, in respect to exposure to a probable or confirmed COVID -19 patient, should be modified. PPE Guidelines 3 Key Messages from the Evidence Summary Research Question 1: Can the prevalence of COVID -19 in the community be used to predict the likelihood of healthcare -based outbreaks? If so, can levels of risk be identified that requirements for increased levels of PPE are triggered as community prevalence rises? How are risk levels impacted by the proportion of community cases with an unknown source? Evidence describing the relationship between community COVID -19 rates and the incidence of outbreaks across healthcare settings (i.e. acute care and long- term care) is limited . In the available published reports, t here was variation in the methods used, and in the confounders measured and controlled for in the analyses. However, across studies the rates of COVID -19 in the surrounding community were found to be associat ed with COVID- 19 infections and/or outbreaks in LTC settings. An analysis of l ocal data also suggests an association between community incide nce and acute care or LTC outbreaks . It should be noted that the definition of outbreaks has been variable across settings and over time, and the local data was not adjusted for additional community, facility or patient -level characteristics . Therefore, it is difficult to make firm conclusions based on this data. No studies were identified that quantified levels of community transmission predictive of outbreaks and thus it is not possible to identify any thresholds for changes to PPE. Further, even if a specific threshold of transmission for predicting outbreaks was determined, there was no evidence identified that quantified added benefits of different levels of PPE through to continuous full PPE (see Question 3) . No studies evaluated risk levels that may be impacted by the proportion of community cases with an unknown source. The appropriate use of PPE in healthcare settings based on the level of community transmission should be considered in conjunction with measures to reduce community transmission. Research Question 2: What guidelines do other jurisdictions use to determine PPE requirements? Are there common features to these guidelines? Several guidelines and guidance documents developed in other Canadian and international jurisdictions provide recommendations for minimum PPE requirements for HCWs in acute care and LTC settings. Broadly, contact and droplet precautions (face mask, gown, gloves , eye protection) are recommended for direct patient care of probable or confirmed cases of COVID -19. When performing an Aerosol Generating Medical Procedure ( AGMP) on a patient with a suspected or confirmed acute viral respiratory infection, the use of an N95 respirator or equivalent in addition to contact and droplet protection (gown, gloves, eye protection) is recommended. The list of procedures comprising AGMP is noted to vary between jurisdictions . AHS guidance is HERE . Only 2 guidance documents (US CDC, Australian Government) addressed community levels of transmission when making PPE recommendations; however, community transmission levels were only qualitatively described (e.g. low levels, or significant levels). Recommendations for continuous full droplet and contact PPE were not identified in any provincial, territorial or other international guidelines. Both c ontinuous HCW masking and masking of suspected or confirmed COVID -19 patients and LTC residents in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic were commonly recommended amongst guidelines reviewed. With respect to patient masking, c urrent AHS practice is that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 in acute care are asked to mask when leaving their room. New guidance from the WHO (December 1, 2020) recommends \"in areas of known or suspected community or cluster SARS - CoV-2 transmission, universal masking for all persons (staff, patients, visitors, service providers and others) within the health facility (including primary, secondary, and tertiary care levels ; outpatient care; and long- term care facilities) , and wearing of masks by inpatient s when physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be maintained or when patients are outside of their care areas .\" However, this WHO guidance didn't reference any high-quality research studies evaluating whether continuous masking of patients improves HCW safety . PPE Guidelines 4 Research Question 3: What degree of protection is offered from universal masking in healthcare, including evidence for the utility of medical masks in preventing transmission from an infected person (source control)? What additional protection results from the sequential addition of a) continuous face shield/eye protection b) contact and droplet precautions c) continuous N95 mask use, each in comparison to continuous masking and hand hygiene? Pooled analyses of RCTs did not show clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection risk. Five RCTs comparing N95 respirators to medical/surgical masks in prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza favored medical/surgical masks though the results were not statistically significant (RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.90- 1.34) (Jefferson et al. 2020). Most studies in these analyses examined viral pathogens other than COVID -19 (though s ome included patients with the closely related human beta- coronaviruses), and many of the studies had varying degrees of imprecision making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Hand hygiene compared to control modestly reduced the burden of acute respiratory illness (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82- 0.86) . There were too few trials comparing different types of hand hygiene interventions to be certain of any true differences between soap and water, alcohol -based hand sanitizers or other types of interventions ( Jefferson et al. 2020). No RCTs or observational studies have directly compared different combinations of these four strategies simultaneously (e.g. continuous medical masking plus hand hygiene vs continuous medical masking plus hand hygiene plus continuous eye protection: continuous medical masking and hand hygiene to continuous eye protection, or to contact and droplet PPE .) Three cluster -RCTs identified in the Jefferson et al. Cochrane review (MacIntyre et al. 2011, 2013, 2015) evaluated continuous mask ing of HCWs during the entire work shift, in high- risk settings (e.g. emergency department, respiratory wards) , in reducing influenza- like illness. Two studies compared continuous N95 to continuous masks (MacIntyre et al. 2011, 2013) and one compared conti nuous masks to no masks (MacIntyre et al. 2015). All three studies found no statistically significant difference in influenza- like illness among HCWs. Two studies evaluated laboratory -confirmed influenza among HCWs and found no difference between continuous N95 and continuous masks (MacIntyre et al. 2011, 2013). Two before- after studies , identified in the WHO mask use guidance, found that implementation of a universal masking policy in hospital systems was associated with decreased risk of healthcare- acquired SARS- CoV-2 infection. These studies did not adjust for potential confounders, h ad no concurrent control group, had relatively short study periods and were not conducted in the context of COVID -19. No RCTs have compared eye protection with no eye protection (Verbeek et al. 2020, Jefferson et al. 2020) . A pooled analysis of observational studies on MERS and SARS health care settings of low er quality (Chu et al. 2020) identified a nearly 80% reduction in viral infection or transmission associated with the use of eye protection among HCWs . PPE use by patients in health care settings (either those with suspect or confirmed COVID -19, or those without COVID -19) has not been evaluated in high quality studies . It is important to note that HCW are protected from acquiring COVID -19 from patients with COVID -19 through their use of PPE , predom inantly use of masks and potentially eye protection. Masking of patients therefore is a consideration primarily where roommates or visitors may be at transmission risk. There are guidelines that discuss patient masking in various healthcare context s. Research Question 4: Are there risks (to patient care, patient wellbeing, healthcare workers or adherence/behaviour) to the use of continuous PPE? There is extensive evidence (quantitative and qualitative) describing physical adverse effects from wearing PPE for long periods of time. Commonly described side effects of PPE include headache, adverse skin reactions, breathing difficulties, rhinitis and nasal symptoms, eye and ear discomfort, thermal stress, and visual field reduction. These symptoms were all described related to N95 masks, while only ear discomfort and skin reactions were commonly described with use of medical masks. Eye discomfort and visual field reduction were reported as a side effect of wearing both eye protection and any type of mask. PPE Guidelines 5 Thermal stress was reported as a result of PPE that included a gown; however, these studies were often performed in hot or tropical climates and may not be as relevant a side effect in Alberta. The use of continuous PPE , or any strategy required increased PPE use may increase the risk of PPE fatigue, doffing errors and risk of self -contamination/self -inoculation. Therefore, PP E recommendations in excess of what is optimally required for protection may actually reduce compliance and increase the risk of breaches and errors The literature is heterogene ous, but the use of PPE and isolation precautions can be associated with communication challenges, and deli rium in patients in isolation. F acial masking, impairs the ability of healthcare providers to communicate with patients and with other providers. Specifically, clinical and non- clinical studies reported impaired facial emotion recognition, hearing, speech discrimination and processing, speech intelligibility, and required increased vocal effort. These communication challenges limit the ability of providers and patients to comprehend each other, ability of providers to relate to their patients and to build a productive therapeutic relationship. However, continuous mask use is acknowledged as a near ubiquitous measure in the current pandemic. However, t hree systematic reviews show that care quality is not impacted by isolation precautions, although the authors of these reviews agree that the evidence is highly heterogen eous. The negative outcome most consistently associated with isolation precautions is delirium - isolated patients have significantly higher odds of experiencing delirium compared to non- isolated patients . The evidence for the effect of isolation on depression and anxiety in patients is mixed. Patient perceptions of care do not appear to be significantly affected by isolation precautions. Staff adherence to PPE guidance is complicated and appears to be influenced by multiple factors including PPE norms, physical discomfort, in terference with ability to provide care, and interference with normal processes. One study suggested that a perception of adequate PPE (i.e. perception of safety) can mitigate non- adherence related to physical discomfort. No evidence was iden tified that described staff complacency with other protective behaviours due to full / continuous PPE; however, one study suggested that PPE may contribute to a false sense of security in staff. The time required, perceived inconvenience, and supply concerns associated with donning and doffing procedures may result in staff neglecting their own needs (such as fully utilizing breaks, eating, drinking, and using the toilet). These stresses, combined with physical discomfort and impaired communication, can im pact mood and erode morale over time. Research Question 5: Which care areas (e.g., ICU, emergency, perioperative care) pose the highest risk of COVID -19 exposure for healthcare workers? There are several observational studies, particularly cross -sectional studies that have examined the relative risk or association between areas of care and COVID -19 infection among HCW . The findings from these studies are mixed. Most of the included studies examined the risk of COVID -19 infection for HCWs working in designated COVID -19 wards; half of the studies reported increased risk (relative to non- COVID -19 wards) and half reported no difference in risk. Four studies reported that HCWs in the intensive care unit (ICU) were significantly less likely to test positive for C OVID -19; one study identified no difference in risk of infection between HCWs in the ICU and acute care areas. The r elative risk or association between other acute care areas (e.g., emergency department, acute medical wards) was heterogene ous, with included studies reporting increased or no association between such areas of care and HCWs acquiring COVID -19. Data from the AHS Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) Testing dashboard and the acute care outbreak dashboards from March 5 to August 31, 2020, suggest that occupational infections have occurred at a relatively low rate in comparison to man y jurisdictions using current precautions, across a range of HCW staffing categories and care areas (see also the SAG review on risk of COVID -19 for healthcare workers ). Additionally, from March 5 to December 9, 2020 the majority of healthcare employee and ph ysician PPE Guidelines 6 infections (63% ) were acquired in the community ; 33% were workplace associated exposures but additional detail on location is not currently available (See AHS Tab leau dashboard) . Committee Discussion The review was discussed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on December 2, 2020 and December 9. Initial recommendations were around terminology, links, resources, and level of evidence. The committee agreed that N95 should not be recommended continuously based on extant data. The evidence base for current precautions (continuous masking and eye protection) was discussed and it was decided to frame this within Practical Guidance rather than Recommendations, given t he limited evidence base. It was re cogniz ed that public health and operational decisions need to consider other contextual pressures ( for example, reducing the number of HCW requiring quarantine), in addition to consider the quality of evidence available. Patient masking was discussed in detail: it was emphasized that symptomatic or suspect/possible/confirmed COVID -19 patient masking for \"source control\" has not been evaluated in high quality studies . It was noted that it would seem to offer little added benefit where HCW are using continuous PPE but may be more relevant where patients are in shared rooms without adequate distancing, or where visitors are present. Given the lack of published studies this was suggested to be addressed in practical guidanc e. Some members also noted that patients with deteriorating clinical status might need special attention, as a group where AGMP may be required with short notice and thus some latitude for HCW PPE selection in this situation was felt important. It was also discussed within written feedback whether there are specific HCW groups who perform repeated AGMPs in settings where symptom and risk assessment may be constrained who might be considered for continuous N95 use in select settings, if recommended by their local Infection Prevention and Control teams. Finally, the committee reviewed and discussed local WHS data concerning occupational acquired COVID -19 infections among HCWs in the first wave of the pandemic. The committee agreed that the data was of a great value for broad reporting and decision- making in the province and that selected available data should be included in this review, as well as for a potential future review on its own. The findings from the WHS data analysis was also felt to be of value to address current research and data gaps and identify causes of facility outbreaks , which are required to better inform local PPE guidance. Recommendations Recommendation 1a: For suspect, probable and confirmed cases of COVID -19, in acute care and long- term care, we recommend that healthcare staff maintain current recommendations of contact and droplet precaution for suspect , probable or confirmed COVID -19 patient encounters , Recommendation 1b: For patients or residents without COVID -19 compatible symptoms or who are COVID -19 negative in acute care and long- term care, the current evidence base supports that healthcare staff use continuous masking, careful hand hygiene and repeated comprehensive point -of-care patient risk assessment s. Note: Continuous eye protection for HCW and masking of patients or residents in acute or long term care is discussed under Practical Considerations Rationale: 1a. No guidelines have recommended full PPE (contract/droplet) for all patient encounters, particularly those who are asymptomatic or are COVID -19 negative, and there is no current scientific evidence of additional benefit to healthcare workers from this practice. The data on potential harms identified in this review supports that continuous full PPE not be recommended. Rationale 1b. Two before- after studies found that implementation of a continuous masking policy in hospital systems was associated with decreased risk of healthcare- acquired SARS -CoV-2 infection (Seidelman et al. 2020, Wang et al., 2020). These studies had limitations including no adjustment for potential confounders, no concurrent controls, and short study periods . Three cluster -RCTS evaluated continuous masking of HCW in reducing influenza- like illness risk with no significant differences found PPE Guidelines 7 (two studies evaluated continuous N95 compared to continuous masks, and one compared continuous masks with no masks). Given these limitations it is also noted that use of continuous masking (in combination with continuous eye protection - as noted in practical guidance) will reduce the number of staff requiring quarantine if they are exposed to a patient who was not suspected of having COVID -19 but subsequently test s positive. Recommendation 2: N95 or similar respirators are not recommended as part of continuous general PPE, but are recommended for healthcare workers who anticipate performing an AGMP on a patient with confirmed COVID -19 infection or suspect COVID -19 infection based on a comprehensive point -of-care risk assessment. Rationale: No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of continuous use of N95s or other respirators compared to continuous medical masks . The evidence from a systematic review and meta- analysis of RCTs suggests that there is no clear difference between the use of medical masks compared with N95 or similar respirators in reducing respiratory viral infection in healthcare workers (Jefferson et al. 2020) , although it is noted that these did not evaluate SARS- CoV-2 transmission. Continuous use of N95 even in the context of increased community transmission of any respiratory virus is not supported by current evidence. Risks to the wearer associated with the use of N95 or other respirators can be important (e.g. headache, breathing difficulties, impaired cognition) and lead to excess fatigue and distress at work. Practical Considerations Any modification to respi ratory protective equipment mandates within the context of a pandemic must include several considerations beyond the level of evidence supporting their protective ability. Considerations should also include the risk of SARS -CoV-2 exposure according to the current understanding of the transmission of the virus and repeated point -of-care risk assessments, hospital outbreak status, the physical risks associated with their use among healthcare workers, the perception of PPE and behavioral impact on staff, and t he impact of a continuous PPE mandate on non- healthcare staff (e.g., overall healthcare worker morale and psychological safety), and the access to and supply of PPE. Where the evidence base is insufficient to allow the Scientific Advisory Group to issue co nditional recommendations, these considerations are reflected in Practical Considerations . Practical Consideration 1 . For asymptomatic or COVID -19 negative patients in acute care, current AHS guidance now recommends that healthcare staff use continuous eye protection in addition to continuous masking, careful hand hygiene and ongoing comprehensive point -of-care risk assessments of patients . The rationale supporting continuous eye protection is that while no RCTs have compared eye protection with no eye protection; a pooled analysis of observational studies of low quality (Chu et al. 2020) identified nearly 80% reduction in viral infection or transmission with the use of eye protection among HCWs , and this has also influenced Workplace health and Safety Risk assessments . High-quality evidence pertaining to the additive benefit of eye protection among HCWs is lacking. Although many jurisdictions currently recommend continuous masking among HCWs for the durati on of their shift; a few jurisdictions (e.g. Manitoba, British Columbia) recommend eye protection in conjunction with continuous masking. The CDC guidance only recommends continuous eye protection with continuous masking only in the context of moderate or substantial community transmission. Recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) specifically mention a rationale to protect \"staff and physicians and limit the need for workplace exclusions\". The AHS guidance states the use of \" continuous use of eye protection for all healthcare workers involved in patient care, which includes all patient interactions that occurs within two metres (2 m). This includes both hands -on patient care, as well as indirect patient care such as meal deliv ery and housekeeping.\" Workplace Health and Safety will no longer exclude workers who wore a mask and eye protection, but were not wearing gloves or a gown, at the time of their patient int eraction [with an asymptomatic or COVID -19 negative patient ] who su bsequently is identified as a case with transmissible COVID -19 (applicable to scenarios where there was no AGMP exposure) . Practical Consideration 2. Patients with suspect, probable or confirmed COVID -19 in acute care and long- term care, are encouraged t o wear a medical mask (if tolerated and with recognition of the patient 's medical condition) as a means of source control when they leave their room. PPE Guidelines 8 Outpatients with suspect, probable or confirmed COVID -19 should wear a medical mask (if tolerated and with recognition of the patient 's medical condition) as a means of source control if within 2 metres of people not wearing appropriate PPE. Use of a medical mask in other settings, including within a patient room, should be considered primarily based on the presence of individuals at risk (not wearing appropriate PPE, within 2 m distance for an extended time) as is generally advised for all symptomatic persons. Rationale: PPE use by patients in health care settings has not been studied . No studies were identified that evaluated the effectiveness of continuous masking of patients with or without COVID -19 in healthcare settings. There are guidelines that discuss patient masking in various healthcare contexts. For insta nce, the current AHS guidance indicates patients on contact and droplet precautions in acute care are asked to mask when leaving a patient room. Recent guidance from the WHO states that \"in geographic settings of known or suspected community or cluster transmission of SARS -CoV-2 virus, universal masking (all persons [staff, patients, visitors, service providers and others] to wear a mask at all times except for when eating or drinking) should be advised in health facilities\" (WHO 2020). Further, \"inpatients are not required to wear a mask (medical or non- medical) unless physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be maintained (e.g. when being examined or visited at the bedside) or when outside of their care area (e.g. when being transported)\", (WHO 2020). The WH O guidance does not indicate levels of community incidence or prevalence of SARS -CoV-2 to define \"known or suspected community or cluster transmission of SARS -CoV-2.\" A SAG review on mask use in the community reported that systematic reviews of RCTs failed to show significant benefit with medical mask use in community settings, whereas more observational and case- control studies (both at higher risk of bias), have suggested that masks are protective. Consequently, the SAG committee made several recommendations including \"in the community, medical mask use should be prioritized for those with any symptoms suggestive of COVID -19, as a form of source control\" and \"In settings where social distancing cannot be maintained, medical masks or high- quality non- medical masks should be encouraged as a form of protection for those vulnerable to severe COVID -19 infection outcomes\" (Asadi 2020). Potential harms, concurrent treatments, health conditions (e.g. confusion) and practical limitations (e.g. feasibility, compliance), can complicate source control masking among patients in healthcare facilities so toler ability assessment is crucial. G iven HCW PPE guidelines and restriction of visitors currently in place, it is unclear that significant benefit in transmission reduction could be realized from inpatients continuously masking in healthcare facilities except in defined circumstances (e.g. when inpatients with any symptoms suggestive of COVID -19 are outside their room). Practical Consideration 3. Fears and uncertainties related to PPE use among healthcare workers may be mitigated by clear communication about the evidence base reviewed, guidelines and rationale for changing the guidelines . The provincial Infection Prevention and Control PPE Peer Safety Coaches program may be a practical and feasible solution to provide healthcare workers the tool s and training necessary to appropriately apply the point -of-care risk assessment, avoid errors in donning and doffing PPE, and to recognize and mitigate situations of potentially high- risk exposures . Practical Consideration 4. To enhance the PPE guidance and help address important research gaps , collaborations between data asset groups within AHS (e.g. Workplace Health and S afety, Infection Prevention and Control, public health and Analytics), the PPE Task Force , and the Outbreak Task Force should enable data sharing, consolidation and analysis. Collaborative investigations are required to identify risk factors and sources of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in healthcare settings (including factors such as: AGMP related, HCW or patient as exposure source, PPE breaches (in PPE or technique, point of car e risk assessment adequacy) . These findings can inform evolving recommendation, be used in HCW education and further investigate whether outbreaks are influenced by different levels of community COVID -19 rates . It is suggested that these elements be report ed to ECC as well as the PPE Taskforce. PPE Guidelines 9 Strength of Evidence Question 1: Sixteen s tudies evaluating risk factors for COVID -19 outbreaks in long- term care were observational studies that were generally graded as low -moderate quality. Six of the studies which identified community transmission being associated with long- term care outbreaks were graded as high- quality observational studies, typically because analyses adjusted for known confounders. No studies examining the association between community transmission and outbreaks in acute care facilities were identifie d; however, three studies speculated the role of community transmission in acute care outbreaks and were described in the evidence synthesis. Use of local data to explore the relationship betwee n community incidence of COVID -19 and hospital or LTC outbreaks carries many limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Question 2: The grey literature search identified 27 Canadian and international guidelines, guidance documents, technical reports, and/or frameworks relevant to this question. Given that the search was targeted to websites of Canadian and international governments as well as well-recognized public health and health protection agencies, the included references are from credibl e sources. However, it is difficult to determine the quality of the included references for this question, as the methodological considerations for their development (e.g., expert consensus input, evidence synthesis and review) were not provided. Most of the included references were not referred to as \"guidelines\". Common mechanisms and tools to assess quality of guidelines (e.g., GRADE) are, therefore, difficult to apply . Question 3: A significant number of RCTs, observational studies and systematic revie ws and meta- analyses of these studies have evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of masks, respirators and to some extent other types of PPE (e.g. eye protection). A total of 16 references were included, one being a recent Cochrane systematic review and meta- analysis (Jefferson 2020) on the effectiveness of physical interventions to disrupt respiratory viral transmission, which formed the foundation for this rapid review. However, uncertainty remains on the overall effects of using these interventions among healthcare workers and infected patients. The overall evidence was scored low -moderate quality since risk of biases were high or unclear. Common issues across clinical studies include different methods, outcomes, and confounding variables; many are underpowered . The quality and quantity of evidence on use of PPE, particularly respiratory protection, against SARS -CoV-2 is low. The paucity of evidence, low quality, in directness and imprecision make it difficult to draw firm conclusions which can be generalized to the current COVID -19 pandemic. Question 4: The literature was searched for qualitative and quantitative evidence that describes the experiences, behaviours, risks, and harms of healthcare workers and patients who are required to use PPE or are placed on contact/isolation precautions. Evidence pertaining to the quality of care provided to patients under isolation precautions, the perceptions of those patients, and qualitative evidence related to the experiences of healthcare workers during previous pandemics was generally of moderate- high quality as it was planned and conducted without the time pressures of COVID -19. Evidence pertaining to the physical discomfor t of PPE, especially those findings from 2020, was generally of low -moderate quality. These studies were often cross -sectional surveys that were distributed online or through professional group mess aging ( e.g. WhatsApp) that had a high risk of response bias and recall bias. These studies are likely to overestimate the true severity or incidence of PPE -related physical harms, as those who experienced PPE -related harm are more likely to share or report on their experience. More specifically, the included st udies do not always clearly define the type of PPE being used, the duration, or the supporting guidance. This makes it difficult to identify what part of the PPE protocol is causing harm or resulting in reduced adherence. Further, there were very few studi es that specifically discussed the risks of PPE or quality of care due to PPE in a pandemic setting, limiting the generalizability of the findings. It is possible that the findings are not translatable, as healthcare workers would not be continually donning and doffing their PPE between patients as is the case in a non- outbreak context . Question 5: This rapid review of the evidence identified several primary studies of relevance to address this question. All were designed as observational studies: 12 cross- sectional studies (1 pre-print); 5 prospective cohort studies (2 were pre-print), 2 retrospective observational studies, 2 case control studies; and 1 study was described as an observational cohort study (also pre-print) that included a prospective cohort design and a cross-PPE Guidelines 10 sectional survey. These observational study designs are appropriate for assessing the relative risks or associations between areas of care and HCWs testing positive for COVID -19. Broadly, the quality of included studies ranged from low to moderate and with potential limitations relating to sampling bias, short study or observation periods, recall bias (for participant self-reported data), measurement bias, and reporting bias (incomplete data and methods reporting). Limitations of this review As this is a rapid review and evidence about COVID -19 is ever -changing, the included studies are not exhaustive. For feasibility of a rapid review, the writers/assists identified literature through the provided search strategies. In situations where limited evidence was identified through the initial searches, partial snowball searching was conducted, and the scope of searches was not expanded to identify additional sources. In some instances, the available literature included studies that have not been peer -reviewed (pre- print) or grey literature/jurisdictional reports. Overall, the body of literature in this area is missing information on PPE effectiveness and the impact of PPE use among healthcare workers and patients in the context of the pandemic. Research Gaps The body of evidence gathered here does not provide an assessment of effectiveness of the addition of continuous eye protection, universal contact/droplet precautions (i.e. full PPE) or continuous N95 compared with continuous masking. Further investigations are needed to : o 1) examine the effectiveness of masks as source control (for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients) in healthcare settings; o 2) examine the effectiveness and harms of different levels of PPE used on the prevention of SARS- CoV-2 transmission; o 3) determine the relationship between different levels of community COVID -19 rates on the presence and size of outbreaks in healthcare settings; and o 4) to identify other risk factors and sources of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in he althcare settings. Data from Workplace Health and Safety in AHS is comprehensive and robust. Outbreak investigations identifying HCW PPE use and breaches, COVID -19 exposures and HCW outcomes should be routinely reported and published. Summary of Evidence Research Question 1: Can the prevalence of COVID -19 in the community be used to predict the likelihood of healthcare -based outbreaks? If so, can levels of risk be identified that requirements for increased levels of PPE are triggered as community prevalence rises? How are risk levels impacted by the proportion of community cases with an unknown source? For feasibility of a rapid review, a broad search strategy was applied to this question. It was designed to capture the body of literature related to outbreaks or clusters in various healthcare settings (e.g. long- term care, hospitals, and specialty units) and the association between these outbreaks with community levels of COVID -19. Abstracts that modeled healthcare utilization or hospital capacity but did not discuss impact on PPE directly were excluded as were studies that described outbreaks but did not indicate a role of community transmission. Given this approach, it is likely that observational studies , particularly those which measured and co ntrolled for community prevalence or incidence in multivariate models were missed . No studies were identified which directly assessed the association between community transmission of COVID -19 and hospital outbreaks or nosocomial transmission. Additionally , only a few studies have described hospital nosocomial transmission (Zhou 2020, Lessells 2020) . Given that long- term care or nursing homes have been particularly affected by the pandemic, many of the studies identified focused on these healthcare settings . The primary search strategy resulted in 16 studies in LTC and 3 studies in acute care. Table 1 details the studies in LTC identified, followed by a narrative description of the acute care studies. See the PRISMA flow diagram (Appendix). Most of the LTC studies were identified from a rapid conducted by the National Collaborating Centre PPE Guidelines 11 for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) from McMaster University on the risk factors associated with COVID -19 outbreaks in long- term care (LTC) (NCCMT 2020) . According to the rapid review by NCCMT, across studies looking at risk factors associated with COVID -19 outbreaks, incidence in the surrounding community was found to have the strongest association with COVID -19 infections and/or outbreaks in LTC settings. They scored the overall certainty of evidence as moderate according to GRADE guidelines. The authors outline that in several studies, the association between organizational -level factors and risk of outbreaks or mortality was reduced or eliminated after adjusting for levels of community transmission. In studies that did not adjust for community transmission, risks of outbreaks or mortality varied considerably between geographic regions, which the reviewers indicate may be explained by variations in communi ty transmission (NCCMT 2020). Despite several observational studies demonstrating a relationship between community incidence or prevalence and long- term care outbreaks, no studies correlated increased community transmission of COVID -19 with changes in PPE requirements among staff. Furthermore, the studies did not always provide estimates of community transmission or clear -step wise comparisons of different transmission rates.

A recent rapid review and meta- analysis of nosocomial infections among patients with COVID -19, SARS and MERs identified only four studies describing nosocomial COVID -19 infections. Three were from Wuhan (1 case- control, 2 case series) and one from Hubei (case series) (Zhou 2020). A few studies have indirectly assessed or speculated on the role of comm unity transmission on hospital outbreaks. Jones et al. (2020) began a HCW screening program for SARS -CoV-2 in a teaching hospital in Cambridge UK over a 3 week and then a 4 week period from 6 April to 24 May 2020. HCWs were grouped into asymptomatic screening, symptomatic screening and symptomatic household contact screening arms. Positivity rates among individuals tested were compared in each arm between the two screening periods using Fisher's exact tests. Among the HCW symptomatic and HCW symptomatic household contact combined, 1.7% tests were positive and significantly lower than the 13% positive tests in the first period (p<0.0001). Similarly, the HCW asymptomatic screening arm also had a lower positivity rate in the second period (0.8% vs 3%, p<0.0001) . The authors comment that the decline in positive HCW tests mirrored the decline in both patients testing positive at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and those tested throughout the wider region. This relationship is described through figures of positivity rates among HCWs, patients and the region. No inferential analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors (Jones 2020) . Sikkema et al. (2020) sought to understand sources and modes of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in HCWs and patients in the same hospitals by combining epidemiological data with whole- genome sequencings of SARS -CoV- 2 from clinical samples obtained from HCWs and patients in three different hospitals in the Netherlands. They performed a cross -sectional s tudy at 2 teaching hospitals and 1 regional hospital. HCWs followed national PPE guidelines at the time of the outbreak, which included full PPE when encountering a suspected COVID -19 patient. No continuous masking protocol was mentioned. FFP2 masks were used during AGMPs. Among the 1796 HCW screened (15% of HCWs at these hospitals), 96 tested positive. Of these only 50 had complete SARS -CoV-2 genome sequences. 92% of the sequences from HCWs grouped in 3 clusters. Their epidemiological data, the presence of identical viruses in all three hospitals, and with non- hospitalized cases in other locations, indicated widespread community transmission with a local super -spreading event (carnival where 2/3 of HCWs tested positive participated in). Based on their analy sis, infection of HCWs could have occurred through foreign travel, community contacts or nosocomial transmission. The authors concluded that no large- scale nosocomial transmission occurred in the context of not using continuous masking policies (Sikkema 2020) . Rickman et al. (2020) conducted a retrospective analysis to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hospital -acquired COVID -19 to inform knowledge of transmission and target IPC practices. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Definite and probably hospital -acquired cases were included over a 6- week period between 2 March and 12 April 2020. Throughout the period, multiple changes in IPC policies occurred. Staff PPE consisted of a minimum of gloves, apron, and surgical mask, with gowns, eye protection and filtering facepiece class 3 for aerosol -generating procedures. PPE was initially used for suspected or confirmed cases and extended to all patient interactions from 1 April. Of the 435 cases of COVID -19 inpatients, 66 (15.2%) were either definite or probable hospital -acquired infections. The case fatality was 36%. For 32% of infections, no source was identified, though likely could include asymptomatic or undiagnosed visitors, patients or staff members. Staff illness levels were h igh and surveillance testing of healthcare workers found that 27% of those infected were asymptomatic (Rickman 2020). The authors indicate that following the introduction of comprehensive IPC responses, both numbers and proportions of hospital -acquired cas es fell. These IPC measures were not evaluated independently to determine their relative impact on cases. However, the authors conclude that expanded staff and patient testing, use of PPE for all patient contacts , enhanced IPC measures and cohorting of suspected cases, and falling community incidence contributed to the decline in cases (Rickman 2020) . PPE Guidelines 19 Evidence from Local Alberta Data Methods In the following analysis, we examined the association of acute care and long- term care weekly outbreaks with COVID -19 incidence in the province in data collected during the period from 15 March to 21 November. Data were provided by Alberta Health Services. The dependent variables were either acute care or long- term care weekly outbreaks. The independent variables were weekly incidence rates categorized into 3 groups: <50, 50 - <100, and >100 cases per week per 100,000 population. Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to explore the association between different levels of community incidence and acute care or long- term care outbreaks and did not adjust for known confounding factors. Results Acute Care A descriptive assessment of the data demonstrated that Calgary (n=23) and Edmonton (n=39) had the greatest number of outbreaks reported. The number of outbreaks per week in each AHS zone is highly skewed with inflated number of zeros, which increases the variance relative to the mean and over -dispersion is observed. The incident rate of community cases was highly correlated (r=0.949) with the ac tive case rate (prevalence). Weekly incidence rates were used for this analysis since identifying incident cases provide more clarity than active cases, since recovery time would have to be considered and is currently difficult to ascertain from local data. Figure 1. Hospital outbreaks (left panel) and COVID -19 incidence rates (right panel) by zone by week from 15 March to 21 November 2020. PPE Guidelines 20 Figure 2. Relationship between weekly incidence rates and hospital outbreaks. Figures 1 and 2 visually demonstrate a relationship between community incidence rates and the number of acute care outbreaks in Alberta. The number of outbreaks increases as the weekly incidence rates in the community increases. Particularly, when the inci dence rate is above 50 cases per week per 100,000 population we begin to observe a larger number of outbreaks occurring. An interesting phenomenon was observed in th is unadjusted analysis . When compared to the base level (<50 cases per 100,000 population per week), the highest level of incidence rates ( >100) is not more likely as the intermediate level (50- 100) to induce hospital outbreaks. When estimating the number of outbreaks per week in acute care hospitals in the province, we see that the higher the weekly incidence rates the higher number of outbreaks will occur in hospitals (increase when incidence rates rise from <50 to >100 cases per 100,000 per week (RR 8.52, 95% CI 4.96- 14.63, p=0.000) ; representing an increase from 0.19 [95% 0.16- 0.23] outbreaks to 2.2 [95% CI 0.69- 3.80] outbreaks per week). Long Term Care A descriptive assessment of the data demonstrated that Calgary (n=80) and Capital Health (i.e. Edmonton) (n=55) had the greatest number of outbreaks reported. The number of outbreaks per week in each AHS RHA is highly skewed with inflated number of zeros, which increases the variance relative to the mean and over - dispersion is observed. The incident rate of community cases was correlated (r=0.765) with the active case rate (prevalence). The percentage of cases with unknown infection sources is not calculable due to the lack of information on RHA coding in the source data. Weekly incidence rates were used for this analysis since identifying incident cases provide more clarity than active c ases, since recovery time would have to be considered and is currently difficult to ascertain from local data. PPE Guidelines 21 Figure 1. LTC outbreaks (left panel) and COVID -19 incidence rates (right panel) by RHA by week from Mar 15 to Nov 21, 2020 Figure 2. Relationship between weekly outbreaks in LTCs & COVID -19 incidence rates In Figure 1 a bimodal peak of outbreaks is observed in Calgary, however a similar bimodal peak in the incidence rate per week in Calgary is not observed, as wo uld be expected in LTC. Despite this, the number of outbreaks appear to increase as the weekly incidence rates in the community increases (Figure 2) . Particularly, when the incidence rate is above 50 cases per week per 100,000 population we begin to observ e a larger number of outbreaks occurring. An interesting phenomenon was observed , like in the acute care analysis . When compared to the base level (<50 cases per 100,000 population per week), the highest level of incidence rates ( >100) is not more likely as the intermediate level (50- 100) to be associated with LTC outbreaks. When estimating the number of outbreaks per week in LTC in the province, we see that the higher the weekly incidence rates the higher number of outbreaks will o ccur in LTC (increase when incidence rates rise from <50 to >100 cases per 100,000 per week (RR 2.79, 95% CI 2.28- 3.41) ; representing an increase from 0. 35 (95% CI 0.28- 0.42) outbreaks to 0.93 (95% CI 0.50- 1.35) outbreaks per week ). Limitations Case repor ting delays are known to exist for various reasons and data inconsistency existed across data sources. Data are cleansed and reconciled as much as possible on a best effort basis afforded. Separately, hospital and long-term care outbreak definitions may also have changed over time, with earlier outbreaks investigated but not formally reported as outbreak, thus rendering a potential underestimate in the number of outbreaks reported. Certain aspects of inconsistency and deficiency may still exist in the analytic data . The analysis nevertheless is PPE Guidelines 22 done in the spirit of conciseness and simplicity to meet the immediate need for information of the Scientific Advisory Group. Research Question 2: What guidelines do other jurisdictions use to determine PPE requirements? Are there common features to these guidelines? A grey literature search was completed to identify guidelines from other jurisdictions concerning the PPE requirements for HCWs in acute care and long- term care (LTC) settings during the COVID -19 pandemic. In brief, the websites of Canadian and international governments and well -recognized public health and health protection agencies were searched. A total of 27 guidelines, guidance documents, technical reports, and/or frameworks were identified ( n=14 applicable to HCWs in acute HCWs in LTC settings; n=4 applicable to HCWs in any healthcare settings). Complete details of these included references, as well as the recommendations for PPE requirements for HCWs in acute c are and LTC settings, are provided in supplementary Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. Evidence from grey literature The jurisdictional scan of guidelines among Canadian provinces and t erritories identified PPE guidance documents from British Columbia (BC Centre for Disease Control, 2020a, 2020b; Vancouver Coastal Health Authority 2020a, 2020b), Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Health Authority [SHA] 2020a, 2020b), Manitoba (Shared Health 2020 a, 2020b), and Ontario (Ontario Health 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Public Health Ontario, 2020). Further, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) developed several infection and prevention control and/or PPE guidance documents in response to the COVID -19, three of which were also included for this review (PHAC, 2020a; 2020b; 2020c). From international jurisdictions, national -level PPE guidance documents were identified from Australia (Government of Australia, 2020a; 2020b), New Zealand (New Zealand Ministry of Health, 2020), Korea (Korean Center for Disease Prevention and Control [KCDC], 2020), the United States (US Centre for Disease Control [CDC], 2020), and the United Kingdom ( Public Health England et al., 2020). Documents intended to provide PPE guidance for multiple jurisdictions were produced by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC, 2020) and the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a; 2020b; 2020c). A summary of the recommended PPE requirements for HCWs treating acute care patients or LTC resident s with COVID -19 from 7 of the included guidance documents is outlined in Table 2. These representative guidance documents were produced by either federal government, public health, and/or health protection agencies, are intended for national (or multiple) jurisdictions, and are commonly referenced in other jurisdictional PPE guidelines, including existing Alberta Health Services guidelines and resources .

Many of the recommendations appear to build off foundational infection prevention and control guidance already outlined by these agencies and provide additional guidance specific to the challenges faced by HCWs duri ng the COVID -19 pandemic. Specifically, when providing direct care to acute care patients or LTC residents suspected (i.e., symptoms suggestive of) or confirmed to be COVID -19 positive, use of Droplet and Contact precautions are commonly recommended. At mi nimum, such precautions include the use of a medical mask, long- sleeved cuffed gown, gloves, and eye protection (e.g., visor, face shield or goggles). Exceptions to this minimum PPE standard were noted by the KCDC, which recommends use of a Korean filter 94 (KF94) respirator (or equivalent respirator, such as the US N95) instead of a medical mask (KCDC, 2020). Furthermore, the US CDC and the ECDC also first suggest the use of respirators (N95 and Class 2 or 3 Face filter piece (FFP2 or FFP3} respirators, respectively) and secondarily recommend medical masks in the event that respirators are in shortage or unavailable (US CDC, 2020; ECDC, 2020). Similar minimum PPE requirements are r ecommended for HCWs performing aerosol -generating medical procedures (AGMPs) in acute care and LTC care settings. An AGMP is any procedure conducted on a patient or resident that can result in the production of aerosols of various sizes, including droplet nuclei. Examples of AGMPs may include intubation and related procedures (e.g., manual ventilation, open endotracheal suctioning), bronchoscopy, sputum BiPAP) (PHAC, 2020a). While most guidance documents note that for COVID -19 positive patients or residents AGMPs should be limited to those that are medically necessary, they should still be anticipated and appropriate precautions (including PPE requirements) planned for, when possible. As such, when performing an AGMP on acute care patients or LTC residents suspected or confirmed to be COVID -19 positive, the representative guidance documents commonly recommend that HCWs additionally employ Airborne precautions, which entail use of a respirator (instead of a medical mask), long- sleeve cuffed gowns, gloves, and eye protect ion (e.g., visor, face shield or goggles). Different types of respirators are recommended across the representative guidance documents. For instance, PHAC (2020a; 2020b; 2020c), the Australian Department of Health (Government of Australia, 2020a; 2020b), and the US CDC recommend use of N95 respirators (US CDC, 2020); whereas the UK's joint public health and health services guidance (Public Health England et al., 2020) and the ECDC (2020) recommend use of FFP3 respirators. In addition, the KCDC recommends us e of either a KF94 or powered air -purifying respirator (PARP) (KCDC, 2020). These differences may reflect the availability and/or procurement of different respirator types in these jurisdictions, rather than specifically effectiveness of the respirators themselves. To this end, the WHO recommends use of either N95, FFP2, FFP3 or 2020c). In LTC settings, AGMPs may be performed less frequently than in the acute care setting and PHAC recommends that HCWs follow specific provincial and/or territorial guidance regarding use of either a medical mask or N95 respirator when performing AGMPs (PHAC, 2020c). It is worth noting that the majority of the representative guidance documents recommend universal or continuous masking for HCWs in any healthcare settings throughout the duration of their shifts. In addition, and if tolerated, continuous masking of patients and residents suspected or confirmed to be COVID -19 positive, particularly in acute care s ettings, was also commonly recommended. This is consistent with current AHS practices (file:///C:/Users/jenine.leal/Downloads/hi -ipc-emerging -issues -ncov.pdf) . Guidance varied with regards to the use of cloth versus medical masks for acute care patients or LTC residents. Both universal or continuous masking among HCWs and patients/residents were described as a means of \"source control\" in the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic. Continuous \"full PPE\", as in complete Contact and Droplet (or Airborne) precautio ns throughout HCWs shifts \u2014 including during non- patient facing activities \u2014was not recommended in any of the included guidance documents (Tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix ). Further, with regards to PPE requirements for direct care of patients or residents without suspected or confirmed COVID -19, recommendations varied across jurisdictions. For instance for HCWs in acute care and LTC settings in Canadian jurisdictions, guid elines from Manitoba recommend use of medical mask s and eye protection ; gowns and gloves are recommended \"as per facilities' routine practices \" (Shared Health 2020a, 2020b). Guidance from the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority in BC recommends HCWs use medical masks, eye protection, and gloves for patients and residents without symptoms and l ow-risk of PPE Guidelines 25 COVID -19 infection (VCH 2020a, 2020b). In contrast in Ontario, only medical masks are recommended at minimum for HCWs during patient -facing activities (Ontario Health, 2020a). However, across guidance documents the use of Standard P recautions and Point of Care Risk Assessment processes specific to the given jurisdictions was recommended when providing care to asymptomatic or COVID -19 negative patients and residents; a synthesis of these recommendations is provided in Table 4 and Table 5 . Along with the recommended PPE requirements, all of the guidance documents provided comments on appropriate application (\"donning\") and removal (\"doffing\") of PPE, or indicated other source documents for HCWs to refer to ( Tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix ). Recommendations related to the disposal or re- use (or extended use) of PPE, particularly in the context of PPE conservation during the COVID -19 pandemic, were frequently noted, although not consistently elaborated on in all of the guidance documents. PHAC, for example, notes that the guidance provided \"does not address Canada's circumstances with respect to shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) that are the subject of urgent and on going discussion at all levels across the country\" (PHAC, 2020a). In contrast, one guidance document produced by the WHO specifically recommends rational use of PPE with respect to COVID -19 and considerations to minimize use of PPE during severe shortages (WHO, 2020b). See Tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix (in \"Other Guidelines Comments\" column) for extracted recommendations concerning disposal, re- use or extended use, where available. Considering Levels of Community Transmission for PPE requirements Guidance from two jurisdictional sources explicitly considered different levels of community transmission of COVID -19 when making their recommendations for PPE requirements. The Australian Department of Health recommends that in areas with significant comm unity transmission, HCWs providing routine care in either acute care or LTC settings may consider use of a respirator instead of a medical mask if patients or residents exhibit cognitive impairment, are unable to cooperate, or exhibiting challenging behavi ours, or are in wards where there are high numbers of suspected or confirmed COVID -19 patients (Government of Australia, 2020a; 2020b). Further, in areas with significant community transmission universal masking of HCWs throughout the duration of their shi ft is recommended when in any healthcare setting (Government of Australia, 2020a; 2020b). The US CDC also recommends that medical masks be used for routine care (and if respirators are not available) for areas with no or low community transmission , however , in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, use of eye protection in addition to their medical mask is recommended (US CDC, 2020). What constitutes low versus significant levels of community transmission was not defined in either the Australian or US CDC guidance documents. The WHO does recommend universal masking of acute care and LTC HCWs throughout the duration of their shifts in the event of any community transmission, but does not specify particular levels of transmission (WHO, 2020a). Research Question 3: What degree of protection is offered from universal masking in healthcare, including evidence for the utility of medical masks in preventing transmission from an infected person (source control)? What additional protection result s from the sequential addition of a) continuous face shield/eye protection b) contact and droplet precautions c) continuous N95 mask use, each in comparison to continuous masking and hand hygiene? Given the amount of literature on evaluating masks, the scope of the rapid review for this question was limited to systematic reviews, narrative reviews, scoping reviews and living reviews. The search strategy identified 1022 citations. These abstracts were pre-screened by an experienced rapid review writer and scientist (J Boyd) to identify relevant literature. Of these 81 were identified for inclusion. For feasibility of completing this rapid review, further screening was done to identify literature focusing on universal masking and/or overall PPE effectiveness in the context of viral respiratory infections. A total of 27 citations were prioritized for review. Upon inspection, one very recent systematic review and meta- analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration (Jefferson et al. 2020) was identified, which formed the foundation of evidence for this rapid review . No COVID- 19 RCT s on PPE use and effectiveness were available at the time this was written. Other systematic reviews were investigated, and it was found that nearly all of them summarized or meta- analyzed studi es that were included in the Cochrane review. From these, partial snowball searching was done to identify observational studies exploring the effectiveness of PPE Guidelines 26 different levels of PPE, particularly the use of universal masking. Table 6 in the appendix provides characteristics of reviews that were inspected. Results from the Cochrane systematic review, other reviews and individual studies are presented in Table 3 below . The Cochrane systematic review and meta- analysis by Jefferson et al. assessed the effectiveness of physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks and gargling) to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. Previous versions of this review have been published four times, with the more recent one in 2011, which included observational studies. For the 2020 update, the authors did not include observational studies as there were enough R CTs to address their study objectives. The pooled results of the RCTs , which were all in the context of seasonal and epidemic influenza, did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection. Hand hygiene modestly reduced the burden of respiratory illness. Harms associat ed with physical interventions were under -investigated. No RCTs were found on eye protection, gowns and gloves, or PPE use, relevant for this review (Jefferson et al. 2020). Three cluster -RCTs were identified in the Jefferson et al . review which evaluated continuous masking among healthcare workers, in high -risk settings where multiple exposures to respiratory infections were expected, to reduce the risk of viral respiratory illness (MacIntyre 2011, 2013, 2015). Two studies compared continuous masking with continuous N95, and one compared continuous masking with no masks. One study assessed the risk of influenza -like illness only (MacIntyre et al. 2015), while two studies (MacIntyre et al. 2011, 2013) assessed clinical respiratory illness (CRI) , influenza -like illness (ILI) and laboratory -confirmed influenza . No statistically significant differences between continuous N95 and continuous masking was identified: CRI RR 0.62 (95% 0.28- 1.35) 1.40); ILI RR 0.52 (95% laboratory -confirmed influenza RR 2.61 (95% CI 0.12- 58.93) in MacIntyre et al 2011 and 2013 respectively. Similarly, MacIntyre et al. (2015) did not find a statistically significant difference in ILI among HCWs when comparing continuous masks to usual practice (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03- 2.51). Randomized control trials are acknowledged as important standards for evidence- based decision- making in medicine since their design reduces biases, making them more reliable assessments of the effectiveness of interventions or treatments. However, despite the several R CTs evaluating masks, uncertainty remains about the effects of medical masks. The evidence was scored low -moderate quality since the risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster -RCTs was high or unclear. Many studies were conducted during non- epidemic influenza p eriods, but many were done during the global H1N1 influenza pandemic, and others during epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016. Therefore, studies were done during periods of lower respiratory viral circulation and transmission compared to COVID -19. The aut hors conclude that there was a high risk of bias in the trials, outcome measurement varied, and there was overall low compliance with the interventions during the studies making it difficult to draw firm conclusions which can be generalized to the current COVID -19 pandemic (Jefferson et al. 2020). Other recent systematic and narrative reviews comparing effectiveness of respirators vs masks against common viral respiratory infections come to similar conclusions that both devices offer comparable protection in healthcare settings. Two before- after studies, referenced in the WHO mask guidance, found that implementation of a universal masking policy in hospital systems was associated with decreased risk of healthcare- care acquired SARS -CoV-2 infection. Seidelman et al. (2020) used negative binomial regression to compare the incidence rates of healthcare- acquired SARS -CoV-2 cases among Duke Health HCWs before and after introducing universal masking using a likelihood ratio test. From March 15- June 6, 2020 they as sessed all HCWs who tested positive for SARS- CoV-2 and observed a significant decrease in the cumulative incidence rate of healthcare- acquired SARS- CoV-2 infection among HCWs (LRT 4.38, p=0.03) one week after the implementation of universal masking on Marc h 31, 2020 (Seidelman et al. 2020). PPE Guidelines 27 Wang et al. (2020) assessed the association of hospital masking policies with the SARS -CoV-2 infection rate among HCWs in Mass General Brigham. In March 2020, they implemented a multipronged infection reduction strategy involving systematic testing of symptomatic HCWs and universal masking of all HCWs and patients with surgical masks. They identified 3 phases during the study period: pre- intervention period (March 1- 24, 2020), a transition period (March 24- April 5, 2020) , a lag period to allow manifestation of symptoms (April 6- 10) and an intervention period (April 11 -30, 2020). During the pre- intervention period, the SARS -CoV-2 positivity rate increased exponentially from 0- 21.32%, and during the intervention period it decreased linearly from 14.65% to 11.46%, with a net slope change of 1.65% (95% CI 1.13- 2.15%, p<0.001) more decline per day compared with the pre- intervention period. Neither study controlled for confounders or other interventions such as restrictions on elective procedures, social distancing measures, and increased masking in public spaces (Wang et al. 2020). Additionally, no concurrent control was included and the observed decreases in HCW infections occurred too quickly to be attributable to the univers al masking policy (WHO 2020). Source Control Few studies assessed the effect of PPE use, particularly masks, among infected individuals (source control). A systematic review by MacIntryre and Chughtai (2020) identified 5 randomized control trials evaluati ng the use of masks among sick patients (source control) (Johnson et al 2009, Canini et al. 2010, MacIntyre 2016 et al. , Barasheed 2014 et al. , Leung 2020 et al. ). The summary of these studies is taken verbatim from the MacIntyre, Chughtai review and are i ncluded in Table 6 . The Johnson 2009 studies was an experimental study of 9 influenza patients, which did not measure clinical endpoints. Participants with confirmed influenza coughed onto culture medium wearing a N95 respirator or masks. No influenza was measured on the medium (Johnson et al. 2009). Canini 2010 conducted a cluster randomized control trial of 105 s ymptomatic sick patients wearing a mask (or no mask) in the household and found no significant differences between arms. However, the trial was terminated prematurely, so it was likely underpowered (Canini et al. 2010) . Barasheed et al. ( 2014) conducted a randomized control trial among Hajj pilgrims, with both well and sick pilgrims wearing masks in the tents randomized to \"supervised mask use' and compared to those well and sick pilgrims randomized to the \"no supervised mask use\" , and low rates of ILI were reporting among contact s of mask ed pilgrims (Barasheed et al. 2014) . MacIntrye et al. ( 2016) conducted the largest available randomized controlled trials with clinical endpoints, studying 245 patients randomized to mask or control. Compliance was suboptimal in the mask group and some controls wore masks. The intention to treat analysis showed no difference in rates of clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.18- 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.03- 3.13) or laboratory confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95%CI 0.06- 15.54). When analyzed by actual mask use, the rate of clinical respiratory illness in household contacts was lower in those who wore masks (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06- 0.86). Risks of ILI and laboratory -confirmed viral respiratory infections were also lower in t he mask group, but the difference was not statistically significant. (MacIntyre et al. 2016) . Finally, a trial with an experimental design by Leung et al ( 2020) examined several viruses including seasonal human coronaviruses. It showed that coronaviruses are preferentially found in aerosolized particles compared to large droplets and could be expelled by normal tidal breathing. Wearing a surgical mask prevented virus from being exhaled (Leung et al. 2020) . Clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of medical masks as source control are scarce, and therefore lower levels of evidence, particularly from laboratory studies, provide further guidance. Zhang et al. (2020) Twelve laboratory studies were identified and summarized. Most studies show high filtration capacity for both masks and respirators. The authors comment that source control with masks may be superior to exposure prevention by either respirators or masks. Although these studies provide information on the theoretical performances of respiratory protection devices, the experimental process and particle sizes tested may not resemble natural respiratory activity (Zhang et al. 2020). Many studies suffer from major limitations and inconsistencies in design and more importantly fail to account for clini cal and behavioural factors. Additional protection above universal masking No studies were identified during this rapid review that have evaluated the incremental benefit of additional PPE with the use of continuous masking. In some jurisdictions, HCWs are instructed to wear eye protection in addition PPE Guidelines 28 to masks, however very few s tudies have examined the combined effects of overall PPE (Zhang et al. 2020). Recently, a an updated Cochrane systematic review and meta- analysis (Verbeek et al. 2020) was conducted to evaluate which type of full -body PPE and which method of donning or dof fing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCWs, and which training methods increase compliance with protocols. Earlier versions were published in 2016 and 2019. In the update they included 24 studies, 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomized controlled trials, one quasi -RCT and nine had a non- randomized design (Verbeek et al. 2020). In this review, only one study examined the effectiveness of different types of PPE, particularly the effectiveness of powered, air -purifying respirator with coverall compared to N95 mask and gown. The study found that the use of PAPR with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (RR 0.27, 95% 0.17- 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non- compliance: RR 7.5 95% CI 1.81- 31.1). Most other studies explored the relative effect of modified PPE designs compared to standard PPE (e.g. sealed gown and glove combination vs standard gown glove, gowns vs aprons; permeable but breathable vs permeable, not breathable attire). Eighteen of the studies did not assess healthcare workers who were treating infected patients but simulated the effect of exposure to infection using fluorescent markers or harmless viruses or bacteria (Verbeek et al. 2020) . No studies were found that investigated goggles or face shields. It was unclear from the study results about the best way to remove PPE after use and the best type of training in the long term. In another systematic review and meta- analysis of observational studies by Chu et al (2020), the objective was to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in healthcare and non-healthcare settings. Most studies reported on bundled interventions, including different components of PPE and distancing, which was usually addressed by statistical adjustment. All studies were observational and occurred during recurrent or novel outbreak settings of COVID -19, SARS or MERS. The authors identified 13 unadjusted and 2 adjusted studies, which demonstrated eye protection was associated with lower risk of infection (unadjusted RR 0.34 95% CI 0.22- 0.52, adjusted OR (Chu et al. 2020) . Samaranayake 2020 reviewed data on the effectiveness and efficacy of face masks and respirators, including protective eyewear, with emphasis on dental healthcare and excluded studies with high- risk of bias according to the Newcastle -Ottawa scale. They identified five studies that examined the use of protective eyewear against respiratory droplets and bioaerosols using simulated models or laboratory studies. Three studies found that either a face mask or fit-tested N95 respirator with eye protection provided better protection and that face shields alone cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection. Two studies looked at face fit factor and found that a conventional visor worn in the inverted position provides superior protection than wearing a mask without a visor; and secondly that face shields were substantially inferior to masks in obviat ing penetration of airborne debris because of a lack of peripheral fit. Interestingly, a research letter by Bhaskar and Arun (2020), recently described transmission in a community setting before and after the use of face shields. Community health workers from a research network in Chennai, India counseled asymptomatic family contacts of patients tested positive for SARS- CoV-2 at their residents. These workers were housed in separate rooms of hostels, provided food, were not allowed to visit homes or public places outside of work, they communicated by phone, and traveled in small vans with a steel partition between the driver and back cabin. Workers wore masks in the van and maintained other levels of PPE when visiting households (i.e. 3-layered surgical masks, gloves and shoe covers) and used alcohol -based hand rub. The study began on 3 May 2020 and by 20 May 2020, face shields were added to their PPE. The researchers compared the number of positive tests (among households and workers) before and after the introduction of face shields. Before the introduction of face shields, 12 (19%) of workers developed COVID -19 infections. Of the 50 workers that didn't develop infection and went on to wear face shields, no workers developed COVID -19 infections. The authors suggest that face shields may have reduced ocular exposure or contamination of masks/hands or diverted movement of air around the face, thus reducing risk of infection given that no other known source of infection were identified, and workers had limited community exposure. However, although interesting, it is prudent that caution be taken when interpreting this report since full study design and methods weren't reported, it was a before- after study design without adjustments for multi- level confounding factors and PPE Guidelines 29 documentation of other potential exposures was not provided (e.g. asymptomatic contacts of SARS- CoV-2 patients) (Bhaskar and Arun 2020).

Fifty-nine studies were included in the narrative synthesis below. No pre- print studies were identified. Five studies could not be retrieved in time for full text screening and inclusion in this review, however, it is unlikely that they include different information from the included studies. Of the included studies, 6 s ystematic reviews were included; 14 observational (prospective or retrospective cohort) studies were included; 2 case- control studies were included; 26 cross -sectional surveys were included; 3 non- clinical studies were included; and 8 qualitative studies w ere included. No grey literature was included in this review. The evidence was extracted verbatim from the article text; the full extraction table is included in the appendix as Table 7. For the present review, studies were included that had risks and harms of PPE / isolation precautions as both primary and secondary outcomes. A living systematic review of the effectiveness of masks on HCW and community members that has been updated throughout 2020 found that evidence of the harms and risks of PPE associated with masking was limited at best, beyond acknowledgement of physical di scomfort, breathing difficulties and skin events (Chou et al., 2020). In addition to the risks of full / continuous PPE to patients and providers, the impact on auxiliary staff should be considered as well. Corley, Hammond & Fraser (2009) suggest that duri ng the H1N1 pandemic in Australia, staff were concerned about the additional waste and laundry needs of using continuous or full PPE and how these might affect the workload and stress of environmental staff. Six categories were identified that relate to t he risks of a full PPE / continuous PPE mandate: Physical effects of PPE on the healthcare provider Effects of PPE on communication and the therapeutic relationship Impact of PPE and isolation on care quality Patient experience and perceptions of PPE and i solation precautions Effects of PPE on healthcare provider behaviours Physical effects of PPE There was extensive evidence that wearing PPE for long periods of time causes physical discomfort and adverse effects. In addition to numerous studies specifical ly describing the dermatological, respiratory, and other effects of PPE, the discomfort and effect of long wear has been documented in the social media accounts of healthcare workers (HCW), often in relation to the concept of \"exhaustion\" and suggested tha t the discomfort of PPE might impact adherence (Arasli et al., 2020). PPE discomfort is a source of stress for nurses (Kuo et al., 2020), and at least three other studies confirm that adherence is impacted by the physical discomfort of PPE (Ciris Yildiz et al., 2020; Daugherty et al.,2009; Houghton et al., 2020). However, one qualitative study of Australian nurses following the H1N1 influenza pandemic suggested that the physical discomfort of PPE may be overlooked by providers as a trade- off for what is per ceived as adequate protection against the infectious agent (Corley, Hammond & Fraser, 2009) Twenty -six studies were identified that described the physical effects of PPE. Side effects described in the literature include headache (Farronato et al., 2020; Gu pta, Singh & Gupta, 2020; Lim et al., 2006; Ong et al., 2020; Tabah et al., 2020), adverse skin reactions (Foo et al., 2006; Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020), difficulty breathing (Houghton et al., 2020; Perna et al., 2020), rhinitis and nasal symptoms (Klimek et al., 2020; Purushothaman et al., 2020), eye discomfort (Giannaccare et al., 2020; Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020), ear discomfort and dermatitis (Bothra et al., 2020; Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020), sweating and thermal stress (Houghton et al., 2020; Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Parush et al., 2020) and a reduction in visual field (Lawrence et al., 2020; Parush et al., 2020). As described previously, \"PPE\" was not clearly defined in each stud y. Overall, the more severe physical effects (such as headaches, breathing problems, impaired cognition) were seen from N95 masks, while more minor effects (such as ear discomfort and skin reactions) were seen from procedural masks. Headaches were consist ently described as a side effect of wearing N95 masks (also known as FFP2 masks) (Farronato et al., 2020; Gupta, Sing & Gupta, 2020; Lim et al., 2006; Ong et al., 2020; Tabah et al., 2020). More PPE Guidelines 36 specifically, wearing an N95 mask and protective eyewear together was associated with 1.5X odds of developing headache (Ong et al., 2020). Headaches are hypothesized to be due to pressure from the mask straps, associated hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and stress (Farronato et al., 2020). These factors also impact working a bility, concentration, and productivity (Farronato et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Parush et al., 2020). These same factors (hypercapnia, hypoxia, and changes in breathing patterns) may also trigger panic symptoms in those who are prone to them (Perna et al., 2020). Adverse skin reactions, such as dryness, redness, rash, or blisters, were very commonly described in the literature (Foo et al., 2006; Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020). Both headache and skin injury were both significantly associated with enhanced levels of PPE and wear time greater than 4 hours (Ong et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020). Of note, a few studies were identified that examined the experiences of healthcare workers with the powered air - purifying respirator (PAPR). In general, it was found to be uncomfortable, inconvenient and inhibited communication (Kang et al., 2018; Khoo et al., 2005), however, the PAPR systems are not expected to be deployed in Alber ta for general use. A new systematic review by Jefferson et al. (2020) examined the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. As suggested by Chou et al. (2020) and confirmed by Jefferson (2020), adverse events were poorly reported in the controlled trial literature. However, the risks and harms of PPE identified in Jefferson (2020) confirm the findings of the observational and qualitative literature included in the present review. The findings of Jeff erson et al. (2020) regarding adverse events are summarized in table X below. It is important to note that while the discomfort and adverse effects of PPE is irritating to wearers, the harms are not generally permanent. Except for skin rashes, the physical side effects of PPE (such as headache) have been shown to resolve shortly after removal (Ong et al. 2020). Table X. Adverse events from PPE described in the randomized controlled trial literature included in Jefferson et al. (2020). Intervention Number of studies Reported adverse events Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Medical/surgical masks 3 RCTs Main issues for adults and children were: - Warmth/humidity - Pain - Respiratory difficulties - General discomfort Very low N95 respirators 5 RCTs Four RCTs either reported no adverse events or only reported on comfort wearing masks. One study explicitly described the side effects of masks and found that adverse events were more common with N95 masks than with medical/surgical masks. - Discomfort was reported in 41.9% of N95 wearers versus 9.8% of medical mask wearers (P < 0.001) - Headaches were more common with N95 (13.4% versus 3.9%; P < 0.001) - Difficulty breathing was reported more often in the N95 group (19.4% versus 12.5%; P = 0.01) - N95 caused more problems with pressure on the nose (52.2% versus 11.0%; P < 0.001). Very low PPE Guidelines 37 Intervention Number of studies Reported adverse events Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Cloth masks 2 RCTs Cloth masks do not have significantly different or significantly more or less adverse effects than medical/surgical masks; however, they offer little protection against respiratory infection n/a Effects of PPE on communication and the therapeutic relationship Twelve studies were identified that described the effect of PPE on communication between healthcare providers and the subsequent effect on the therapeutic relationship. PPE was shown to impair speech quality and volume (Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020), comprehension (Parush et al., 2020), speech recognition and discrimination (Bandaru et al., 2020), speech processing in environments with significant background noise (such as operating theatre settings) (Hampton et al., 2020) and reduced speech intelligibility (Ribeiro et al., 2020). These challenges are noted to degrade communication between care providers (Lawrence et al., 2020). Increased vocal effort and the increased cognitive load of understanding speech was reported to affect fatigue, situational awarenes s, and decision- making (Parush et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2020). These difficulties were seen with level 1 PPE (full PPE) (Parush et al., 2020), as well as with N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Masks also affect the ability of care providers to fully relate to their patients. In an experimental (non- clinical) study, Carbon (2020) reports that masks significantly affect an individual's ability to recognize and differentiate between emotions. This finding was validated by care providers in qualitative studies of clinical PPE, as providers note that masks limit non- verbal communication and create a barrier that impacts the therapeutic relationship (Hines et al., 2020; Galehdar et al., 2020; Houghton et al., 2020; Tan et al. , 2006; Palinkas et al., 2020). In adults, this barrier is not perceived to affect the quality of care (Palinkas et al., 2020); however, pediatric care providers report that masks cause fear in children, which impacts the providers ability to engage and pr ovide care for the child (Shack et al., 2020). Impacts of PPE and isolation precautions on care quality Thirteen studies were identified that describe the impact of PPE and isolation precautions on the quality of care provided to patients. In general, the evidence is inconsistent. Three systematic reviews suggest that isolation precautions for adults in acute care do not impact care quality by multiple metrics (Abad, Fearday & Safdar, 2010; Berry et al., 2020; Purssell, Gould & Chudleigh, 2020). However, each notes that the body of evidence is heterogeneous and Berry (2020) specifically notes that they have very low - low certainty in their conclusions. This effect, or lack thereof, is also seen in individual studies of pediatric inpatient care and of long- term care (Cohen et al., 2008; Pineles et al., 2018). Pineles (2018) showed that residents in long- term care who were under isolation precautions actually received more visits per hour and care activities than their non- isolated counterparts. The only outc ome that is consistently shown to be associated with isolation precautions is delirium. Delirium is significantly more prevalent in isolated patients than in non- isolated patients, and patients placed on contact precautions are have 1.4 X higher odds of ex periencing delirium (Day et al., 2012; Purssell, Gould & Chudleigh, 2020). One study also found that processes of care related to pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine, and smoking cessation, were more likely to be missed in isolated patients (Morgan et al., 2011). These shortcomings were not observed in care for isolated patients with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction (Morgan et al., 2011). Conversely to observational studies, surveys of healthcare providers who care for patients on isolation precautions suggested that patients under isolation are less likely to be examined and may not efficiently have their needs met (Khan, Khakoo & Hobbs, 2006). Further, the delegation of duties by attending physicians to PPE Guidelines 38 medical residents may result in less experienced care provided to patients on isolation precautions compared to non-isolated patients (Saint et al., 2003) As described in the limitations above, it is difficult to separate the effect of PPE from other administrat ive and care processes on the quality of care provided to patients on isolation precautions. Specific studies of PPE on care have mixed results - full PPE has no impact on endoscopy quality (Teh et al., 2020), while surgeons feel that full PPE causes communication issues, visual interference, and reduced situational awareness (Y\u00e1nez Ben\u00edtez et al., 2020). Indeed, some aspects of PPE may even be beneficial to care. Universal gloving practices worn during RSV season have been shown to significantly reduce hos pital-associated bloodstream infections and central -line associated infections (Yin et al., 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that care quality is specific to the individual hospital, patient, and care context. Patient experience and perceptions of PPE and isolation precautions Seven studies were identified that describe patient perceptions and experiences with isolation precautions. The evidence regarding the psychological effect of isolation of patients is mixed. Three studies (one a systematic review) report that isolation precautions have a negative impact on patient psychology and behavior, such as increased scores for depression and anxiety, anger -hostility, fear, and loneliness (Abad, Fearday & Figuei redo, 2019; Catalano et al., 2003). Conversely, three studies (one a systematic review) found no significant difference between isolated and non- isolated patients with respect to length of stay, depression, anxiety, health- related quality of life, 30- day r eadmission, or death (Lau, Bonten, 2010). Two studies showed that isolation precautions do not appear to impact the patient perspective on care. Isolated patients have not been shown to have a negative perception of their care and understand that isolation is for their own benefit and the safety of others (Gasink et al., 2008). Indeed, individual rooms may provide more comfort and privacy, and offer a sense of protection (J esus, Dias & Figueiredo, 2019). As with the impacts of isolation on care quality, the patient perception of isolation precautions appears to be context -specific and the findings may not be relevant to a pandemic setting. Effects of PPE on healthcare provid er behaviours Seven studies were identified that describes the effects of mandates for full PPE / continuous PPE on the behaviour of healthcare providers. The availability of PPE plays a key role in staff behaviour. Fears of PPE shortages can be triggered by both increasing the requirements (staff may perceive that they will run out of PPE too quickly) or by decreasing the requirements (staff may perceive that reduced requirements are part of a conservation strategy and worry that they are not protected) (Corley, Hammond & Fraser, 2009). These fears may be mitigated by clear communication about guidelines and rationale for changing the guidelines (Corley, Hammond & Fraser, 2009). Only one study noted that PPE may lead to a false sense of security in healthcare providers (Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020). Fears of complacency appear to be unfounded - Houghton (2020) suggests that adherence is influenced by social norms and culture - when everyone is wearing PPE, there is improved attention to guidelines and good PPE practice. However, adherence is complicated. Qualitative surveys suggest that adherence will decrease if PPE is believed to be inconvenient to normal routines and processes or if the PPE hinders the ability to perform care (Hines et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2006; Daugherty et al., 2009). There is a risk that staff will not take care of their own needs if the PPE requirements are considered burdensome. It was noted in five studies that the inconvenience of donning and doffing PPE prevents staff from fully utilizing breaks, eating, drinking, and using the toilet (Galehdar et al., 2020; Houghton et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Tabah et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2006). These restrictions, combined with the physical discomfort of PPE and impaired communication aff ects the mood of care providers and over time could erode staff morale (Galehdar et al., 2020). PPE Guidelines 39 Research Question 5: Which care areas (e.g., ICU, emergency, perioperative care) pose the highest risk of COVID -19 for healthcare workers? A total of 22 articles (16 peer -reviewed; 2 peer -reviewed and pre- proof) were included in the narrative synthesis. Eighteen articles were included from abstract and full -text screening of citations identified from electronic database searching. An additional 4 articles were identified from hand- searching the references lists of relevant systematic and rapid reviews. All of the included articles were of observational studies: 12 cross -sectional studies (1 pre- print); 5 prospective cohort studies (2 were pre- print), 2 retrospecti ve observational studies, 2 case control studies; and 1 study was described as an observational cohort study (pre- print) that included a prospective cohort design and a cross -sectional survey. Evidence from the primary literature The characteristics of t he included studies and main findings are provided in Table 4 . Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (n=5) or Europe (Spain n=3; Italy n=3; France n=1; Denmark n=1; Sweden n=1; Belgium n=1; Turkey n=1). The remaining studies were conduct ed in China (specifically the city of Wuhan, n=2) and 2 in the United States (New York state n=1, national n=1). Ten studies were conducted in a single acute healthcare facility, 9 studies were multi -centre (acute care, community, and primary care faciliti es), and 3 were national -level (included multiple healthcare facilities within a country). The participants in all of the studies were healthcare workers (HCWs) and were categorized into clinical specialties or areas of care where they primarily worked during the study period. The specific areas of care varied widely across included studies (Table 4). For all but one study (Wei et al., 2020), the study outcome of interest was the association between areas of care and COVID -19 infection among HCWs, confir med through either microbiological assay from sera (seropositivity). The outcome of interest for the remaining study was the association between the clinical setting and developing severe or critical symptoms of COVID -19 among HCWs (Wei et al., 2020). Any covariates included in adjusted analyses , when reported, are noted in Table 4 (see 'Methodological Notes' column) . Demographic characteristics of HCWs (e.g., age and sex) were commonly included covariates in adjusted analyses, whereas adjustments for COVID -19 community activity in HCWs' areas of residence were not explicitly reported by any study. Given the observational nature of the included studies, the study quality ranged from low to moderate and studies were broadly limited by sampling bias, short study or observation periods, recall bias (for participant self -reported data), measurement bias, and reporting bias (incomplete data and methods reporting). These limitations, in addition to those elaborated below, should be considered when interpreting the findings.

COVID -19 Scientific Advisory Group Rapid Evidence Report PPE Guidelines 50 Areas of care associated with increased risk of COVID -19 infection among HCWs Broadly, the findings across studies are mixed, with 10 studies reporting positive associations between specific clinical area of work and COVID -19 infection among HCWs. Four studies reported that HCWs work ing in \"COVID -19 units or wards\" (i.e., clinical areas designated for COVID - 19 positive patients) were at increased risk of COVID -19 infection compared to those working in \"non- COVID -19 units or wards\" (Bistoquet et al., 2020; Iversen et al., 2020). Celebi et al. (2020) and Iversen et al. (2020) reported relative risks of COVID -19 infection among HCWs in COVID -19 units ranging working in non- COVID -19 units. The latter study had a relative large sample size (n=17,304) including participants across the study country (Iversen et al., 2020). Similarly, the cross -sectional study conducted by Bistoquet et al. (2020) reported incr eased adjusted odds COVID -19 infection (OR: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.15- 17.06) for those working in medical, intensive care and screening COVID -19 units compared to non- COVID -19 wards. These findings, however, must be interpreted with caution as no methodol ogical details were available in the pre- proof version of the article (Bistoquet et al., 2020). Colaneri et al. (2020) conducted a single- centre retrospective cohort study and reported that working in a COVID -19 ward was associated with an increased rate of COVID -19 infection (incident rate ratio [IRR]: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.95- 4.03) compared to other clinical wards. One additional study by Galan et al., (2020) reported increased odds of COVID -19 infection among HCWs working in COVID -19 hospitalization areas (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.22- 2.40) relative to staff in non- patient facing areas; these odds were similar, however, to HCWs in non- -19 hospitalization areas (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.30- 2.73). None of the aforementioned studies described the types of PPE used among participants, nor how they may differ between the care areas examined. Celebi et al. (2020) found that inappropriate use of PPE while caring for a suspected or confirmed COVID -19 patient to be a prominent risk factor for COVID infection among HCWs (OR: 11.295, 95% CI: 2.183- 59.429), but did not report subgroup analyses to determine whether or how this may differentially apply between HCWs in COVID -19 units and non- COVID -19 units. Bistoquet et al. (2020) reported a relatively low overall COVID -19 seropr evalence among its study sample (<5% testing positive [n=12]) and the authors attributed 1 HCW infection in the COVID -19 ward to inconsistent masking around colleagues. While availability of PPE, in terms of shortages, was not described among included studies, Colaneri et al. (2020) commented that a continuous supply of respirators, surgical masks, liquid- repellent gowns, hair caps, overshoes, and goggles or face shields were available to all HCWs in the hospital throughout the study period. Conversely, 4 studies (Garcia- Basteiro et al., 2020; Lidstrom et al., 2020; Mortgat et al., 2020; Porru et al., 2020) reported that working in a COVID -19 unit was not associated with COVID -19 infection, with ORs ranging from the studies were designed as cross -sectional studies \u2014two of which had a relative large (n>1000) or nationally -representative sample\u2014and 1 was a single - centre prospective cohort study. Lai et al., (2020) also found that in their retros pective case series in one hospital, HCWs working in clinical departments other than those designated for patients with fever (referred to as \"fever clinics or wards\") was associated with an increased risk of COVID -19 infection (IRR: 3.1, 95%CI: 1.8- 5.2) ( Lai et al., 2020). Garcia- Basteiro et al., (2020) hypothesized that the lack of association may be attributed to a higher perception of infection risk among HCWs in COVID -19 designed units, thus leading to more diligent infection and prevention control, including careful PPE practices. In addition, 5 studies reported increased risk of HCWs acquiring COVID -19 infection in other acute care settings. Of note, Cooper et al. (2020), Eyre et al. (2020), Galan et al. (2020), and Olanyanju et al. (2020) found that HCWs in the emergency department (ED) (OR ranging (OR CI: 1.07 -2.16] to 2.07 [95% CI: 1.31- 3.25]) had statistically significant higher odds of acquiring COVID -19 infection relative to the study -specific reference groups. In the cross -sectional study conducted by Piapan et al. (2020) in a north- eastern province of Italy, the majority of HCWs infected with COVID -19 worked in medical wards, with s ignificantly higher odds of infection among HCWs PPE Guidelines 51 in geriatric and infectious diseases (OR: 67.9, 95% CI: 5.6- 16.5) (Piapan et al., 2020). It is important to note, however, the Piapan et al. (2020) article w as characterized as a \"Practice Points\" piece; thus, methodological details of the study were not included and could not be critically evaluated. Olanyanju et al. (2020) also found that in their single- centre cross -sectional study, HCWs in obstetrics and g ynecology showed significantly 95% CI: 2.028- 183.412) compared to those working in chemical pathology (the reference group). In a prospective cohort from 4 teaching hospitals, Eyre et al. (2020) observed increased odds of COVID -19 infection among HCWs in orthopaedics, commented that because so few COVID -19 patients were admitted to these areas, this association reflected staff -based outbreaks in these specialties. For acute medical areas outside of COVID -19 cohort wards, Eyre et al., (2020) noted that \"level -1\" PPE precautions (i.e., fluid resistant surgical mask, gloves, apron, and optional eye protection) were only recommended for HCWs in contact with patients with confirmed or s ymptoms suggestive of COVID -19. The authors suspect this may have led to potential exposure by asymptomatic or pauci -symptomatic COVID -19 positive patients, resulting in greater odds of HCW infection in several acute medical wards (Eyre et al., 2020). None of the other studies provided sufficient details on PPE practices as they relate to increased risk or associations in the care areas evaluated. Areas of care associated with decreased risk of COVID -19 infection among HCWs Four studies reported that HCWs working in the intensive care unit (ICU) were significantly less likely to be positive for COVID -19 (Baxendale et al., 2020; Firew et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020; Shields et al., 2020). Among those, two large cross -sectio nal studies reported adjusted ORs for COVID -19 infection among critical care HCWs ranging 0.28 (95% CI 0.09- 0.78) (Shields et al., 2020) to 0.41 (95% CI: 0.27- 0.6) (Martin et al., 2020) compared to HCWs in other acute care settings. Shields et al., (2020) suggested that the reasons underlying these findings are like multi- faceted; however, authors from both studies hypothesized that enhanced PPE requirements in the ICU setting (e.g., continuous use of respirators versus face masks, as in other acute settings) likely contributed to the decrease in risk among HCWs in the ICU (Martin et al., 2020; Shields et al., 2020). Firew et al. (2020) conducted a national cross -sectional survey of HCWs in the United States in May 2020 and found that HCWs in the ICU were ab out 27% less likely (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.73, 95% to have COVID -19 compared to HCWs in the ED. The authors discussed how differences in environmental factors between ED (e.g., crowding and physical spacing of patients) compared to other acute care settings, including the ICU, may account for the observed findings (Firew et al., 2020). Baxendale et al. (2020) also reported that staff working with ICU patients were significantly less likely to acquire COVID -19 infection in comparison to staff in non- patient facing roles (= - 1.06, SE=0.44, Z= -2.39, p=0.017). Strict adherence to PPE guidelines (details not specified in the article) among critical care HCWs was thought to account for this difference (Baxendale et al., 2020). Interestingly, one case- control study comprised of participants randomly drawn from a India- wide COVID -19 testing data portal (Chatterjee et al., 2020), identified no statistically significant difference in COVID -19 infection among HCWs working in ICUs with COVID -19 positive or suspected patients (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.88- 2.1) compared to HCWs that were not (p=0.17) (Chatterjee et al., 2020). No association between area of care and COVID -19 infection among HCWs Lastly, two of the included studies found that the clinical areas where HCWs worked were not associated with HCW COVID- 19 infections (Algado- Selles et al., 2020; Moscola et al., 2020). Algado- Selles et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study comprised of HCWs in a tertiary hospital and 12 primary healthcare centres and found similar odds of COVID -19 diagnosis among HCWs in the ED, pediatric areas, critical care units, adult medical wards, primary health care and non- COVID -19 wards. Further, Moscola et al., (2020) identified no difference in the risk of testing p ositive for COVID -19 among HCWs in the ED, ICU, hospital units, and other locations from a cross -sectional survey administered in the New York state. Evidence from the Alberta Health Services Healthcare Worker Testing Dashboard Data from the Alberta Heal th Services Healthcare Worker Testing Dashboard from wave 1 of the COVID -19 pandemic in Alberta (and covering dates from March 5 - August 31, 2020) shows that most infections amongst healthcare workers were acquired outside of the workplace. SARS -CoV-2 infection affected healthcare workers PPE Guidelines 52 across a wide range of staffing categories and from a variety of care settings. These community acquired infections accounted for roughly 75- 80% of all of the healthcare worker infections seen in wave 1 within AHS, Covena nt Health, and Alberta Precision Laboratories. Of those within AHS specifically who were identified as having had a workplace related source for their infection (occupationally acquired infections), the majority (97%) were amongst frontline clinical staff . There were 62 cases of COVID -19 in AHS healthcare workers were deemed to have been occupationally acquired and 32 cases of COVID -19 in AHS healthcare workers were of indeterminate cause. Staffing categories: Of the 62 cases that were confirmed as occupationally acquired, the majority were amongst registered nurses (n = 22), healthcare aides (n =15), and licensed practical nurses (n = 11). In addition, there were unit clerks (n = 4), physicians (n = 3), and less than three each of paramedics, social wor kers, recreational therapists, and administrative support or leaders. Care locations: Occupationally acquired infections linked to outbreaks in roughly 70- 80% of cases. Acute care outbreaks occurred on the following unit types within AHS settings during wave 1: Psychiatry Obstetrics/labour and delivery COVID -19 ward Post-operative ward Transition ward (awaiting long term care)/general medicine ward Rural hospital inpatient medical ward There were no occupationally acquired infections in emer gency departments or intensive care units or surgical suites. Evolving Evidence Question 1: COVID -19 has particularly affected long- term care residents disproportionately during the pandemic. The literature related to risk factors (including community transmission) associated with transmission in these facilities reflects this. Most studies ident ified in this rapid review identified studies evaluating the role of community transmission in long- term care outbreaks. The NCCMT identified three systematic review protocols in PROSPERO, which will explore characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID -19 outbreaks and cases in long-term care. With the increasing community prevalence observed across jurisdictions, during this second wave of the pandemic, more hospital outbreaks are being reported. However, up until now, there have been few studies or reports describing the characteristics of these outbreaks, routes of transmission among nosocomial cases, and the role that community prevalence has on increasing COVID -19 burden and transmission within hospitals. We anticipate that the literature over the coming months will begin to address this gap. Question 2: Based on the large number of guidelines, guidance documents, reports, and frameworks identified from both Canadian and international jurisdictions, there already exists a substantial amount of guidance for what PPE is required for HCWs treating acute care patients and LTC residents during the COVID -19 pandemic. However, given the evolving nature of the pandemic and increasing incidence and prevalence, updated guidelines for PPE requirements \u2014par ticular with regards to forms of continuous PPE (beyond masking) \u2014may develop. Alternatively, existing guidelines may evolve to explicitly consider jurisdictional challenges of PPE shortages as well. Question 3: A significant number of primary studies and systematic reviews and meta- analyses have been reported looking at the efficacy and effectiveness of face masks and respirators; however very little evidence pertaining to face shields, and different levels of PPE. Most studies were conducted prior to the COVID -19 pandemic and given the imprecision and indirectness of the studies, firm conclusions and generalization of findings to the current COVID -19 pandemic are difficult. Currently, there are two RCTs during COVID -19 that plan PPE Guidelines 53 to recruit a total of 72,0 00 people. One will evaluate medical/surgical masks and the other cloth masks. In one of these trials, Canada is leading in recruitment of participants. Another study is ongoing and will recruit 576 people to compare N95/P2 respirators with medical surgica l masks for healthcare workers during COVID -19. Finally, there are two ongoing studies of handwashing interventions in 395 children outside of COVID -19. Despite these ongoing studies, it will be particularly important to evaluate the role and impact of continuous masking, with or without the use of additional PPE (e.g. face shields). Question 4: This rapid review identified extensive evidence of the physical discomfort that results from wearing PPE, especially N95 masks, for long periods of time. However, the no evidence was identified that described the effect of continuous PPE or full PPE mandates on healthcare worker behaviours, adherence or complacency. It is unclear if the effects of PPE mandates implemented during COVID -19 will have a lasting effect on HCW perception of PPE after the pandemic has subsided. Consideration should be given to the risks of not implementing higher -level PPE in non -COVID units. Although outside the scope of this review, numerous excluded studies described an increase in staff anxiety when they felt the recommended PPE was inadequate to protect them against disease transmission. If higher -level PPE is implemented as standard, it may be prudent to do periodic assessments of staff per ception of PPE adequacy to mitigate stress rel ated to personal safety concerns. Based on personal communication (J Conly), a RCT by Loeb et al.(McMaster University) evaluating medical masks compared to N95s during the COVID -19 pandemic is 40% enrolled and an independent safety monitoring group has see n NO safety risks to date. Question 5: With the evolving nature of the COVID -19 pandemic itself, there is concomitant evolving evidence concerning the risk factors associated with HCWs infection, including the care areas wherein HCWs may be \u2014if at all\u2014at r isk of acquiring COVID -19. One of the secondary literature sources that was hand- searched for this work (Chou et al., 2020) was described as a living rapid review (originally published on May 5, 2020) and identified 3 studies that examined various risk fac tors for acquiring COVID -19 among HCWs. Since that date, 5 updates of the living rapid review were completed (most recent completed October 20, 2020), and a total of 49 additional studies concerning potential risk factors for COVID -19 infection among HCWs were identified. Further iterations of this living rapid review would be worth reviewing to examine for potentially relevant articles to this current report.

Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes Abad, Fearday & Safdar, 2010 Systematic review Hospitalized patients (n= 40 included studies) Isolation precautions for any type of infection - Among the studies that focused on the psychological impact of isolation, the majority showed a negative impact on patient psychology and behaviour, including higher scores for depression and anxiety, higher anger -hostility scores, and reports of fear and loneliness. - Evidence regarding the amount of care provided to patients in isolation is mixed - three studies found that patients in isolation receive less car e (fewer examinations, fewer patient encounters, less likely to enter patient rooms); three studies found no difference in the care provided to patients on isolation precautions - Quality of care findings may have limited generalizability to pandemic isolation units Arasli et al., 2020 Critical content analysis of social media Nurses \"PPE\" - The perceived absence of PPE was a factor in nurses' distress and worries regarding working during pandemics - PPE linked to theme of \"Exhaustion\" - skin reactions from the gloves, gowns, or face shields that were also worn by nurses for long hours during the existing pandemic discouraged nurses from using them - The excessive utilization of PPE will have an extra effect on stock deficiencies. Atay & Cura, 2020 Cross-sectional survey Nurses in Turkey (n=307) \"PPE\" - N95 masks (66.3% of nurses), surgical masks (77.8% of nurses), gloves (85.3% of nurses), goggles or face shields (70.0% of nurses), and overalls/gowns (74.8% of nurses) were most frequently worn for more than 4 hours - Compared to shorter (4 hours or less) wear time, wearing an N95 mask continuously for more than 4 hours significantly increased the odds of developing redness of the cheeks (OR 1.6 times; 95% [CI], 1.03- 2.18; P < 2.18; 95% CI, 1.39- 3.46; P < .05), redness of the bridge of the nose (OR 2.02, 95% CI, 1.36- 3.04; P < .05), and redness of ear flaps (OR 3.44; 95% CI, 1.14- 0.34; P < .05) PPE Guidelines 54 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - The odds of developing dry mouth were significantly higher when wearing a surgical mask for more than 4 hours (OR 1.47 times; 95% CI, 1.01- 2.13; P < .05). - Compared to shorter wear times, wearing gloves for more than 4 hours increased the odds of dry hands (OR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.05- 5.47; 95% CI, 1.02- 2.16; P < .05) - odds of reporting a headache were significantly higher when goggles or a face shield were worn for > 4 hours (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 0.99- 2.14; P < .05) - odds of sweating when wearing overalls or a gown (OR 2.02; 95% CI, 1.41 -3.83; P < .05) Bandaru et al., 2020 Non-clinical study Healthcare workers in India (n=20) N95 mask and face shield - There was a statistically significant increase in speech reception threshold and a decrease in speech discrimination scores with the use of PPE; the p - values obtained for both parameters were less than 0.0001 on paired t -test. - There were no statistical ly significant differences in the changes in speech reception threshold and speech discrimination score values obtained with and without using PPE when comparing between different age groups (20- 40 years vs 41-60 years), sex, and occupation - Changes in s peech perception may have implications for commun ication Berry et al., 2020 Systematic review Adult medical/surgical ward patients (n= 6 included studies) Isolation precautions - No significant difference in in -hospital cardiac arrest between isolated and non-isolated patients (low certainty) - No significant difference in ICU admissions between isolated and non- isolated patients (low certainty) - No significant difference in pressure injuries (low certainty) - Inconclusive evidence of an increase in falls injury in isolated patients compared to non- isolated patients (low certainty) - No significant difference in venous thromboembolism (low certainty) PPE Guidelines 55 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Balance of evidence suggests no significant difference in medication- related adverse events (very low cer tainty) - No difference in delirium (very low certainty) - Evidence is mixed for both inpatient death and hospital length of stay Bothra et al., 2020 Preliminary report Healthcare workers and members of the public in India (n= 14) Ear-loop style face masks All 14 diagnosed with retroauricular dermatitis due to ear loops on face masks - N95 masks were the most commonly used mask in 35.7% of patients, having thermoelastic polymer straps. Sweat dermatitis was observed due to associated headgear use or usi ng nylon cloth masks. - Latex was the commonest strap material resulting in dermatoses in 4(28.5%) patients - Friction caused by the strap, trapping of sweat, use of disinfectant to reuse masks, application of dyes to colour homemade masks are frequent ca uses of dermatitis using ear loop face masks Unclear generalizability to Alberta due to mask styles in use in AHS Carbon, 2020 Non-clinical experimental study Volunteers (n= 36) Surgical mask - Presenting a mask on faces showed a clear performance drop in reading emotions in faces. With the exception of fearful and neutral faces, for which ceiling performance effects were observed, all emotional states were harder to read in faces with masks. - reading the emotional status of elderly faces was more difficult than reading it from middle- aged or young faces; this effect was pronounced when faces were shown with masks - for face sex , in contrast, we only found an effect for the accuracy of emotion reading. - Confidence in assessing emotions was decreased when viewing faces with masks - All emotional states with the exception of fearful were repeatedly confused with a neutral state. - Sad was often confused with disgusted and neutral , and angry was confused with disgusted , neutral , and sad. Experimental study; decrease in emotional assessment m ay affect clinical care and patient perception of care PPE Guidelines 56 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Most drastically was the misinterpretation of disgusted as angry , which showed up in nearly 38% of the cases, although such a confusion did only happen in 2% of the cases where no face mask was used. Catalano et al., 2003 Case -control observational study Patients admitted to infectious disease units; isolation (n= 27), control (n= 24) Isolation for antibiotic resistant infection; control patients were not isolated - Depression (HAM -D): The control group's score decreased from 8.46 to 6.00 after 1 week of hospitalization, and the isolation group's score increased from 8.42 to 10.73. The ANCOVA showed this time -by-group interaction to be significant (P < 0.001) - Anxiety (HAM -A): The control group's score decreased from 8.37 to 4.71 after 1 week of hospitalization, and the isolation group's score increased from 8.00 to 11.11. The ANCOVA showed this time -by-group interaction to be significant ( P < 0.001) - Findings may not be generalizable due to small sample size and short time frame Chou et al., 2020 Living systematic review HCWs and persons in the community (n= 39 included studies) Interventions were disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators, surgical masks, and cloth masks - Reporting of harms in the RCTs was suboptimal but did not indicate serious harms with mask use - the most common adverse events were discomfort, breathing difficulties, and skin events. - Evidence is mixed regarding the risk of adverse events for N95 or surgical mask - No additional studies identified in updates Ciris Yildiz, Ulasli Kaban & Tanriverdi, 2020 Descriptive study (survey) workers in Turkey (n= 553) \"Personal protective equipment\" (non- specific) - A total of 124 participants reported that the frequency of mask use decreases due to its discomfort, while 209 participants indicated that they do not prefer to use protective glasses due to its discomfort. - there was a significant positive correlation bet ween the number of physical complaints and the subscale scores of participants' attitudes related to personal protective equipment (r=0.21, p=0.001 for comfort and difficulty subscale, and r = 0.13, p=0.001 for accessibility). - 70.2% of them report ed that using protective glasses cause difficulty in using their daily eyewear - High risk of sampling bias PPE Guidelines 57 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Pain in the face, redness, sores (around the eyes, ears, and nose) and dryness on the throat due to dehydration were the other most frequently reported physical complaints rel ated to the use of personal protective equipment in healthcare professionals (mostly associated with N95 masks) Cohen et al., 2008 Prospective cohort study Children admitted to private rooms in pediatric service in Toronto (n= 24 isolated, 41 nonisolated) Isolation precautions - Five patients were isolated with droplet precautions, 5 with contact precautions, and 1 with airborne precautions. Eleven isolated patients were placed under a combination of contact and droplet precaut ions, and 2 patients were isolated for a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions - The quantity of care was similar in both groups in terms of time spent in the room, organ systems examined, vital signs recorded, GRASP scores, and RIW. Th e groups differed in the length of stay, which was 4.5 days for isolated patients versus 2.0 days for non-isolated patients (P .014). - There was no difference between the 2 groups in the average rating per item on the PFSQ (P .209) or in the number of safety or incident reports completed (P .109) - No significant difference in terms of time spent in the room by the attending physician or number of organ systems examined in isolated compared with non-isolated patients. - Findngs may not apply to adult care or pandemic setting Corley, Hammond & Fraser, 2009 Phenomenological study Australian nurses during H1N1 pandemic influenza (n= 34) n/a - Experiences with PPE - A perceived lack of firm recommendations and guidelines regarding specifically what PPE was required created an element of confusion amongst the staff caring for these patients. Staff described feeling unsure regarding what PPE was required. - As guidelines changed, there was perception that the supplies of PPE were running low within the unit and this created an environment which made staff question whether they would remain adequately protected - Small sample from Australia - may have limited generalizability to Alberta PPE Guidelines 58 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - One bedside nursing staff member stated ' 'as supplies ran out the 'rules' changed and surgical masks and plastic aprons were [considered] effective. It made me worried that the only reason it was changed was due to stock shortage and that perhaps we weren't as protected''. - ''our biggest fear was running out of things, like your masks and gowns...I think there was a time when they thought we were going to run out and resort to substandard masks '' - Generally, the wearing of PPE was tolerated by most staff as it was deemed a necessary measure in providing protection to them - ''using PPE was really good''. However, the physical discomfort of PPE was a key theme - ''It was hard working in a gown and mask (very hot) and not being able to go out for a drink whenever as the unit was very busy. I found I was dehydrated with a headache at the end of all my shifts'' and ''very uncomfortable and very injurious... I had skin peeled off here [points to nares]'' - The application and removal of PPE was considered to be extremely time consuming for staff, particularly when requiring supplies or performing duties outside the isolated unit - Communication was challengi ng with PPE - Another issue of concern to many of the respondents was the amount of waste generated by the disposal of PPE and the extra workload and stress that this put on the wardspersons who are responsible for the cleaning and the removal of waste from the unit Daugherty et al., 2009 Cross -sectional survey ICU Healthcare workers in USA during Influenza season (n= 292) \"PPE\" - Respondents who believed that adherence posed an inconvenience to their work routine were less likely to report high levels of adherence (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22- 0.80) - Belief that PPE interferes with quality of care was not associated with reduced adherence PPE Guidelines 59 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes Day et al., 2012 Retrospective cohort study Nonpyschiatric adult patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 2007 through 2009 (n= 60151) Contact precautions (Isolation + full PPE) - Fifteen percent of admissions were under contact precautions (9,684/60,151). Of these 9,684 patients, 42% were placed under contact precautions after admission (4,032/9,684), and 58% (5,652/9,684) were placed under contact precautions at admission - Patients moved to contact precautions during their stay were older (54.4 vs 50.8 years; P < .01), had longer lengths of stay in the hospital (median, 11.7 vs 5.1 days; P < .01), were more likely to transfer to an ICU (42.6% vs 16.2%; P < .01), and were more likely to die during their stay (10.0% vs 4.2%; P < .01) than patients who were placed under contact precautions at admission. - The prevalence of delirium in patients under contact precautions was 16.1% (1,562/9,684), compared with 7.6% (3,785/50,467) in patients not under contact precautions. - Contact precautions were significantly associ ated with delirium (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.24- 1.51]) - Patients placed under contact precautions after being newly identified as colonized or infected with an MDR bacterium were 1.75 times more likely to experience delirium than patients not under contact precautions (OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.60 -1.92]; P < .01). - Unclear effect of PPE on delirium Farronato et al., 2020 Scoping review and cross- sectional survey Italian dental professionals (n= 256); five included studies FFP2 (N95) respirators - Headaches as one of the main outcomes related to FFP2 wear, but not correlated to the hours spent wearing a respirator. Pressure and traction from mask straps are likely to be concurrent in the pathogenesis of those headaches, along with hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and stress from the current pandemic situation and its consequent workload. - Another significant side effect and relevant outcome in our survey was breathing difficulties, at least moderate for 63.5% of our sample, but not correlated with the hours spent wearing N95 /FFP2 respirators. - The presence of concentration problems, exertion, breathing difficulties, and headaches resulted in a PPE Guidelines 60 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes moderate impaired working ability for 85.5% of our sample. Impaired working ability was strongly correlated to headaches ( = 0.212, p < 0.01), breathing difficulties ( = 0.566, p < 0.01), concentration problems ( = 0.748, p < 0.01), and exertion ( = 0.620, p < 0.01). Foo et al., 2006 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in the designated SARS hospital in Singapore (n= 340) - N95 masks for an average duration of 8 hr a day and over a mean period of 8.4 months. - Rubber gloves for an average duration of 6.2 hr over a mean period of 9.4 months - gowns used were of the disposable variety and were worn for an average duration of 6. 2 hr over a mean period of 8.8 months. - No skin reactions associated with surgical or paper masks - 109 (35.5%) of the 307 staff who used masks regularly reported adverse skin reactions, which included acne (59.6%), facial itch (51.4%), and rash (35.8%) - 64 (21.4%) of the 299 staff who used gloves regularly reported adverse skin reactions, which included dry skin (73.4%), itch (56.3%), rash (37.5%), and wheals (6.3%) - 4 (1.6%) of the 258 staff who wore gowns regularly reported adverse skin reactions - Potential recall and response bias - Unclear if findings are generalizable to Alberta Galehdar et al., 2020 Qualitative study Nurses in Iran (n = 20) n/a - sources of psychological stress - Wearing protective clothes is an unpleasant feeling which has to be experienced by the nurses during each shift - Wearing protective clothes, restrictions in mobility, eating, and drinking, as well as being unknown to others can affect nurses' mood and lead to extreme fatigue - Nurses' identity is concealed by wearing protective equipment, which impairs the understanding of the body image and self -esteem - Inability to relieve discomfort affects mood - Inability to share identity with patients while wearing PPE - Unclear if generalizable to Alberta Gasink et al., 2008 Cross -sectional survey Patients in general medical and surgical wards in Pennsylvania (n= 43 isolated, 43 non- isolated)) Contact isolation - Non-isolated patients gave a median hospital rating of 8 (IQR 7- 10) while isolated patients gave a median hospital rating of 9 (IQR 8- 10) (p=0.02) on a scale of 1-10 - CAHPS Hospital Survey - Unclear if results are generalizable to pandemic setting PPE Guidelines 61 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Isolated patients and non -isolated patients did not differ with respect to whether they would recommend the hospital to a friend - 95% of isolated patients understood that isolation was for their benefit and the benefit of others - 62% of participants felt that isolation improved their care, while 8% felt that isolation worsened the care they received from healthcare providers Giannaccare et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Medical students in Italy (n= 107) \"face mask\" - Eleven subjects (10.3%) described appearance or worsening of ocular discomfort symptoms, and 21 (19.6%) reported the need for daily use of tear substi tutes. - The mean score of Ocular Surface Disease Index was 21, and 61 subjects (57%) scored 15 (pathological values) Potential risk of sampling bias and response bias Gupta, Singh & Gupta, 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in India (n= 100) Surgical mask, N95 mask or clot h mask for 4 -12 hours per day (66% of participants) - 62% indicated fogging of spectacles which hindered their vision. - 56% expressed that mask was very uncomfortable due to the pain caused by elastic bands. - 55% reported suffocation and difficult and heavy breathing, especially while climbing stairs. - 49% reported excessive sweating inside the masked area of the face. - 44% expressed reduced quality and volume of speech. - 43% conveyed development of skin marks and scarring due to pressure. - 40% reported pain and redness due to friction. - 28% revealed a false sense of security while wearing the mask. - 19% reported significant ear discomfort due to constant pull from mask - 16% pointed out increased incidence of furunculosis on face. -14% manifested increased incidence of eyes irritation and claustrophobia - May have limited generalizability to Alberta due to cultural differences and differences in PPE supply PPE Guidelines 62 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - 4% indicated increased sense of embarrassment due to use of face mask Hampton et al., 2020 Simulation study Representatives from hospital ENT department (n=5) \"PPE\" (not described) - PPE significantly affected speech processing in simulated operating theatre settings but not in simulated office, emergency department, or intensive care settings. - Bamford- Kowal -Bench sentence test scores were significantly lower for subjects wearing PPE (median score = 58) compared to those without PPE (median score = 92) in an operating theatre simulated environment (Z = 2.02, p = 0.04) - Increasing voice volume whilst wearing PPE significantly increased Bamford- Kowal -Bench sentence test scores (median score = 86) compared to normal speech volume when wearing PPE (median score = 58; Z = 2.03, p = 0.04) - Louder background environments, such as an operating theatre setting, produced the most pronounced (statistically significant) effect on speech comprehension Hines et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey and qualitative study Healthcare workers in the United States (Maryland) (n= 1152) Respirators - N95 mask, elastomeric respirator, or PAPR - HCWs recognized that while mask use did not create conflict with patients or family members, it limited the ability to be seen smiling, and they speculated that a transparent mask might be better - Most respondents did not find that use of respirators and PPE impacted their ability to perform patient care (62%) or that it was inconvenient (51%) - If respirator use interfered with their abil ity to perform care, it would influence their compliance with respirator use - More PAPR users (27%) than N95 (17%) and elastomeric (16%) users agreed that respirator use interferes with patient care. Risk of response bias Houghton et al., 2020 Systematic review Healthcare workers (n= 20 included studies) n/a - ability to adhere to IPC guidelines - Both information on, and rationale for IPC guidance, was seen as important, but healthcare workers reported that they needed support to source PPE Guidelines 63 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes appropriate evidence for their own knowledge and practice with respect to PPE - Ill-fitting PPE or PPE perceived to be ineffective at stopping transmission may impact adherence to PPE guidelines - Wearing facemasks could be seen as creating a barrier between the healt hcare worker and patients, which could make patients feel uncomfortable, particularly children who may become frightened. - Facemask/respirator use is associated with putting 'barriers up' between themselves and their patients and perceived a negative impact on their relationships with patients and ability to provide care. - Social norms and culture of wearing PPE improves adherence - if all staff members are wearing PPE, there is improved attention to guidelines - Substantial physical discomfort of wearing PPE is believed to act as a barrier to adherence. These discomforts included difficulty in donning multiple PPE; difficulty in breathing and feelings of suffocation; exhaustion and fatigue; sweating, dizziness, dehydration and irritation; backache; and glasses fogging up - Continuous / Full PPE may prevent staff from fully utilizing their breaks or properly caring for their own needs (toileting, hydrating, eating) to mitigate the inconvenience of donning and doffing Hu et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey (purposive sampling) Healthcare workers in China (n= 61) N95 masks, latex gloves, protective clothing - N95 mask: 58 (95.1%) reported adverse reactions, including nasal bridge scarring (68.9%), facial itching (27.9%), skin damage (26.2%), dry skin ( 24.6%), and rash (16.4%) - All people with skin reactions developed these reactions after using the N95 mask for 12 hours a day over an average of 3.5 months - HCWs using surgical masks, cloth masks, and paper masks did not report any adverse skin reaction s PPE Guidelines 64 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Latex gloves: 54 (88.5%) reported adverse skin reactions, including dry skin (55.7%), itching (31.2%), rash (23.0%), and chapped skin (21.3%) - For an average of 3.5 months, latex gloves were used for an average of 10 hours. No one reported that the us e of plastic gloves and cloth gloves can cause adverse skin reactions - Protective clothing: 37 (60.7%) reported adverse skin reactions, including dry skin (36.1%), itching (34.4%), rash (11.5%), and wheals (3.28%). - The incidence of adverse skin reactions to the N95 mask was 95.1%, that to latex gloves was 88.5%, and that to protective clothing was 60.7%. Jesus, Dias & Figueiredo, 2019 Qualitative study Hospital patients in Brazil (n=19) Airborne or isolation precautions - Positive perceptions were beca use individual rooms provide more privacy and comfort for these interviewees. The possibility of being in a private room and with companion was pointed out as a bonus of being hospitalized under precautions. - There was also the sense of protection offered by the precaution implemented - The unfavorable perceptions emerged were feelings of loneliness, anguish, sadness, and despair for being in a small room, with restraint of exits - stigma of isolation is observed as a result of being separated from other p atients. - Unclear if generalizable to pandemic setting Jiang et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Medical staff in China (n= 4308) Continuous (8 -12 hrs) personal protective equipment (PPE), including protective masks, goggles, face shield, and protective gowns. - 1,396 respondents (32.4%) and 2,910 respondents (67.6%) wore grade 3 and grade 2 PPE, respectively. The average daily wear time was 7.7\u00b12.9h, with 14.3% (615 respondents) and 85.7% (3,691 respondents) daily wear time 4 and >4h, respectively - device- related pressure injury (DRPI), moisture- associated skin damage (MASD) and skin tears (ST) - The overall prevalence was 42.8% (95% CI 41.30 - 44.30), and the prevalence -2.40) - High risk of sampling bias, response bias, recall bias due to online methodology PPE Guidelines 65 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - 386 respondents (27.4%) had 2 or more types of injuries (coinjuries), and 1,080 respondents (76.8%) had 2 or more anatomical part injuries (multiple site injuries) - Prevalence of skin injury was higher in people wearing grade 3 PPE than grade 2 PPE (88.5% vs. 21.0%, p<0.001), in people with daily wearing time >4h than in people with daily wearing time 4h (47.3% vs. 18.7%, p<0.001) - Mulitvariate logistic regression that sweating (95% CI for [OR] 87.52- 163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR 1.61- 3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11 -2.13), and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR 1.08 -2.01) were associated with skin injuries Kang et al., 2018 Qualitative study Nurses in Korea during MERS (n= 27)` n/a - \"It's so sweaty and hard to breathe with it. It is hard to work and see clearly while wearing it (protective measures) and I feel dizzy when wearing it for long hours.\" - \"(We were) sweating, (find it) hard to breathe; it was difficult to work wearing personal protective equipment.\" - Nurses from one hospital stated that they stayed in the isolation room for a maximum of 2 hours while wearing their PAPR and then came out; they stayed in the anteroom (a room in front of the negative pressure isolation room) and went back into the isolation room when needed - Wearing the PAPR made them difficult to communicate with patients and other nurses in isolation anterooms. They said that it was not easy to communicate with patients on a respirator while wearing PPE as noise from the respirator or other machines and face shields of their PAPR impeded communication - Unclear if PAPR use limits generalizability to Alberta PPE Guidelines 66 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes Karki, Leder & Cheng, 2013 Retrospective cohort study Patients with VRE admitted to Alfred hospital in Australia (n= 246) Contact precautions - 109 patients had at least 1 formal complaint/adverse incident; 186 incidents were reported before initiation of CPs and 214 after commencement of CPs. - During the study period, the mortality among patients was 29% (72/246). - The median lengths of stay per admission before and after the initiation of CPs were 9 (IQR, 4 -20) and 8 (IQR, 4 -16) days, respectively. - A significantly higher rate of medication administration errors was observed following the implementation of CPs (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01 -2.41) The IRR was confidence interval [CI], 1.16- 11.17); however, the pressure injuries was 1.91 (95% CI, 0.82- 4.77) and not statistically significant - For other adverse outcomes reported, including uncomplicated falls, drug prescription and pharmacy - related errors, diagnosis -related errors, clinical management errors, and patient support failures, no statistically significant differences were found - A significantly higher risk of potentially preventable non-pressure- related injuries (including falls from bed, skin tears, or self -injuries) and of medication administration errors in patients under CPs and a nonsignificant increase in pressure injuries - Study poorly described; low quality article - Included in Berry et al., 2020 Khan, Khakoo & Hobbs, 2006 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in United States (West Virginia) (n=368) Contact isolation precautions - Physicians perceived care of contact isolation patients as being more prone to adverse effects, compared with nursing staff (63% versus 32%; P = .0001) - Nursing staff in general disagreed with there being delays in medication delivery to contact isolation patients; 88%, versus 64% of physicians ( P = .0006) - Physicians reported being less likely to examine patients who were in contact isolation when compared with nurses (59% versus 4%; P = .0001). - Potential for r esponse bias - Unclear if findings from non-pandemic times apply to COVID -19 PPE Guidelines 67 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Attending physic ians were less likely to examine patients in contact isolation (69%) compared with resident physicians (58%; P = .0001) - Overall 96% of the nurses, compared with 40% of respondents from the physician group, reported being less likely to examine patients i n contact isolation ( P = .0001) - The HCWs responsible for more than 3 patients in contact isolation at a time and those with an increasing number of total patients also tended to agree with being less likely to examine their patients (P = .0001) - As the total number of patients and those in contact isolation under the daily care of the HCW increased, more respondents perceived an inability to efficiently respond to the needs of contact isolation patients ( P = .005 and .01, respectively). Khoo et al., 2005 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in Singapore during SARS (n= 51) Powered air -purifying respirator (PAPR) - The majority of respondents who used both the 3M and Stryker PAPR found it to be at least tolerable with respect to comfort - The majority (98% and 95% for the 3M and Stryker PAPR, respectively) found the level of visual impairment attributable to the PAPR to be at least acceptable - A total of 14% of respondents found the hearing impairment when using the 3M PAPR to be significant or unacceptable, while it was significant for only 5% when using the Stryker PAPR. Concomittant use of the N95 mask impacted vocal volume and ability to speak - About tw othirds of respondents agreed (22%) or strongly agreed (42%) that they looked frightening to their patients whenever they used the PAPR. - Potential risk of selection and response bias - Unclear generalizability to Alberta since routine PPE does not inclu de PAPR Klimek et al., 2020 Descriptive study Healthcare workers (n=17); other patients (n= 29) FFP2 (N95) respirators - of as sneezing, itching, nasal blockage, and/or watery nasal discharge after wearing their FFP for a minimum of 2 hours or longer PPE Guidelines 68 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Endoscopic signs of irritation and edema with mucosal swelling and watery secretions were mainly found in the area of the inferior and middle turbinates; irritation subsided after 3 days of mask absence - After wearing FFP2 respirators for a minimum of 3 hours, a mean number of 3.8 \u00b1 7.9 (mean \u00b1 SD) polypropylene fibres were found in nasal lavage fluid per nasal side with a maximum of n = 47 fibres in the lavage fluid of one patient, while the number decreased to 0.4 \u00b1 0.7 (m ean \u00b1 SD) after 3 mask -free days ( p < 0.01) Kuo et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in Taiwan (n=752) n/a (PPE experience) - Mean total score on perceived work stress was 47.7\u00b116.8, representing moderate stress. - The main stressor for the hospital staff was discomfort caused by protective equipment - Nurses' stress could be attributed more to their fear of social isolation, discomfort due to protective equipment, and burden of patient care. In contrast, medical technicians had a hig her degree of stress related to difficulties and anxieties related to infection control. - Stress caused by PPE discomfort has implications for psychological safety and workplace morale - Risk of response bias (web survey) - May have limited generalizabili ty Lau, Majumdar & McAlister, 2016 Prospective cohort study Patients admitted to Internal Medicine in Alberta (n= 495) Contact, droplet, or airborne precautions (\"isolated\") - Seventy -five (18%) patients were isolated during their admission (contact precautions n = 46 (9%), respiratory precautions n = 29 (7%)) - Isolated patients were more likely to be unemployed, less likely to be retired, and more likely to identify as First Nations compared to non- isolated patients - Length of stay, depression, anxiety, health -related quality of life, and satisfaction scores were similar at discharge - At 30 days, 81 (16%) patients had been readmitted, 13 (3%) had died, and 131 (26%) had attended the ED on one or more occasions. - The overall 30- day rate of readmission or death was 17% ( n = 85), and it was not different between isolated and non -isolated patients - Unclear if findings will be applicable to pandemic setting PPE Guidelines 69 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Similar 30 -day rates were also observed among isolated and non- isolated patients for readmission (aOR 1.19, CI 0.74- 10.46), and one or more ED visits post - discharge (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 0.57 -1.84). Lawrence et al., 2020 Pre-clinical PPE assessment Otologists (n=20) 1) a full face respirator (Promask; 3M Scott, Munroe, NC; n = 5 otologists) 2) a modified full face snorkel mask11 (n = 10 otologists) 3) and the ensemble of a half face mask (filtering facepiece [FFP]3 or FFP2) and safety goggles or spoggles (n = 5 otologists) - Communication was most degraded using the full face snorkel mask, with participants' performance around 50% correct across all conditions and listener positions. - On average, communication scores for the half face mask (FFP2 or FFP3) were superior to both of the fullface mask options. - no concerning changes were observed in heart rate, O2 saturations, or ETCO 2 levels across all participants for all mask t ypes. - Most participants rated the comfort associated with the half face (FFP3 or FFP2) mask as good, a higher proportion than either of the full face masks - The safety spoggles had a negligible effect upon the visual field (radius = 96%). The safety gog gles, full face snorkel mask, and full face respirator all caused a substantial reduction of the radius of the visual field to 55%, 40%, and 18%, respectively - Most participants only tolerated wearing the full face snorkel mask for less than 60minutes and, again, the majority also stated that they would not personally use it for CI surgery. - Restriction of the visual field and a lack of binocular vision were major concerns for all of these PPE options. Lee et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare professionals from India and Singapore (n = 165) Liquid impermeable gowns, gloves, goggles, surgical caps, and masks - Agreement with the following statements, but more strongly in Singapore than in India: 1. \"Heat stress can degrade productivity\" 2. \"Heat stress can degrade judgment\" 3. \"Heat stress can negatively affect me psychologically\" 4. \"Heat stress can negatively affect emotions\" - Limited generalizabili ty to Alberta because of climate differences - Risk of response bias PPE Guidelines 70 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Respondents suggested that they avoid taking breaks and avoid hydration to preserve their PPE and avoid the inconven ience of the donning/doffing procedures - Thermal stress: Symptoms such as thirst ( n = 144, 87%), excessive sweating ( n = 145, 88%), exhaustion (n = 128, 78%), and wanting to go to comfort zones (n = 136, 84%) were highly reported. Lim et al., 2006 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers during SARS outbreak in China (n= 212) N95 face mask -79 (37.3%) reported headaches while wearing N95 masks ( 27 (37.3%) had pre existing headaches, 52 (62.7%) had no pre existing headaches, 25 (31.6%) had migraine headaches, 43 (54.4%) had tensiontype headaches, 11 (13.9) had unspecified headaches and none had cluster headaches) - Pre existing headaches ( P=0.041; OR= 1.97; 95% CI 1.03- P=0.053; OR=1.85; 95% CI 0.99- 3.43) were associated with headaches amongst N95 face mask users - 26 (32.9%) suffered more than six headaches in a month, six (7.6%) had taken sick leave (because of headache) from March 2003 to June 2004 (mean 2 days; range 1- 4 days) and 47 (59.5%) had headaches that required the use of abortive analgesics - Response bias and recall bias Lin et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in China (n= 376) - Adverse skin reactions were reported by 280 respondents (74\u00b75%). Of note, this rate was much higher than the rate of occupational contact dermatitis (31\u00b75%) in HCWs under normal working conditions, and that of adverse skin reactions (21\u00b74- 35\u00b75%) during the SARS outbreak - Duration with full body PPE of > 6 h per day (OR 4.26, P < 0\u00b7001) were associated with increased adverse skin reactions. - Hands, cheeks and nasal bridge ranked as the three most commonly affected areas, reported by 237 - Risk of response bias and recall bias PPE Guidelines 71 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes (84\u00b76%), 211 (75\u00b74% ) and 201 (71\u00b78%) respondents, respectively. - Promoting education on proper PPE, and restricting the duration of wearing PPE to no more than 6 h per day would help minimize adverse skin reactions Morgan et al., 2011 Retrospective cohort study Patients admitted for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Pneumonia (PNA) and Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in Maryland (n= 6716) Contact isolation precautions - Contact Isolation was n ot associated with worse CHF process -of-care quality composite measure (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.5 -2.2). - Contact Isolation was not associated with worse AMI process -of-care quality composite measure (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.1 -5.0) - The composite pneumonia process -of-care measure was significantly more likely to be missed in patients on Contact Isolation (6.8% vs. 21.4%, OR 0.3, p<0.01) - Three individual CMS process -of-care quality measures were less likely to be met in patients on Contact Isolation (pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine, smoking cessation) - Contact Isolation was not statistically significantly associated with worse SCIP process -of-care quality composite measure (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 -1.3) Ong et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare worker s in tertiary care in Singapore (n= 158) N95 mask and eye protections - On average, respondents donned the N95 face mask for 18.3 days over the 30- day period, with a mean of 5.9 hours per day. Goggles were used as protective eyewear in the majority [153/158 (96.8%)]. Protective eyewear was worn on an average of 18.2 days over the 30- day period, with a mean of 5.7 hours per day - 128 (81.0%) reported de novo PPE -associated headaches when they wore either the N95 face mask, with or without the protective eyew ear. - Discomfort experienced by the participants corresponded to the areas of contact from the face mask or goggles and their corresponding head straps. - Risk of rec all bias and response bias PPE Guidelines 72 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Onset of headache was less than 60 minutes for the majority of respondents [104/128 (81.3%)] and [113/128 (88.3%)], respectively). After removal of PPE, the attributed headache resolved spontaneously within 30 minutes in the majority for both N95 face mask [113/128 (88.3%)] and protective eyewear [114/128 (89.1%)] - Headache intensity was graded as mild by 92 out of 128 (71.9%) respondents. Associated symptoms were experienced by 30 out of 128 (23.4%) respondents, and comprised of nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, neck discomfort, and movement sensitivity - When PPE usage patterns were eva luated, N95 face mask (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.15- 2.18; P < .001), protective eyewear (OR 1.60, CI 1.13- 2.25; P < .001) or using them together (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.09- 2.07; P = .002) for >4 hours per day had a higher chance of developing headache Palinkas et al., 2020 Ethnographic study Healthcare workers in Seattle (n= 5 participant observers) \"PPE\" - Concerns about preserving PPE limits the ability of care providers to provide care as needed to patients - \"I think that some people do feel apprehensive that they can't see your face but also that you know you may be a risk to them, and sort of I feel like sometimes sends that signal even though you're trying to obviously do the right thing and protect them. I mean classic ally people have worn masks in hospitals when they have been sick, right?\" - the time involved in 'donning and doffing' created delays in performing procedures and the perceptual separation from patients created by the PPE - POs noted changes in patient -provider interactions resulting from social distancing and PPE use - Despite concerns expressed by staff over the potential effects of delays in testing for COVID -19 and the challenges associated with social distancing and PPE use, the overall qual ity of care delivered to - Unclear if results can be generalized PPE Guidelines 73 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes patients does not appear to have been significantly affected. - Workload did increase in many instances due to the imposition of new procedures related to PPE Parush et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, paramedics) in Israel (n=722) and Portugal (n=301) Full \"Level 1\" PPE (full body coveralls with hood, eye protection, mask, gloves) - high agreement across professions and in both countries that the use of the PPE is highly uncomfortable: 78% (n=539/688) in Israel and 87% (n=328/377) in Portugal. - Only 27% (n=188/684) of the respondents from Israel and 45% (n=163/365) from Portugal, of all the professions, indicated that donning the PPE was difficu lt - Agreement was high across professions and the two countries regarding difficulty in seeing what is going on around while using the PPE: 89% (n=697/763) in Israel and 84% (n=317/376) in Portugal - Significantly higher proportions of respondents from Portugal than Israel reported difficulties in doffing the PPE 77% vs. 44%, P <.001); in hearing (64% vs. 50% P<.001); in understanding speech (65% vs 47% P<.001); in understanding the situation (69% vs 54%, P<.001); in being able to think clearly (57% vs 43%, P<.001); and in being able to make decisions (50% vs 39%, P <.001). - Increased discomfort with the PPE was related to increased difficulties in hearing and speech comprehension, which were related to increased difficulties in understanding the surroundi ngs - Purposive and convenience sampling, high risk of response bias - Differences in Level 1 PPE (incl. Training and culture) in each country may contribute to human factors differences Pei et al., 2020 Descriptive cross - sectional survey Healthcare workers in China (n= 484) Biosafety level 1, 2 or 3 (undefined) - 18.2%, 64.1% and 17.2% of participants were equipped with biosafety level 1, 2 or 3, respectively - More than half of the participants wore the protective suit between 4 and 6 h at a time and 9.1% of them kept the suit on for longer than 6 h - Among the 484 participants, 73.1% suffered from various skin lesions. The lesions manifested as erythema (38.8%), prurigo (22.9%), blisters (13.8%), - High risk of response bias PPE Guidelines 74 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes and Lesions were located on the face (47.1%), followed by the hands (27.5%), limbs (15.7%), truncus (12.6%) and the whole body (2.3%) - medical staff with level 2&3 protection were more likely to experience itching than those using primary protection ( P = 0.0121) - More advanced protection ( P = 0.0016), higher working frequency ( P < 0.001) and longer wearing times of protective suits ( P = 0.0016) were more correlated with the appearance of facial skin lesions (P = 0.000 6) Perna et al., 2020 Literature review n/a - rigourous studies of effects of respiratory protection devices (RPD)(n= 5 included studies) Common RPDs among HCWs and the general population are surgical facemasks (SMs) and filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) - Four studies reporting on objective measures of respiration suggest that RPDs may alter the users' natural breathing patterns and make breathing more difficult. This is due to an increase in breathing resistance (resulti ng in increased breathing effort and hypoventilation) accumulating and inhaling CO 2 in the dead volume in the facepiece, and reduced O 2 concentrations on inhalation - Sensitivity to respiration differences (breath- holding, hyperventilation, hypoxia, hyperc apnia) may trigger panic symptoms in panic -prone individuals - The use of RPDs has been associated with other effects, including increased air temperature in the RPD cavity (up to approximately 32\u00b0C -33\u00b0C) with sweat accumulation, which may add a further burden to breathing and general discomfort - individuals vulnerable to panic may be at higher risk of relevant discomfort while wearing RPDs, thereby reducing their tolerance for these devices, Pineles et al., 2018 Observational study Healthcare workers in long-term care facilities in the United States Patients/residents on isolation precautions - 999 hours of observation were conducted across 8 VA nursing homes - Residents on any type of isolation received an average of 4.73 visits per hour of observation compared with 4.21 for non -isolation residents PPE Guidelines 75 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes (P<.01), a 12.4% increase in visits for residents in isolation - A similar result was seen in average number of HCW visits per hour, which were 15.1% higher in residents in isolation than those who were not (3.43 vs 2.98; P<.01) - For every hour of observation, residents on any type of isolation received an average of 22.1 visit minutes compared with 19.9 visit minutes for residents not in isolation ( P<.01) - Residents in isolation received, on average, 3.53 resident care activities per hour of observation, compared with 2.46 for residents not in isolation (P<.01) - Hand hygiene compliance on entry between residents in isolation and residents not in isolation was the same (38% vs 38%; P=.99) Purssell, Gould & Chudleigh, 2020 Systematic review & meta- analysis Hospitalized patients on isolation precautions (n= 26 studies) Isolation precautions - Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for anxiety was 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34); although within this there was significant heterogeneity - For depression, the SMD was 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09); again with significant heter ogeneity - Studies not reporting the raw data showed that contact precautions were associated with depression OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) but not anxiety OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) in the non- ICU population - There was also an association with delirium (OR 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.51)); although this was primarily among those who were newly diagnosed as needing isolation (OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.92, p<0.01)) rather than those who had been under contact precautions for their entire stay - For those outcomes associated with quality, the median RR (with positive outcomes reversed so a higher RR is associated with a worse outcome) was 0.94 (IQR 0.92- 0.98), satisfaction 0.95 (IQR 0.89 - 1.01) and adverse events was 1.27 (0.91 -2.5) PPE Guidelines 76 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes Purushothaman et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Healthcare workers in India (n= 250) Surgical masks and N95 respirators for a minimum of 4 h per day - 48.8% experienced generalised nasal discomfort, 30.3% dry nose, 26.1% burning sensation in the nose, about 52.0% developed itchy nose, 56.0% acne in the face, 39.0% experienced redness on the face and 67.6% developed excessive sweating around the mouth - About 30.0% developed pain on the nose and 45.2% had pain behind the ear which are possibly due to the tight -fitting masks - 58.2% of the participants developed trouble breathing on exertion while wearing masks (probably due to the tight mask causing hypercapnic hypoxic environment leading to numerous physiological alterations such as cardio- respiratory stress and metabolic shift) - Inadequate hydration while wearing PPE leads to dry mouth, halitosis and sore throat - A small proportion of healthcare workers were observed with the symptoms of altered smell (7.2%), sense of nasal stuffiness (30.4%), nasal (9.6%), crusting the nose (15.7%) and blood on tissue paper (1.6%) - Results may have limited generalizability to Alberta - High risk of response bias Ribeiro et al., 2020 Descriptive, observational cross - sectional study Volunteers in Brazil recruited by web and social media (n= 468) - Working Group (WG), with 289 individuals who wore the face masks for professional and essential activities during the pandemic - Essential Activities Group (EAG), which comprised of 179 individuals who wore the face masks only to perform essential activities during the pandemic - Masks were N95, disposable surgical mask, or cloth mask - There was a higher frequency of usage of cloth masks in the EAG ( P< 0.001), especially by participants who were working from home ( P< 0.0 01) - Significantly higher scores of vocal fatigue symptoms in the domains of tiredness and voice impairment ( P = 0.001) and avoidance of voice use (P = 0.046) in the WG as compared with the EAG - Significantly higher frequency ( P < 0.001) and intensity ( P < 0.001) of vocal tract discomfort in the WG relative to the EAG - Increase in vocal effort, difficulty in speech intelligibility, difficulty in coordinating speech, and breathing in both groups, and reduction of auditory feedback when the conditions with and without face masks were compared ( P < 0.001) PPE Guidelines 77 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Higher frequencies of vocal effort ( P = 0.017), difficulty with speech intelligibility ( P = 0.003), and difficulty in coordinating speech and breathing ( P = 0.003) were observed in those wearing the face mask in the WG when compared to the EAG Saint et al., 2003 Prospective cohort study Patients admitted to general medicine (n= 139); Observations of attending physician and senior residents Contact precautions for antibiotic resistant infection - 31 (22%) of patients in contact isolation. - Senior medical residents examined 26 of 31 patients (84%) under contact precautions versus 94 of 108 patients (87%) not under contact precautions (n.s.) - Attending physicians, in contrast, examined 11 of 31 patients (35%) under contact precautions versus 79 of 108 patients (73%) not under contact precautions (relative risk = 0.49; 95% confidence interval = 0.30- 0.79; P < .001). Differences in physician activities may not be due to isolation (could be due to delegation of duties) Shack et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey Pediatric health workers in Israel (n= 356) \"Face masks\" - 82% reported that mask wearing interrupts their ability to interact with children - 62% reported that children are more fearful of mask wearing clinicians - 59% experienced difficulty effectively assessing or treating patients while wearing a mask (p<0.005). -Significant differences in clinicians' reported difficulty in engaging with patients when comparing mask wearing during the pandemic to previous routine practice. This effect was more pronounced at younger ages; for patients aged 6 months to 2years, 20% of all clinicians reporting their experiences as 'difficult' or 'very difficult' with mask wearing during the pandemic, as opposed to 4% during previous routine practice. - High risk of sampling bias - Perceptions from pediatric specialists, not direct evidence from patients / families Spence & McQuaid, 2011 Retrospective chart review Acute care patients (n=8772) Isolation precautions - 712 (8.1%) were placed in precautions other than standard - 301 (38.6%) of 780 incident reports filed and categorized as being potentially related to patient harm Included in Purssell, Gould & Chudleigh (2020) PPE Guidelines 78 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Forty -five incident reports were in the 712 patients in precautions and 256 in the remaining 8,060 patients. These differences are statistically significantly (2 = 19.5, P .001). - The majority of the adverse events, 43 of 45, occurred in the 525 patients who were in contact precautions with 1 adverse event each in patients placed in droplet and preventive precautions - The differences in the number of adverse events categorized as medication, intravenous fluid , and treatment errors between isolated and standard patients (25 of 692 and 152 of 7,956, respectively) were highly significant (2 = 9.01, P .005). Stelfox, Bates & Redelmeier, 2003 Case -control study - General cohort (patients admitted with all diagnoses between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000; n=78); - Disease- specific cohort (patients admitted with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure and history of MRSA between January 1, 1999, and July 1, 2002; n=72). - Two matched controls were selected for each isolated patient (n=156 general cohort controls and n=144 disease- specific cohort cont rols). Adults on isolation precautions for MRSA - isolated patients were more likely to have their vital signs incompletely recorded (14% vs 9%; P<.001) and to have days with no vital sign recordings (5% vs 1%; P=.02) at all - Isolated patients were twice as likely to have vital signs not recorded as ordered (51% vs 31%; P<.001), and they were also more likely to have days with no nursing narrative notes (14% vs 10%; P< .001) or physician progress notes (26% vs 13%; P< .001) recorded - Isolated patients wer e far less likely to have a stress test or angiogram if they had angina (8/59 [14%] vs 42/93 [45%]; P<.001), to have their weight recorded on at least half of the days of the hospitalization (58% vs 87%; P=.01), or to have an evaluation of left ventricular function while in the hospital (57% vs 69%; P=.049). - Isolated patients were less likely to have documentation of congestive heart failure education (18/63 [29%] vs 69/136 [51%]; P=.004) and timely (within 4 weeks) follow -up appointments scheduled (15/63 [24%] vs 63/ 136 [46%]; P=.001) - Unclear if findings will translate to COVID -19, when droplet precaution PPE is the norm rather than the exception - Included in Berry et al., 2020 - Included in Purssell, Gould & Chudleigh, 2020 PPE Guidelines 79 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - Isolated patients had longer hospitalizations and higher rates of adverse events compared with control patients - . Isolated patients were twice as likely as control patients to experience adverse events (31 vs 15 adverse events per 1000 days; P<.001) during their hospital stay - Twelve isolated patients (8%) submitted unsolicited complaints to the hospital compared with only 3 control patients (1%) Tabah et al., 2020 Cross -sectional survey (web -based) Healthcare workers in 90 jurisdictions (n= 2711) PPE (described in findings) - most respondents reported use of FFP2/N95 masks (1557; 58%), Surgical masks were reportedly used for routine care in 289 (15%) cases but infrequently (47, 2%) for and face shields/visor (1574; 62%). - The median duration of a shift while wearing PPE without the ability to take a break (PPE -Shift) was 4 h (IQR 2, 5 h). This was similar for nurses and doctors. Adverse events were associated with longer PPE shifts. - Adverse effects were reported by 80%, including heat (1266, 51%), 44%), 28%), inability to use the bathroom (661, 27%) and extreme exhaustion (4924, 20%). - High risk of response bias Tan et al., 2006 Qualitative study Family physici ans after SARS in Singapore (n=8) \"PPE\" - Practice pattern was also modified as one participant decided to talk less and hastened the consultation in view of the dyspnoea - There were moments of complacency when the participants felt all right to remove the mask intermittently to allow \"normal\" breathing but compliance was improved after the death of their doctor friend from SARS in the hospital - The participants, who wore gowns, pointed out the inconvenience during toilet breaks - Risk of recall bias PPE Guidelines 80 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes - The participants hig hlighted the physical discomfort during prolonged use of the N95 mask, ranging from breathing difficulty, headache to the development of allergic facial rash around the mask - The discomfort from the N95 mask had severely impaired the ability to carry out the consultation had resulted in one participant switching to the triple ply surgical mask - They also had to handle some of their other patients' adverse perception of their PPE (concern and anxiety) with reassurance and explanation. - The participants claimed that their patients' reactions to the PPE were varied and ranged from amusement to apprehension - The patients perceived the wearing of PPE by their family physicians as a sign that they could have been exposed to SARS patients and thus taking up these precautions. The patients inferred that their family physicians, in turn could endanger their health by transmitting the SARS virus to them - One participant highlighted the need to explain to patients the use of PPE to rectify any erroneous perception. He made it clear to his patients that wearing the PPE would be a key measure to safeguard their health with mutual benefits Teh et al., 2020 Observational study Retrospective review of endoscopies performed in 2020 and a similar period in 2019 (n=247) Enhanced PPE: f N95 filtering face piece (FFP) respirator, face shields, and hairnets, in addition to the standard personal protective equipment (SPPE) of water -resistant gown and gloves - No significant difference in median time to cecum (TTC) (10.0 vs 10.0min, P =0.524) and total procedure time (22.5 vs 23.0min, P =0.946) between the SPPE and EPPE groups - There was no statistically significant difference in adenoma detection rate (ADR) (29.8% vs 21.6%, P rate (CIR) (99.2% vs 100%, P =0.346) was also similar between the two groups. PPE Guidelines 81 Reference Study type Population Intervention (PPE, isolation, masking, etc.) Findings Notes Tran et al., 2017 Retrospective cohort study Patients admitte d to general medicine in Toronto (n= 17649) Isolation precautions - 1506 patients isolated for respiratory illnesses and 745 patients isolated for MRSA - Among the respiratory isolation cohort, 207 (13.7 %) were readmitted to the hospital, and 164 (10.9 %) visited the ED within 30 days after discharge. Their mean cost for hospitalization was CAD $7254, and their mean length of stay was 8.5 days - Among the cohort with MRSA, 141 (18.9 %) were readmitted to the hospital, and 85 (11.4 %) visited the ED within 30 days of discharge. Their mean cost for hospitalization was CAD $12,129, with a mean length of stay of 12.8 days - Individuals isolated for respiratory illnesses were not significantly more likely to experience a 30- day readmission or ED visit, death, or adverse event during hospitalization or to file a formal complaint compared to non- isolated individuals - Those on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses stayed 17 % longer (LOS, 8.5 days vs. 7.6 days; 95 % CI: 1.09, 1.12), stayed 9 % longer than expected, (LOS/ELOS, 1.08 vs. 1.01; 95 % CI: 1.03, 1.15), and had 23 % higher cost of care (direct cost, CAD $7194 vs. CAD $6294; 95 % CI: 1.14, 1.32) than non- isolated individuals. - Patients isolated for MRSA were 4.4 % more likely than non- isolated in dividuals to be readmitted within 30 days after discharge (rate, 19.0 % vs. 14.7 %; 95 % CI: 1.4 %, 7.3 %).

They must remove the gloves and perform hand hygiene before leav ing the patient's room - During the study period, 54.2% of the months were in mandatory gloving periods and 45.8% were in standard care periods. - Universal gloving reduced the rates of HAIs in any pediatric unit by 25% (relative risk [RR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 -0.93; P = .010), after adjusting for long- term time trends, seasonality, and the effect of HAP and VAP surveillance - Glove use was associated with significantly lower HAI rates in the PICU (RR: P = 0.607) - ( BSI) CI: 0.44-0.84; P = .003). - significance differences were found for pneumonias ( HAP, VAP) and C. difficile infections - Unmonitored inappropri ate glove use may increase the risk of MRSA transmission PPE Guidelines 84 Methods Question 1: Can the prevalence of COVID -19 in the community be used to predict the likelihood of healthcare- based outbreaks? Statistical Analysis of AHS Data for Acute Care Modeling the association of outbreaks in hospitals with COVID_19 case prevalence in Alberta - Prepared for the Scientific Advisory Group - Prepared by Shihe Fan, Edmonton Zone Analytics and Reporting, Analytics (DIMR) - Prepared on: Nov 27, 2020 - Contact info: shihe.fan@ahs.ca Origin al analytical question asked: \"Can the prevalence of COVID -19 in the community be used to predict the likelihood of healthcare based outbreaks? \" In this analysis, however, no attempt was made to develop a predictive model for future outcomes. It only examined the association of hospital outbreaks with COVID -19 case prevalence in the province in data collected during the period from Mar 15 to Nov 21, 2020.

The variance of the data is therefore much larger than the mean and over -dispersion is evident as shown in Figure 2 and confirmed by the model in Picture 1 (alpha is statistically different from zero). The incidence rates generally increased in recent weeks across all zones ( Figure 1). The correlation coefficient of incidence rate with active case rate is 0.949; with lab positive rate 0.8205; with percentage of cases of unknown infection sources 0.5612 . All these highly correlated variables are not used in the model. All rate calculations included cases involved in outbreaks as suggested. Figure 1. Hospital outbreaks (left panel) and COVID -19 incidence rates (right panel) by zone by week from Mar 15 to Nov 21, 2020 PPE Guidelines 86 Figure 2. Frequency distribution of weekly hospital outbreaks The case time variable is constructed from the earliest of symptom onset date, specimen collection date, or lab report date in the data sources described above. The outbreak date is constructed from the first case date. Some records do not have geographic information attached (i.e. postal code, zone, or health region). Therefore, they cannot be assigned to any geographic zone. Some records do not have proper identifier. When record linking is required, they are not linkable. All these problematic records are used as much as possible. Otherwise, they are excluded from the analysis. The records used are generally those on the Alberta residents. Data used in the analysis were only true to Nov 25, 2020 when the analytical data were last extracted. The author i s informed of data delays at various levels of the operation/reporting structure. The results demonstrated below can therefore be said to be accurate only to the existing data up to that date. Data inconsistency exists across data sources. For instance, a patient died on Nov 9, 2020, but his first onset date and specimen collection date were reported to be Nov 10. Data are cleansed and reconciled as much as possible on a best effort basis afforded. Separately, hospital outbreak definitions may also have changed over time. Certain aspects of inconsistency and deficiency may still exist in the analytic data. The author regrets its existence, if any, in light of the fact that not much of a choice was afforded to him given the tight time line and large amount of data to be dealt with. Statistical model and (Stata) outputs: Because the data is zero -inflated with over -dispersion, a zero -inflated negative binomial model is chosen for the analysis. The dependent variable is weekly outbreaks in acute care hospitals in each AHS zone. The independent variables are weekly incidence case rates categorized into 3 groups: < 50, 50 - <100, and 100 cases per week per 100,000 population, and the AHS zones. The discretization of the incidence rates is to honor the requestor's interest in knowing how outbreak pictures change in relation to different levels of incidence rates. 0 50 100 150Frequency 0 2 4 6 number of outbreaksPPE Guidelines 87 The data is analyzed using Stata/MP 16.1 for Windows (64- bit X86 -64) (StataCorp LLC, Texas, U.S.A.). The exact model code used is: zinb outbreaks i.incid_rate_cat, inflate(i.incid_rate_cat i.zone_id) exposure( hospitals) cluster(zone_id) The exposure variable in the model is the number of hospitals in each zone, which causes each zone to be observed in different frequencies each week. Because each zone is observed 37 weeks from Mar 15, 2020 to Nov 21, 2020, the variance estimate took this into account, with a cluster estimation method. Picture 1 captures the model output from Stata. The outbreaks equation logically shows increases in outbreaks with the rise in weekly incidence case rates. The inflation equation [p(outbreak=0)] shows decreased probability of no outbreaks as incidence rates increase (exponentiation of the regression coefficients will get the odds ratio of no outbreaks) . Compared to the South Zone, the Calgary and Edmonton Zones are much less likely to see no outbreaks, whereas the Central and North Zones are not much different from the South Zone. Picture 2 shows the estimated marginal probability of no outbreaks compared to each base level. An interesting phenomenon is when compared to the base level (<50), the highest level of incidence rates ( 100) is not as more likely as the intermediate level (50 - 100) to induce hospital outbreaks. The reason here is a strong zone effect. The hig h rates occur most recently and primarily in the Calgary and Edmonton Zones, so the zone effect overwhelms the rate effect. Picture 3 shows the estimated number of outbreaks per week in acute care hospitals of the province. Logically, the higher the weekl y incidence rate, the higher number of outbreaks will inevitably occur in hospitals (10 x increase when incidence rates rise from <50 to 100 week - 110-5 ). This leads to a conclusion that either hospital infection prevention & control programs must step up efforts to prevent hospital outbreaks or efforts must be made to suppress the incidence cases in the community at large. All said, the author must reiterate that the original question could be investigated in many different ways from different angles wit h different perspectives. The analysis nevertheless is done in the spirit of conciseness and simplicity to meet the immediate need for information of the Scientific Advisory Group. PPE Guidelines 88 Picture 1.

The incidence rates generally increased in recent weeks across all RHAs ( Figure 1 ). The correlation coefficient of incidence rate with active case rate is 0.8765 and with lab positive rate 0.8324 . All these highly correlated variables are not used in the model. The percentage of cases with unknown infection sources is not calculatable due to the lack of information on RHA coding in the source data.

Statistical model and (Stata) outputs: Because the data is zero -inflated with over -dispersion, a zero -inflated negative binomial model is chosen for the analysis. This model simultaneously models two data generation processes, a zero generation process and a random zero from the Poisson process. The dependent variable is weekly outbreaks in LTCs in each RHA. The independent variables are weekly incidence case rates categorized into 3 groups: < 50, 50 - <100, and 100 cases per week per 100,000 population, and the RHAs. The discretization of the incidence rates is again to honor the requestor's interest in knowing how outbreak pictures change in relation to different levels of incidence rates. The data is analyzed using Stata/MP 16.1 for Windows (64- bit X86 -64) (StataCorp LLC, Texas, U.S.A.). The exact Stata model code used is: zinb outbreaks i.incid_rate_cat, inflate(i.incid_rate_cat i. rha_id) exposure( ltc s) cluster( rha_id) PPE Guidelines 93 The exposure variable in the model is the number of LTCs in each RHA, which causes each RHA to be observed in different frequencies each week. Because each RHA is observed 37 weeks from Mar 15, 2020 to Nov 21, 2020, a cluster estimation method is used to calculate variance. Picture 1 captures the model output from Stata. The outbreaks equation logically shows increases in outbreaks with the rise in weekly incidence case rates. The inflation equation [p(outbreak=0)] shows decreased probability of no outbreaks when incidence rates increase from <50 to between 50 - <100 week-110-5 and then not much a difference with incidence rates rising further above the 100 week-110-5 level (exponentiating the regression coefficients will get the odds ratio of no outbreaks ). Com pared to the Chinook RHA, all other RHAs, except the East Central (5) RHA, are much less likely to see no outbreaks. The Chinook and East Central RHA are not much different. Picture 2 shows the estimated marginal probability of no outbreak s compared to the base level. An interesting phenomenon again is when compared to the base level (<50), the highest level of incidence rates ( 100) is not as more likely as the intermediate level (50 -100) to induce LTC outbreaks. This is revealed in Figur e 2. Similar to what was seen in the hospital outbreak analysis, the RHA effect is probably dominated the incidence rate effect more because both the Calgary and Edmonton RHA have had more outbreaks. Another reason may be the effect of prevention measures, such as visitation restriction and cross -site employment reduction, which suppressed outbreaks. Picture 3 shows the estimated number of outbreaks per week in LTCs of the province. As consistently seen in Figure 2 , the intermediate incidence rate level (50 - 100 week-110-5 ) induced more outbreaks than the higher level ( 100 week-110-5). Nevertheless, both are still significantly higher than the base level (<50 week-110-5 ). Therefore, it is necessary to enhance infection prevention & control programs to prevent LTC outbreaks as incidence case rates increase in the community at large. All said, the author repeats that the original question was investigated in the spirit of conciseness and simplicity to meet the immediate need for information of the Scienti fic Advisory Group.

Are there common features to these guidelines? Literature Search A search of the grey literature was conducted by Rachel Zhou from Knowledge Resources Services (KRS) within the Knowledge Management Department of Alberta Health Services. KRS searched websites of: Canadian provincial and territorial governments, health systems, or authori ties, international governments (or ministries of health); and national and international and public health and health protection agencies. In addition, google searching was also performed. Briefly, the s earch strategy involved combinations of keywords for SARS- CoV-2; COVID -19 and PPE guidelines. Refer ences identified by KRS in their search were initially screened and the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Table 9 below. Fifty-seven references were identified by KRS with titles and website links provided for further review. An additional 12 referenc es were identified from ad hoc searching. A total of 69 references were reviewed and 42 were excluded in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria stated below. A total of 27 guidelines, guidance documents, technical reports, and/or frameworks of relevance to this question were identified (n=18 applicable to HCWs in either acute care or any healthcare setting; n=9 specific to HCWs in LTC settings) and were included in the narrative synthesis. Table 9. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for results of the literature search Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria - Grey literature: guidelines, guidance documents, reports, briefs providing guidance on PPE for healthcare workers during the COVID -19 pandemic - Date of guidance: January 1 2020-present (in order to capture those relevant to the COVID -19 pandemic) - Acute care and/or long-term care settings - Any Canadian or international jurisdiction outside of Alberta - English language only - Published peer -reviewed literature - Comm entaries, opinion pieces, editorials, or narrative literature reviews - Guidelines published before 2020 (not likely to be specific to COVID -19 precautions) - No explicit description of specific PPE requirements (and in which care situations) PPE Guidelines 101 Question 3. What degree of protection is offered from universal masking in healthcare, including evidence for the utility of medical masks in preventing transmission from an infected person (source control)?? Literature Search A literature search was conducted by Rachel Zhou from Knowledge Resources Services (KRS) within the Knowledge Management Department of Alberta Health Services. KRS searched databases for reviews published from January 1, 2020 to present, and included: OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, TRIP PRO, CADTH, Ox ford Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine, MedRxiv, bioRxiv, Google and Google Scholar . Briefly, the search strategy involved combinations of keywords and subject headings including: SARS -CoV-2; COVID -19, MERS, SARS, RSV, healthcare settings, and PPE. Searches were limited to reviews or studies that incorporated 'reviews' of the literature on this topic and limited to English literature. Articles identified by KRS in their search were initially screened by title and abstract against the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Table 10 below. Eight -hundred and seventy -nine articles were identified by KRS with references and abstracts provided for further review. An additional 49 aritcles were identified from hand- searching the reference lists of 3 relevant systematic reviews and 1 living rapid review. A total of 924 articles underwent abstrac t review and of these, 76 were reviewed in full -text. Ultimately, 54 were excluded from the review in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria stated below. A total of 22 articles were included in the narrative synthesis.
