She recently learned that one of her children is suffering with a serious medical condition. Over night, the world she knew is no longer recognizable. Physically and emotionally she feels drained and exhausted, and suffers from severe sleep depravation. I suggested the homeopathic remedy Cocculus Indicus. This remedy helps our body realign it's rhythm and sense of balance from loss of sleep and mental emotional strain. It is a remedy often called for when taking care of/watching over someone who is ill, need our care, when there is loss of sleep and much worry. The remedy gave immediate relief and helped my friend relax and get some much needed sleep. She will continue to take the remedy as needed.
