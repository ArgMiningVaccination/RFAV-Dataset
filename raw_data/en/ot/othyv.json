My breathing was interfering with daily activities, exercise, and causing me a lack of sleep. I went from getting an average of 4-5 hours sleep to getting about 6.5 - 7 hours sleep each night. Also, my normal breathing has shifted and I use the breathing to calm myself whenever I feel uncomfortable. I loved Dr. Zhu's calm, gentle, kind, personality. \"Dr. Zhu is a fantastic practitioner who cares deeply about her patients. She took the time to listen to everything I had to say and made me feel heard. Dr. Zhu has a very caring heart and it really shows when she interacts with you. After the acupuncture session I felt amazing! I have gone back a couple of times now. I would highly recommend Dr. Zhu to anyone!\" Dr. Zhu is a true healer. I came to her because of problems with digestion. I found her to be a careful listener with a wide range of health strategies. My digestion improved dramatically and continues to get better under her care. I also sleep better. She is very well-qualified and caring with her patients. Dr. Lin Dan Zhu is one of the best 3 doctors I have been a patient of in my 70+ years. The other two I am no longer in proximity to, so I needed to find an equivalent. I am very happy with her and have told my family and friends and would not hesitate to refer anyone to her. She has helped me with a lifelong thyroid issue. She is excellent at getting to the core of an issue and then prescribing the most common sense, down to earth, simple, and effective remedies. She is my cup of tea. "}
