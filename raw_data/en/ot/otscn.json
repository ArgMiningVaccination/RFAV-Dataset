In 2019, reflect- ing this period of tumultuous change, the Biennale adopt- ed the theme: \"May You Live i n Interesting Times\". The phrase could be interpreted as a wish or a curse. It can evoke a sense of challenge or even menace, but it can also be an invitation to consider the turn of human events in all their complexity. We who work in oncology are living in 'very interest - ing times'. The field has been undergoing a permanent revolution over the past three decades. Molecular diagno - sis and new imaging modalities have transformed clinical practice. We have seen the implementation of hormonal and targeted therapy, immunotherapy, CAR T cell tech - nology, genetic engineering, enhanced radiation therapy and nuclear medicine - all of these with great advantages but also non-negligible toxicities. The digital revolution has brought us big data and eHealth Technology. We now interrogate our genetic background, and sequencing and 'omics are in day-to- day use. We measure our health using a proliferation of smartphone apps - not all of them endowed with the same quality or reliability. Costs have risen progressively, leading to therapies becoming less affordable and wide disparities in access emerging along geographic, ethnic, gender, age and socio-economic lines. Living longer frequently entails many years of poor health in later life, and often also loneliness - cancer is a disease of the whole body: organ, microenvironment, and soul. In my own research, alongside the patient there is always the 'non patient' - the healthy person who is at risk of cancer. We need to ask: what does it mean to be truly 'healthy'? And how can we learn about what stops healthy people tipping into sickness? Prevention studies are noto - riously difficult as they seek to explore a non-event.The term 'chemoprevention' was defined by Michael Sporn in the late 1970s as the use of natural, synthetic, or biologic agents able to delay, reverse, or inhibit tumor pro - gression. Cancer World editor Alberto Costa was heavily involved in early clinical applications of the prevention concept in breast cancer in the 1980s and '90s. A recently emerging concept is 'cancer interception' , a sort of early-adjuvant approach, introduced by Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn, which strives to actively interrupt the growth of a tumour mass at its earliest stages. Craig Jordan's tamoxifen studies, which are described in this issue, can be seen as an early example of using the interception approach in relation to second - ary tumours. We know that the health, wellbeing and happiness of cancer patients depend on many factors beyond diagnosis and therapy. Our approach should be not only Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM), but also Participatory, and with a Psycho-oncology dimension. We need specialist nursing care, rehabilitation, good food and exercise, serenity. We need to think more deeply about what the 'end of life' and palliation should be. These times are interesting: it is both a wish and a curse. \"In times of great change,\" observes Biennale President Paolo Baratta, \"we must pay attention to the evolution of the world,\" and we should ask ourselves, \"How have we reacted?\" He suggests that successfully navigating the complexity requires not reducing \"to schemas and formulas - something which, by its very nature, is manifold.\" From its birth in 2004, Cancer World has sought to address all the many and complex aspects of cancer that matter to patients and where oncology professionals have a role to play. I see it therefore as an honour and a responsibility to take over as editor of Cancer World to address new chal - lenges for these 'interesting times' in oncology. Tackling cancer in interesting times Adriana Albini - Editor in chiefCover Story4 Spring 2020Evidence-based medicine and precision medicine - irreconcilable or inseparable? How do you build an evidence base to inform treatment choices that are tailored to the unique genomic profile of each patient and their disease? Sophie Fessl talks to some leading clinical researchers and statisticians who are trying to find answers. \u00a9 Sara CorsiCover Story5 Spring 2020Medicine cannot be learned quickly, because it is impossible for there to exist any established method in it, as for example when someone who has learned to write in one way that is taught then understands everything. Medicine from one moment to the next does things that are opposite, and it does opposite things for the same person, indeed, even things that are self-contradictory. The writer of the Hippocratic treatise On the Plac - es in Man - written around the mid-fifth century BCE - articulated a dilemma of medical thought that has prevailed until today: How can a framework for medical theory and practice be built? Should medicine proceed based on the differences between patients or on their similarities? The tension between the general and the specific con - tinues in oncology today. In the past century, considering the general was the norm. Large trials generated evidence for treatments, under the brand of \"evidence-based med - icine\", the results of which were then applied across the patient population. But not everyone is the same. In the past twenty years, personalised medicine, with its prem - ise of tailoring treatment to a patient's individual profile of mutations, entered oncology. The hype and hope with which personalised medicine - variously also called pre - cision medicine or stratified medicine - has been greeted suggested it may revolutionise cancer treatment. But will it? Hype or hypothesis? One of precision oncology's most prominent critics, Vinay Prasad, haematologist-oncologist and Associate Pro - fessor of Medicine at Oregon Health and Science Univer - sity, has called precision oncology \"a hypothesis Rieke, oncol - ogist at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Berlin, Germany, expresses his reservations more cautiously: \"I do believe that precision oncology has a future and that it makes sense to continue to pursue this approach. But we have to be care - ful not to throw evidence-based medicine overboard, just because we can now sequence our patients.\" The starting signal for precision oncology was the devel - opment of imatinib as a the bcr-abl kinase, the aberrant protein driving CML. In the phase I trial of ima - tinib, 53 of 54 patients went into complete haematological response. This created a new paradigm of targeted treat -ments that take aim at driver mutations. But with the ben - efit of hindsight, commentators point out, imatinib and its effectiveness in CML turned out to be an exception. In fact, imatinib is one of the very few targeted agents that achieve a long-lasting benefit, even when administered on its own. For many other precision oncology agents, this success was not repeatable. Tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution usually give cancer multiple escape routes from targeted therapy. Hence, treatment response and prognosis is much less predictable by genetic tests than was expected based on the imatinib-CML paradigm. And while the course of illnesses with a clear, identifiable, singular genetic alteration, such as CML, may be altered dramatically, it is much less clear whether this promise holds true for other cancers ( Lancet Oncol 2016, 17:e81-86). In 2016, Prasad noted that, \"When patients with diverse, relapsed cancers are given drugs based on biological markers, only around 30% respond at all and the median survival rate is just 5.7 months.\" He esti - mated that \"precision oncology will benefit around 1.5% of patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumours\" (Nature 2016, 537:S63). Making sense of complexity The main difference between evidence-based medicine and precision medicine is the depth of data, says Rieke. \"When a patient comes to the clinic, we try to gather as much data as possible - diagnosis, stage, previous treat - ments, lifestyle, allergies - and then decide what the best therapy is, based on the currently available data... When [in addition] we sequence 10,000 genes, we have many more datapoints and a higher complexity. In both approaches, we personalise treatment based on the patient, but in precision oncology, we have the added genetic data points.\" Molecular tumour boards attempt to make sense of this complexity. \"At the Charit\u00e9, two to three doctors work full time to look at patients' genetic data and comb through the literature. This information is collected and assessed, based on study design and the level of evidence. The aim is to make the recommendation for which there is the best evi - dence\", explains Rieke. Rieke led a study comparing the treatment recom - mendations made by molecular tumour boards (MTBs) worldwide JCO Precision Oncology 2018, 2:1-14). The team sent genomic information of four fictional patients to MTBs. Although all MTBs received the same informa - tion, the recommendations of the five MTBs that replied \" \"Cover Story6 Spring 2020differed substantially for some patients. This is a problem, says Rieke. \"On the one hand, it means we create a lot of evidence which is not optimally retrievable for the individ - ual patient. On the other hand, we have no standards for how to handle genetic data.\" One step towards harmonising recommendations is to make genetic evidence more readily accessible. A dozen knowledge bases store evidence on genetic mutations, of which Rieke estimates only a few to be useful, \"but each database also holds unique information - this shows us just how much data we have.\" A framework for aggregating and harmonising clinical interpretations of detected variants has now been developed using data from six prominent cancer variant knowledge - bases (biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/366856v1.full.pdf). The framework aims to provide access to concise, standardised, and searchable clinical interpretations (therapeutic, diag - nostic, prognostic and predisposition) of detected variants drawn from across multiple institutions that gather and store that data. The harmonised interpretations from those six knowledgebases have been published on an open and searchable website search.cancervariants.org. Therapeutic freedom versus treatment algorithms How to handle genetic data and make treatment deci - sions based on - eventually harmonised - genetic evi - dence is a different debate. Rieke advocates giving oncol - ogists freedom to decide. \"I think we are far removed from assigning optimal treatments using a computer. We shouldn't treat patients according to an algorithm, but based on experience - tak - ing into account, for example, previous therapies. Oncol - ogists should have a certain therapeutic freedom, but the available evidence should be the same - which it isn't.\" Developing treatment algorithms is hard, not least because statistical considerations have to be taken into account. Jan Bogaerts, Scientific Director at Europe's largest independent cancer research organisation EORTC, explains the dilemma: \"I'm concerned about which meth - odology we will use to tease apart the changes we make for patients, and worry about the multiplicity of testing. The more research claims to be personalised, the smaller the subclasses of analysis will become. One idea is to solve this with AI, but these methods are very data hungry - I'm not sure that will work with the data we have available.\" Several years ago, Bogaerts was asked to comment on an idea of comparing several treatment assignment meth - ods in parallel - but this approach had to be abandoned as the statistical requirements were too complex. \"If we try to compare two or more gene-based methods of deciding which patient gets which treatment, and want to answer the question of which one of ten drugs should be given to a patient, we have a very difficult problem. In our answer, we would mix the relative efficiency of drugs tested and the way of assigning patients to them. In reality, we would only be able to give a pragmatic answer, that one method of assigning patients gives a somewhat better survival, without being able to identify the reasons why that hap - pened.\" From a statistician's point of view, Bogaerts sees a protocol in which each patient serves as her or his own control as ideal. \"For statisticians, an approach in which we do within-patient experimentation before deciding on a treatment would improve the situation a lot. But this is totally utopian in most situations in cancer.\" Precision oncology on trial Clinical trials put precision oncology to the test. The French SHIVA01 trial was the first, and so far only, ran - domised trial of therapy directed at pathway mutations. In this study, patients with metastatic or refractory solid tumours who had already received the approved line of treatment, including molecularly targeted agents, were randomly assigned to either receive treatment aimed at the pathway in which their molecular alteration fitted, \"An approach in which we do within- patient experimentation before deciding on a treatment would improve the situation a lot\"All MTBs received the same information, but the recommendations of those that replied differed substantially for some patientsThe VICC Meta-Knowledgebase The Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) meta- knowledgebase is a harmonised collection of clinical variant interpretations and related variant information informing of the clinical significance of variants observed in human cancers. The meta-knowledgebase was created to evaluate the disparities in variant interpretation content and structure across established resources of clinical interpretation knowledge. It harmonised information from six prominent cancer variant knowledgebases: Cancer Genome Interpreter (cancergenomeinterpreter.org), web interface: search.cancervariants.orgSource: cancervariants.org, accessed 30/01/2020.

The pri - mary endpoint in the study was progression-free survival. The results showed that treating patients according to the molecular pathway did not improve median progres - sion-free survival. For Rieke, the design of the study is partly to blame. \"SHIVA01 was too simplistic, it targeted only the signal - ling pathways in which a genetic alteration is placed. How - ever, there are more specific inhibitors that target the exact mutations causing a pathway activation. While thinking in terms of pathways is already more personalised than conventional therapy, the assignment of therapy was obvi - ously not good enough.\" Prasad, too, readily grants that these results do not mean that precision oncology per se will fail, just that the tested strategy failed. But he warns that \"... because the tested strategy is consistent with the growing off-proto - col use of these drugs, results of the SHIVA trial should serve as a powerful deterrent against the off-protocol use of unapproved targeted drugs...\" ( Lancet Oncology 2016 17:e81-e86). Concerns about the extent to which these drugs are being used off protocol were highlighted in a recent arti - cle that looked at 'Early Returns from the Era of Preci - sion Medicine' \"Off-label use has Cover Story8 Spring 2020been estimated as high as 30% of use for some antican - cer agents,\" notes the author. A key issue, he says, is that anticancer drugs tend to be tested in metastatic cases first, \"because clinical trial recruitment is easier and the time from initiation of therapy to a meaningful end point is shorter.\" However they are then sometimes used off-la - bel to treat earlier-stage cancers or certain other cancer types, he notes, \"even before clinical trials are conducted or completed\". Maud Kamal, scientific manager in charge of preci - sion medicine project coordination at the Institut Curie, in Paris, and scientific coordinator of the SHIVA01 trial, sees validation in the trial's secondary endpoint. \"As a secondary endpoint, we used patients as their own con - trol. We compared progression-free survival of patients undergoing targeted therapy as compared to conven - tional therapy and see that a subpopulation of patients does better if they are treated based on the altered path - way. So treating based on alteration works in a subpop - ulation of patients.\" Kamal acknowledges room for improvement. \"We reassessed the SHIVA01 results by classifying the alter - ations used in the SHIVA01 algorithm according to the ESCAT scale, which classifies the association between a molecular alteration and a specific targeted therapy. We found that the majority of alterations in the algorithm were tier 3 alterations, for which there is only moderate evidence. We may need to refine the algorithm to give better treatments to our patients.\" Kamal will keep looking for a proof for the preci - sion oncology approach. \"We will need more trials with different types of design to have clinical proof. As for the treatment algorithms, we need to be precise. While one mutation may be actionable, another mutation in the same gene but not at the same position might not be actionable and targetable to the same degree. We know clinical evidence is important, so we should not just stick our treatment decision on a gene or signalling pathway, but go beyond and look at the specific alteration.\" Real world data cannot replace RCTs What can be done to increasingly tailor cancer treatment to the patient, but maintain the \"safety in numbers\" given by large trials? The collection of so-called real world data after drug approval may not cut it, says Bogaerts. \"I'm worried that, guided by hype, and without sufficient certainty that the preci - sion oncology method will work, we will give up parts of randomised clinical research and bank a lot on real world data. \"But this data is not necessarily geared towards answering our questions. If precision oncology doesn't come through as promised, we will have big gaps in our knowledge in the future.\" In January 2019, the EORTC launched its 'Man - ifesto for establishing treatment optimisation as part of personalized medicine development' , (bit. ly/EORTC_Treatment-Optimisation-Manifesto, see also p9). This envisages an approach in which rele - vant questions for patients outside the, often-limited, patient group included in a trial are answered before approval, Bogaerts explains. \"In the current model, we test a restricted number of almost ideal cases and then approach all the other cases - often the majority - by hand waving, saying 'we will see in the clinic how we will solve this small problem.' Then a cancer patient comes to the clinic who doesn't exactly fit the descrip - tion of patients in the trial for which the drug was approved. What do we do with this patient? \"The manifesto asks drug developers to research this question up front. We should move to a situation where we have broader research into how a drug is going to be used once it is approved, and talk about the practical problems clinicians will have when apply - ing this drug later on.\" Rieke echoes this caution. \"Just because we now have genetic data points, we shouldn't throw over - board everything we've learned in the past fifty years. We shouldn't think that this method is better per se - because it isn't, not yet.\" And he offers an answer to the age-old question of: What would you do, doc? \"If I had a tumour, I would probably have it sequenced. But if we don't find any - thing for which there is good evidence, I would decide on having a conventional therapy that is well under - stood. In this case, evidence beats biological hope.\"\"We should move to a situation where we have broader research into how a drug is going to be used once it is approved\"With the arrival of precision medicine, the days of the old 'one size fits all' treatments seem long in the past. Precision oncology and new approaches to clinical research have meant a dramatic change in the field of cancer treatment. But precision medicine, promising as it is, brings its own challenge - how can we be sure that these targeted treatments are used optimally to the benefit of the individual patient? New treatments now become available based on solid scientific rationale, thanks to our understanding of molecular biology and immunology. However, optimal use of new anti-cancer treatments remains poorly documented. Optimal patient population and cut-off values of biomarkers, treatment duration, sequence and combination are rarely informed, leaving patients, doctors and society facing many questions. In addition, all this is exacerbated by the often very high cost of new treatments. It is therefore essential to find an equilibrium between the interests and needs of all stakeholders, and define it around patient- centredness. A newer version of the Clinical Trial Regulation will soon be implemented in Europe. However, it is not yet known whether it will address the issue of the qualification of studies designed to answer questions centred on patient care. On the contrary, it raises the risks that all Member States could adopt a position not necessarily based on medically informed criteria, and risks making therapeutic strategy trials yet more challenging to perform in the EU. The current drug development paradigm has been criticised for being too drug-centred, and not focusing sufficiently on the patients who will eventually be consumers of the new therapies. A recent EORTC manifesto aims to try to find the balance between the interests and requirements of stakeholders (bit.ly/EORTC_ Treatment-Optimisation-Manifesto). The EORTC consulted academic clinicians, representatives of patient organisations, regulatory and payer authorities, health technology assessments agencies, and industry. We now have much greater clarity on what is needed to put patients at the centre of the drug development process, and we were pleased to find that all stakeholders considered treatment optimisation tools to be valuable to address current gaps in evidence. Treatment optimisation is a process intended to enhance the long term efficacy, adherence, safety, convenience and affordability of a therapy. Its ultimate goal is to expand access to effective treatment to all of those it will benefit. Currently, European patients and the healthcare system are penalised rather than aided by the regulatory hurdle. We need greater independence in assessing the role of treatments. Urgent reform is needed to assess interventional clinical research based on purpose and treatment modalities, not necessarily through the rigid application of inappropriate frameworks.

As head of policy and partnerships, Chiara Gasparotto is positioning the European Society for Radiotherapy to make the case for better access and to alert policy makers and the public to the unmet need in their own countries. Peter McIntyre reports. Radiotherapy has a compelling story to tell about its potential in cancer treatment and about sig- nificant unmet need across Europe. Almost half of patients diagnosed with cancer would benefit from treatment that includes radio - therapy, yet almost a quarter of these patients do not receive it. As the number of European citizens diag - nosed with cancer rises, the number of patients who would benefit from radiotherapy will also rise, reach - ing around 2 million by 2025 - a 16% increase in demand since 2012. And with improvements in skills and technology and imaging now allowing more personalised and precise treatment that can target tumours more effec- tively, while doing less damage to healthy tissue, the need to improve access to radiotherapy is ever more urgent. As Director for Policy and Partnerships at the European Society for Radiotherapy ESTRO, Chiara Gasparotto has responsibility for getting that story heard by people who can deliver on the needed invest - ment in skills and technology. For the past seven years, she has been helping the Society to become more out - ward looking and to build partnerships that strengthen understanding of the potential for radiotherapy among policy makers and within the cancer community. When she started in that role, says Gasparotto, it was clear that ESTRO lacked the level of public visi - bility that other oncology societies enjoyed. \"For sure there is no difference in importance within the disci -plines, but historically the other disciplines started to grow in terms of public knowledge much earlier than radiotherapy.\" The turning point came in 2012, she says, when the then ESTRO President Vincenzo Valentini launched the Society's vision for 2020, with the aim that \"Every cancer patient in Europe will have access to state-of-the-art radia - tion therapy, as part of a multidisciplinary approach where treatment is individualised for the specific patient's cancer, taking account of the patient's personal circumstances.\" The vision was that other specialities would recognise radiation oncology as a major contributor to cancer cure and ESTRO as a strategic driving force in the multidisci - plinary fight against cancer. As part of that, ESTRO aimed to become the pre-eminent educational and scientific soci - ety in radiotherapy and oncology. Gasparotto, who had been managing courses at the ESTRO School for the previous three years, was tasked with establishing the public affairs unit and became its director. With her help, ESTRO began to focus attention on translating clinical and epidemiological data into informa - tion that health policy makers can understand and use. And it used facts about unmet need, costs and benefits to achieve greater recognition among the cancer community of the contribution of radiotherapy to curing and palliating cancer. \"When the process started of looking into ESTRO's place with other stakeholders then yes, you did feel a dif - ference,\" says Gasparotto. \"The Society began to feel a growing interest in partnership and in reaching out towards external stakeholders, including other oncology societies. Credit: David Plas Profile 11 Spring 2020We started to look into what it means for ESTRO to engage in public affairs.\" Making the economic case One of her roles has been to support the HERO proj - ect (Health Economics in Radiation Oncology), launched by ESTRO to develop a European knowledge base and a model for health economic evaluation. \"The role of the HERO project was of paramount importance looking at the health economics of radiation oncology. It started to look into the availability of radio - therapy in terms of staffing, machines and guidelines. Then it looked at the need for radiotherapy - how many patients need the treatment and how many patients are not getting the treatment. It was really looking at the whole healthcare system. We were sitting on data that were and still are extremely important from the point of view of organisation of care.\" HERO has delivered a cost-accounting programme as an online tool for use by country-level societies to support data driven decision making. Changing public perceptions The Marie Curie Legacy Campaign was launched in 2018 to change public perceptions. An initiative of the ESTRO Cancer Foundation (ECF), developed by ESTRO and corporate partners, it promotes a clear message that radiotherapy could save one million more lives a year by 2035 if used to its full potential. \"The Marie Curie campaign was and still is a beautiful adventure,\" says Gasparotto. \"For the first time we decided to talk a sort of different language and reach out to media and lay public and include decision makers as well. \"We started this adventure without knowing what would be the level of response from the media and we were posi - tively surprised that it caught on. It means there is a hunger for information and understanding more and better what kind of treatment patients can have.\" Gasparotto worked with colleagues to draw out essential data from the HERO project and distil it into media friendly messages while retaining the confidence of doctors and sci - entists. \"Science definitely has a different pace from media - much slower,\" she notes. \"It is not always easy to keep up the attention of the media and to make sure that what you are telling them is always newsworthy and relevant.\" The Marie Curie Legacy Campaign has been embraced by ESTRO national societies, which added their own data and backed national media campaigns, notably in Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany, Italy and Portugal. \"The role of the national society was extremely important to be the bridge towards what ESTRO is developing and the different national circumstances,\" says Gasparotto. Advocating on the European stage This initiative was quickly followed by a White Paper, 'Radiotherapy: seizing the opportunity in cancer care,' which makes a pitch for governments, policymakers, healthcare professionals, patients and professional societ - ies to become 'radiotherapy ambassadors'. The White Paper, presented at the EU Parliament in Brussels in January 2019, highlights a need to deal with inequalities and presents a five-point plan to close the gaps in radiotherapy provision across Europe. The report cites shortages of equipment, variations in training, insufficient integration of radiotherapy into treatment plans, lack of investment in research, lack of general understanding of radiotherapy, and misconceptions about safety as contrib - uting to radiotherapy's poor image and underuse. Gasparotto believes these initiatives have started to make a difference. \"The campaign and meetings at the European parliament allowed ESTRO as a society to be With Yolande Lievens, ESTRO Past-President and Chair of the HERO project Profile 12 Spring 2020more visible and to start entering into discussions and debates with decision makers we would not have had a few years back.\" The European Commission has put cancer high on its health agenda and is receptive to new ideas for promoting treatment. At national level there has been more readiness to include radiotherapy societies in partnerships and net - works. \"It is a positive circle. You start a campaign and thanks to the campaign you get attention and start build - ing bridges and those bridges might lead to another wave of campaigning.\" A voice in the wider cancer community The links are also stronger with other European-level cancer societies. Yolande Lievens, President of ESTRO, chairs the Value Based Healthcare project established by the European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) to examine ways of measuring the value of different types of cancer treatments to determine the real benefit to patients. Radi - ation oncologist Cai Grau, who chairs the HERO project, is also a member of the value-based healthcare expert core group. In March 2019, ESTRO launched its new strategy for 2030: 'Radiation Oncology. Optimal Health for All, Together,' which puts still greater emphasis on partner - ships and on looking outwards. It calls for the creation of more multidisciplinary practice guidelines in which the oncology societies would work together to promote evi - dence-based combination treatment, with an enhanced role for radiation therapy. It proposes greater collaboration with GPs, carers and patient support groups. ESTRO is also playing a wider global role, and in 2018 established an 'ESTRO meets Asia' congress, now held annually in Singapore, to share experiences and plan future collaboration. It also partners with the International Atomic Energy Authority, which works to make the case for radiation oncology in parts of the world, in Africa for example, where around half the countries have no radio - therapy services. Marrying sociology and oncology When Gasparotto joined ESTRO in January 2009 to manage courses at the ESTRO School, it was the match of skills that attracted her, rather than the oncology. \"I've always liked to understand connections and relationships between people and between groups, she says. \"What inspires me most today is the sociology of organisations - to see the dynamics between people and the values and behaviours within organisations.\" In fact she had reservations about working alongside clinicians. Her father was a radiographer and her mother a hospital secretary (both now retired). Her uncle is a doctor Profile13 Spring 2020and hospital manager and her aunt is a nurse. As if this was not enough her sister is a biologist. \"I was panicking a bit because I did not know anything about oncology and because everyone in my family works in a hospital. I was kind of proud that I was the only one who escaped from a healthcare environment ... but then you see that things happen for a reason.\" She concludes that her choices were probably not by chance. \"Very often you are in the right place at the right time. There is a fil rouge that connects all my steps.\" Born and brought up in north-east Italy, Chiara Gaspar - otto did her first and second degrees at the University of Udine in Gorizia, close to the border with Slovenia. Her Masters is in European public relations, concerned with European public affairs and international relations. Between her two degrees she took part in the Erasmus exchange programme, studying social science at G\u00f6ttingen University in Germany, after which she went to live and work in Brussels, partly because she wanted to travel and partly \"because of love\". She took an internship with a consultancy dealing with financial services, where she found herself in charge of organising events, and then worked with a consultancy concerned with EU financing for university education and research. That experience prepared her for her first job with ESTRO, as their School contact point for professional devel - opment courses. In that role she developed a strong insight into the needs of young specialists and into the workings of a European medical society. She also got to understand the value of the 'volunteers' - the specialist radiation oncol - ogists, physicists and radiation therapists who build the organisation, run its influential committees and share their expertise. \"The volunteers are extremely motivated and it is motivating to work with them. You feel this energy and commitment they put into the society and that is amazing. I had this when I was working with the School and I still have it today.\" The next decade With so much going on, it is perhaps not surprising that ESTRO is one of the fastest growing professional medical societies in Europe. A 30% increase over the past five years has seen membership grow to more than 7,800 radiation oncology professionals, just over half of whom are radia - tion oncologists, about a quarter are medical physicists and 10% are radiation therapists and dosimetrists, who deliver the treatment, or radiobiologists, who study how radiation affects the biology of cells. Gasparotto talks of the need to \"time-proof\" the future of the organisation by anticipating the need for changing services. \"The vision looks at how to empower the radio - therapy community. You listen to the communities, you understand what they need, and then you respond to those needs.\" \"If you look at the goal of ESTRO and all the other med - ical associations, it is to ensure that patients do have the best care, and patient treatment by definition is multidisci - plinary. So making sure that we are going to work together and collaborate is somehow in the DNA of what cancer care is today. The feeling that I get is that we have much more dialogue with patient societies, organ specific societ - ies and other medical societies.\" She says that ESTRO has greater potential to make use of the data that emerges from their research projects, both internationally and by supporting national level societies which are gatekeepers for information about radiation ther - apy in their countries.

Cristina Ferrario reports on the new technologies and innovative approaches being used to tackle innate and acquired resistance to these drugs and improve their therapeutic impact. Since their first approval and use, more than 15 years ago, inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have revolutionised clinical practice and the prognosis for cancer patients, especially in colorectal and lung cancer. The treatment paradigm of these two malignancies shifted rap- idly from traditional chemotherapy to targeted therapy. In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with wild-type RAS and no EGFR mu- tations, EGFR inhibitors, in combi - nation with chemotherapy, are now considered the standard of care. In patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) EGFR inhibi - tors are considered standard of care in those harbouring specific EGFR activating mutations (ESMO Open tyrosine kinase inhibitors are miracle drugs: patients with lung cancer simply go back to life after being treated,\" says Yosef Yarden, an international expert on epidermal growth factor receptor, based at the Department There are many causes of innate or acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in meta- static colorectal cancers (mCRC) and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Some of the key mechanisms identified so far include: Source: D Westover et al (2018) Mechanisms of acquired resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR 1):i10-i19; CM Parseghian et al (2019) Mechanisms of Innate and Acquired Resistance to Anti-EGFR Therapy: A Review of Current Knowledge with a Focus on Rechallenge Therapies.

Cohen's main focus had been on the epidermal growth factor which, together with its receptor, had started to play a pivotal role in basic and clinical research from around the mid 1950s, prompting researchers to gain a deep knowledge of physiolog - ical and pathological roles of these molecules, as well as their structural and molecular characteristics. The transmembrane protein EGFR is involved in tumour growth, survival and immune-escape, and it is now considered one of the most potent genes commonly altered in cancers. Moving from bench to bedside, many cancer therapeutics target - ing EGFR tyrosine kinase activity went into 9:800; ESMO Open 2016, 1:e000088; Transl Cancer Res 2019, 8 (Suppl 1):S23-S47). Two classes of drugs developed specifically to tar - get EGFR are currently approved: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for colorectal tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for use in NSCLC. As first postulated by John Men - delsohn and Gordon Sato in 1980, mAbs against EGFR (currently cetuximab and panitumumab) pre - vent ligand binding to the receptor, inhibiting activation of the specific tyrosine kinase cascade of events, thereby blocking cancer cell prolif - eration. TKIs, by contrast, are small molecules that compete with ATP in binding to the intracellular TK domain of EGFR. Three generations of anti-EGFR TKIs are now avail - able. The first generation (erlotinib and gefitinib) are active in patients with diseases harbouring sensitising mutations in the EGFR TK domain. The second generation drugs (afati - nib and dacomitinib) were developed to overcome resistance to first-gener - ation TKIs due to the acquisition of T790M mutation in the TK domain of EGFR. The simultaneous inhibition of the mutated and wild-type form of the receptor leads to dose-limiting toxicities for the second generation of TKIs, which led to the development of a third generation TKI (osimerti - nib), with increased specificity for T790M mutation and a low inhibi - tory effect on wild-type EGFR ( 3:76; Cancer Lett 2019, 459:240-7).Traditionally, developing resistance to an anti-cancer drug meant be- ing taken off that treatment for ever. But with an increasing number of treatment options available, using a variety of mechanisms of ac - tion, new strategies are emerging that may allow a tumour to regain some level of sensitivity to a drug it had become resistant to. This opens up the possibility of giving a 'second chance' to a treatment that had previously stopped working - a strategy known as the re-chal- lenge. As Fortunato Ciardiello, Professor of Medical Oncology at University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli' in Naples, explains, \"There is a strong rationale behind the re-challenge of an anti-EGFR therapy,\" and molecular aspects play the major role in the choice. He is following with interest phase III randomised trials looking at this strategy in the context of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. \"Patients develop resistance to the first treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab, and the process is often mediated by new RAS mutations,\" he explains. When resistance emerges, anti-EGFR therapy is discontinued and replaced with new regimens, for instance, chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs in meta- static colorectal cancer. \"At this point, something may happen at the molecular level that can give us the possibility to recon - sider a treatment with mAbs against EGFR.\" Under chemotherapy regimens without EGFR targeting, the presence of RAS mutations no longer represents a selective advantage: mutated clones are affected by the new therapy and can disappear from the tumour in 3-5 months, as shown by liquid biopsy. \"And this is when the re-challenge can be considered,\" says Ciardiello. For the time being, the strategy remains experimental, pending the findings of the phase III trials.Let's try again! - re-challenging a once-resistant tumour Practice Point 17 Spring 2020Who responds, who is resistant? Several clinical studies have shown that EGFR-targeted thera - pies are highly effective in sensitive cancers, improving progression-free survival, objective response rates and quality of life, while decreasing toxicity compared to previous stan - dards of care ( Int J Mol Sci 2017, 18(11):2420; Transl Cancer Res 2019, 8 (Suppl 1):S23-S47). Sadly, only a limited proportion of colorectal and NSCLC cancers have that sensitivity, says Ciardiello, which means that in both cancer types, anti-EGFR drugs are indicated for only a selected pop - ulation of patients. He emphasises the need to take issues of innate resis - tance and activating (or 'sensitising') mutations into account when choos - ing the best therapeutic approach. What this means, says Ciardiello, is that in patients with colorectal can - cer, anti-EGFR mAbs can be used only for cancers with wild-type RAS (both KRAS and NRAS), which account for about two in five cases of metastatic disease, and they are more effective where the primary tumour was located on the left side. In patients with NSCLC, the propor - tion of patients who can benefit from anti-EGFR TKIs is even lower. Sen - sitising mutations in the EGFR TK domain of the receptor are needed for these drugs to be effective. The most common, accounting for 90% of EGFR mutations in the clinic, are deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21 ( Int - tions are detected in 12-15% of the cases, while in Eastern Asia they are more common, usually in a 30-35% range, reaching 50% in specific popu - lations,\" says \"Moreover, we know that muta - tions are mostly found in non-smok - ers, and are more common in women - most of them in their childbearing age - than in men.\" Why this hap - pens is not yet clear, he adds.Mechanisms of acquired resistance Almost all patients treated with an anti-EGFR drug, whether mAb or TKI, develop resistance even after an impressive initial response. In recent years, many mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibi - tors have been elucidated, showing a very dynamic molecular and cellular landscape, and a great number of dif - ferent processes involved. Resistance mechanisms can be clustered into at least three major groups: gene muta - tions, activation of alternative path - ways, and phenotypic transformation (Int J Mol Sci 2017, 18(11):2420; Clin Cancer Res 2019, 25:6899-908). For example, the emergence of the mis - sense T790M mutation within exon 20 of EGFR is the predominant mechanism of resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, occurring in 50-70% of patients progressing after treatment Front Med 2017, 3:76; Cancer Lett 2019, 459:240-7). \"Unfortunately, resistance also Tailoring treatments to the evolving molecular profile of each tu- mour requires effective tools to analyse and monitor changes that can inform therapeutic choices. As lung cancer special- ist Johan Vansteenkiste commented in an editorial in Annals of Oncology, \"Molecular profiling of NSCLC is now critical not only at the time of diagnosis, but even so at each step of tu- mour progression due to molecular alterations in the tumour,\" (Ann Oncol 2018, 29 (Suppl 1):i1-i2). The same is true for metastatic colorectal cancer, where molecular characterisation is mandatory before starting the treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, and is of pivotal impor - tance when considering a second- or third-line therapy (Clin Cancer Res 2019, 25:6899-908). A tissue biopsy can be used to identify the presence of the molecular requirements for a spe- cific anti-EGFR treatment, such as sensitising mutations in NSCLC, but it cannot be repeated very often in the clinical setting. \"We need a non-invasive procedure that can be performed quite often without bothering or damaging the patient,\" says Fortunato Ciardiello, Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli' in Naples. He believes that liquid biopsy and the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) acquired from a simple blood draw could be the answer. \"It gives us a real-time molecular picture of the tumour and it is as specific and sensitive as tissue biopsy,\" he says. As he points out, ctDNA analysis could also be important in overcoming the problems associated with intra-tumoural heterogeneity. \"The ctDNA represents a 'summary' of cancer DNA: the analysis of these small fragments allows us to gain information about the whole tumour in one run,\" he says. High-throughput techniques such as next generation sequencing - which can be used to analyse liquid biopsies as well as tissue - could be important to get a complete picture of the molecular profile of the disease. Yosef Yarden, from the Department of Biological Regulation at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science, agrees with Ciardiello that all patients should have their tumour sequenced to detect mutations . \"This will help define a personalised treatment and collect molecular data to better understand and maybe overcome resistance mechanisms.\"Monitoring molecular mutations Practice Point 18 Spring 2020occurs after the use of third-gener - ation TKIs like osimertinib, due to several mechanisms like the emer - gence of a tertiary mutation, namely C797S,\" claims Yarden. Activation of alternative pathways, including upregulation of other members of the EGFR family (HER2 or HER3) or a mutation in BRAF, can also be involved in acquired resistance, as well as the transformation from NSCLC to SCLC (small cell lung cancer) or epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells ( Int J Mol 18(11):2420; Ann Oncol 2018, 25:6899-908). \"This is very complex,\" says Ciardiello. \"But the good news is that many of the players involved in acquired resis - tance can be studied as potential targets for new therapies to prevent, delay or overcome resistance.\" Strategies to overcome resistance Progress has been made in identi - fying cellular and molecular mech - anisms responsible for resistance to anti-EGFR drugs. The question remains of how to counteract them. When resistance occurs, patients are often treated with chemother -apy, alone or in combination with other drugs (e.g. anti-angiogenics). This could work in some cases, but as Yi-Chen Zhang and colleagues commented in a recent paper, \"novel agents with higher potency, broader selectivity and better intracranial are urgently needed,\" ( Can- Lett 2019, 459:240-7). New drugs targeted on EGFR TK activity are in development. Given what we know about resistance mechanisms, however, it would make sense to look a bit further, says Yarden. \"We could think, for example, to use different approaches targeting both the kinase activity of EGFR and alternative pathways.\" His labora - tory is experimenting on mice car - rying human tumours (xenografts), using a double anti-EGFR strategy (mAb+TKI) together with a block - ade of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is activated after EGFR inhibition. \"This combination showed a very strong synergistic effect, and all the tumours disappeared during the treatment,\" says Yarden, but he adds that, as with other therapies, \"this triple regimen failed to cure patients: the tumour always comes back if we stop administering the drugs.\" Good results from combina - tion regimens have also been seen in metastatic colorectal cancer, according to Ciardiello, who men - tions concomitant inhibition of wild-type EGFR and mutant BRAF in this setting. And with the growing number of anti-EGFR drugs coming on the market, particularly TKIs, there is an urgent need to find out more about the most effective sequence of administration ( Int J Mol Sci 2019, 20(1):146).Dr Matti Aapro ECCO President 2020-2021 Big things are made out of small pieces: The value of convening networks in cancer policy Dr Matti Aapro is President of the European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) and Dean of the Multidisciplinary Oncology Institute, Genolier, Switzerland.So the Year 2020 has arrived. Many predictions were made about the lives we would be living by now. Machines were usually a feature. Flying cars, spaceships taking us to Mars and robots doing our tedious chores. While technology revolutionises our lives with increasing frequency, there is still some way to go before the more imaginative predictions of our future are reached. Not all the components are in place yet. Also, sometimes what appears as 'progress' can create brand new problems to solve, as occasional over-reliance on technology can demonstrate. It reminds all of us in cancer care that the biggest successes are often achieved not through a single giant leap of technology, but from accumulation of many smaller improvements over time. This comes to mind as I start my Presidency of ECCO. I do so at the birth of both a new EU Cancer Mission for research, and an EU Beating Cancer Plan designed to coordinate 27 countries towards shared goals. I hope both will not only be significant in themselves, but set a longer term trend for continual high-level inter-governmental cooperation on cancer. I also start with a freshly minted ECCO Four Year Strategy, developed after ten months of consultation with our members. What came out strongly from that process is not only the need to bring together actors in cancer care to give one voice on certain key policy issues, but also the value in convening interested parties around complex topics where joint work can help overcome persistent obstacles to progress. So we now are launching eight 'Focused Topic Networks' of ECCO members and our Patient Advisory Committee members, but crucially, also invited stakeholders, EU players and our 'Community 365' of funding partners. This expansion of the ECCO family to help problem-solve on a bigger scale is very welcome. I pay particular tribute for that development to my predecessor as ECCO President, Professor Philip Poortmans. He was instrumental in identifying this need, and in gaining full support from the members for the new strategy. His devotion to seeing this task through was singular, and I am in his debt. The first Network to be launched was 'HPV Action Europe', dedicated to achieving the elimination of all HPV caused cancers in Europe as a public health problem. This is a case study of where a range of small steps - on vaccination uptake, on screening, treatment and research - when put together, could achieve an enormous whole, well within our own lifetimes. Many different professions and interest groups have their role to play, and that means bringing people together around a unified purpose. The next two networks to launch will be Treatment Optimisation and expansion of our Quality Cancer Care initiative, with others thereafter. This means that, as the EU Cancer Mission and Plan are rolled out, we will have communities of action ready to input, and ready to implement; ready to inform about the hundreds of small steps already taken, and ready to advise on what is required to reach the next level. So for my own prediction of the future: Like the Swiss watches my city Geneva is so famous for, the machines of the past, present and future are united by being made of many different components, big and small, working in concert, to perform their function. Creating effective collaboration for advancement in cancer care is no different. Big and small parts work best together. This is a reality I hope to oversee, as ECCO puts in place new Networks for improvement and commits itself to supporting the machinery of EU cancer cooperation to achieve a better future.\u00a9 Yorkshire Post Cutting Edge 20 Spring 2020How to make precision drugs that work better Six lessons from the development of the first targeted anti-cancer therapy Why are today's precision drugs falling so short of the impact achieved by tamoxifen, the first ever targeted cancer therapy? Craig Jordan puts it down to the lack of detailed pharmacological work, and offers six lessons from his own experience developing not just tamoxifen, but also raloxifene and other SERMs.Cutting Edge21 Spring 2020\"You're not going to cure cancer by sequencing everything\"Tamoxifen famously started life as a failed contracep- tive, developed by ICI (now Astra Zeneca), but with the fatal flaw that it increased ovulation rather than suppressing it. It's a story sometimes told to show how discoveries can come from unexpected quarters and that scientific progress has a habit of proceeding in zigzags. Craig Jordan is the pharmacol - ogist who took that failed drug and developed a treatment strat - egy for tamoxifen, and then did the groundwork for four additional selective oestrogen receptor modu - lators (SERMs) - saving millions of women's lives. He teaches us that such zigzaggedy progress and unex - pected discoveries don't just hap - pen. They require bloody minded, dedicated and creative scientists who refuse to give up on failures, and fight for the resources and peo - ple to do the science to turn things that might not look very promising into something that could offer real value. By 'failures' , Jordan includes the vast majority of targeted medicines currently marketed with scant evi - dence of real benefit. \"If you go to the paper that looks at the approv - als of all of these targeted thera - pies, they have if you are lucky 5 or 10% responses. There is no sur - vival data, but they are on the mar - JAMA Onc 2018, 4:1093-98; JAMA Onc 2018, 4:1789-90). Companies are able to sell them, says Jordan, on the basis that there's nothing else, so why not use it? \"My view is: why does nobody take the time and invest the money to find out which drugs will be used and useful?\" He believes that many failing targeted drugs would turn out to be of great value if more time and resources were invested in doing the pharmacology and translational research to build a detailed picture about exactly what they are doing and how they could be improved. That takes persistence (verging on obsession in his case) and a focus on finding solutions for patients rather than marketable applications for drugs. He worries that the major les - son to be learned from the tamox - ifen/SERMs story won't be learnt, partly because tamoxifen is seen by the younger generation of research - ers as \"a bit like aspirin\" - part of the fabric of cancer therapy that has always been there. Moreover, while tamoxifen may be formally recognised as the first targeted anti-cancer therapy, it is Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Glivec (imatinib) that researchers generally use as a reference point, as they were the first to use new molecular biology techniques to identify targets and create molecules to block them. For Jordan, this explosion of molecular biology is part of the problem. \"Everybody could just go into the lab and take tumours and sequence them and compare them with the normal human genome. All we've really done is developed a map of the world. All of these maps. But nobody has a got a clue about: What is going on in Africa? Why is Detroit different from Los Ange - les? What's going on in Europe, and what are the interactions that cre - ate a European Union? Nobody has any idea because the task is so vast. You're not going to cure cancer by sequencing everything.\" He says there has been a drift away from the fundamental ques - tions: How does this drug work? How can we make it better? How do we study side effects? Could there be good side effects as well as bad? For Jordan, now professor of Breast Medical Oncology and Molecular and Cellular Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Texas, the main drive was how to get a treatment available for women to keep them alive - and that focus seems to have got downgraded. His one big exception to this cri - tique relates to work on improving immunotherapies, including at MD Anderson, which is also home to Jim Allison, who received a Nobel Prize for his role in discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of neg - ative immune regulation. \"There is a whole team of people looking at the good, bad and ugly of immu - notherapy, and fixing it to be more targeted,\" says Jordan. \"Where do the side effects come from? Can we improve this? They are look - ing at everything that they can to be able to find out advances useful for patients. So this is a big version of the Craig Jordan model, if you like.\" Doing the pharmacology: lessons from tamoxifen When Jordan started working with tamoxifen - then known as ICI 46 474 - in the 1970s, cancer researchers were betting heavily on the potential of combination chemotherapies to deliver a cure. At the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center, where Jordan arrived in 1980 to establish his laboratory to explore 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' aspects of tamoxifen. During the decade that fol- lowed, he discovered selective oestro- gen receptor modulators (SERMs) Cutting Edge 22 Spring 2020They had had a dramatic effect on curing childhood leukaemia and great progress was being made in Hodgkin's Disease. \"Most of the clinical community were con - vinced you could find the right lex - icon of drugs to give to any patient with any cancer and you could cure it.\" Breast cancer was a case in point, he says. \"Heroic efforts were being made to try to treat women with massive doses of chemother - apy and bone marrow transplants, and none of this worked.\" Tamox - ifen, meanwhile, an anti-oestro - genic compound that had just failed as a contraceptive, \"was just lying there\". Jordan has described how, fresh from completing his PhD at the University of Leeds on the pharma -cology of anti-oestrogens, he got the facilities (at the Worcester Founda - tion for Experimental Biology in the US) and the backing (from ICI in the UK) to explore the potential of tamoxifen in breast cancer - a story told in 'Tamoxifen the first targeted long term adjuvant therapy for breast cancer' ( Endocr-Relat Cancer 2014, 21:R235-246) ( Ann Surg Oncol 2019, 26:1981-90). However, it is what happened next, and over the following decades, that is probably more important for drawing lessons that can be applied to developing better cancer drugs today. Lesson 1: How can this drug save lives? - a conversation with nature The potential for treating breast cancer by cutting its access to oestrogen had been partly under - stood since the 1890s when George Beatson had shown that excising a woman's ovaries could delay the progress of some breast can - cers. However, ICI's chief interest in developing ICI 46 474 was as a contraceptive, so until Jordan got the go-ahead to work on the drug in the early 1970s, not a single anti- tumour experiment had been done with it in the laboratory. Arthur Walpole, who had been in charge of developing the agent as a contraceptive, but had a deep interest in cancer research, played a key role in convincing ICI not to ditch their drug at this point, but to advance it for approval as an orphan drug for use in advanced breast cancer. With his PhD back - ground in anti-oestrogens, Jordan was tasked with doing the phar - macology to understand about its mechanism of action and clinical opportunities. Tamoxifen's impact in the met - astatic setting, used across all tumours regardless of their hor - monal status, was not spectacular. With a response rate of around 30% and a duration of response of around one to two years, it was no better than the hormonal therapies - high-dose oestrogen or androgen - that were already in use. The side effect profile was admittedly bet - ter, but the costs were higher, and ICI were not convinced there was money to be made with it. But everything Jordan was learning about the drug was telling him that its true potential lay with a different strategy. His experiments with carcinogen-induced rat mam - mary cancers showed rapid tumour induction in controls, while those treated with tamoxifen remained completely tumour free: \"Two depot injections of tamoxifen, which each had a biological action for many months, completely wiped out the development of tumours.\" He also showed that adminis - tering the tamoxifen sooner after inducing tumours with carcino - gen was more effective than later, and that shorter duration delayed tumour development, but continu - ous administration had a long-term preventive effect (figure opposite). The pharmacology, which Jor - dan describes as \"a conversation with nature\", was telling him that the strength of tamoxifen lay in its potential as a preventive, or at least in very early disease. There were good reasons not to go down this route, however. Firstly, pre - vention would mean giving the This data was first presented at the King's College Cambridge Breast Cancer Symposium, September 1977. Jordan's argument that tamoxifen was best used as a continuous admin - istration in a preventive setting found a very mixed reception in a clinical audience, who insisted that the strategy would inevitably lead to resistance. Subsequent trials showed Jordan was right. Source: VC Jordan (2014) Endocrine-Related Cancer 21:R235-R246, republished with permissionNature says... continuous tamoxifen is the way to go Cutting Edge 23 Spring 2020drug to healthy women who may never go on to develop the disease, so the side effects and risk would have to be negligible. Secondly, it is always more difficult to demon - strate efficacy in prevention than treatment, as prevention measures non-events. And anyway there was a high degree of scepticism within the research community about the efficacy of the drug, says Jordan. \"They were saying 'With che - motherapy women get sick, we see their blood cells go down, we know it's killing cancer cells because it's killing their healthy cells as well. This has virtually no side effects and you are saying use this because you think it will be able to kill can - cer cells. You have no real evidence it will be able to do that.'\" For Jordan, however, the key question was never: What is the easiest endpoint to prove? Or what is the quickest route to a marketable drug? but rather: \"What will keep women alive?\" Lesson 2: Face down the sceptics - nature does not lie By the mid-1970s, and with Jor - dan now back in the UK, the concept of hitting cancer early was beginning to gain traction on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly in the form of adjuvant treatment following surgery for early breast cancer. \"My philos - ophy was that it is no good trying to cure people at the end of life. You've got to hit it strategically somewhere along the way that will become vul - nerable. That is after a woman had had a mastectomy and there are micrometastases around her body but we can't see them.\" In September 1977, at a packed Breast Cancer Symposium at King's College Cambridge, Jordan presented his data showing that, in rats, a continuous dose of tamoxi - fen could offer long-term protec- tion against breast cancer. It was here that he first argued the case for the potential of long-term use of tamoxifen in an adjuvant setting. The suggestion did not go down well. They were horrified, says Jor - dan, and protested that he wasn't a doctor, didn't understand anything about drug resistance, and pre - sented a danger. \"It was completely counterintuitive in cancer, having a therapy you give for ever. Everyone said it can't happen.\" Everything that clinicians had learnt about the limitations of sys - temic therapies - including tamox - ifen, which in advanced cancers stopped working after a year or two - pointed to the intractable problem of acquired resistance, says Jordan. The dominant feeling in the audi - ence - with a few important excep - tions - was that a strategy that risked The question was never: What is the easiest endpoint to prove? or What is the quickest route to market?With Bernie Fisher, one of the pioneers of breast conserving surgery with adju- vant therapy. Jordan and Fisher were the two inaugural winners of the Brink - er International Breast Cancer Award (1992) for basic and clinical research respectively. Cutting Edge 24 Spring 2020developing resistance in an adjuvant setting meant having one less option to use if the woman then went on to develop advanced disease. But Jordan's pharmacology was telling him long-term adjuvant treatment was the way to go. Unde - terred, he took his data to the US, where he presented his case to Paul Carbone, who was setting up the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center, one of six original compre - hensive cancer centres designated by the National Cancer Institute. Here he met a very different response. Carbone invited him to join them, and head the breast can - cer programme. Lesson 3: Find the right research environment The labs at Wisconsin became the cradle where the concept of selec- tive oestrogen receptor modulators was developed, where raloxifene, the second SERM after tamoxifen was developed, and where early work led to three further SERMs, each addressing multiple key women's health issues. Here, for the first time Jordan was based at an institute that treated patients, where clinicians and phar - macologists learned together via feedback loops between lab and clinic - long before the term 'trans - lational research' was coined. The very significant public funding made available as part of the 'War on Can - cer' gave researchers the freedom to pursue scientific strategies led by seeking solutions for patients, with - out constant pressure to demonstrate marketable applications for a drug, take out patents, or spin off biotech companies. So began the interaction with clin - ical trials organisations such as the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) led by Bernie Fisher, a key instigator of the trials of adjuvant chemotherapy, but also with triallists in the UK, such as Michael Baum - who was the first to trial adjuvant tamoxifen for two years rather than one (the stra - tegically named NATO trial) - and Helen Stewart, who ran the Scottish Adjuvant Tamoxifen trial that looked at the benefit of administering the drug for five years immediately after mastectomy compared with waiting until recurrence. The results of the Scottish trial showed \"significantly prolonged dis - ease-free survival\" in the adjuvant arm for patient population. It was not until more than 10 years later, however, with publication of the 1998 Oxford Overview Analysis - a meta-analysis of data from mul - tiple trials done on adjuvant breast cancer therapy at that time - that the true size of that benefit became clear. In premenopausal women whose tumours were oestrogen receptor positive, adjuvant tamoxifen given for one year produced no reduction in recurrence or death rates. Two years' administration produced a small benefit on both measures. Five years gave an astonishing 50% reduction in recurrence and a 30% reduction in death rates. If there's one lesson that Jordan wants to get across, it is this. The impact of tamoxifen used in advanced breast cancers gave no clue about its amazing potential given long-term in an adjuvant setting. \"Nobody could have predicted that at all.\" Winning the argument on the issue of resistance was an important key to that success - we now know that tamoxifen can continue to be administered for 10 years or more. Demonstrating that tamoxifen was a precision treatment that should only be used - and its value measured - in women with hormone-dependent breast cancer, was also key. Lesson 4: Mechanism of action - how tamoxifen became the first precision cancer therapy Jordan understood from the start that the oestrogen receptor was likely to play a key role in tamoxi - fen's mechanism of action. In 1973 The impact of tamoxifen in advanced breast cancers gave no clue about its amazing value in an adjuvant setting A snapshot of breast cancer history. The three men pictured here were key players in transforming the prognosis and management of early breast cancer in the final quarter of the twentieth century. Umberto Veronesi (centre) had pioneered the breast-conserving quadrantectomy and the sentinel node procedure in the 1970s and 80s. Gianni Bonadon - na (left) led the first clinical trials of adjuvant breast chemotherapy together with Vero- nesi. The picture was taken at the European Institute of Oncology (EIO) in Milan, where Jordan was presented with the 2001 EIO annual Breast Cancer Award. Jordan went on to win numerous further awards and accolades for his work, including the 2011 St Gallen Breast Cancer Award, presented by Hans-J\u00f6rg Senn, who had founded the St Gallen In - ternational Breast Cancer Conference to enable experts to review the emerging evidence on management of early breast cancer and formulate consensus recommendations. In 2016, Jordan, Senn, Veronesi and zur Hausen (who discovered the link between the human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) were named by the German Society for Gynaecology and Obstetrics as the 'Big Four of the Millennium' in recognition of their role creating the standard of care for women's health in the 21st Century. Cutting Edge 25 Spring 2020Elwood Jensen, who had identified the receptor some 17 years earlier, offered him the chance to visit Chicago to learn assay techniques. By 1975 Jordan's labs were able to show that tamoxifen blocks estra - diol binding to human tumour oes - trogen receptors. The pharmacology told him that, unlike cytotoxics, which tar - get every replicating cell, tamox - ifen would work only in certain breast cancers - those with high levels of oestrogen receptors. This was one of the first indications that that biological drivers behind breast cancer might not all be the same. But it took another 10 years before the concept of testing and selective administration was widely accepted, says Jordan. One reason for the delayed rec- ognition was that the pharmacologi - cal findings had not been confirmed in the original Scottish trial, or the NATO trial, probably due to a lack of preparation of the tissue before it got to the lab, which destroyed the oestrogen receptor. By the early 1990s, though, test - ing breast tumours for their hor - monal status became routine, sig - nalling the arrival of the concept of precision cancer medicine. Lesson 5: Search for 'the good, the bad and the ugly' Tamoxifen was now a block buster drug delivering unparalleled benefit to hundreds of thousands of women across the world. At this point, Jor - dan decided to do something that drug sponsors never do: he and his lab went back to the molecule to find out everything they could. \"I was trained as a pharmacol - ogist to look for the good, the bad and the ugly. You've got to be able to spot what is going to go wrong, so people do not die. We took it apart like nobody else had taken it apart. Nobody else was interested. The drug was on the market. Who cared?\" He had won the argument about long-term administration of a cancer drug. He would now take responsibility for exploring every aspect of its impact, to look for potential side effects and drivers of resistance. That is how Jordan - having devoted his career to a drug he believed in and steered to suc-cess - ended up as the person who sounded the alert over the raised risk of endometrial cancer associ - ated with taking tamoxifen. Jordan's lab had noticed that the drug had a uterine 'tickle' , induc- ing small changes, principally a thickening of the uterine wall. To find out more, his lab conducted experiments with immune-de - ficient mice, implanting human cancer cell lines, injecting oestro - gen to make them grow, and then administering tamoxifen. This time they introduced a breast cancer cell line on one side of the mouse, and an endometrial cancer cell line on Source: VC Jordan (2004) Cancer Cell 5:207-13, \u00a9 2004. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier The big surprise with the 'anti-oestrogen' drug tamoxifen was that it turned out to be anti-oestrogenic in some parts of the body while promoting oestrogen expression in others. The discovery led Jordan to develop the concept of developing selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that could deliver combinations of oestrogen agonist and antagonist effects to address multiple oestrogen-related health problems, including coronary heart dis- ease and osteoporosis, two of the biggest killers of women. The figure above was published by Jordan in Cancer Cell in 2004, with two SERMs already on the market, to illustrate the idea. At that time raloxifene - the second SERM - was already in widespread use as a treatment for osteoporosis that avoided some of the bad effects of the hormone replacement therapy then in standard use, while actively preventing breast cancer as a 'good side effect'. In 2007 the FDA approved raloxifene as a primary chemoprevention in women at high risk for breast cancer. Three further SERMs have since been approved for various indications.

The breast cancer was completely blocked by tamoxifen. Gone. But the animal was dragging around a huge endometrial cancer.\" Nothing was being flagged up in the clinical setting, however, so Jordan found it hard to get his con - cerns taken seriously. Taking mat - ters into his own hands, he decided to announce his findings at an international meeting he was due to address. His findings prompted a doctor, who was sitting in the audi - ence, to report some clinical cases of endometrial cancers in women he had treated with tamoxifen. A correspondence then opened in the pages of The Lancet between the doctor, Leonard Hardell, and Jordan. Jordan suggested checking the Scottish trial data for raised incidence of endometrial cancers. \"Never seen it!\" was the response, says Jordan. But then the Scottish trial, reported in The Lancet in 1987, had never actually collected data on the incidence of endome - trial cancers. In the end it was a Scandinavian clinical trials group cancer registry that delivered the smoking gun. \"They looked at their data gathered on five years of tamoxifen versus two years versus control, and said we were right... They had nine years of data, but they hadn't looked at it.\" Yet again, says Jordan, it was the pharmacological work and not the clinical data that brought this essential information to light. Subsequent studies revealed that the raised endometrial risk only affected women post-menopause, as monthly menstruation is a pro - tective factor. This finding destroyed Jordan's hopes of a chemopreventive role for tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. But it did mean that, by the time chemoprevention trials on tamoxifen derivatives began, researchers were looking at the whole gynaecological picture. This was due to the work of his lab. \"I consider it one of the best things I have ever done,\" he says . Lesson 6: Can we do better? Raloxifene and more... Painstaking exploration of 'the good, the bad and the ugly' had revealed not only the heightened risk of endometrial cancers, it also revealed some potentially 'good' and completely counterintuitive effects of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen was only selectively anti-oestrogenic, and actually acted as an oestrogen agonist in some instances. \"It would switch on and switch off sites around the wom - an's body that nobody had ever seen before,\" says Jordan. \"Anti-oestrogen was thought to be anti-oestrogenic everywhere in the body, so it would cause osteoporosis, it would cause The discovery that tamoxifen was hydroxylated to the metabolite 4-hydrotamoxifen was first reported in 1977. That metabolite became the leading compound in medicinal chem - istry for the synthesis for raloxifene, which has 100 times the binding affinity of tamoxifen for the oestrogen receptor, and was approved in 1997 as a treatment for osteoporosis that also prevented breast cancer. Source: VC Jordan et al (1977) J Endocrinol 75:305-16The start of SERM chemistry Cutting Edge 27 Spring 2020coronary heart disease... What we found was that tamoxifen tickles the bones to make them stay strong, and it lowered circulating cholesterol.\" He developed the idea of look - ing for derivatives of tamoxifen that might carry no risk of endometrial cancer, but could treat coronary heart disease (a bigger killer than breast cancer among women) and treat osteoporosis (another major killer of older women, due to complications of fractures), while preventing breast cancer at the same time. That is how the concept of selec- tive oestrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, was born in 1989, with the ability to \"treat multiple diseases with one pill\". Being the 'go-to' lab for all things related to oestrogen receptors and anti-oestrogen, over the years Jor - dan had accumulated a number of tamoxifen-like synthetic compounds that he'd been asked to test against tamoxifen. He now turned his atten - tion to pulling together information about this group of drugs. Persistence and the deep knowl - edge accumulated over 30 years specialising in this area, paid off in 1997 with approval of raloxifene - the second SERM discovered in Jordan's lab - for treating osteopo - rosis. The drug carried none of the risk of endometrial cancer associ - ated with tamoxifen but gave pro tection (though only 75% as effec- tively as tamoxifen) against breast cancer when taken continuously. A theroretical study, ten years later, that compared rates of new breast cancers among women treated for osteoporosis with ral - oxifene compared to the then-stan- dard hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or bisphosphonates, showed how effective this strategy was. Applying the different rates to the 500,000 women estimated to have been treated with raloxifene across the world, analysis suggested that over a ten-year period, about 27,000 breast cancers were being prevented as a side effect of active treatment for osteoporosis - a marked success for the chemoprevention strategy Jordan had always believed in ( EJC 2006, 42:2909-13) In 2007, the FDA extended the indication for raloxifene for pri - mary use in preventing breast can - cer for women known to be at par - ticularly high risk. Three further related SERMs have since come to market: baze - doxifene - approved in Europe and the US as part of a treatment for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the preven - tion of postmenopausal osteopo - rosis; ospemifene - approved on both sides of the Atlantic for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to meno - pause; and lasofoxifene. The last of these - \"an old drug from the con - traceptive days,\" and \"a miracle of medicinal chemistry\", according to Jordan - decreases fractures from osteoporosis using 1% of the dose required for equivalent impact with raloxifene, while also reducing breast cancer, stroke and - a first for any SERM - coronary heart disease, though with increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. Sadly, says Jordan, due to the intricacies of pharma marketing strategies, lasofoxifene has been left sitting on the shelf, approved but not marketed in Europe, and not even approved yet in the US. Can drug development get back on track? A 2014 review on Past, Present and Future Challenges in Breast Cancer Treatment, written by a star cast of authors and published to mark the 50th anniversary of ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology), claimed that In November 2019 Jordan was appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George by the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace, in recognition of his contribution to the field of women's health. This is one of the highest honours given in recognition for service at an international level, and usually reserved for service in the diplomatic sphere. Photo \u00a9 PA Credit: PA Cutting Edge 28 Spring 2020anti-oestrogen treatments had argu - ably had \"greater global impact that any other treatment intervention in cancer medicine,\" ( JCO 2014, 32:1979-86). The reference included not just tamoxifen and its derivatives, which work through selective modulation of oestrogen receptors, but also aro - matase inhibitors, a newer class of drugs introduced in the mid-2000s that work by suppressing oestrogen production. The value of tamoxifen itself, says Jordan, can be measured by the fact that 25 years on it has not been replaced, and is still used as treat - ment for advanced disease, as an adjuvant in early disease, as a treat - ment for ductal carcinoma in situ, as chemoprevention in high-risk premenopausal women, and in male breast cancer. \"No other therapy has that penetration in cancer across the board.\" Contrast this with the drugs that have come on the market in the age of molecular biology and precision cancer medicine. A 2017 study in the British Medical Journal reported that, from 2009 to 2013, the Euro - pean Medicines Agency approved 48 cancer drugs for 68 indications. Of the 44 drug indications that did not show a survival benefit at time of approval, and with a median of 5.4 years' follow up (3.3-8.1 yrs), three (7%) were subsequently shown to extend life after market entry, and five (11%) were associated with some improvements in quality of life ( BMJ 2017, 359:j4530). Jordan argues that one big fac- tor is that governments have ceded the task of drug development to the private sector, \"which is expected to raise private capital and get it done\". The public money that funded much of his early work at the University of Leeds and at Wisconsin has all but dried up. In the US, he says, only around 1 in 15 young scientists can get a grant today - in his day it was 1 in 4. \"[Governments argue] Why should we fund the research? Go out and start your own biotech com - pany and raise private capital and get it done.\" Pharmaceutical companies have also stopped doing their own drug development work. \"Places like [ICI/Astra Zeneca's] Alderley Park, which developed dozens and doz - ens of world beating drugs, all that has been closed down.\" Biotechs, meanwhile, measure their success in terms of coming up with \"an idea that looks like it has promise - that big pharma will buy.\" But at no point is anyone invest - ing in the pharmacological work to turn that promise into a really effec- tive drug, says Jordan. Although targeted therapies go to a specific gene target, he says, there are no tests to put the gene target and response to the therapy together. \"Nobody is doing that. It is 'suck it and see' with every one of them. We've gone back to the days before the oestrogen receptor and SERMs.\" He sees Glivec and Herceptin as rare exceptions \"[They are] the benchmarks of the past generation. But now we have 200 different tar - geted drugs and where do you start? \"Now I think it has all gone so far adrift, into what we can find from the sequencing machine, that we have lost the skills to be able to ask the questions about how is this treatment going to impact on this disease, and what is the good, bad and ugly of my new drug?\"Spotlight30 Spring 2020 Women make great surgeons, so why is the profession still dominated by men? Once seen as an exclusive 'men's club', women have broken into the surgical profession over the past 50 years and proved their value. Yet they remain significantly underrepresented, particularly at the higher echelons, even in countries where family responsibilities are no longer a major barrier to a career. Simon Crompton asks why, and what has to change? \u00a9 Vito Manolo RomaSpotlight31 Spring 2020Professor Isabel Rubio is - geon at the top of her profes- sion. She is Director of Breast Surgery at Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Madrid. She is Presi- dent-elect of the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSO- MA) and head of public affairs at the European Society of Surgical Oncol- ogy (ESSO). And yet, when male surgeons introduce her, they use her first name when other men are given their sur - name and title. When she suggests conference sessions on women in surgery, some male colleagues say they don't see the need. And recently, when a society she was involved in decided to publish a booklet on surgery, it somehow escaped every - body's notice - apart from hers - that every single surgeon pictured was male. None of this is as bad as the patronising attitudes Rubio encoun - tered on her way up the surgical lad - der, when she was often treated as if she were a child - male colleagues regularly suggested she didn't have their stamina and told her to take a break while they ploughed on. None - theless, such everyday expressions of sexist attitudes do have an impact. \"Our unconscious attitudes, which have arisen from pre-formed asso - ciations, can affect what we say and do without our knowledge - and may even contradict our conscious beliefs,\" says Rubio. This affects how women progress in surgery. And without enough women at the top, where are the role models for future female surgeons? How will the gen - der gap in cancer surgery ever be closed? \"There are too few female men - tors in surgery and the lack of female role models in surgical leadership contributes to the perpetuation of male stereotypes,\" says Rubio. Women in surgery: the numbers How much have such attitudes affected the number of women enter - ing, and staying in, surgical special - ities? Although getting authoritative statistics on the number of women cancer surgeons across Europe is difficult, the disparity between gen - ders is clear. A forthcoming survey from the European Union of Med - ical Specialists (UEMS) indicates that in most European countries the proportion of women surgeons is 30% to 40%, while in some coun - tries it is as low as 20%. Given that the number of women surgical trainees in some European countries now equals the number of men, there's hope that greater equality is on the way. However, not all of those will choose to pur - sue a career in surgery, says breast surgeon Malin Sund, a professor of surgery at Ume\u00e5 University, Swe - den, who organised the UEMS sur - vey. She points to findings showing a relatively high dropout rate in many countries. While the num - ber of trained women surgeons not actively working as surgeons is very low in Nordic countries, the UK and Netherlands, it is higher in Germany and reaches 25% in some southern European countries. \"In these countries there are a lot of female surgeons who have trained and then decide not to work as sur - geons - which is of course a terrible loss to the system, and a catastrophe for the women themselves,\" she says. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that those women who do stay in the profession appear to face far more obstacles than men in reaching the surgical heights. Equal - ity in positions of seniority is still a long way off. Changing attitudes Surgery has traditionally been seen as a profession involving characteristics that are stereotypi - cally ascribed to men: aggression, courage and the ability to make split-second decisions in the face of life-threatening risks. But in recent decades, increas - ing numbers of women surgeons have broken into what was once regarded as an exclusive 'men's club' , challenging these outdated assumptions. Between 1970 and the mid 1990s the UK saw a ten - fold increase in women surgeons. Thanks in large part to tech - nical progress, the split-second decisions taken in high-risk sit - uations are now seen as far less important than good planning and preparation. Being good at listening and communicating - characteristics more closely asso - ciated with women - are now seen as essential clinical skills. At the same time, these stereotypes have themselves been challenged, with the recognition that men can be caring and attentive, while women can be aggressive and courageous - though such behaviour is often still seen as less acceptable in female surgeons than in their male counterparts ( Human Orga - nization 1997, 56:47-52). The biggest driver of changing attitudes was probably down to the pioneering women who began to join the profession in ever increas - ing numbers, and proved their com - petence in the operating theatre.Spotlight32 Spring 2020\"Those women who do stay in the profession appear to face far more obstacles than men in reaching the surgical heights\"That competence was recently confirmed in a Canadian matched cohort study of postoperative outcomes published in the BMJ , which provided evidence of what everyone already knows: women make just as good surgeons as men. If not better. It found that patients treated by female sur - geons had a small but statistically significant decrease in 30-day mortality and had similar surgical outcomes compared with those treated by male surgeons ( BMJ 2017, 359:j4366). So the question remains: why is it that women are still signifi - cantly underrepresented in sur - gery as a whole, and particularly at the higher echelons of the pro - fession? Is protecting family life the problem? If surgery still has a gender problem, what lies at the root of it? Could it simply be the old issue of how to combine fam - ily demands with the demands of a traditionally high-pressure career? Data from 'implicit bias' testing of surgeons, published in JAMA Network Open in 2019, found that male surgeons had a tendency to associate men with career and surgery and women with family and family medicine. \"It's true that balancing family and surgery sometimes is difficult and I think that this is one reason that women refrain from entering surgical specialties,\" says Rubio. \"But I don't think we should be focusing on that. It's far more complex than that.\" Malin Sund, who became the first ever female professor of sur - gery in Sweden in 2013, believes the family issue is definitely sig - nificant, but is more important in some countries than others. Swe - den is one of the countries where the number of women in surgical training is equal to men. \"In the Nordic countries, with our generous social support and good quality day care, it's fully possible to be a practising surgeon and mother, whereas in many countries that might not be the case,\" she says. \"There are stud - ies showing that academic sur - geons tend to have no children or fewer children than other female physicians, but whether you have to make that sacrifice depends on the country you live in. \"Our survey responses from southern European countries tend to focus on the difficulties of organising family life. So it wasn't doing the surgery itself that was the problem, but the expected lifestyle of the surgeon - that the work hours are very hard to com - bine with a functioning family. In the more northern countries, the problems were less about exter - nal day care, and more about the division of labour in the home: a lot seems to depend on who you choose to start a family with.\"Is bias and lack of role models the problem? But there is more going on than lack of financial and social support. Even in Nordic countries there are concerns about equality, not because there aren't enough women in cancer surgery but because there are not enough women at the top of cancer surgery. This isn't just an issue about being able to stay in the profession; it's about being able to be successful in the profession. Recent research suggests that, although we may like to think that the days of glass ceilings and job discrimination are over, women still face far more obstacles than men in reaching the surgical heights. A UK survey of women surgeons published in the BMJ this year found that 59% had reported or witnessed discrimination. Trauma surgery and orthopaedics were identified as having the most sexist cultures by more than half of respondents. More than one in five said they perceived a \"glass ceiling\" in surgical training ( BMJ Open 2019, 9:e024349). In the US, a recent survey of plastic surgeons revealed similar findings. Women were more likely than men to have experienced sex - ism or bias, and were less likely to feel recognised for ideas, author - ship, promotions, or pay rises. Women also felt that their sex was a disadvantage in career advance - ment ( Plast Reconstr Surg 2018, 142:252-64). As Isabel Rubio points out, role models are important here. Her own mentor, Suzanne Klimberg, was an important influence during her US Fellowship - and after - wards. \"I saw how she worked and Spotlight33 Spring 2020\"Networks that develop before and during training become somehow self- promoting of men\"how she had the same difficulties as me, but she still succeeded. Seeing a woman who can achieve anything - give talks at big congresses, be president of societies, be chief of breast surgery - helped me a lot. It helped me realise that I didn't have to enter into the male thing of demonstrating that you can operate for 12 hours at a stretch, for exam - ple. We can do it our own way and be just as good.\" Malin Sund agrees that role models help young female surgeons see a way of navigating the system. Until they become more common and visible, there may be problems making any ambition seem realis - tic. But she points to another prob - lem continually pulling that kind of aspiration back. Is it about 'old-boys' networks' and just being different? The UEMS survey showed that women feel excluded from the male-dominated networks where promotions are unofficially discussed and decided. \"This is interesting from a Scandinavian or Swedish perspective, because I don't think women don't get up the hierarchy because men aren't being nice. It's just that the networks that develop before training and during training become somehow self-pro - moting of men,\" says Sund. Facing such issues is key if women are to be properly repre - sented in the highest echelons of cancer surgery, according to can - cer surgeon Peter Naredi, Profes - sor of Surgery at the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska Uni - versity Hospital, Sweden. He points out that, while socio -economic factors may still explain the gender imbalance in those seeking a career in surgery in many areas of Europe, this is no longer a major factor in countries like Sweden - and yet the gender ratio remains stubbornly weighted towards men. \"In Sweden both the man and the woman have to take maternity or paternity leave and you don't lose too much on your pension if you are home with kids for two years. Yet even if parents share the social responsibilities, it is still hardly changing the ratio of female to male surgeons.\" Part of the problem, says Naredi, is lack of opportunity for younger entrants. \"We are so many older surgeons taking up the space.\" So in northern and western Europe, it's partly a matter of wait - ing for \"old dinosaurs like myself\" to move on, he says, leaving space for women coming up through the ranks. But Naredi worries that there is still a considerable and subtle barrier preventing this - the uncon - scious discriminatory force which he recognises he himself, as a male, is part of. \"When I'm looking for a succes - sor as head of my breast surgical unit, or of a research group that I'm running, there's an official system in place that's very objective. But in practice, what you tend to do is choose someone who's very much like you. As the present - male - head, you might think of that male surgeon, 20 years younger than you, who you've been working with for 15 years. And then you find argu - ments why this person has more merits than the female surgeon who has also been working with you for 15 years.\" And so, the male dominance of senior positions continues. \"This is the hidden network,\" says Naredi. Truly promoting equality in sur - gery, he says, means choosing peo - ple according to formal compe - tence, not whether they 'fit in'. \"We need the most competent person, the person who can diver - sify the cancer care, can look at how we serve our society best. There are some countries in Europe, and in the United States, where this has become standard practice, while in other countries we are 10 to 20 years away from that and we con - tinue to choose persons according to the hidden network.\" From the exception to the rule No matter how much has been achieved in some countries, the current experiences of women surgeons tell their own story. Isabel Rubio thinks of all those board meetings of surgical societ - ies where she wishes there would be many more women - not sim - ply because she feels outnum - bered, but because women and men often approach things differ - ently. \"It's not a fight, because we need men to work all this out too and to understand that there is a problem with gender bias. To solve it, there's a need for every - one to realise that some things need to change.\"Sakari Karjalainen, President of the Association of European Cancer Leagues (ECL), Secretary General of the Cancer Society of Finland, Finnish Cancer Registry, and the Cancer Foundation of Finland Celebrating 40 years of reducing the impact of cancer on people's lives The Association of European Cancer Leagues (ECL), a network of national and regional cancer leagues all over Europe, is celebrating 40 years of actions to reduce the impact of cancer. It was founded in Rome by 14 prominent leagues and 21 well-known cancer experts in 1980, to fight against a disease that was considered a death sentence at the time. Cancer knows no borders and is relentless. And so has been our collective determination to fight it. In the 1980s, cancer mortality was projected to rise beyond the year 2000. Today, not only have mortality rates in Europe declined, but we have sufficient knowledge to prevent half of all cancers. Our members have helped translate scientific findings into concrete actions. What seemed impossible is now a reality. ECL members are the main public resource for cancer control information and services. Sharing the ambition of eliminating cancer, nothing less is good enough for us or for the citizens, patients and survivors we serve. The ECL network has empowered cancer leagues to accelerate cancer research and actions to support patients and their loved ones. In 40 years of existence, ECL has grown in achievements and leadership. ECL's eminent status in cancer control in Europe today is due to successful collaboration, including with the World Health Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the European Commission, the European Parliament and others. Co-funding from the European Union has enabled ECL to intensify our work, especially in influencing policy, raising awareness of prevention through the European Code Against Cancer, encouraging Youth Ambassadors to improve dissemination among young people, and enhancing networking opportunities for leagues to share best practice and collaborate more efficiently, especially to reduce health inequalities. The Future In the next 40 years, we seek to put ourselves out of business. Our vision is nothing less than a future without cancer. To some this will sound utopian. How can we aim for a cancer- free Europe when experts are predicting that more people will be diagnosed with cancer because we are living longer, and cancer is an age-related set of diseases? While we do not have all the answers, the following considerations will be key: Prevention is the best cure. A more robust approach to research on innovative cancer prevention and treatment solutions is needed. Cancer is a health inequality issue that cannot be resolved by the health sector alone. A substantial amount of data and expertise is available across the continent; we must collaborate to make the most of these tools. Our major projects for this anniversary year are to: encourage countries to step up tobacco control efforts such as outlined in the new tobacco control country ranking report (www.tobaccocontrolscale.org) ensure that EU policies and the regulatory environment support collaboration across the cancer community and strengthen the role of representative organisations, such as the ECL shape the #EUCancerPlan and Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goal 3.4. Call to Action On this 40th anniversary, ECL calls on everyone to join the dedicated efforts of cancer leagues. As the European Commissioner Kyriakides said at a conference on Better Access to Cancer Treatment, in December 2019, \"We don't have to look too far for inspiration. The European Cancer Leagues are doing incredible work.\" Our impact on cancer control and our good reputation are based on the strong influence of cancer leagues all over Europe. Together, we can make beating cancer a Mission Possible. Risks & Benefits35 Spring 2020The unique toxicities of CAR T cell therapy Toxicities related to CAR T cell therapy are very different from the toxic side effects associated with classical chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Oncologists need to know what to look out for, how to assess them and how best to manage them. Elena Riboldi reports on what is known and what needs further research. The advent of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T cell) therapy generated great ex- citement in the field of onco-hae- matology. Clinical trials have shown remarkable results in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell malignan- cies, and two CAR T cell products have been approved in the US and in Europe. Efforts are now underway to extend this approach to other haema-tological malignancies and even to solid tumours. Yet the clinical trials that have shown the huge potential of CAR T cells, at the same time revealed their unique toxicities. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurologic syndrome (ICANS) are two key tox - icities associated with CAR T cell therapy, though other adverse events also occur and need to be taken into consideration in clinical practice. The morbidity associated with the side effects is not irrelevant. Though generally reversible, on rare occa - sions it has led to death. Oncologists need to know how to diagnose and manage toxicities related to CAR T cell therapy. According to published studies, after CD19-targeted CAR T cell ther -\u00a9 Sara CorsiCytotoxic T cells (CD8) are lymphocytes that can be armed to recognise and destroy cancer cells via the antigens they display on their surfaces. This can be prepared by harvesting a patient's own T cells from their blood, with a process called apheresis, isolating the cells, and then introducing a chimeric antigen into them, which is done by inserting a gene, mostly using a viral vector, as if 'infecting' the cell with the antigen receptor gene. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a fusion protein. The extracellular portion of the re- ceptor is an antibody-derived targeting domain. It is constituted by the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody directed against an antigen expressed by cancer cells. The chimeric construct then enables the cell to express and localise the chimeric antigen re- ceptor to the surface of the T cell, from which location it will be able to recognise a specific marker (known as an antigen) on a cell's surface. Many different antigens exist on cells, but to date most CARs have been designed to recognise a marker called CD19, which is found on the surface of all B cells (the white blood cells responsible for producing antibodies), including the malignant B cells that cause certain leukaemias and lymphomas. The modified T cells are then cultured and returned to the patient in a single infusion. This is usually preceded by a course of chemotherapy, designed to deplete the patient's own immune cells, which helps the CAR T cells to multiply in the patient's body. The CAR T cells then fuse to cancer cells thanks to the CD19 marker, which initiates several signalling pathways, leading to elimination of the targeted cancer cell as well as triggering the 'expansion' (multiplication) of the CAR T cells.CAR T cells at a glance Risks & Benefits 36 Spring 2020apy, CRS was experienced in differ - ent grades by 37%-93% of patients with lymphoma and 77%-93% of patients with leukaemia. Rates of any grade ICANS were, respectively, 27%-67% and 40%-62%. In the early clinical trials, approximately half of the patients needed intensive care management. The task of developing optimal strategies for managing these toxici - ties has been hindered by the consid - erable variation in the way they have been assessed and graded across clinical trials and across institutions. In an attempt to address this problem, in 2019 the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Ther - apy (ASTCT) published recommen - dations for \"an objective, easy-to- apply and accurate classification of CAR T cell-related toxicities,\" based on a consensus reached by almost 50 experts in the field ( Biol Blood Mar - row Transplant 2019, 25:625-38). Sattva Neelapu, from the Depart - ment of Lymphoma/Myeloma, at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, is the senior author of the ASTCT consensus recommen - dations. He emphasises that CRS and ICANS can be fatal if not rec- ognised. Therefore, patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy need to be managed by specialised teams including physicians with expertise in these toxicities, intensive care specialists and neurologists. Things may be more complicated when the therapy is administered in the outpatient setting. In those cases, patients should be hospitalised as soon as they develop a symptom or sign of toxicity, and caregivers must be taught to recognise symptoms of ICANS.Be aware, spot the signs Cytokine release syndrome Neelapu outlines some of the signs and symptoms to look out for. \"The first clinical manifestation of CAR T cell toxicity is cytokine release syndrome. It usually starts with fever, that can even exceed 40\u00b0C,\" he says. \"Other symptoms are malaise, head - ache, myalgias, and tachycardia. Pos - sible manifestations include organ dysfunctions, cytopenias, and coag - ulopathy. In severe cases, patients can develop life-threatening capil - lary leakage with hypoxia and hypo - tension.\" Rarely, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis - a condition in which the body makes too many activated immune cells - can arise. CRS usually occurs in the first week after CAR T cell infusion, although delayed CRS is possible. Time to resolution is generally seven to eight days, but some patients may need more than 30 days to recover. Immune effector cell associated neurologic syndrome Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) may occur as a CAR T cell related encephalopathy syndrome. The clinical manifestations of ICANS are very wide ranging, as toxicity does not affect a specific region of the central nervous system. They include encephalopathy (con - fusion or delirium), expressive apha - sia or language disturbance, motor weakness, myoclonus or tremor, headache, seizures, and a depressed level of consciousness. In rare cases patients can rapidly develop diffuse cerebral oedema. Expressive apha - sia seems to be a typical symptom. ICANS onset can range from a few hours to three to four weeks after The mechanism underlying cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is essentially a 'cy - tokine storm', which produces and sustains a systemic inflammatory response, says Sattva Neelapu, from the Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. Activated T cells and bystander immune cells, such as monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic pathogenesis of immune effector cell-associated neurologic syndrome (ICANS), by contrast, is largely unknown, he says. \"It is linked with a strong production of cytokines, but none of the cytokines seems specific. Se- vere ICANS is associated with increased blood-cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] barrier permeability. Elevated levels of cytokines in the CSF may result from both influx and local production.\" The accumulation of glutamate and quinolinic acid (two excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate recep - tor agonists) in the CSF may explain some of the symptoms, adds Neelapu. The finding that patients with severe CRS and ICANS have high blood levels of angio poietin-2 also suggests an involvement of endothelial cell activation.Pathogenesis of CAR T cell therapy toxicities Risks & Benefits 37 Spring 2020CAR T cell infusion. It can occur almost simultaneously with CRS or even after CRS has resolved. ICANS is usually self-limiting, and most symptoms reverse in three to four weeks, with persistent abnormalities being uncommon. Predictors of severe toxic effects Both treatment-specific and patient-specific factors have a role in determining the gravity of CAR T cell related toxicities, says Neelapu. \"The severity of CRS has been cor - related with the peak of in vivo CAR T cell proliferation and disease bur - den. A faster T cell expansion can be promoted by higher cell dose, heavily pretreated bone marrow disease, and also by some kinds of precondition - ing, such as fludarabine-containing regimens.\" The risk of severe CRS is also increased in patients with comorbidities and in those who develop the syndrome within three days of infusion. Severe ICANS develops almost only in patients who have experi - enced CRS, adds Neelapu, with severity being influenced by disease type, disease burden, patient's age, and treatment history. Differences in the design of the chimeric antigen receptor may account for variations in toxicity between different CAR T cell prod - ucts. Second-generation CARs con - tain an intracellular domain, called co-stimulatory domain, derived from either CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137), to enhance CAR T cell survival and pro - liferation. CD28-based CAR T cells expand rapidly, while 4-1-BB-based CAR T cells expand more slowly. CRS has an earlier onset with CD28- based CAR T cells, and higher rates of severe neurotoxicity have been observed with CD28-based CAR T cell products. However, an associ - ation between the severity of these toxicities and a particular co-stimu - latory domain has not been conclu - sively demonstrated. The search for biomarkers to predict which patients are likely to develop severe CAR T cell related toxicities, before they become criti - cally ill, is an active field of research. Grading toxicities For CRS, the ASTCT consensus grading is three elements: fever, hypotension, and hypoxia ( Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2019, 25:625-38). Severity can range from grade 1 to 4, with the grade being determined by the most severe event. The consensus panel that agreed on the recommendations took the decision to focus on criteria that could be measured in the clinic rather than the laboratory, for pragmatic reasons. \"Significant alterations in many labo -ratory parameters clearly occur with CRS,\" they wrote. \"Cytokine aberra - tions have been well described, but such data are not routinely available in most academic centres in a time frame that is useful for assigning grade and planning management of a patient experiencing CRS.\" They nonetheless encourage clinical teams to monitor cytokines, C-reactive pro - tein, ferritin levels, and other param - eters, \"so that additional data may be generated for future study\". For ICANS, the ASCTC consen - sus grading is based on elements: the 10-point ICE (immune effec- tor cell-associated encephalopathy) score, depressed level of conscious - ness, seizure, motor findings, and ele - vated intracranial pressure/cerebral oedema. Severity can range from grade 1 to grade 4, with the grade determined by the most severe event. The ICE score is a tool that mea - sures alterations in speech, orienta - tion, handwriting, and concentration. For children aged 12 or younger, the ICE score is replaced by the Cor -Scientists are working to generate more potent immune effector cells. However, the increase in persistence that would raise CAR T cell anti-tu- mour efficacy carries the risk of more severe toxicity. From that per - spective, a 'safety switch' would be highly desirable. Franco Locatelli's group at the Bambino Ges\u00f9 paediatric hospital in Rome has developed a 4-1-BB-based CD19-specific CAR construct that incorporates an inducible caspase 9 (iC9) safety switch. The gene of human caspase 9 has been engineered with a drug-binding domain. By administering a nontoxic compound, the iC9 dimerises and activates the cascade domain. In the event of uncontrolled toxicity, CAR T cells can thus be killed by apoptosis within a few hours. Other, more radical, innovative changes include changing cell type. \"We are working on tri-als using CAR-Natural Killer (NK) cells, because this strategy could offer several advantages in comparison to CAR-T cells,\" says Locatelli. He sees a number of advantages to this approach. \"First, possibly - although it has to be validated in the clinical setting - the NK cell-related toxicity could be lower than that of CAR T cells, because the cytokine production of NK cells has a less toxic, more favourable pro- file.\" Second, the cells could be immediately available, he says, \"We can figure out how to prepare banks of CAR-NK cells.\" A great advantage is that they can be obtained without the blood apheresis process needed for patients' T cells enrichment. Third, he concludes, the cancer cell kill- ing effect of the NK cells is greater than that of the T cells, as NK cells are the most potent cytotoxic lymphoid cells in the body.Making CAR T cell therapies safer Risks & Benefits 38 Spring 2020nell Assessment of Pediatric Delir - ium. \"The updated encephalopathy screening tool includes elements for assessing the receptive aphasia seen in these patients,\" write the authors of the consensus recommendations, but they add that, while the ICE screening tool is helpful for assessing patients for encephalopathy, the grading of ICANS requires not only assessment of the ICE score but also evaluation of other neurologic domains, as other manifestations can occur with or without encephalopathy. Managing toxicities The standard of care for CRS is tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist. If the patient does not respond to tocilizumab, corticoste - roids can be effective in reversing CRS. Some data suggest that the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody sil - tuximab or the IL-1 antagonist anak - inra may have clinical efficacy. In CRS, patients can require vasopres - sors to correct hypotension and oxy - gen supply or intubation for hypoxia. Tocilizumab is not generally rec- ommended for isolated ICANS. In fact, some studies showed a slight increase in severe ICANS rates in patients treated with this antibody. Corticosteroids are widely used to treat ICANS, but type and dose can differ significantly between institu - tions. Intubation is critical in patients with ICANS who have severely impaired consciousness. Speaking at the 2019 Congress of the European Hematology Association, Stanley Riddell, Scientific Director of the Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center at the Fred Hutchinson Can - cer Research Center in Seattle, high - lighted the importance of timing and dose in managing CRS.\"There are now algorithms to treat CRS with blocking antibodies to cytokines and with steroids, but the timing when you administer those medications can be really critical in determining the patient's outcome. Being aware of the complications and intervening at the right time and with the appro - priate dose of those medications is important,\" he said. Riddell emphasised the urgent need to understand more about the pathogenesis of CRS, to work out and test better ways to manage it. While it is clear that CRS is initiated by the T cells recognising the cancer cells and producing cytokines, he said, \"After that there is a cascade of events that is very complicated, involving different cell types.\" He pointed to the unexpected finding of several recent studies which showed that, in preclinical models, a major mediator of CRS is adren - aline or its catecholamines. \"In the clinic, when patients get CRS, we give them catecholamines to treat their blood pressure, so we are maybe throwing fuel on the fire in some circumstances.\" Riddell anticipates \"some major advances\" in strategies to avert CRS over the coming year or two. \"We need to do the scientific research to understand the patho - genesis and then we need to do the clinical work to test interventions in a logical way on controlled clin - ical trials, so that we understand which ones are working and which ones do not work,\" he said. Right now, it is a manageable problem, he added, \"And I am pretty confident that it will be getting increasingly manageable in the future.\" \u00a9 Vito Manolo Roma Impact Factor 41 Spring 2020Dr Fraud's jungle, where science is the prey With the advent of Open Access - a new publishing model that asks researchers to pay to make their research publicly accessible - unscrupulous predators were granted easy access to a house full of na\u00efve scientists and doctors, and today thrive at their expense, and at the expense of science, including cancer research. Fabio Turone reports. \"The email appeared legitimate. It spelled my name correctly, referenced some of my previ- ous work, and used correct grammar. The jour - nal wasn't on Beall' s List of Predatory Journals and Pub- lishers. I thought I had done my due diligence. I submitted my manuscript. Shortly after, I celebrated the first round of favorable reviews. Things were going great - or so I thought. \" More and more scientists - like Alan Chambers who recently wrote his dramatic story in Science maga- zine ('How I became easy prey to a predatory publisher') Impact Factor42 Spring 2020- are experiencing the hard way a nasty side-effect of the revolution that shook the world of scientific publishing and conferences, to increase access to published research. Black sheep in disguise Several animal metaphors - from black sheep to sharks - have started to pop up because new, unusual and danger - ous 'beasts' started making their appearance on the desks and in the mailboxes of scientists of all disciplines: pub - lishers who lure academics and researchers into publish - ing in journals with impressive names, and into presenting their research at conferences abroad. More and more often, academics and researchers are ceremoniously invited to sit on editorial boards and even chair them, regardless of their qualifications and scientific production. Those invitations are sent by the new actors in the pub - lishing arena: A journal editor called them 'black sheep' back in 2008 (http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com), but the expression that stuck with the international scientific community to describe unscrupulous publishers and con - ference organisers was 'predators'. It was Jeffrey Beall - then librarian-researcher at the University of Denver, in Colorado - who coined the expres - sion 'predatory journals and publishers' , back in 2010. Will - ing to warn scientists about the risks, in 2008 he had started to publish a blacklist, which was freely available online. At first, one might assume that fraudsters are easy to dis - tinguish from honest enterprises but research shows that the opposite is true: in developed countries such as Germany, the UK and Italy, as many as 5% of academics like Cham - bers continue to fall prey to these shady operations. A fast-growing and changing scenario According to the most recent report by the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (bit.ly/2018-STM-Report), \"there were about 33,100 active scholarly peer-reviewed English-language journals in mid-2018 (plus a further 9,400 non-English-language journals), collectively publishing over 3 million articles a year\". These numbers keep growing, at an accelerating pace: \"The num - ber of articles published each year and the number of jour - nals have both grown steadily for over two centuries, by about 3% and 3.5% per year respectively,\" the report con - tinues. \"However, growth has accelerated to 4% per year for articles and over 5% for journals in recent years.\" The number of 'predatory' journals - which generally go hand in hand with conferences based on the same lack of scientific scrutiny - has also grown very rapidly: accord - ing to estimates, there were 8,000 predatory journals in 2014. This drains some $75 mn from legitimate operations, essentially through the publication fees that legitimate jour - nals use to replace lost income from subscriptions. As of August 2018, the most recent figure from Cabell's - a publisher that started offering a blacklist at a hefty price - was of 9,179 journals verified as predatory. This list began after legal threats and all kinds of pressures convinced Jef - frey Beall to remove his own list. In this scenario, researchers looking for an outlet to pres - ent their research to the world in a legitimate way,have a really hard time. The hunter, the hunted and the exploiter According to a recent analysis of the scientific produc- tion of all Italian academics who applied for the National Scientific Qualification to get access to career improvement (Res Pol 2019, 48:462-77), more than 2,200 authors - about 5% of the total - published at least one article in a predatory journal on Beall's list, and about 30% of those did so more than once. After identifying the articles published in those ques - tionable journals, the researchers invited the authors to answer a few questions, anonymously: \"Some of them said that they were duped, but some admitted to having been lured by the idea of easily publishing an article, because in the short term that would increase their chances of getting the qualification,\" co-author Mauro Sylos-Labini, a polit - ical economics researcher at Pisa University, told Cancer World . \"They told us that they regretted having done so, in retrospect.\" The explanation for the apparent non-sense is in the fact that almost one in four of the journals classified in the study as predatory based on the Beall's list were also present on Scopus, one of the leading international databases of jour - nals, and used by many research institutions - including the One might assume that fraudsters are easy to distinguish from honest enterprises but research shows that the opposite is trueImpact Factor43 Spring 2020Italian agency for the evaluation of research - as a proxy for quality. The trouble is that nobody has yet found a clear way to determine whether those journals were wrongly included in the Beall's blacklist or in Scopus' whitelist: \"We can say that in most cases - I would say 98% of them - it is easy to say if a journal or a publisher is predatory, but there are borderline cases for which it can be very difficult,\" Beall told Cancer World . \"Bad science and questionable publi - cation practices existed long before Open Access, but the advent of Open Access and the Internet offered them more opportunities for thriving.\" Last April, one of Beall's sworn enemies, Indian pub - lisher and conference organiser OMICS, was finally sued by the US Federal Trade Commission and sentenced to pay over $50 mn for \"unfair and deceptive practices\". Needless to say, the company is still in business. My name is Fraud, Dr Anna Fraud After Science m a g a z i n e p u b l i s h e d , i n 2 0 1 3 , t h e fi r s t shocking investigation by John Bohannon, which showed that many Open Access journals claiming to use peer-re - view were more than willing to publish a fake scientific article full of obvious mistakes, just to cash a fee (Who's Afraid of Peer Review? Science 04 Oct 2013), other sting operations demonstrated that the situation is not improving, and might be worsening. In today's world, to become editor in chief of a scholarly journal or scientific director of a scientific conference, all one needs is an online presence and some pocket money. Of course, the chutzpah helps. The case of fictitious scientist Anna O. Szust (Oszust is the Polish word for fraud, fraudster) is a good example. A group of scientists created a plausible, but totally fake, online resum\u00e9, and applied on her behalf to the editorial boards of 360 journals: \"The profile was dismally inad - equate for a role as editor. Szust's 'work' had never been indexed in the Web of Science or Scopus databases, nor did she have a single citation in any literature database. Her CV listed no articles in academic journals or any experience as a reviewer, much less an editor. The books and chapters on her CV did not exist and could not be found through any search engine. Even the publishing houses were fake,\" they wrote ( Nature 2017, 543:481-83). \"The aim of our study was to help academics to under - stand how bogus versus legitimate journals operate, not to trick journals into accepting our editor. For this reason, Szust was not a persistent applicant,\" they continued. \"In many cases, we received a positive response within days of application, and often within hours. Four titles immediately appointed Szust editor-in-chief.\" Apart from egregious cases like this one, there are more and more operations - often based in the developing world - that are not up to the highest standards, but are doing their best to learn: \"It's not binary, but rather a complex scenario,\" summarises Beall, who has retired after being cleared of the allegations of research misconduct by his University, sparked by a complaint by OMICS. Oncotarget: friend or foe? Then there are highly unusual cases, such as the Open Access journal Oncotarget , owned by US-based publisher Impact Journals: \"One day an outstanding researcher of my Institute who had published in Oncotarget called me in shock because he had just realised that one of his research articles had abruptly lost much of its value,\" recalls Vanna Pistotti, former librarian of the Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research in Milan, now moved to a posi - tion as researcher in oncology. \" Oncotarget was in the mid - dle of a storm, and we were unable to understand the reason for that.\" The journal, described as \"the most proliferative journal of oncology and cancer research of the past decade\" ( Scien - tometrics 2018, 117:2195-205), was dropped from Medline - the database of the US National Library of Medicine - and later delisted from the Journal Citation Reports pub - lished by Clarivate Analytics that assigns the highly valued 'impact factor' to listed journals. Weirdly enough, a few months earlier Clarivate Ana - lytics had listed the journal among the 'Rising Star from Essential Science Indicators' , basically recommending sci - entists to submit their research there. The lack of scientific consensus on predators \"If you look at the scientific literature on predatory pub - lishers, you find a significant lack of consistency,\" Kelly \"If you look at the scientific literature on predatory publishers, you find a significant lack of consistency\"Scientific conferences are today's golden goose for predatory publishers. As with journals, there is no simple way of distinguishing them from legitimate ones. If you have received an invitation, ask yourself the following questions (adapted from Academic Positions, bit.ly/predator-warning): ~Is the conference in your field? ~Does the conference appear to be a first? Look for information about the previous meetings. ~Who is organising the conference? Is it a for-profit enterprise? If so, does it have a connection to a legitimate research organisation/society/institute? ~What sort of fees are associated with attending the conference? Beware if organisers try to bundle registration fees with accommodation, meals, and travel. ~Does the conference claim that abstracts and papers will be peer-reviewed? ~Does the conference advertise a fast review time or high acceptance rate? ~Does the conference guarantee your work will be published in the conference proceed- ings? Have you ever read any papers from these conference proceedings before? ~Does the theme seem overly broad or that the organisers are trying to combine multi- ple fields into one event? ~Did the email invitation come from a free email provider such as Gmail? ~Is the conference organiser responsible for other conferences this year on the same topic? If the answer is \"yes\" for one or more of these questions, caution is advised. Ask around, and use Google.Warning signs of a predatory conference Impact Factor 44 Spring 2020Cobey, a social psychologist and publication officer from the Centre for Journalology, at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told Cancer World . Cobey conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying many more opinions than empirical research ( F1000Research 2018, 7:1001). The analysis included 38 empirical studies, that overall pro - posed 109 different criteria: \"One of the great challenges is finding and validating criteria, and agreeing on the rele - vance of each of them,\" she explains. Every approach seems to have its limitations: \"For sure, the idea of making profit from this, like Cabell does, is bizarre,\" says Cobey, who still has not found a way to access that list for lack of sufficient funding. Cabell's blacklist doesn't seem to offer more than freely available services do. A recent study by a group of researchers of the Swiss Science Foundation ( mBio 2019, 10:e00411-19), compared two blacklists: Cabell's and the updated Beall's list, and two whitelists; the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and the Committee on Pub - lication Ethics (COPE). They concluded that \"the lists tend to emphasize easily verifiable criteria, which are easier for journals to meet, whereas dimensions that are more diffi - cult to assess, such as peer review, are less well covered.\" Furthermore, disagreements suggest that some journals are misclassified and others operate \"in a gray zone between fraud and legitimacy\". It takes two to tango Researchers publishing or presenting in the wrong place are mostly the victims. Alan Chambers, for exam - ple, and the many who chose Oncotarget before it was brought down from the stars to the stables. Still, they may soon be invited to justify their behaviour. \"Publishing on a predatory journal or likewise presenting an abstract at a questionable conference is not considered misconduct, but still it damages research integrity,\" explains Cinzia Caporale, a bioethicist and expert in research integrity at the Italian National Research Council in Rome. Capo - rale's group has worked on a list of recommendations, to be published soon. \"We came up with a main list of eight items, with five additional items worth checking. We know that none of the criteria is decisive, but the overall picture is certainly useful,\" she says. This careful screening requires a remarkable invest - ment: \"In a way, the introduction of Open Access removed the subscription cost, but imposed an additional, hidden cost, which is still hard to quantify,\" concludes Beall.\u00a9 Maddalena Carrai Quality of Life 45 Spring 2020AI will help Cinderella to see herself in the mirror Almost three in ten patients who undergo breast reconstruction after cancer surgery are unhappy with the results. This may be due to objective failures, but often dissatisfaction comes from unrealistic expectations. Daniela Ovadia talked to Maria-Jo\u00e3o Cardoso about a tool in development that will use artificial intelligence to help women predict how they will feel about their body after surgery. Many women who undergo breast reconstruction after mastectomy end up disap- pointed. It is estimated that as many as 30% of women have to live with aesthetic results they are not happy with. On the other hand, some of those who opt against reconstruction may have chosen otherwise had they had a good idea in advance about how it would turn out. Maria Jo\u00e3o Cardoso is head breast surgeon at the Champalimaud Cancer Centre in Lisbon. She founded the patient support centre Mama Help and co-leads a research group on improving outcomes in breast surgery at the Institute for Quality of Life46 Spring 2020Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science in Porto. Using their combined expertise in breast surgery and computing, the group are addressing a new challenge. They are trying to find a way to help patients with breast cancer to foresee the realistic results of breast surgery - any procedure, from conservative to radical, with and without reconstruction - before going ahead with the operation. \"Breast cancer overall survival has increased impressively in the last 20 years. Although improved survival is crucial, quality of life should parallel this endpoint,\" says Cardoso. Quality of life is heavily dependent on the side effects of treatment. In breast cancer, besides the side effects of systemic treatments, there is also the visible and lasting impact of sur - gery and radiotherapy. \"Breast-con - serving treatment or mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction are the most common surgical options. Moreover, with more sophisticated treatments, better aesthetic outcomes are anticipated. Some of the possible causes of patients' disappointment could be prevented if the outcomes could be measured consistently and possible causes of poor satisfaction identified,\" says Cardoso. She wants to develop an evidence-based tool to visualise the range of aesthetic results that are likely following breast reconstruction, in order to allow the women to predict how they could feel with their new body image. What surveys can and cannot tell us Recent studies done in North America show that women who opt for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy have a high rate of complications: one in three develops a postoperative complication over the following two years, and one in five requires more surgery; in 5% of cases, ibid pp 891-9). findings also showed that women who undergo autologous breast reconstruction are generally more happy with the results in the long term than women who choose reconstruction with breast implants. In order to evaluate satisfaction, the researchers surveyed women on their quality of life 90 days before their mastectomy, and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after reconstruction. They asked the women about their perception of their breasts, and their emotional, social, sexual and physical wellbeing. Specific questions addressed how their breasts appeared, how satisfied they were with that appearance, how bras fit, and how their breasts felt to the touch. Emotional and social wellbeing were investigated, asking questions about their body image, their confidence in social settings and their sexual wellbeing. Questions about physical wellbeing, pain and physical difficulty while performing daily activities were also included in the survey. The surveys revealed that satisfaction is not always related to an objective failure. In a study published two years earlier, Cecilia Dahlb\u00e4ck from the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, tried to identify risk factors for poor satisfaction with conventional breast-conserving surgery ( World J Surg Oncol 2016, 14:303). \"The majority of the women, 84%, were satisfied with the overall aesthetic result. But if we look in detail at the results, we see that the rate of satisfaction regarding symmetry between the breasts was 68% and for skin sensitivity in the operated breast it was 67%,\" says Dahlb\u00e4ck. Factors contributing to a poor subjective level of satisfaction with overall aesthetic outcome included excision of more than 20% of the preoperative breast volume and axillary clearance. A high BMI (30 kg/m2) was associated with complaints related to symmetry. Re-excision and postoperative infection were associated with lower rates of satisfaction regarding both overall aesthetic outcome and symmetry. According to the researchers, the choice of the surgical technique should take into account both objec- tive data and the patient's preferences. The questionnaires used to mea - sure satisfaction in many of these studies were developed in plastic sur - gery and not specifically for cancer patients ( Plast Reconstr Surg 2009, 124:345-53). \"The most common evaluation methods on the impact of treatments are patient reported out - comes,\" says Cardoso. \"They consist almost exclusively of questionnaires, usually with low reproducibility due to the subjectivity inherent to patient's self-evaluation. That's why we are trying to find a more objec- tive way to determine the risk factors of poor patient satisfaction in breast reconstruction after cancer thera - pies.\" A gold standard for evaluating outcomes It is often very difficult for pro - fessionals to fully understand and explain why an excellent result, based on the technical analysis of The CINDERELLA project is developing a tool to help candidates for the following common breast surgery procedures predict how they will look and feel about their body: ~Conservative surgery - unilateral ~Conservative surgery with bilateral reduction ~Conservative surgery with LD or LICAP/TDAP flaps ~Mastectomy with unilateral reconstruction with implant ~Mastectomy with unilateral reconstruction with autologous flap ~Mastectomy with bilateral reconstruction with implants ~Mastectomy with bilateral reconstruction with autologous flaps ~Mastectomy with unilateral reconstruction with implant and contralateral symmetrisation with implant (augmentation). ~Mastectomy with unilateral reconstruction with autologous flap and contralateral symmetrisation with reduction ~Mastectomy with unilateral reconstruction with autologous - thoracodorsal artery perforatorReconstruction techniques included in the study Quality of Life 47 Spring 2020the starting situation, might still be far from ideal, and more or less sat - isfactory in the patient's eyes. This is because there is no standard model for comparison, and other personal factors, such as age, marital and socioeconomic status, and psycho - logical factors, can contribute to the final appreciation. Objective methods, using artifi - cial intelligence (AI), have been tried to circumvent the lack of reproduc- ibility of patient reported outcomes. However, there is a poor agreement between questionnaires and AI. The project Cardoso and col - leagues are working on aims to create a gold standard method for the aesthetic evaluation by giving patients a better insight into the outcomes, allowing them to judge more objectively, also using inputs from both objective and subjective factors. Named CINDERELLA (Compar ing patient's de cision on aesthetic outcome with the BCCT. core objective evaluation after contro lled te aching in patients pro -posed for breast cancer locoregional treatment), the hope is that the proj - ect will \"lead to a better choice of locoregional treatments and better quality of life,\" says Cardoso. The CINDERELLA project Apart from self-reporting, sur - gical outcomes can be evaluated by an expert assessment. This is ideally done by someone who is not involved in the treatment, to avoid bias, and the evaluation should be preferably be done by more than one person. This type of expert assessment is often done using digital photographs, but it is very costly and time-consum - ing. If you have a large number of patients, it's very difficult to ask the experts to look at all the pic- tures. Then there is the so-called objective assessment, which is usually done through measure - ments looking at the patient's images on a screen. \"We measure the distance between the nipples, the distance to the arm and the edge, we compare symmetry, etc.\" explains Cardoso. \"Our research team already developed a soft - ware called BCCT [Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment], used by almost 300 centres all over the world, that does it automatically using the pre- and post-surgical photos of thousands of patients, which will allow the analysis and comparison of a large number of pictures in many different centres and countries.\" Within the CINDERELLA study, she explains, candidates for breast surgery who are included in the intervention arm will receive educational training with an expert using a teaching soft - ware, while the control group will receive the general information currently provided to all their patients. \"We will also be able to evaluate the importance of cul - tural environment on patients' satisfaction, as we already know that Eastern and Western coun - tries have a different cultural approach toward body image, but we will also be able to identify objective risk factors for dissat - isfaction, including the surgeon performance.\" Beyond photoshop Digital photo retouching tech - niques have been used in plastic surgery for many years to antic- ipate aesthetic results, but Car - doso's project aims to go well beyond that. The realistic outcomes that the surgeons can automatically simu - late today are based on the photos of the patient and on the expected changes that the surgical tech-Patients proposed for locoregional treatment will be randomised to the control or study arm. Pictures pre- and post-surgery will be taken in both arms. The control arm will receive general information about the surgical outcomes, while the study arm will receive training with an expert using a teaching gallery of pictures. Patients in both groups will be evaluated using the QLQ-C30 quality of life questionnaire, and expectations will be collected using the Harris Self-Concept scale after complete healing of the scar, and at month 6 and 12. Later on, statistical analysis coupled with the use of artificial intelligence to evaluate the outcomes (through the existing BCCT program) will be applied to the database to identify predictors of poor satisfaction. The software will be updated (BCCT Plus) to include the patients' opinions.The study design Quality of Life 48 Spring 2020nique will introduce. AI allows the system to become smarter and more efficient, by adding more cases and more photos. Any possi - ble confounding or influential fac- tor will be recorded, including age, body mass index, bra size and cup, education degree, profession and hobbies. Marital status, pregnan - cies and offspring, together with breastfeeding habits and meno - pausal status, can also influence the results of reconstructive surgery, so they will be included in the anal -ysis. The database will consider also possible complication such as smoking, diabetes and radiotherapy (total dosing and fraction number). Taking personalised surgery one step further The trial has been approved in Portugal and has already com - pleted the feasibility phase. A first group of 340 patients and 340 controls will be recruited in the next phase. An expert evaluation of each outcome will be compared with the results from the AI analy - sis to focus on the determinants of poor outcomes or poor satisfaction, including the kind of training the patient received before the surgery and how it shaped her expectations. \"We hope to modify and upgrade our software to include the patients' perspective as it comes out from the statistical analysis of the question- naires and surveys. It will be called 'BCCT Plus' , and will be avail - able open access to all the surgical centres dealing with breast cancer surgery,\" says Cardoso. \"We don't have sponsors and support from companies, as it is an open-access project, even if we have a large number of pictures in our database and enough nurses volunteering to be trained to be educators and to use our teaching tool. But we already have our proof of concept: machine learning can help us get the best possible result out of each surgical procedure - fostering the idea of personalised surgery - and develop a tool that people will be able to use all over the world, in a multidisciplinary team including oncologists, nurses and surgeons and patients, each of them with their own expectations.\"Systems & Services50 Spring 2020Biosimilars - Policy failings that deny savings to some of Europe's poorest countries Competitor drugs entering the market are opening opportunities to make important savings on an increasing number of biological anticancer agents. But, as Rachel Brazil reports, many countries, including those with the most stretched health budgets, could do a lot more to reap the potential rewards. The promise of cheaper biolog- ical drugs is now coming to fruition in oncology. Biosimi- lars for supportive therapies used in oncology have been available in Eu- rope for over a decade. Over recent years, biosimilars of key monoclonal antibody (mAb) anticancer treat- ments have also become available, including for trastuzumab, used to treat HER2+ breast cancer (reference drug, Herceptin), bevacizumab, used to treat colon and lung cancer, as well as glioblastoma and renal-cell carcinoma (reference drug, Avas- tin), and rituximab, used to treat some B-cell lymphomas (reference drug, Rituxan). Systems & Services51 Spring 2020At least a further eight oncology biologics will come off patent in the next four years, bringing cheaper prices, with the hope of investing the savings in treating more patients, and increasing access to other therapies (http://bit.ly/CW88-biosimilars). So far biosimilar take-up has not been uniform across Europe. Some countries are already reaping the ben - efits, whilst others - including many countries with the most stretched health budgets - are yet to do so. Switching has led to big savings In September 2019 the UK's National Health Service (NHS) announced it had saved \u00a3294 m (\u20ac340 m) from its drug budget in 2019 and a total of \u00a3707 m (\u20ac820 m) over the two-year period 2018-2019. The biggest sav - ing (\u00a3110 m/\u20ac127 m) came from switching to biosimilars of Humira (adalimumab) - a medicine used to treat inflammatory conditions. In another recent analysis, looking at the economic impact of switching to trastuzumab and rituximab biosimilars, an Italian team evaluated five phase II tri - als including 2,362 patients being treated for advanced breast cancer or follicular lymphoma. They found the economic advantage of biosim - ilars amounted to \u20ac274 per month for rituximab and \u20ac3,283-\u20ac6,310 per month for trastuzumab, up to the time of treatment failure, which represented a 40% saving on the cost of the originator drugs ( Anti- cancer Res 2019, 39:3971-73). A recently published analysis suggested that Europe as a whole could save between \u20ac0.91 bn and \u20ac2.27 bn over the next five years by switching to trastuzumab biosimi - lars ( BioDrugs 2019, 33:423-36). A separate budget impact analysis, focused just on Croatia, showed that switching to a trastuzumab biosimilar could save between \u20ac0.26 m and \u20ac0.69 m - represent - ing a saving of between 15% and 35%. Reinvesting this amount, the study found, would make it pos - sible to give the treatment to an additional 14-47 patients per year (Appl Health Econ Health Policy 2017, 15:277- 86). Switching has increased access in some cases Decreasing prices has in some cases brought increased access, says Adrian van den Hoven, Director General of Medicines for Europe, the organisation representing Europe's generic and biosimilar medicines industries. \"Use of filgrastim, the growth factor that stimulates white blood cell production, was heavily restricted in Europe until the arrival of a biosimilar. You really had to be diagnosed with severe neutropenia before you could get access to this product.\" Today in the UK, he says, with access to biosimilars costing around 30-40% less, \"they [have] allowed doctors to prescribe this for preven - tive use.\" In some countries, such as the southern healthcare region in Sweden, use of filgrastim has increased five-fold ( Future Oncol 2019, 15:1525-33). Increased use of almost 435% in Hungary and 515% in Slova - kia was also reported by industry sources at the 2019 Biosimilars Commercialisation Summit (bit.ly/ Biosimilars-Summit) . In some countries savings are also being invested in provid - ing access to novel, more expen - sive treatments, which may partly explain why oncologists, in the experience of van den Hoven, have been generally more open to switch - ing than were clinicians working in the more chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where biosim - ilars were introduced earlier. \"The acceptance and the willingness of clinician to use biosimilars has been much faster in the area of oncology, for first-line and second-line treat - ments\" he says. Big differences in take up That rapid take up applies to some countries much more than others, however, according to Paul Cornes, an oncologist from Bristol, in the UK, and part of the Compar - ative Outcomes Group - a research cooperative interested in healthcare value. And it is some - but by no means all - of the richer countries that seem to be leading the way. \"The biggest uptake [and] the great - est economic benefits appear to be in the UK and the Nordic countries, and increasingly Germany.\" A recent study on the take-up rate of rituximab biosimilars for treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, for instance, showed big differences across the so-called EU5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). Approved in \"Where we have the biggest problems is actually in the poorest countries of Europe\"Biosimilars have highly similar physical, chemical and biological properties to their refer - ence medicines - any differences are not clinically meaningful in terms of safety or effica- cy. They are approved according to the EMA's pioneering regulatory pathway, introduced in 2004. Approval means demonstrating biosimilarity - similarity in function and effect - by showing comprehensive comparability data, including from clinical studies, to show that the biosimilar moves in a similar way within the body (similar pharmacokinetics) and has a simi- lar effect and mechanism of action (similar pharmacodynamics). Source: Biosimilars in the EU Prepared jointly by the European Medicines Agency and the European Com - mission, bit.ly/Biosimilars-EU, accessed 28/01/2020Biosimilars - stepped pathway to regulatory approval Systems & Services 52 Spring 2020Europe in early 2017, prescription rates averaged across the five coun - tries increased from 7% to 35% between July 2017 and September 2018. But there were important differences between countries. For patients treated with a rituximab-in - cluding regimen, prescribing of any EMA-approved rituximab bio - similar in the third quarter of 2018 was 72% in Germany and 63% in UK, while France, Italy and Spain reported 47%, and 30% respectively Scandinavia, where biosim - ilars are strongly promoted by health authorities, the fast uptake contrasts with countries like Italy, where health authorities have had a more conservative approach. Cornes believes it's the result of entrenched differences in attitudes to healthcare and the extent to which it is seen as a communal responsibility that must be nurtured. \"[In the UK] there's a kind of awareness that you have to save where you can,\" says Cornes. \"They do revere their health ser - vices and they joke that the NHS is a religion.\" \"Where we have the biggest problems is actually in the poor - est countries of Europe - Roma - nia [and] Bulgaria,\" says van den Hoven. \"They have been very slow to get their machinery in order to incentivise the use of biosimilars, and so they don't benefit from the competition. Those are probably the countries that need this the most. A lot of patients don't have access to those biologics today.\" He mentions the example of the hospital tender for trastuzumab in Romania, where he says, \"the incumbent [i.e. Roche, which pro - duces Herceptin] was able to get a tender issued one month before the biosimilars entered the market. So obviously, it was the only supplier and so it won a tender before the bio - similars could even compete... until the next round of tenders.\" Medicines for Europe has set up a task force to help these countries improve their uptake. Clinicians need confidence in biosimilars Part of the issue is clinicians' attitudes to biosimilars, and their willingness to prescribe them. A 2017 survey on knowledge and use of biosimilars, conducted by ESMO (the European Society for Medical Oncology) amongst 393 oncolo - gists, showed that only 49% of them used biosimilars in clinical practice (ESMO Open 2019, 4:e000460). \"It's difficult to say why only half are using them, given what we know... I hope the rate is higher now,\" says Giuliani, one of the co-authors. Uncertainty about the safety of switching was certainly a factor con - tributing to initial reluctance with some oncologists. But, as Cornes says, \"These are not under-tested drugs. The European regulators spend a year reviewing 60-100 tests of comparability, and we hear that they're reviewing 10,000 pages of data, and the volume of data and the time they take to review it is exactly the same as a brand new drug.\" The different drug registration pathway for biosimilars could be one reason for hesitation among some clinicians. \"We are used to phase I, II and III clinical trials - we need to move our 'angle of obser - vation' ,\" says Giuliani. The ESMO survey showed that clinicians were still paying a lot of attention to clin -Systems & Services53 Spring 2020ical data rather than the evidence demonstrating biosimilarity to the reference drug. Hillel Cohen, executive direc- tor of scientific affairs at Sandoz in Princeton, New Jersey, agrees that lack of familiarity with the biosim - ilar regulatory pathway is an issue with some practitioners, \"especially the reliance on analytics, and not large-scale, clinical safety and effi - cacy studies that physicians have been trained to look at.\" He believes, however, that this is changing over time. \"We've seen that as clinicians are getting more experienced using biosimilars, and it's certainly true in Europe, these concerns seem to diminish.\" Early in their history, the poten - tial safety and efficacy impact of switching a patient from a reference product to a biosimilar was heavily debated, but as the drugs have been used by more patients and for lon - ger, confidence has grown thanks to convincing evidence from large numbers of studies. In 2018 Cohen and co-authors published a review of more than 90 studies looking at this evi - dence. \"These enrolled over 14,000 patients, seven different molecules, including oncology products, in 16 different disease locations,\" says Cohen. \"It provided reassurance to healthcare professionals and the public that the risk of immunoge - nicity-related safety concerns or diminished efficacy is unchanged after switching... no review today has revealed any reason to be con - cerned after switching from a refer - ence product to a biosimilar.\" Extensive education campaigns carried out by many organisations have helped convince the clinical community. \"Peer-to-peer initia -tives in education are very influ - ential,\" says Cohen. Cornes agrees that education initiatives carried out in preparation for the release of oncology biosimilars have had a big impact, and he credits the European regulators with playing a crucial role in supporting and explaining their process. The approach taken by patient advocacy groups has generally stressed the importance of ensuring patients are fully informed about any changes in their prescriptions from reference drug to biosimilar, or between biosimilars, and that they are able to discuss changes with their clinicians and know what to ask (see for instance the biosimilars toolkit of the International Alliance of Patients Organizations (iapo.org. uk/biosimilars-toolkit). Clinicians need an incentive to switch Take-up of biosimilars is not down to education alone, however. \"[Physicians] have to have an incen - tive to do so,\" argues Cornes. Dif - ferent countries have used a variety of carrot and/or stick approaches, he says. Denmark used an aggressive approach to push physicians to pre - scribe the first biosimilar, infliximab, used since 2014 to treat a number of autoimmune diseases. \"They basi - cally said: you will use the biosim -ilar unless the doctor can produce clinically supportable evidence as to why that's the wrong action.\" While that approach had the intended effect, says Cornes - \"In a matter of a few months, Denmark switched more than 80% of their patients,\" - it also caused \"some friction between managers and healthcare profession - als,\" according to ESMO's Giuliani. Sweden, meanwhile, adopted a slightly more consensual approach, which also worked. Clinicians faced no initial obligation, and early uptake was slower. But by 2016, when confidence had been built, patients were informed of a switch by letter, and within four months 90% of them were using a biosim - ilar (ESMO Open 2018, 3:e000420). In the UK incentives have been offered whereby the prescribing authorities benefit from the savings made from switching to biosimi - lars, using a 'gain share' model. A well-publicised example relates to University Hospital Southampton and their local Clinical Commis - sioning Group. When they switched to infliximab biosimilars, the cost savings were divided between the hospital and commissioning group, which then invested the money back into clinical services, creating a win-win situation. To achieve this switch, says Cornes, they invested in specialist drug optimisation pharmacists. \"An investment in a year's salary for a pharmacist was paid back in about a month with the money generated by saving. And [it] indicated that peo - ple with knowledge of [biosimilar] drugs, who had the time and ability to talk to patients, could give them the confidence to swap.\" The NHS now aims to have 90% of new patients being on the best-\"The different drug registration pathway for biosimilars could be one reason for hesitation\"Systems & Services54 Spring 2020value biological medicine within three months of product launch, and 80% of existing patients within 12 months. The first UK oncology biosimilar, rituximab, launched in April 2017, reached this target within 5 months. Savings vary according to payer purchasing mechanisms Another factor that varies between countries is the payer purchasing mechanisms used. A report commissioned by Pfizer from the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science found evidence that, at a hospital level, the use of single- winner contract tenders led to rapid biosimilar uptake, with biosimilar volume share reaching 80% in less than six months (bit. ly/IQVIA-Biosimilars) . However, it also points to evidence that multiple-winner contract tenders may result in lower costs at a regional level (measured by average net molecule costs per defined daily dose), because reductions are obtained on multiple products, often including the originator drug ( ibid) . Balancing savings with ensuring a sustainable supply The UK model is praised by van den Hoven for encouraging compe - tition, but avoiding the pitfalls that in some instances have led to drug shortages. \"They've organised the tendering for biosimilars to ensure that they have at least three or possibly four different suppliers, including the incumbent maybe in some cases, and that way, they make sure that they always have a guarantee of supply,\" he says. Maintaining a healthy biosim - ilars market may not be down to Europe alone, however. The US regulators, the FDA, approved their first monoclonal antibody biosimilar in 2016, and now there are two or more biosimilars on the market for each of the cancer ther - apies bevacizumab, trastuzumab and rituximab. But some are ques - tioning how sustainable the US biosimilars market will be, with drug companies creating 'patent thickets' to protect their monopo - lies through new formulations and delivery methods. This year Pfizer announced it had abandoned five of its pre-clin - ical biosimilar programmes. \"There's a lot of pessimism,' says Cornes. 'I can see that a lack of traction in the American market, for whatever reason, is going to cause trouble for Europe.\" Speaking from the perspective of the European biosimilar med - icines industry, van den Hoven warns that, \"There is a concern from our side of the industry with the sustainability, longer term, because as the prices are pushed quite low, there's an issue of how sustainable this is... We're con - cerned that companies will focus more on [high-volume] biologics and less on some of the niche bio - logics for orphan diseases, because there's no real incentive.\" Biosimilars certainly need con - siderably higher levels of invest - ment than generics - one estimate is that it takes seven to eight years to develop a biosimilar, at a cost of between $100 m and $250 m, making them very vulnerable to low or anti-competitive pricing (Am Health Drug Benefits 2013, 6:469-78). Cornes says purchas - ers have got to consider the issue of sustainability: \"Do we just drop the price and take the lowest one, or do we think: what does it take to nurture a market so these com - panies will be here in 10, 20, or 30 years from now?\" One area that adds to the cost is the large amount of data required by the regulators, which van den Hoven says could be streamlined. \"We've been saying for some time now, we need to look at what is the purpose of all these clinical studies. There have been some small improvements. For example, in Europe, they have reduced the number of animal studies that the industry has to do.\" Currently clinical studies also have to be carried out separately for each regulator, rather than being able to use the same data, which all adds to development costs. \"We've made incremental progress [in discussions with the EMA], but I think we could do a lot more,\" he says. Cohen is still positive about the future for biosimilars. \"There's no question that the number of biosimilar oncology drugs will increase, has increased, and is increasing, both in supportive and treatment settings,\" he says. Certainly lessons have been learned since the first oncology biosimilars were introduced ten years ago. \"The difference is now - adays communication is better and we understand the scepticism and can explain [biosimilar regulation pathways],\" says Giuliani. The question is how to turn those lessons into policies across Europe that can maximise the ben - efits for all.\u00a9 Maddalena Carrai Team Talk 56 Spring 2020MDT meetings: why patient care suffers if I'm not there Multidisciplinary team meetings should be where the full details of a patient's cancer diagnosis are discussed by specialists with the cutting-edge knowledge and expertise in treating cancer and the rel- evant information about the patient - their fitness, med- ical history, needs and priorities - to reach a consensus recommendation for their treatment and care. In a disease as complex as cancer it seems the most logical way to ensure uniform standards of high qual - ity care for all patients. Team meetings can also offer opportunities for education, provide a way to increase the number of patients entered into clinical trials, facil - itate communication between primary, secondary and tertiary care, and provide team members with opportu - nities for professional development. In general, members of MDTs that function effec-tively can barely imagine working in any other way. Many MDTs however do not function effectively. In some places, MDT meetings are seen as merely 'rubber stamp' or 'tickbox' operations - something of little intrin - sic merit that the system obliges you to go through, where every case is rushed through and the decision reached within the space of a few minutes. In others, discussions are allowed to drag on interminably, for no good reason, with too long being spent on relatively straightforward cases, and many contributions being unduly lengthy or off the point. Sometimes the problem is that one or two voices dominate every discussion, sidelining the contribution of others who have information and expertise that could impact on the recommendation. In some places key team members are often missing from the meeting, because they - or the team organisers or hospital administration -Team Talk57 Spring 2020The Addenbrooke's prostate cancer MDT, one of around 40 different MDTs convened every week at this Cambridge hospital, meets on a Monday afternoon to discuss treatment plans for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. Attending the meeting are members of the core team composed of urologists, oncologists, pathologists, radiologists and specialist nurses. The meeting is divided into two parts. The first part considers patients from regional hospitals, whose healthcare teams dial-in using conferencing facilities. For these patients (usually around 15 are reviewed), local hospitals have already made a diagnosis, but require expert opinions to explore whether patients are suitable for brachytherapy or robotic surgery, which is only provided at Addenbrooke's. In the second part the team considers local patients, who are listed for discussion when their imaging and pathology results are ready. For these patients (usually around 40 are reviewed), the team decide between recommending surveillance or active treatment in the form of surgery and radiotherapy. Altogether the MDT meeting takes around three hours. Key to the smooth running is the EPIC system where the patient information is entered on to the computer system by the MDT coordi - nator prior to the meeting. \"This allows us to view all the information on one screen and saves having to spend time hunting it down,\" says Veneeta Thankappannair, the prostate cancer specialist nurse. Other important facilities needed are teleconferencing to communicate with external hospitals, a microscope and projection system for the pathologist to show slides, and screens to display the EPIC patient information and radiology images. Fundamental to the approach of MDTs is that the MDT makes recommendations, rather than taking decisions, with the final decision about the way forward made by the patient in face-to-face discussions with the urologist or specialist nurse in clinic after the meeting. What does your role involve? \"In Cambridge the urologist leads the MDT because they are the team member who first sees the patient in clinic and records their medical history and takes the biopsy specimen. Prior to the MDT, the urologist spends about an hour review - ing the notes, biopsy results and imaging, and brings everything Urologist - Vincent Gnanapgragasmhave not prioritised ensuring they can and do attend. Then there's the whole question of what happens to the discus - sion and recommendations. How do these feed into the decision making process with the patient, if they do at all? Sadly, large numbers of cancer practitioners across Europe end up resenting the time they are obliged to spend at MDT meetings, because it seems like an unnecessary and bureaucratic waste of time that yields little of benefit to either patients or doctors. In an effort to challenge this perception, and explore the realities of team meetings in different places across Europe, Cancer World's Janet Fricker asked the core members of a well-functioning prostate cancer multi -disciplinary team at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cam - bridge, to describe from their own perspective why their team meetings matter to the quality of patient care. Specifically she asked each member of the core team about their role, about what they contribute that their colleagues need to know, about the information they need to receive from their colleagues, and general observations about what makes the meetings work well or how they might be more effective. We hope to follow this up with a further article where we ask readers to comment on how the functioning of this team compares - the good and the bad - with their own experiences.

The tool, developed using data from over 10,000 men diag - nosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between 2000 and 2010 with a median follow-up of 9.8 years, estimates survival with and without treatment. The model helps patients and clinicians to decide between active surveillance and radical treatment. For radi - cal treatment it does not distinguish between surgery and radiotherapy. It is really important in balancing whether the patient is likely to die of something else sooner than prostate cancer. The Predict Prostate tool has been endorsed by the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence as a decision aid in prostate can - cer management.\" What does your role involve? \"In the UK, clinical oncologists combine the role of radiation oncologist and medical oncologist. Our role is to consider the whole patient and their prostate cancer in the context of comor - bidities. We provide in-depth knowledge of radiotherapy and systemic anticancer therapies (hormone treatments and chemotherapy) and know about associated toxici - ties. We can also let them know about relevant trials. As well as treating patients in the curative setting, oncolo - gists are responsible for treating metastatic disease.\" What does the team need from you? \"They need the clinical oncologist's view about whether the patient is suitable for radiotherapy and systemic treatments.\" What information do you need from colleagues? \"We need information about the patient's fitness for treatment and existing comorbidities. Essentially, some -one who is fit enough for curative radiotherapy needs to be walking into the clinic unaided. I also need to know about urinary frequency and flow, as a large prostate or bladder insufficiency can affect their ability to have radiotherapy, as can some bowel conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease. It is also valuable to know about social circumstances, as elderly patients with caring responsibilities may not wish to travel daily for radiotherapy.\" Other thoughts: \"To help make things clearer within the busy and time-constrained MDT discussion, it would be valuable to have patients grouped together, for exam - ple to have a section in the meeting for men presenting with raised PSA, another for localised prostate cancer and a third for those presenting with metastatic disease.\"Clinical oncologist - Yvonne Rimmer week, sub-speciality pathologists assess microscop - ically prostate biopsies that have been processed into paraffin wax blocks and cut into thin sections and stained. For each specimen pot (containing fine 'cores' of tissue representing different parts of the prostate) we screen for cancer foci. If cancer is found, we provide a histology report detailing the number of cores with tumour, the maxi - mum length of the cancer in a single core and architectural appearance (known as grade) of the tumour. For tumour grading we use both the traditional Gleason Grading system and a Pathologist - Anne Warren Team Talk59 Spring 2020new 'Grade group' system (proposed by Jonathan Epstein from John Hopkins University) that help to guide the most appropriate treatment options for patients. For each patient, the whole biopsy reporting process takes between 30 minutes and two hours, depending on the number of biopsies taken. On the morning of the MDT, the pathologist attending the meeting does a quick review of cases to check that no mistakes have been made. Even if the patient has a negative biopsy (~ 30% of patients) they still need to be discussed in the MDT due to the possibility that the biopsies could have missed the cancer.\" What does the team need from you? \"Informa - tion about whether cancer is present in the prostate biopsies, and if so the number of cores involved, the maximum length of the tumour present in a single core, the tumour grade (Gleason score and Grade group), and whether there's evidence of extra pros - tatic spread.\" What information do you need from colleagues? \"The patient's clinical history. Many people think biopsies give black-and-white results (like a blood test), but in reality it's an interpretation of the image you see before you. We can get that interpretation completely wrong if we don't consider it in context of the patient's clinical history. We need to have information such as whether the patient has had prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy, whether they have known metastatic spread of the prostate cancer or even a different type of tumour arising in another organ.\" Other thoughts: \"Going forward it would be helpful to always undertake the biopsy after the MRI scan, as this would allow you to screen out the patients where there are no visible lesions on imag - ing and to focus on biopsying patients with visible 'target' lesions. The difficulty with biopsying everyone is that you identify lesions that aren't clinically significant and don't need to be treated. Doing an MRI scan first would be better for patients and allow us to improve efficiency by rationalising the amount of pathology we need to do.\" What does your role involve? \"The nurse pro - vides the first point of contact for prostate cancer patients and their families at Addenbrooke's Hos - pital, ensuring that the pathway runs smoothly with tests undertaken in a timely fashion, and helps to counsel patients through the decision making pro - cess after the urologist has broken the bad news.

It's also help - ful to know whether there are research studies that the patient might be suitable for in future, allow - ing us to flag up the possibility to them at an early stage.\" Other thoughts: Patients are normally only considered by the MDT at diagnosis, and referred directly to the oncologist if they have a recurrence. From the nurse's point of view I would find it valu - able to run patients with recurrent prostate cancer past the MDT to discuss benefits of different treat - ment approaches. For example, this could be when progression is identified and men become eligible for hormone therapy, or when men become resistant to hormone therapy and are considered for second line treatment or chemotherapy.\"Specialist nurse - Vineetha Thankappa NairTeam Talk60 to the MDT, a radiologist will have reviewed the MRI and CT scans. MRI is used for local diagnosis to determine where lesions are located in the gland, while CT scans are used for advanced or metastatic disease. While CT is a generalised radiology skill, MRI is much more specialised and needs radiologists who are proficient at interpreting different anatomical areas. For exam - ple, I am experienced in prostate, bladder, and kidney MRIs, but am not nearly so expert at analysing liver and gynaecological MRIs.\" What does the team need from you? \"Informa - tion on TNM staging, which describes the size of the tumour, and whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, or different parts of the body. Radiol - ogy can also provide a definitive answer to say no dis - ease is present here and further investigations are not required.\"What information do you need from colleagues? \"We need information from the urol - ogist about the specific focused question they want answered, as this can help reduce the number of images that we need to view. Also, it's useful to know whether the patient has any other rel - evant clinical history that may make a tumour likely, or indeed information that may make a benign process more probable, such as a treated prostate infection and a subsequent reduction in the PSA levels.\" Other thoughts: \"The MDT process could be streamlined, removing straightforward cases and allowing longer slots for patients who need more time for discussions. When I worked in the US and Canada they limited MDT discussions to four or five cases that are considered to be management or diag - nostic conundrums.\"Radiologist - Tristan Barrett in the Hot Seat62 Spring 2020Solange Peters President of the European Society for Medical Oncology The second woman ever to hold the ESMO presidency, Solange Peters brings to the role impressive clinical and research experience in lung cancer, one of the most challenging and fast-moving areas of oncology. Cancer World asked her about how ESMO is adapting to meet the needs of oncologists in today's complex and rapidly changing clinical landscape, and about her vision for ESMO, and its role in the world. Cancer World: New treatments are coming to market much faster than the evidence doctors and patients need to make informed choices about how best to use them. What issues does this raise for ESMO's task of developing evi- are as treatments are becoming more expen - sive and healthcare resources are more restricted. It is very important to offer evidence-based medicine to the maxi - mum number of patients, so spending money on therapies that are not of benefit has to stop. In response to current challenges, we are working to improve our guidelines in a number of ways. Firstly, our statement of benefits of each intervention is always quali - fied to indicate the level of evidence and grade of recom - mendation. Secondly, as the number of options expand, and as biological subgroups of cancers are identified, guidelines have been getting increasingly lengthy and complex to read and apply. We are therefore looking to adopt a more sche - matic approach to presenting the evidence, for instance by making greater use of algorithms. Thirdly, with the clinical landscape changing so fast, we need to ensure our guidelines are always up-to-date. We have now started publishing online so-called 'liv - ing guidelines' , which incorporate new evidence in real time, as it emerges from the literature. The fourth thing is the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS). With so many treatment options now available for many cancers, you need to make a choice. The ESMO-MCBS qualifies the extent of clini - cal benefit in terms of various dimensions including overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity, long-term sur - vival, quality of life and so on, which means you can use it to prioritise the strategies to use in patients. So in the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines you now have the level of evidence, the clinical grade of recommen - dation and the ESMO-MCBS score. CW: The ESMO Guidelines Committee can only work with the evidence that is available. How do we ensure the right studies are done to answer unresolved questions about which treatment strategies work best for which patients? SP: There are many outstanding questions: the usual examples are about duration of immunotherapy as well as the optimal frequency of administration and doses of these drugs. These questions that the community is asking will in general only be answered by academic research. ESMO is committed to doing as much as we can to support the academic and collaborative groups doing in the Hot Seat63 Spring 2020research, so whenever a request comes for any operational or policy support we always try to respond. But there are also ways to incentivise the pharma indus - try to ask the right questions. The ESMO-MCBS has an important role here. As the scale includes mandatory mea - sures of aspects such as toxicity, quality of life, and long- term benefits, then if industry trials do not evaluate those data, they won't qualify to reach the maximum score. So that could be one incentive for industry to generate the evi - dence doctors and patients need. CW: You are only the second woman president of ESMO, and you've been instrumental in significantly boosting the profile of women in senior ESMO roles. How did you do that, and what advice do you have for others trying to address gender bias in oncology? SP: M a r t i n e P i c c a r t , E S M O ' s fi r s t w o m a n p r e s i d e n t , started ESMO's Women for Oncology initiative, I picked that up from her. When I first joined the ESMO Executive Board, it was composed of more than 10 men, and me. I was the only one who really saw this as a problem. The attitude was that, more and more women are entering the profession, so the gender gap will resolve 'spontaneously'. So I asked for funding to do a study to better define the magnitude of the problem. When we looked at the numbers it turned out that less than 30% of ESMO committee members, less than 25% of invited speakers at ESMO meetings, and less than 15% of ESMO Board members were women. Impor - tantly, this picture had not changed at all over the previous 10 years, despite the marked increase in the proportion of women working in the profession over that time. Once the ESMO Board realised there was a problem, we saw rapid change. Today the Executive Board is com - posed of 50% men and 50% women, and at the last ESMO Congress (2019), women accounted for 45% of speakers. So the advice I can give to anyone wanting to start challeng - ing gender inequalities is that you first have to prove and describe that the problem exists. Challenging the gender balance has been important for equality within ESMO, but it also helps challenge some of the bias and barriers that women members say hold them back in their careers, by offering role models, building con - fidence and changing negative perceptions about women's capabilities in leadership positions. We are now also encouraging the industry to address the entrenched gender gap when choosing their principal inves - tigators, first authors and members of their advisory boards, as it is almost impossible now to build a career in oncology without some involvement in industry trials. CW: ESMO has undergone a significant change in identity in recent years. Is it still a medical oncology society and is it still European? SP: In everything we do now, we are not just medical oncology, we are multi-professional. All our guidelines, all our faculties across diseases, encompass all the treating subspecialties, the cancer caregivers. Our roots are European, our membership is international - 25% of ESMO members are in Asia. Our approach is to deliver education according to our members' needs and consequently this includes organising activities in coun - tries outside Europe. We have the capabilities, we have the energy, we are happy to do that. But we are always very respectful of the local knowledge in cancer, what is in place and what is needed. One of the aims of my presidency is to move ESMO towards philanthropy, to fund travel costs, for instance, for doctors in under-resourced countries to learn about how a new radiation machine is working, or education about how to optimally manage patients in different settings. I expect we will offer such support primarily to countries in Asia, Africa, South America, but also in Europe when necessary. I think that when an organisation such as ESMO has become so reliable in developing resources and services for patient care, it must ensure appropriate resources are acces - sible to its members and patients in countries with more fragile situations. This is one of the most important things for me. We will also provide funding for new types of fel - lowships, which will be more closely tailored to national needs. If I have to think of any legacy at the end of my presidency I hope it will be this.
