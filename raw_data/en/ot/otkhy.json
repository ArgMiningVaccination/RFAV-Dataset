Here the sunflowers, there the hummingbird\u2014 equal seekers of sweetness. Here the quickening yeast; there the blue plums. Here the clam deep in the speckled sand. Are my boots old? Is my coat torn? Am I no longer young, and still half-perfect? Let me keep my mind on what matters, which is my work, which is mostly standing still and learning to be astonished. The phoebe, the delphinium. The sheep in the pasture, and the pasture. Which is mostly rejoicing, since all the ingredients are here, which is gratitude, to be given a mind and a heart and these body-clothes, a mouth with which to give shouts of joy to the moth and the wren, to the sleepy dug-up clam, telling them all, over and over, how it is that we live forever. \u2014Messenger by Mary Oliver Photo by [Jeb Buchman](https://centerforspiritualityinnature.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a73119e84a4c637121bfe411a&id=1ed55059a4&e=5663e65245) on [Unsplash](https://centerforspiritualityinnature.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a73119e84a4c637121bfe411a&id=4fbd7d8ffd&e=5663e65245) Testimonials I must say that the Monday morning meditations program was a Godsend during these endless days of the pandemic. Insightful photography combined with inspiring words. No better way to begin the work week than by awakening the senses and stirring the soul. REV. DENNIS TESTERMAN (Regarding a 2021 Lenten Meditation Program) "}
