How can I help you? Homeopathy Homeopathy is an effective, individualised, holistic form of traditional medicine. It stimulates the human body's powerful innate healing systems to restore balance in the body, which in turn relieves symptoms. It is appropriate for most acute and chronic health issues. Detox Our environment is increasingly toxic and, despite our best efforts, we are all exposed to potentially toxic substances. It is possible to detox our bodies gently using homeopathy and homeobotanicals. Hormone Balancing When our hormonal balance is off it can cause so many health issues. Homeopathy and homeobotanicals can help to restore your hormonal balance gently and effectively, to get you back in the flow. Homeobotanicals Homeobotanicals (or Hbs) are powerful, synergistic, dynamised blends of organic herbal combinations in liquid form, which detoxify, rebalance and improve nutrition to stimulate healing.

About me I am a qualified homeopath with a special interest in autoimmune thyroiditis known as [Hashimoto's](https://carolynhowgegohomeopathy.co.uk/hashimoto/), or Hashi's. It is the cause of 90% of underactive thyroid diagnoses (hypothyroidism) but as conventional practitioners rarely [test for it](https://carolynhowgegohomeopathy.co.uk/thyroid-tests-hypothyroid-whole-picture/), most people don't even realise it is the cause of their hypothyroidism. I understand that hypothyroidism can be frustrating, debilitating, overwhelming and often all-consuming, but it need not be a life sentence. Despite what you may have been told, you can recover. Would you like to be free of the symptoms of hypothyroidism such as palpitations, anxiety, panic attacks, numbness and tingling, depression, lethargy, exhaustion, lack of motivation, brain fog, aching joints, thinning hair or digestive disorders? Or have you recently received a Hashimoto's diagnosis and would like to get your antibodies down, get your thyroid back in balance, feel like your old self again, and avoid taking drugs such as Synthroid or Levothyroxine for the rest of your life?

With her help I have been able to achieve this and no longer need to take Levothyroxine, which I had taken for almost 20 years. I am delighted with this...the reduction of medications to date has made a big difference to my health and outlook. Reduction of my medication has been undertaken with the support of my consultant. Everyone should seek a homeopath like Carolyn. Within weeks of being under her care I received relief from chronic issues like nagging, recurrent UTIs, and kidney and bladder spasms that no modern medicine could fix. Carolyn has enabled me to be pain free and finally free of ongoing bladder issues...I've never felt better, not just because of the medicine she prescribed but because of her interest in my overall wellbeing. I highly recommend Carolyn for anyone looking for an unquestionably qualified and compassionate homeopath. Carolyn is a very experienced and insightful homeopath. Her case perception and prescription is always spot on. Her approach is caring and empowering. I am very grateful to Carolyn for her help on my Hashimoto's journey and would recommend her to anyone looking for a supportive guide on their quest for health. "}
