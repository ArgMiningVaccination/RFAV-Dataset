HS&DR programme The Health Services and Delivery Research (HS&DR) programme, part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), was established tofund a broad range of research. It combines the strengths and contributions of two previous NIHR research programmes: the Health Services Research (HSR) programme and the Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO) programme, which were merged in January 2012. The HS&DR programme aims to produce rigorous and relevant evidence on the quality, access and organisation of health services including costs and outcomes, as well as research on implementation. The programme will enhance the strategic focus on research that matters to the NHS and is keen to support ambitious evaluative research to improve health services.

This research sought to appraise the potential of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for children and young people with neurodisability. Aim: This research aimed (i) to identify key outcomes of health care for children with neurodisability, beyond morbidity and mortality, from the perspectives of children, parents and professionals; (ii) to critically appraise existing generic multidimensional PROMs; and (iii) to examine whether or not the key outcomes might be measured by existing PROMs. We also sought agreement on a de nition of neurodisability. Methods: Data were gathered in three main ways, (i) a systematic review identi ed eligible generic multidimensional PROMs and peer-reviewed studies evaluating psychometric performance using English-language questionnaires. Studies were appraised for methodological quality and psychometric performance was appraised using standard criteria. (ii) Focus groups and interviews with children andyoung people with neurodisability, and separately with parents, sought to identify important outcomes of NHS care, and their feedback on example PROM questionnaires. (iii) An online Delphi survey was conducted with a multidisciplinary sample of health professionals to seek agreement on appropriate NHSoutcomes. In addition, we convened a consensus meeting with a small nominal group of young people, parents and professionals; the group sought agreement on a core set of important health outcomes.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 v\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and KINDL offer both self-report and a proxy report version for a range of age bands, but evidence of their psychometric performance was weaker. Evidence was lacking in one or more respects for all candidate PROMs, in both generalpopulations and those with neurodisability. Proxy reporting was found generally to be poorly correlatedwith self-report. Focus groups and interviews included 54 children and young people, and 53 parents. The more important health outcomes were felt to be communication, emotional well-being, pain, mobility, independence/self-care, worry/mental health, social activities and sleep. In addition, parents of childrenwith intellectual impairment identi ed behaviour, toileting and safety as important outcomes. Participants suggested problems with the face validity of example PROM questionnaires for measuring NHS care. In theDelphi survey, 276 clinicians from a wide range of professions contributed to at least one of four rounds.Professionals rated pain, hearing, seeing, sleep, toileting, mobility and communication as key goals for the NHS but also identi ed treating neurological symptoms as important. Professionals in the Delphi survey and parents working with the research team agreed a proposed de nition for neurodisability. The consensus meeting con rmed overlap between the outcomes identi ed as important by young people, parents and professionals, but not complete agreement. Conclusions: There was agreement between young people, parents and professionals regarding a core suite of more important health outcomes: communication, emotional well-being, pain, mobility, independence/self-care, worry/mental health, social activities and sleep. In addition, behaviour, toiletingand safety were identi ed as important by parents. This research suggests that it would be appropriate to measure these constructs using PROMs to assess health care. None of the candidate PROMs in the reviewadequately captures all of the identi ed constructs, and there is inadequate evidence that candidate PROMs are psychometrically robust for use across children with neurodisability. Further consultation with young people, families and professionals is warranted to support the use of PROMs to measure NHS outcomes. Research to test potential PROMs with different age groups and conditions would be valuable.

We spoke to 54 children and young people with neurodisability, and to an unrelated group of 53 parents in focus groups and interviews. We also engaged with over 200 health professionals in several rounds of an online survey. A small group of 15 youngpeople, parents and professionals who had participated in the research then met to rank the most important outcomes. The key health outcomes were agreed as communication, emotional well-being, pain, mobility, independence/self-care, worry/mental health, social activities and sleep. Parents of childrenwith learning disability also rated behaviour, toileting and safety as important. NHS performance is increasingly being judged using questionnaires called patient-reported outcome measures, or PROMs. Therefore, we assessed whether or not the key outcomes we identi ed could be measured reliably using existing PROM questionnaires. No PROM was found to be entirely satisfactory in scienti c terms but some showed potential. Few PROMs had been tested speci cally with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Young people and parents reacted unfavourably to examples of the questionnaires weshowed them in our research. Agreement between parents and young people 's responses to these questionnaires is generally not reliable. However, the views of parents are crucial, particularly for children who cannot respond themselves. Further consultation with young people, families and professionals is warranted to support using PROMs to measure NHS outcomes. Research to test potential PROMs withdifferent age groups and conditions would be valuable.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 xxi\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Most commonly, an estimate of 1 in 20 children is cited. Neurodisability is an umbrella term for conditions associated with impairment of the nervous system and includes conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism and epilepsy; it is not uncommon for neurological impairments to co-occur. Aside from asthma, neurodisability is thought to represent the largest proportion of signi cant childhood disability. Although neurodisability comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions, these conditions have much in common in terms of health-care needs. Children and young people affected by neurodisability have arange of impairments; some of these are relatively minor, but many give rise to complex health-care needs.As a consequence, children with a neurodisability are among the most frequent and intensive users of the NHS, requiring care and support from health services across primary and community care, hospital services and specialist centres. Outcomes of a health condition or injury can be considered within the bio-psychosocial framework expressed through the World Health Organization 's (WHO) International Classication of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess the quality of care delivered to NHS patients from the patient perspective. PROMs measure a patient 's health at a single point in time, and are collected through short, self-completed questionnaires. PROMs aim to assess components ofhealth which are largely the components of the ICF under the rubric of health status or health-related quality of life. A wide range of generic and condition-speci c PROMs has been developed for children and young people. Identifying PROMs for neurodisability requires, rst, identi cation of the precise constructs to be measured and, then, the gathering of evidence of psychometric performance of available measures. The NHS Outcomes Framework is part of a strategy that aims to deliver 'the outcomes that matter most to people '. Domain 2 of this framework will detail indicators of the 'quality of life of people with long-term conditions '. Proposed indicators include PROMs. The identi cation of suitable outcome measures will improve the evaluation of integrated NHS care for the large number of children affected by neurodisability, and has the potential to encourage the provision of more appropriate and effective health care. This research sought to contribute to improving children 's health outcomes by identifying a common purpose for NHS services for children and young people with neurodisability, and appraising appropriate outcome measures. Aims and objectives This research aimed to determine (a) which outcomes of NHS care should be assessed for childrenand young people affected by neurodisability, and (b) the extent to which they can be measured byexisting PROMs. To address these aims, the study had the following objectives:i. to identify key health-care outcomes, beyond measures of morbidity and mortality, that are regarded as important by children with neurodisability, and parentsDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 xxiii\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

As part of this research, the serendipitous opportunity arose to develop and determine agreement on ad enition of 'neurodisability '. Hence, the following objective was in addition to those speci ed in the protocol: vii. to develop and test agreement with a de nition of neurodisability that would be acceptable and meaningful to both families and health professionals. Methods The research design comprised three main work streams to address the objectives: 1. a systematic review of the psychometric properties of generic multidimensional PROMs used to measure the health of children and young people 2. focus groups and interviews with children and young people with neurodisability, and separately with parents 3. an online Delphi survey with health professionals working with children and young people affected by neurodisability. The systematic review was designed in two stages. First, we sought to identify all eligible PROMs used to measure the health of children and young people <18 years of age. We considered three categories ofPROMs: (i) generic, for use across all people; (ii) chronic-generic, for use across people with chronic conditions; and (iii) preference-based measures (PBMs), which incorporate a weighting of scores based on a reference valuation of health states into a single index score. Then, we identi ed peer-reviewed publications of studies in which the psychometric performance of identi ed candidate PROMs had been evaluated with children and young people. Studies were categorised by whether they evaluated PROMs in (i) general population or (ii) children and young people with neurodisability, either speci cally or in mixed samples. The domain scales and items of candidate PROMs were coded with reference to the WHO 'sInternational Classication of Functioning, Disability and Health Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY), to provide an indication of what each instrument measures. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Evidence of the psychometric properties or performance of instruments was extracted and examined,including content validity (theoretical framework and/or qualitative research), construct validity (structuralvalidity and hypothesis testing), internal consistency, test- retest reliability, proxy reliability, precision, responsiveness and acceptability. Evidence of psychometric performance was rated using data extractedfrom included studies, with reference to standard criteria. Qualitative research involved focus groups and interviews with children and young people affected by neurodisability, and parents, to identify important outcomes of NHS care and their feedback aboutexample PROM questionnaires. Participants were recruited through networks maintained by the CouncilSCIENTIFIC SUMMARY xxiv NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukfor Disabled Children, and were purposively sampled to capture diagnostic, demographic and geographic variation. Appropriate topic guides were developed for children and parents in consultation with parents working with the researchers. Modi cations were made to include children and young people with a range of abilities, including the 'Talking Mat approach 'with children with profound communication impairment. The framework approach was used for the analysis, with reference to the WHO ICF-CY toenable the comparison of the results of the different streams. An online Delphi survey was conducted with a multidisciplinary sample of health professionals working with children and young people with neurodisability in England. Health professionals were recruited initially through child development teams, supplemented by purposive sampling through professionalsocieties to recruit under-represented professions. Data were collected using several iterative rounds of an online Delphi survey, an established method for seeking consensus. Questions in each round addressed (i) aspects of health clinicians target (rounds 1 and 2); (ii) aspects of health that the NHS should routinelyassess (rounds 2 and 3); (iii) appropriateness of constructs of health covered by candidate PROMs (round 4); and (iv) proposed de nitions of neurodisability (rounds 1, 2 and 3). A consensus meeting with a small group of young people, parents and professionals was convened to seek agreement on a core set of more important aspects of health that could represent key health outcomes for neurodisability. Results The systematic review identi ed 41 eligible PROMs, and 126 papers that reported evidence of psychometric performance of 25 PROMs using an English-language questionnaire: 19 generic PROMs, two chronic-generic PROMs and four PBMs. Stronger evidence was found for a small number of PROMs:KIDSCREEN (generic), DISABKIDS (chronic-generic), and Child Health Utility 9D (preference-based measure). The Healthy Pathways may also be a promising instrument, with emerging evidence. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and KINDL provide a broader age spectrum and include self- and proxy-reportversions, but evidence of psychometric properties was weaker. Robust evidence was lacking in one ormore respects for all candidate PROMs, both in general populations and in those with neurodisability. Proxy reporting using PROMs was found generally to be poorly correlated with self-reports by children. In the qualitative research, 54 children and young people participated: 50 participated in focus groups and four in interviews. There were 53 parents who participated in the research: 47 in focus groups and six in interviews. Children, young people and parents viewed health outcomes as inter-related and withreference to a hierarchy. Participants identi ed clearly the contribution foundation and intermediary outcomes made to a smaller set of higher-level outcomes that they felt were most important to have agood quality of life. Health outcomes that were highlighted more frequently by young people and parents were communication, mobility, pain, self-care, temperament, interpersonal relationships and interactions,community and social life, emotional well-being, and gaining independence/future aspirations. Someparents were also particularly concerned with sleep, behaviour and/or safety if those issues were pertinent to their children. In terms of hierarchy, children and young people identi ed as most important interpersonal relationships and interactions, community and social life and emotional well-being; and parents identi ed community and social life, gaining independence/future aspiration and emotional well-being. Key factors that might be considered when using PROMs with disabled children and theirfamilies included contextual issues associated with questionnaires and entitlements for families of disabledchildren, problems with face validity, the cognitive task, and enhancing presentation and administration procedures to encourage participation.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 xxv\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Responses to all four rounds including only participants from England were, respectively, 233 out of 284 (82.0%), 232 out of 294 (78.9%), 227 out of 293 (77.5%) and 191 out of 292 (65.4%). Those aspects of health that were rated by health professionals as most commonly targeted, and also viewed as the responsibility of the NHS, were predominantly located in the WHO ICF 'body functions and structures '-pain, hearing, seeing, sleep and toileting -or were those domains of 'activities and participation 'most readily in fluenced by provision of available assistive technologies: mobility and communication. Less frequently endorsed as the responsibility of the NHS, by consensus among participants, were play, relationships with family and friends, sport and leisure, and learning and applying knowledge. Professionals also identi ed treating various neurological-speci c symptoms that are less amenable to assessment using generic PROMs. Responses to the rst three rounds that included iterations of proposed de nitions of neurodisability, and several participants from outside England, were, respectively, 245 out of 290 (84.4%), 242 out of 300 (80.6%) and 237 out of 297 (79.7%). There was agreement (93% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed) with the nal iteration of the proposed de nition: Neurodisability describes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. A specic diagnosis may not be identied. Conditions may vary over time, occur alone or in combination, andinclude a broad range of severity and complexity. The impact may include difculties with movement, cognition, hearing and vision, communication, emotion and behaviour. There were 15 participants at the consensus meeting: three young people, ve parents and seven health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, two paediatricians, nurse, paediatric surgeon, child and adolescent psychiatrist); apologies were received from a speech and language therapist and anorthopaedic surgeon. There appeared to be agreement between participating young people, parents and professionals regarding a suite of more important health outcomes: communication, emotional well-being, pain, mobility, independence/self-care, worry/mental health, social activities and sleep and, for childrenwith intellectual impairments, also behaviour, toileting and safety. Conclusions and recommendations Selection of any PROM should be consistent with the purpose of measurement and satisfactory evidenceof psychometric properties; the questionnaire must also have face validity to respondents. There was onlypartial overlap between the key outcomes identi ed by children, young people, parents and professionals, and the items and content assessed by more competitive candidate PROMs from the review. Generalfeedback on the questionnaires indicated poor face validity. Even though several questions were felt to berelevant, other key health outcomes were identi ed as missing. In addition, young people and parents disliked questions that were perceived as negatively phrased. Careful cognitive interviewing should beundertaken with children, young people and parents to ensure that questionnaires have face validity topotential respondents with reference to the purpose of measurement. Further research is required toevaluate the psychometric properties of generic PROMs for children and young people with neurodisability, particularly testing item invariance across conditions, age groups and ability to detect meaningful change. Parents identi ed discomfort in being able to respond to some questions as their child' s proxy, particularly those about emotional domains and about activities that take place away from them such as school and with friends. Hence, there should be consideration as to whether or not these questions should beasked of parents, especially as ample evidence identi ed in this review suggests strongly that proxy reporting of such domains is unreliable. Parents 'reports may be desirable to be able to assess those children who are too young to respond, or do not have the cognitive capacity to do so. There were someoutcomes that parents felt were more important to assess for children with intellectual impairments,SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY xxvi NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukincluding behaviour and safety. These may be important outcomes to include in parent-reported instruments, but less relevant to include in self-reported questionnaires for children and young people. This research has proposed a new de nition of neurodisability. The ndings provide an incremental step towards a vision for what health services might seek to achieve for children and young people with neurodisability. The ndings of this research can also inform health service policy regarding the NHS Outcomes Framework and the selection of PROMs. We have identi ed psychometric issues and contextual factors that affect the implementation of PROMs to assess NHS outcomes. Families may nd it dif cult to partition health outcomes that are a consequence of the NHS, and health professionals perceive a limiton what 'health services 'can do for children and young people. The ndings may also have salience for other health-related outcome policy initiatives. Current policy initiatives include considering measuring cross-sector integrated education, health and social care outcomes, and including young adults up to 20 and 25 years of age. Assessing health outcomes with a common metric through these age bandswould offer strong advantages in terms of monitoring and evaluation of services.

Neurodisability is an umbrella term for conditions associated with impairment of the nervous system and includes conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism and epilepsy; it is not uncommon for neurologicalimpairments to co-occur. Aside from asthma, neurodisability probably represents the largest proportionof signi cant childhood disability. 5Individually, many conditions that result in a neurodisability are rare, whereas, grouped together, they are relatively common. Neurodisability is a UK term; there is a subspecialty of paediatric training within the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health devoted to this group of children. However, the term neurodisability is not dened, and there is no universally recognised agreement as to which conditions are included. The term has arisen as a way of describing a group of conditions which give rise to similar problems, health and educational needs, and which are commonly managed by the multidisciplinary teams skilled in multisystem health conditions. Without a clear and agreed de nition, it is not possible to derive consistent and reliable estimates of the prevalence of neurodisability to inform needs assessment and appropriate resource planning. The lack of a denition of neurodisability, and lack of clarity about which conditions are included, also hinders effective communication, especially when considering health outcomes and the planning and evaluating of health services, multiprofessional teams and care pathways. In other English-speaking countries, the term neurodevelopmental disorders is used to describe similar conditions in children. For instance, we found a de nition of neurodevelopmental disorders as 'disorders where motor, cognitive, behavioural, and/or language functioning are affected by central nervous system impairments, resulting in a variety of challenges associated with ambulation, information processing, self-regulation and communication '.6To our knowledge, no de nition is widely agreed on. Health services for neurodisability Although neurodisability comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions, these conditions have much in common in terms of resulting health-care needs. Children and young people affected by neurodisability have a range of impairments; some of these are relatively minor, but many give rise to complex health-care needs. As a consequence, they are among the most frequent and intensive users of the NHS, requiringcare and support from health services across primary and community care, hospital services and specialist centres. Although largely unable to cure the neurological impairments, health services aim to optimise functioning and to maintain/improve the health and well-being of these children, most of whom can be expected to survive into adulthood. 7Funding and provision of health services for disabled children are recognised to be highly variable.8A report by Sir Ian Kennedy into improving health services for children and young peopleDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 1\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Disabled children are known to face health and social disadvantage. Thus, over recent years, a range of initiatives have sought to improve health and social care provision, for example the National ServiceFramework for Children, Aiming High for Disabled Children, and the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes in Children and Young People 's Services. The Every Child Matters outcome framework has provided a useful means to develop indicators assessing educational and social care outcomes for children and, with adjustments, is proposed to be appropriate and meaningful for disabled children. 10 Nevertheless, it has been dif cult to assess the impact of NHS care on disabled children, as there is no overall measure of their health outcomes. Hence, identifying outcome measures of how the NHS is impacting on the health of children with neurodisability would be extremely useful, particularly if the measurement was grounded in the perspectives and priorities of children, young people and their parents.Identifying an agreed set of health outcomes between families and professionals would also provide afocus for the combined efforts of the NHS. In fact, such outcomes could constitute the 'shared vision 'of what health services are trying to achieve for disabled children, as recommended by Sir Ian Kennedy. Health outcomes Outcomes of a health condition or injury can be considered within the bio-psychosocial framework expressed through the World Health Organization 's (WHOs) International Classication of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).11The WHO ICF classi es components of health and functioning as 'body structures and functions 'and'activities and participation '. Thus, a disease or injury may lead to impairments of body structure or function, limitation in activities and/or restriction in participation. These impairments, limitations and restrictions are collectively referred to as disability, and the relationshipsbetween these components are mediated by environmental and personal factors. Key environmentalfactors are health-care services, systems and policies, and social interventions. In the context of neurodisability, it is often dif cult for health services to make changes in chronic impairments of 'body functions and structures' . Consequently, there may be a greater likelihood of health and social interventions maintaining or improving 'activities 'and/or the 'participation '. Clearly, the constructs assessed using outcome measures should be those most appropriate to assessing likely impacts of health care, and must be credible to patients, in this instance children and young people affected by neurodisability, and their parents. 12,13 Patient-reported outcome measures Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess the quality of care delivered to NHS patients from the patient perspective. PROMs measure a patient 's health at a single point in time, and are collected through short, self-completed questionnaires. PROMs aim to assess components of health, which are largely thecomponents of the ICF under the rubric of health status or health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A widerange of generic and condition-speci c PROMs has been developed for children and young people. 14 Identifying PROMs for neurodisability requires, rst, identi cation of the precise constructs to be measured and, then, the gathering of evidence of psychometric performance of available measures.12 Language and cultural issues can affect how people interpret and/or respond to questions; hence, onecannot simply assume that PROMs perform consistently across languages and cultures. 15Therefore, forINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 2 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukexample, the Food and Drug Administration guidance on PROMs recommends that evidence be provided of the process used to test measurement properties across different language and cultures.15 Structured reviews have identi ed generic and condition-speci c PROMs that can be used with children.14 Others have discussed conceptual issues pertaining to what such instruments measure for children and young people affected by neurodisability.16-18However, no systematic reviews have comprehensively appraised published research about the psychometric performance of generic PROMs when used withchildren and young people affected by neurodisability. Children and young people have the right to report on their own health. 12Although there has been wide recognition that children 's voices should be heard in research and service design, this is often not the case19and, in particular, the voices of disabled children are frequently overlooked. Chronological age is not a clear criterion for judging when children are capable to self-report their health by completing a questionnaire, although children aged 8 years are widely believed to be competent.12Parent and carer proxy reports are the only way to assess outcomes for children cognitively unable to self-report, butthese do represent a different perspective to the child 's own view. However, as it is parents who typically seek health care on their child 's behalf, they need to be offered an opportunity to report their perspective. Ideally, both children 's and parents 'reports should be collected so that both perspectives are represented independently. 12 NHS Outcomes Framework The NHS Outcomes Framework is part of a strategy that aims to deliver 'the outcomes that matter most to people '.20Domain 2 of this framework will detail indicators of the 'quality of life of people with long-term conditions '. Much of the detail is still being determined and will evolve over the coming years.20 Proposed indicators include PROMs. There continues to be a substantive programme of methodological,applied and policy research about PROMs funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR),Medical Research Council and the Department of Health. Much of the work has focused on adults andless on children. There is a clear direction of travel whereby PROMs look set to be one of the key performance indicators in the UK and other health systems. 13 As part of consultations on the initial proposal for the NHS Outcomes Framework , the Royal College ofPaediatrics & Child Health proposed, pragmatically, that there should be a single PROM 'for a basket of conditions 'rather than aiming to have one for every diagnosis. 21 The identi cation of suitable outcome measures will improve the evaluation of integrated NHS care for the large number of children affected by neurodisability, and has the potential to encourage the provision of more appropriate and effective health care. This research sought to contribute to positively improving children 's health outcomes by providing a high-quality means for measuring them. Identifying a common purpose for NHS services will improve health outcomes for children and young people affected by neurodisability.9Establishing appropriate outcome measures will help to ensure that NHS resources are deployed effectively and in an ef cient manner.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 3\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

As part of this research, the serendipitous opportunity arose to develop and determine agreement on a denition of 'neurodisability ', in terms of the types of conditions it includes. Hence, the following objective was in addition to those speci ed in the protocol: vii. to develop and test agreement with a de nition of neurodisability that would be acceptable and meaningful to both families and health professionals. The research design comprised three main work streams to address these aims and objectives: 1. a systematic review of the psychometric properties of generic PROMs used to measure the health of children and young people 2. qualitative research involving focus groups and interviews with children and young people affected by neurodisability, and separately with parents 3. an online Delphi survey with health professionals working with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Finally, a consensus meeting with a small group of young people, parents and professionals was convened to seek agreement on a core set of more important aspects of health that could represent key healthoutcomes for neurodisability. The report The approach taken for each work stream, and ndings from each approach, are described separately in the report. We begin by describing the public and patient involvement (PPI) in the research (see Chapter 3 ). Then, we describe the systematic review (see Chapter 4 ), the qualitative research (see Chapter 5 ) and online Delphi survey (see Chapter 6 ). In practice, these activities were carried out in parallel. In Chapter 7 we describe the consensus meeting. These sections are followed by a narrative synthesis (see Chapter 8 ), where the ndings of each component of the research are brought together, conclusions are drawn, and relevant implications for health policy and research are considered.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 5\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

This chapter describes how parents of children affected by neurodisability were involved as part of the research team, and discusses the impacts that parent involvement had on the research, parents and the researchers. This chapter is intended to describe the PPI activities and provide re flections rather than be a rigorous appraisal of the involvement. The report takes in to account the recommendations for complete and transparent reporting of PPI in health services research.23 Peninsula Cerebra Research Unit and public and patient involvement Involving stakeholders and members of the public in research is believed to improve the utility of applied health service research.22The Peninsula Cerebra Research Unit (PenCRU) at University of Exeter Medical School is committed to involving families of disabled children in all aspects of the research process.PenCRU achieves this involvement through recruiting and retaining a 'Family Faculty '. Our rationale for involving families of disabled children in research embraces the philosophical as well as pragmatic advantages and policy-relevant advantages. 24 The PenCRU Family Faculty is currently a cadre of several hundred parents of disabled children, mostlyresident in Devon, who have indicated a willingness to be involved in research. We have learned to be flexible in our approaches to PPI in the context of childhood disability research. We understand that being involved in research is not a top priority for these parents and, therefore, provide opportunities for them to be involved in research at a level that suits their situation and the time they have available. Therefore, while our overall approach and ethos is to seek to work in partnership with families, in practice ourmethods for PPI vary from being wholly collaborative to, in other instances, being relatively consultative. Methods The chief investigator (CM) conceived the idea for the research based on policy relevance and personalinterests, skills and experience; we do not believe that parents in the Family Faculty would havesuggested the topic. However, the proposal was discussed and endorsed by the PenCRU advisory group prior to applying for funding. One parent participated as a co-applicant on the application, although their contribution to the protocol was consultative regarding the salience of the research ratherthan methodological. Subsequent to funding being approved by NIHR, the opportunity to be involved in the research was advertised to the Family Faculty by e-mail. Including the parent who was a co-applicant, ve parents volunteered to become involved. Four of these parents participated alongside members of the research team in the rst co-investigator meeting held in Exeter, UK, in November 2012, and three participated in the co-investigator meeting held towards the end of the project, in April 2013. Parents participated in several meetings during the research to help develop and review appropriate topic guides for the qualitative research (described in more detail in Chapter 5 ), to hear progress and ask questions about the systematic review, contribute to and re ne the de nition of neurodisability, and to reflect on the outcomes suggested by professionals in the Delphi survey (see Chapter 6 ). Parents also communicated and contributed by e-mail, particularly in relation to developing the de nition.

Meetings were held generally during the school day (10 a.m. to 1 p.m.) and, although they were structured with an agenda, the meetings wereinformal and discursive, and followed by a sociable lunch. Parents were provided opportunities to comment on the nal report and conclusions and recommendations, and helped to write the plain English summary. They will help to produce plain language summaries for subsequent academic papers produced from the research, and help in implementing the dissemination strategy for the ndings. Measuring the impact of the PPI was not a formal element in the protocol. Nevertheless, we sought theviews of the parents who had been involved using a feedback questionnaire. We asked parents how they had been involved in the research; their general experience of being involved; what were positive or goodthings about being involved; whether there were any parts of the experience of being involved that werenot so good or could have perhaps been better; whether or not they felt that they had an impact on the way the research was done; whether or not being involved had any particular impacts on them; and whether or not they felt part of the research team. Members of the whole research team were offered theopportunity to comment by e-mail on whether they felt parents having been involved had an impact on the research or on them personally. Parent feedback Parents who gave feedback generally described their involvement as having been part of a 'group of parents 'involved with the research team. They recalled the co-investigator meetings, other meetings, being sent documents and commenting on these by e-mail. They described their experience generally as interesting and educational, and appeared to have enjoyed meeting other members of the team andadding their own perspectives to those expressed by others in the team. There were indications that they felt that any impact they might have had on the research was as a group, rather than by them as individual parents. Their impression was that their greatest impact on the research was their contributionsto the de nition of neurodisability. While they did feel involved in the research, they did not feel that they were necessarily integral to theresearch team, and one expressed that they felt in some ways the research could have been carried out without them. One parent indicated that they would have liked greater involvement in the interviews and analysis for the qualitative research but also appreciated that parents are busy and they may not have beenable to be more involved, even if the opportunity had been offered. One indicated that they wished that they could have been more help to the team, which was expressed as a slightly negative re flection. Researcher perceptions Members of the research team in Exeter felt that parents made signi cant and valuable contributions both at co-investigator meetings and through their other contributions. In the rst co-investigator meeting, parents were noted to have made important contributions in the small group discussion planning the qualitative research. At the second co-investigator meeting, parents were felt to have provided importantperspectives to the general discussions interpreting the ndings of the three research streams, and in particular the discussion on how to approach and conduct the consensus meeting. Involving parents atthese meetings meant that documents and presentations had to be prepared in accessible formats, whichPUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT 8 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukmay have taken a little more time. The feeling generally among researchers appeared to be that parents ' input positively in fluenced the dynamics of discussion. The researchers involved in the Delphi survey that developed the de nition of neurodisability felt that the contributions of parents made by e-mail and at meetings were invaluable. The two meetings the Exeter team had with parents to develop the topic guides for the qualitative research were felt to have beencrucial to developing an appropriate format for these events. Researchers carrying out the systematicreview found it dif cult to nd ways to involve parents meaningfully and usefully in that aspect of the research due the technicalities of psychometric evaluation, and the tasks associated with systematicreviews generally. Feedback from members of the research team based elsewhere in the UK was that the approach taken to PPI in this research was laudable, and went beyond the 'tick-box 'approach that they had observed previously with some other projects. One researcher who was less familiar with childhood disability felt educated to the demands of parenting disabled children by meeting and talking with the parents, and remarked profound admiration for their contributions to the research given the demands of theirdaily lives. Discussion There was a general feeling that this project presented a number of challenges for enabling the fullcollaborative involvement of parents, especially given the technical nature of the systematic review. Thereare several opportunities for PPI when conducting systematic reviews: suggestion of the topic and development of speci c research questions; in the development of the protocol and determining the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria; and in the conduct of the review by helping to draft or review the report. 25For this project, the opportunity to involve parents in each of these activities was somewhat compromised due to the topic and research questions having been predetermined, and the technicalunderstanding required for appraising the psychometric aspects of PROMs. There were greater opportunities for involving parents as part of the research team in planning the qualitative research and Delphi survey with professionals. Pragmatically, there were few opportunities to involve parents in the analysis of qualitative data, as members of the research team (AA and AF) who ledthis aspect of the analysis were based in London. Planning more substantive involvement of parents throughout the qualitative analysis may well have provided enhanced insight and depth of analysis; nevertheless, it would also have taken more time, and would have needed to be factored into the overallproject management. We have learned from this project that full collaborative involvement of families in designing and managing the project would have provided greater scope for impacting on the research from the start, and also may have enabled us to plan greater opportunities for involvement throughout. Developing a more detailed plan for involvement activities as part of the protocol may have been bene cial. In addition, producing a plain language summary of the protocol would have been helpful to assist parents tounderstand the context and purpose of the study; the plain language summary would have aided advertising of the opportunity for being involved. Time and interest of parents permitting, providing a package of introductory training for parents about PROMs and appraising measurement properties wouldhave been ideal. In terms of evaluating the impact of involving parents in childhood disability research generally, it may be useful to record the preconceived notions and plans that researchers take into meetings with parents, and recording afterwards what, if anything, has changed by the end of the meeting.

There remains scope for methodological research to learn more about appropriate approaches to PPI in the childhood disability research context. Summary There was a strong commitment to involving parents of children and young people affected by neurodisability in this research. In practice, a number of challenges were identi ed. In particular, the topic and technical methodology presented opportunities for more innovative involvement activities, such as aplain language summary of the protocol, or providing training. On balance, involvement of parents wasperceived positively by those parents involved and by the researchers.PUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT 10 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukChapter 4 Systematic review of patient-reported outcomes for children and young people Aims and objectives The aims of the review were to identify generic PROMs used to measure the health of children and young people and to appraise psychometric evidence of the performance when evaluated using English-language questionnaires. The objectives for the systematic review were: 1. to identify eligible candidate generic PROMs for measuring the health of children and young people 2. to identify peer-reviewed publications of studies in which the psychometric performance of candidate PROMs had been evaluated in general populations 3. to identify peer-reviewed publications of studies in which the psychometric properties of candidate PROMs had been evaluated speci cally in a population of children and young people affected by neurodisability 4. to appraise the methodological quality of the identi ed studies that evaluated psychometric properties of candidate PROMs 5. to appraise the evidence for the psychometric properties of candidate PROMs both in general populations and with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Methods The systematic review was designed in two stages. In stage 1, we sought to identify all generic PROMsused to measure the health of children and young people < 18 years of age. In stage 2, we identi ed and critically appraised peer-reviewed publications of studies in which the psychometric performance ofidenti ed candidate PROMs had been evaluated with children and young people. In stage 2, studies were categorised depending on whether they evaluated PROMs in (i) a general population of children or (ii) children and young people affected by neurodisability. The systematic review was conducted following the general principles published by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. 26The systematic review team developed a detailed protocol for the review from the original proposal (www.netscc.ac.uk/hsdr/ les/project/HSR_PRO_10 -2002 -16_V01.pdf). We applied to publish the full protocol with PROSPERO in February 2012; however, we were informed that,as a methodology review, our systematic review did not meet their inclusion criteria at the time. However, the protocol was published on the Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care(CLAHRC) for the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC) website (http://clahrc-peninsula.nihr.ac.uk/patient-reported-outcome-measures-in-children-with-neurodisability.php). The protocol was updated to take account of methodological decisions that were required as the review progressed. Stage 1: identi cation of patient-reported outcome measures Search strategy The search strategy was designed by an information specialist (MR) following consultation with the systematic review team, and with reference to the methodological lters published by the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) group27andDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 11\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014. This work was produced by Morris et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health. This issue may be freely reproduced for the purposes of private research and study and extracts (or indeed, the full report) may be included in professional journals provided that suitable acknowledgement is made and the reproduction is not associated with any form of advertising.

Search terms were grouped as follows: lgroup 1: general names for measures (e.g. questionnaires, instruments or tools) lgroup 2: multidimensional health construct terms (e.g. quality of life or health status) lgroup 3: terms to describe children and young people (e.g. children, teenagers or adolescents). The terms within each group were combined with a Boolean OR command and were searched in combination using a Boolean AND command. Piloting this search strategy produced a total of 38,893 citations. Systematic screening of this number of citations was judged to be too burdensome within theconnes of the resources allocated to the project. A fourth set of terms was therefore added to increase the speci city of the search: lgroup 4: terms relevant to psychometric performance (e.g. validity or reliability). As this project was conceived to inform the NHS Outcomes Framework in the UK, we were interested onlyin PROM questionnaires that were available and evaluated in English; hence, the search was limited toEnglish language. The search was also limited by date to publications from 1992, as the team agreed that it was unlikely that PROMs had been developed before this date. The search strategy was designed for MEDLINE (via OvidSP) and modi ed for EMBASE and PsycINFO (via OvidSP) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (via EBSCO host). The searches were run on 20 and 21 March 2012. Separate searches were carried out on the Oxford PROM bibliographic database and Patient-Reported Outcome and Quality of Life Instruments Database. Reference lists of systematic reviews were also checked. 14,29 -32The search strategy (for MEDLINE/OvidSP) is shown in Appendix 1 . All search results were exported to reference manager software (EndNote X6, Thomson Reuters, CA, USA) and deduplicated. EndNote was used to manage the citation database throughout the project. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The aim of this stage of the review was to identify potential candidate PROMs. Eligibility criteria weredeveloped to guide selection ( Table 1 ).

Discrepancies were discussed and resolved with the arbitration of a third reviewer (either CM or AJ), where necessary. A flow chart describing the process of identifying relevant literature for this stage of the review can be found in Figure 1 . Data extraction The result of this stage of the search was a list of potentially eligible candidate PROMs. Names andacronyms of all PROMs cited were extracted by one reviewer (AJ) who applied the eligibility criteria.

For each candidate PROM, an individual search strategy was created to identify studies where the PROM had been used and evaluated in generalpopulations (search 2.1). Three groups of search terms were used: lgroup 1: name(s) of the PROM lgroup 2: terms to describe children and young people lgroup 3: psychometric terms (e.g. validity or reliability). The electronic search was designed for MEDLINE (via OvidSP) and modi ed for EMBASE and PsycINFO (via OvidSP). No language or date limits were applied to the search. The search used in MEDLINE (OvidSP)can be found in Appendix 2 . In total, 51 searches were run on each of the three databases between 18 July and 5 September 2012. A further search strategy was designed to identify studies where candidate PROMs might have been used speci cally with neurodisability (search 2.2). Three groups of search terms were used: lgroup 1: name(s) of the PROM lgroup 2: terms to describe children and young people lgroup 3: neurodisability terms, including key exemplar conditions. The terms used included MeSH terms, and variations of the three exemplar conditions set out in ouroriginal proposal, namely cerebral palsy, autism and epilepsy. The search was designed in MEDLINE (OvidSP) and modi ed for EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (via OvidSP), CINAHL (via EBSCO host) and NHS Database of Economic Evaluations. Searches were run between 12 and 25 September 2012. The strategy used for MEDLINE/OvidSP can be found in Appendix 3 . Backwards citation chasing (one generation) was carried out using all reference lists from papers included in this stage of the review. Forward citation chasing was carried out between 28 January and 6 February2013 using Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (via Web of Knowledge) for included studies. Search results were exported into separate EndNote libraries created for each PROM. We sought to locate a copy of each questionnaire; if a copy was not readily available, authors and/or developers of the PROMs were contacted to request a copy. We also contacted the authors or developers of all PROMs for which no evidence of the psychometric performance in an English-speaking populationwas found. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The aim of this stage of the review was to identify evidence for the performance of candidate PROMswhen evaluated with children and young people. Criteria to guide inclusion and exclusion are shown inTable 2 . Study selection Titles and abstracts of all unique citations were screened against the eligibility criteria by one reviewer (AJ)and a sample of 10% of decisions was checked by a second reviewer, (CM) with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third (CJ) where necessary. The full text of any potentially relevant article was retrievedand screened using the same procedure. A flow chart describing the process of study selection for this stage of the review can be found later in this chapter ( Figure 2 ).SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 14 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukData extraction Data were extracted using standardised, piloted data extraction forms. For each included candidate PROM, the following were extracted: name of PROM and acronym, purpose of measurement, number of items, the responder, completion time, age range, recall period, response options, key reference paper, and typesof domains/dimensions assessed. We determined that there were three types of eligible candidate generic PROMs: (i) generic PROMs, designed for use across all people; (ii) chronic-generic PROMs, intended for use across people with chronicconditions; and (iii) preference-based measures (PBMs). Scores from generic and chronic-generic PROMs are typically determined directly from responses to items in the questionnaires. PBMs have two components; the responses to patient questionnaires are transformed using a weighting system, based onvaluation of health states by a reference population, to produce a single index score between 1 and 0 (or less), where 1 equates to full health and 0 is dead. 33,34 The domain scales and items of each candidate PROM were inspected with reference to the WHO 's International Classication of Functioning, Disability and Health, Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY)11,35 to provide an indication of the constructs each instrument was measuring. It was not our aim to allocate every item from candidate PROM questionnaires to a precise ICF code using proposed linking rules.36 Instead, our mapping sought to use the ICF-CY to describe what the scales of each candidate PROM proposed to measure. We coded at the higher levels of the ICF-CY, and also identi ed separately constructs not represented in the ICF-CY.TABLE 2 Eligibility criteria for studies evaluating the performance of PROMs Inclusion criteria Specification Population English speaking children and young people < 18 years old General and/or neurodisability populations Instruments Generic PROMs as listed as a result of stage 1; child self-report and parent (primary carer) reported measures are eligibleEnglish version of the instrument administered Evidence Reporting of any aspects of psychometric performance, including reliability, validity, responsiveness, precision, interpretability, acceptability and feasibility Study design Studies speci cally designed to evaluate psychometric properties.

Data were extracted by one reviewer (KA/AJ) and checked by a second reviewer (AJ/KA), with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third (CM) where necessary. For each included paper, the methodological quality of the study and the completeness of the report were assessed using the COSMIN checklist.37The COSMIN checklist assesses the methods and reporting of internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity and responsiveness. Cross-cultural validity is not reported as we only included studies using an English version of the eligible PROMs. The checklist was administered by one reviewer (CM) and a 10% sample was rated by a second (AJ). Studies that used Rasch analysis were alsoassessed by one of the team with expertise in these techniques (AT). The COSMIN checklist uses a 'worst score counts' rating for methods used to test psychometric properties, producing a quality assessment of excellent, good, fair or poor. 37Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or with the involvement of a third reviewer (CJ), where necessary. Then, any data on evidence of the psychometric properties or performance of instruments were extracted including content validity (theoretical framework and/or qualitative research), construct validity (structuralvalidity and hypothesis testing), internal consistency, test- retest reliability, proxy reliability, precision, responsiveness, acceptability and feasibility. Data were extracted by one reviewer (KA/AJ) and checked by asecond reviewer (AJ/KA), with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third (CM) where necessary. Appraisal of evidence for psychometric performance Our original proposal focused on evidence of psychometric properties when evaluated with children andyoung people affected by neurodisability. However, we were mindful that some emerging PROMs may have only been tested with general populations, and it would be advantageous to be aware of the state of the evidence of the psychometric performance of such PROMs. Therefore, the evidence of psychometricperformance for each instrument was organised by whether the sample in the study was (i) a generalpopulation of children and young people, (ii) children and young people with mixed chronic conditions that included neurodisability, or (iii) speci cally, children and young people affected by neurodisability. Evidence for each of these populations was studied separately for the three groups of PROMs: genericPROMs, chronic-generic PROMs, and PBMs. Appraisal criteria Standardised criteria and thresholds were used to judge the evidence of psychometric performance of each candidate PROM.38,39The criteria used to assess and select patient-completed instruments included their appropriateness for measuring the health of children and young people affected by neurodisability, and an appraisal of their validity, reliability, responsiveness, precision, interpretability, acceptability and feasibility.38 A summary of the criteria and indices used to judge psychometric properties is provided in Table 3 . To demonstrate content validity, PROM developers should describe a clear conceptual framework underpinning the instrument, and incorporate qualitative research with potential respondents to inform development of the items in the questionnaire. This is also likely to ensure that the questionnaire has face validity to future potential respondents. Construct validity concerns whether or not a scale is measuring what is stated as the purpose of measurement. Construct validity can be seen as comprising two aspects, internal and external. Internalconstruct validity is concerned with the valid structure of the scale, and is often examined through factoranalysis. 40,41Item response theory approaches also can apply an initial factor analysis, as they assume unidimensionality,42but Rasch analysis often implements a post-hoc test of unidimensionality based uponSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 16 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukanalysis of the residuals.43External construct validity can take several forms; for example, hypothesis testing examines evidence of whether scales correlate well with other scales measuring a similar construct (convergent validity) or correlate poorly with instruments that are measured something unrelated (divergent validity). Correlations are considered low if r< 0.3, moderate if rlies between 0.30 and 0.49 and high if r< 0.5.44Hypotheses should be stated a priori, including the postulated direction and magnitude of correlation.37Discriminative validity describes whether or not an instrument detects 'known differences 'between respondents. Internal consistency is the extent to which all items in a scale are measuring the construct of interestand is assessed by Cronbach 's alpha statistic ( ). Scales with an statistic between 0.7 and 0.9 are considered to be composed of items that adequately measure a uniform construct. 45The statistic assumes unidimensionality. If the assumption of local independence is violated, or there are simply a large numberof items, Cronbach 's alpha may be in flated and/or an unreliable indicator. 45 All scores from PROMs include some level of measurement error, which can be estimated using calculations such as standard error of measurement;45Rasch analysis estimates the measurement error for individual items (and persons) rather than the average of the scale level.46 The reliability of instruments is determined by repeating administration on different occasions when respondents have not changed with respect to the construct being measured (test -retest). The level of agreement is also reported where child and parent responses are typically compared (inter-rater reliability).38Reliability coef cients are directly related to the variability in the population in which they areTABLE 3 Appraisal of psychometric properties and indicative criteria Psychometric property Indicative criteria Content validity Clear conceptual framework consistent with stated purpose of measurement Qualitative research with potential respondents Construct validity Structural validity from factor analysis Post-hoc tests of unidimensionality by Rasch analysis Hypothesis testing, with a priori hypotheses about direction and magnitude of expected effect sizes Tests for differential item and scale functioning between sex, age groups and different diagnoses Reproducibility Test-retest reliability ICC > 0.7 adequate, > 0.9 excellent Child- and parent-reported reliability ICC > 0.7 Internal consistency Cronbach 's alpha coef cient: > 0.7 and < 0.9 Responsiveness Longitudinal data about change in scores with reference to hypotheses, measurement error, minimal important difference Precision Assessment of measurement error; floor or ceiling effects < 15%; evidence provided by Rasch analysis and/or interval level scaling Acceptability Non-participation or non-response to surveys Proportion of missing data Appropriateness Content pertinent to children and young people affected by neurodisability Excellent psychometric performance when evaluated with children and young people affected by neurodisability ICC, intraclass correlation coef cient.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 17\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The effect size is a standardised measure ofthe magnitude of change, calculated by dividing the amount of change by the SD of the baseline score. 44 MDC is an indication of the amount of change required to have con dence that it is change beyond measurement error; a common standard is to use a 90% con dence level (MDC90).48The MID is the mean change in score reported by the respondents who indicate that they had noticed some small change.49 Precision is concerned with the number and accuracy of distinctions made by an instrument.50Indices include how well the possible responses to each item are distributed over a true range. Use of Rasch analysis in scale development has suggested that scale scores vary in their precision (standard error) across the spectrum of the scale, with greater precision at the centre of the scale. Interval-level scales, such asthose derived in the weighting of PBMs, inherently offer greater precision. A further aspect of precision isto examine whether there is any evidence of floor or ceiling effects, typically judged to occur when more than 15% of respondents' scores aggregate at one end of the scale. 38 Acceptability to respondents is infl uenced by the design of a questionnaire, the number of items and the time necessary to complete the questionnaire.51Cognitive interviewing is a process to investigate how potential respondents understand PROM questions. Appropriateness in this context is also dependent on evidence of excellent psychometric properties of candidate PROMs when evaluated with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Given thatthe purpose of the review is to identify and recommend a generic PROM for children < 18 years, and with different diagnoses under the umbrella of neurodisability conditions, we looked particularly for evidence of group invariance across age groups and different conditions. This would indicate that validcomparisons could be made across age and diagnostic groups. Two practical issues considered were interpretability and feasibility. Interpretability is concerned with how meaningful the scores are produced by an instrument; indicators of interpretability are their face validity tothose using the scores from PROMs. 51Feasibility is also concerned with the researchers 'perspectives, and assesses whether or not the instrument is easy to administer and process, in terms of managing dataand the calculation of scores. 52 Summarising evidence of psychometric performance Several similar systems have evolved for summarising evidence to support psychometric properties ofPROMs in systematic reviews. In our original protocol, we proposed using the system of the Oxford PROMs group: 0 for not reported; -for no evidence in favour; + for some evidence in favour; ++ for some good evidence in favour; and +++ for good evidence in favour. 28The COSMIN group later proposed something similar: + positive rating; ? for an indeterminate rating; -negative rating; and 0 for no information available.53On balance, we elected to use a combination of these systems to summarise available evidence ( Table 4 ). Summary ratings of evidence of psychometric performance were made using data extracted from included studies, with reference to whether or not standard criteria33,34were met. When making the ratings, we also took account of the methodological quality of studies, number of studies, and giving further weightto any apparently independent studies that appeared not to have been conducted by the originaldevelopers. 54We made an overall judgement separately for evidence emerging from studies conducted with (a) samples from general populations and (b) samples of young people with neurodisability.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 18 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukResults Search results stage 1: identication of patient-reported outcome measures Therst search, to identify potentially eligible PROMs, resulted in 13,770 records after duplicates were removed. Following screening of the records by two independent reviewers, 832 abstracts were reviewed for names and/or acronyms of potentially eligible PROMs. This resulted in a list of 131 PROMs (see Appendix 4 ), of which 78 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. The flow chart in Figure 1 illustrates the different steps in the selection process. In total, stage 1 identi ed the names of 53 potentially eligible candidate PROMs, including 39 generic PROMs, seven chronic-generic PROMs and seven PBMs. Search results stage 2: identication of studies evaluating psychometric performance of candidate patient-reported outcome measures Search for eligible studies in general population samples (search 2.1) The combination of the searches for each of the 53 individual PROMs in general populations resulted in 4830 records. Screening the deduplicated le of 2750 records resulted in 238 records that were selected for full-text screening. In total, we retrieved 218 full-text papers. We excluded 12 further PROMs (and their corresponding 38 papers), as they did not match our inclusion criteria. These were instruments that were developed for adults or were dimension-speci c to mental health, assessed health-related behaviours, or were screening tools. This reduced the number of eligible papers to 180, which described 41 PROMs. Another 75 records were excluded on closer examination of the full text; most papers were excluded because they had notadministered an English version of the PROM ( n= 24) or because a clinical but non-neurodisability group of children and young people had been studied ( n= 15). The flow chart in Figure 2 shows the different steps in the process and details on the different exclusion criteria and number of papers excluded. Thissearch process resulted in the selection of 105 papers reporting on psychometric evidence on one of the 41 eligible candidate PROMs. Search for eligible studies in neurodisability samples (search 2.2) The combination of searches for the 53 individual PROMs used with neurodisability resulted in 2952 records. A total of 68 papers studying psychometric properties were selected based on title and abstract. After full-text screening, 13 papers were identi ed as eligible: nine were duplicates from search 2.1 and four new papers were selected for data extraction. Figure 3 gives an overview of the selection process.TABLE 4 Indices for summarising appraising psychometric properties of PROMs Rating De nition 0 Not reported ?

Filtering the EndNote le to only select records that mentioned validity (and derivatives, e.g. validation) or reliability (and derivatives) reduced the number of records to 235. Screening the titles and abstracts of these 235 records revealed 23 papers reporting on studies examining psychometric properties of a selected PROM in a population of children and young people with neurodisability. This strategy highlightedfour papers not otherwise identi ed, which were included in data extraction. A further 10 papers were identi ed while searching for the key reference paper and were also included for data extraction. Search results summary In total, 126 papers were selected for data extraction.

The longer questionnaires require the longest completion times: CHIP-AE (30 minutes) and QoLP-AV (40 minutes).Most questions used a Likert-scale response option; exceptions included the CHAQ [pain and overall well-being use a visual analogue scale (VAS)] and ExQoL (each statement is rated on a VAS ranging from'not like me 'to'exactly like me '). The CHIP -Child Edition (CHIP-CE) self-report version uses a scale of circles of increasing sizes to as the response options. Three PROMs incorporate illustrative elements: CHIP-CE (drawings illustrate the question, and a 'fun break ' page is provided where a child can make a drawing); COOP (response option is illustrated with a drawing); and ExQoL (each statement is accompanied by a picture). The shortest recall period is 'today ', and the longest recall period is '1 month '.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 32 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukA note on the CQoL is that each question/statement is required to be rated for 'health state ','upset 'and 'satisfaction '; this may become repetitive and confusing. Generic patient-reported outcome measures: content mapping The ICF-CY was used as a framework to report on the content assessed by the different PROMs. We mapped the items on the ICF-CY chapter headings using the 1424 ICF-CY core sets as a guide. Thisyielded a pro le across ICF-CY categories for each of the PROMs. The items or domains of the questionnaires were mapped onto the chapter headings of the ICF-CY(ICF-CY content mapping for generic PROMs can be seen in Table 6 ). If we could not identify a chapter that described the item or domain we used the additional ICF-CY categories (general health/mental health or physical health not covered by the generic or speci c ICF-CY core sets) or categorised them under 'other '. We had full-text versions of all questionnaires except for two PROMs. For the CHQ we used the domains and exemplar items available online (www.healthactchq.com). The CQoL was mapped on to the ICF-CY using the variables reported in the developmental paper. 97We paid to receive a full-text questionnaire (and manual) of the QoLP-AV and the FSIIR. Overall, the domain 'activities and participation 'is most covered by the generic PROMs (see Table 6 ). The CHQ, CHIP, CQoL, PedsQL, QoLP-AV and the YQoL-R each cover a minimum ve of the nine chapters. None of the items of the CHRS, SLSS and WCHMP cover an ICF-CY Activity and Participation domain.'Mental functioning 'and'sensory functions and pain 'are the most commonly covered domains in the ICF-CY Body Functions and Structures section.Many PROMs have at least one item that maps on to the environment domain and ask about health in general. From the topics not covered by the ICF-CY, 'being able to do what you want to do ','having fun ' and'satisfaction with life 'score highest. The Healthy Pathways, KIDSCREEN-52 and the QoLP-AV broadly seem to cover aspects of both 'body functions 'and'activities and participation '. Generic patient-reported outcome measures: psychometric performance with general population We found 73 papers that reported evidence from studies of the evaluation of the psychometric performance of 19 generic PROMs. Some have also been tested in a sample with neurodisability.

We present an overall rating for each psychometric property based on the evidence in the selected papers and also taking into account the quality of the papers. Strong evidence was found for the content validity of the CHIP and KIDSCREEN-52, with extensive qualitative research having been used to generate the items. The evidence of content validity for the KIDSCREEN versions with 27 and 10 items was rated lower, as fewer of the concepts are covered. Noevidence of work to determine the content validity with children and young people was found for CHAQ,CHQ, KINDL (although this was examined in a German study), PedsQL and PWI. The manual of the PWI mentions that the child versions (preschool and schoolchildren) are based on the adult versions. These versions do not appear to have been adapted with input from qualitative research with children andyoung people. Good evidence for structural validity was found for the Healthy Pathways, KIDSCREEN-52 and 27, the PedsQL, the SLSS and BMSLSS, and most robust for the Healthy Pathways and KIDSCREEN which have undergone good quality studies using Rasch analysis. Good evidence was found to support the internal consistency of the domain scales for most PROMs. The internal consistency of some domains of the CHQ, KINDL and PedsQL were below accepted criteria (< 0.7) and hence received an equivocal rating overall. Evidence from hypothesis testing generally supported construct validity of domain scales. Test-retest reliability was examined for half of the PROMs; if tested, results were inconclusive. Evidence from different studies of the CHIP, KIDSCREEN and PedsQL either supported stability (ICC > 0.7) or did not (ICC < 0.7). The reliability between self- and proxy report was studied only for a few PROMs and tests generally showed negative results, in that reliability between children and proxy reports was usually below recommended criteria on one or more domains (ICC < 0.7). Evidence for precision is provided for the Healthy Pathways and KIDSCREEN based on Rasch analysis. Little is known about the responsiveness of these instruments.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 58 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukTABLE 9 Generic PROMs: overall appraisal of measurement performance and operational characteristics in a general population Instrument versionContentvalidityStructuralvalidityConstructvalidityInternalconsistencyTest -retest reliabilityProxyreliability Precision Responsiveness Acceptability CHAQ 0 0 0 + + -- 0 - CHIP-CE ++ + + ++ +/ + 0 + 0 - 0+ CHRS + + + +/- 00 0 00 CHSCS + + + -- 00 0 0 COOP + 0 +/- ?+ 0 0 0 + ExQoL ? 0 ? + 0 0 0 0 0 FSIIR ? + + + 0 0 0 0 - GCQ + 0 + + 0 0 0 0 0 KIDSCREEN-52 ++ +++ ++ + 0+ + KIDSCREEN-10 0 + ++ + + - +0 + KINDL Kid 0 0 +/- 00 0 + 0 + Kiddo 0+ continuedDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 59\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The CHQ and the PedsQL are most tested; respectively, three and ve papers have been included in the data extraction. With the exception of the paper on the BMSLSS and SLSS, the methodological quality of the reported studies was rated fair topoor ( Table 11 ). Eight generic PROMs have been tested in a ( Table 12 ). A total of 25 papers were found reporting evidence on ve generic PROMs tested in a solely neurodisability population. The CHQ (seven papers) and PedsQL (13 papers) have been studied more frequently, but the same developer reported most of the studies of the PedsQL. The content validity of two instruments (CQoL and YQoL) has been tested in a neurodisability sample and evidence was very favourable for the CQoL. Some good evidence in favour of the structural validityhas been found for all PROMs except the CQoL from factor analysis, and for the KIDSCREEN-52 in a study using Rasch analysis with responses from a large sample of children with cerebral palsy (Table 13 ). Not all domain scales of the CHQ-PF50 and PedsQL reached acceptable criteria for internal consistency. There is stronger evidence from test -retest reliability studies that responses to the PedsQL were stable. The KIDSCREEN-52, CHIP and YQoL show the most promising results, with a caveat that all evidence forthe YQoL is drawn from one paper. Table 14 provides a summary of the performance of generic PROMs in a population of children and young people with a neurodisability. Chronic-generic patient-reported outcome measures In the selection process, ve families of chronic-generic PROMs were identi ed. For three chronic-generic PROMs no evidence was found in an English-speaking population: the Child Health Ratings Inventory(CHRIs), 188the Children 's Life Quality Index (CLQI)189and the Perceived Illness Experience scale (PIE and PIE-R).190,191The authors and or developers of these PROMs were contacted to verify that we had not missed any peer-reviewed papers; no response was received. These PROMs are not included in the report;characteristics of these PROMs can be found in Appendix 6 . Patient-reported outcome measures with evidence that have more than one version include: lDISABKIDS Chronic Generic Module (DCGM or DISABKIDS) short/long (three versions).192-194 Chronic-generic patient-reported outcome measures: descriptive characteristics Instructions and items of the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI)-Child Form are available in the paper of Walker and Greene.195We contacted the author of the DISABKIDS and paid to receive all three versions of the instrument and the manual.

The number of items ranges from 6 (DISABKIDS-Smileys) to 37 (DISABKIDS-37); these were derived from the original 56-item pilot version. The FDI has one version for 8- to 17-year-olds; the FDI has 15 items. Both the DISABKIDS and the FDI have self-report and proxy report versions. All instruments can be completed in < 10 minutes. The DISABKIDS-Smileys-6 version employs illustrated response options as 'smiley faces '. The recall period for the FDI is the 'last few days ', while the DISABKIDS-Smileys uses 'lately 'and the recall period for the DISABKIDS-37 and DISABKIDS-12 is 'the past 4 weeks '. Chronic-generic patient-reported outcome measures: content mapping The FDI is aimed at measuring a child 's ability to complete daily activities and those are the ICF-CY chapters broadly covered by the items. No additional aspects are assessed. All versions of the DISABKIDS focus strongly on how children 'feel'. They are not aimed at abilities or functioning; none of the items speci cally assesses what the child can or cannot do. The DISABKIDS-Smileys-6 asks children how they 'feel in general 'as well as about themselves. The DISABKIDS-12 focuses on how children feel about their life and their medical treatment. In addition to those items probing emotional well-being, the DISABKIDS-37 covers more topics: running, sleep, play, school (concentration) and friends. Table 16 summarises the content mapping for the chronic-generic PROMs. Chronic-generic patient-reported outcome measures: evidence of psychometric performance in a general population Evidence of the psychometric performance was found for two of the ve identi ed chronic-generic PROMs (Table 17 ). The FDI has been tested in a general population, and the DISABKIDS-37 and DISABKIDS Smileys-6 have both been tested in a mixed chronic condition sample including neurodisability. Only one paper reports evidence, of varying quality (poor -good), for the FDI in a general population (Table 18 ). In conclusion, we found some good evidence in favour of content validity, internal consistency and hypothesis testing of the FDI ( Table 19 ). Chronic-generic patient-reported outcome performance in neurodisability population The DISABKIDS-37 and DISABKIDS-Smileys-6 have both been tested in with children and young people with chronic conditions including neurodisability ( Table 20 ). Four papers report evidence of the psychometric performance of the DISABKIDS-37 and Smileys-6; thesewere studies mostly of good to excellent methodological quality ( Table 21 ). There is some good evidence avail able in favour of content validity, structural validity and test -retest validity of both versions. Some good evidence in favour of hypothesis testing and precision is reported forthe DISABKIDS-37. The study evaluating the internal consistency of the Smileys-6 version was notconsidered equivocal in terms of evidence to support this property. Overall, there appears to be evidence that the DISABKIDS-37, and to a lesser extent the Smileys-6, have performed well in samples of children and young people with chronic conditions that included neurodisability ( Table 22 ).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 71\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

All the PBMs have a single form for all age groups: lCHU-9D (7- 11 years originally, now extended to 17 years old) lEQ-5D-Y (7- 12 years old) lHUI (12 years and onwards for self-report, 5 years and onwards for proxy report) lCHSCS-PS (2- 5 years old). The CHSCS-PS for infants is a proxy report questionnaire; the other PBMs have both self-report and proxy report versions for all age groups covered. The number of items ranges from 5 for the EQ-5D-Y to 12 for the CHSCS-PS. PBMs use ordinal-level response options by which more or less of the attribute isdistinguished. All instruments can be completed in less than 10 minutes. The shortest recall period is 'today '(CHU-9D, EQ-5D-Y) and longest recall period 'the past 4 '(HUI2 and HUI3). Preference-based measures: and the HUI2, HUI3 and CHSCS-PS, are similar in the content they cover,and the way in which their questions are phrased. All of the PBMs examined have relatively few items compared with the generic and chronic-generic PROMs. Nevertheless, they seem to cover a variety of ICF-CY chapters in both of the domains 'body functions 'and'activities and participation '(Table 24 ). The HUI2, a seven-item questionnaire, covers eight ICF-CY chapters. Mental functioning and sensory functioning and pain are covered by all PBMs. Preference-based measures: psychometric performance in a general population We found evidence of the psychometric performance of ve PBMs tested in a general population, including both versions of the HUI from 10 papers ( Table 25 ).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 77\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The hypothesis testing was also rated as good quality. The development process of the EQ-5D-Yincluded the revision of the content and wording of EQ-5D to ensure relevance and clarity for young respondents. After translation of the resulting modi ed version, cognitive interviews were conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden to test the instrument 's comprehensibility in children and adolescents. 207No information supporting content validity was found for the HUI2, HUI3 and CHSCS-PS. Table 26 reports the methodological quality of the studies reporting evidence. No good evidence was found for test -retest reliability, internal consistency, structural validity and measurement error. Overall, there appears little evidence to substantiate the performance of PBMs based on standard psychometric criteria. Few conventional psychometric properties of these PBMs appear to have been examined. Of all PBMs, the CHU-9D has been tested more extensively, with some limited evidence in favour for content and construct validity. Table 27 shows an overall appraisal of the PBMs performance in a general population. Preference-based measures: psychometric performance in a neurodisability population No papers were found reporting on the psychometric performance of the four PBMs in samples of children and young people with mixed chronic conditions that included neurodisability. The proxy-report version ofthe EQ-5D (not the Youth version) has been used with children with attention de cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the HUI3 has been used with children and young people with autistic spectrum disorder, and the HUI2 and CHSCS-PS have also been evaluated in a neurodisability population ( Table 28 ). No studies were found evaluating the CHU-9D with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Little evidence of the performance of the four tested PBMs in a neurodisability population could be gleaned ( Table 29 ). Most evidence pertained to construct validity using hypothesis testing; there was one poor-quality reliability study comparing self and proxy reports of the HUI2. An overall appraisal of the PBMs 'performance in a neurodisability population is provided in Table 30 . Discussion This systematic review focused on the identi cation of generic, multidimensional PROMs for children and young people, and appraisal of the psychometric performance when using English-language versions with samples of the general population and/or neurodisability. Key ndings We identi ed 25 PROMs: 19 generic PROMs, 2 chronic-generic PROMs and 4 PBMs. In total, 126 papers reporting evidence of the psychometric performance of 25 PROMs were selected. The psychometric performance has been tested either in a general population (84 papers, 23 instruments), achronic-condition population including neurodisability (14 papers, ve instruments) or a neurodisability population (28 papers, eight instruments). Patient-reported outcome measures not selected for further consideration There were 13 PROMs for which the evidence was so limited or of such poor quality that they could notbe considered psychometrically robust compared with other candidate PROMs; all were developed prior tothe year 2000. We found only one eligible paper reporting an evaluation of PWI/ComQOL-S5, WCHMP and YQoL. The available evidence precludes a full understanding of their psychometric properties as generic PROMs in general populations, and particularly with children and youngpeople affected by neurodisability.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 82 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukTABLE 26 Preference-based measures: methodological quality of the studies evaluating psychometric properties in a general population Instrument version Author PYInternalconsistency ReliabilityMeasurementerrorContentvalidityStructuralvalidityHypothesistestingCriterionvalidity Responsiveness CHU-9D Stevens publication year. a This paper assesses item floor/ceiling effects which is included below in precision.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 83\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.Patient-reported outcome measures selected for further consideration Twelve PROMs were selected as potentially psychometrically more robust, based upon the quality and quantity of evidence available for appraisal. The candidate generic PROMs included CHIP, CHQ, HealthyPathways, KIDSCREEN, DISABKIDS was the only chronic-generic PROM to stand out in the appraisal. The four PBMs all showed some potential: CHU-9D, EQ-5D-Y, HUI and CHSCS-PS. These are discussed in further detail, taking into account the age range of the targetpopulation, availability of self- and/or proxy report versions, content assessed, content validity, and theirpsychometric performance in different populations. Child Health and Illness Profile The CHIP has four versions: a self-report and two proxy report versions for 6- to 11-year-olds and a self-report adolescent edition (for 11- to 17-year-olds). The CHIP-AE was developed based on the literature, the involvement of focus groups and expert panels, and pretesting in four groups of teenagerswith different health states. 105Three studies using cognitive interviews were conducted to develop the CHIP-CE.107They tested children 's ability to convert their health experiences into scaled responses and examined type of response format and recall period most effectively used by children. At least some goodevidence in favour of the CHIP-CE and AE has been reported for precision, hypothesis testing and internalconsistency. Structural validity has been tested for the CHIP-CE but not for the CHIP-AE. In addition, the reliability and validity of the CHIP-CE has been tested in an ADHD population, reporting evidence in favour of the instrument. The use of circles of increasing sizes to clarify the response options and drawings to illustrate the questions makes the CHIP-CE more attractive to children. The developers of the CHIP prefer self-report overproxy-report, offering only a self-report version for adolescents. All versions of the CHIP contain items that question mental functioning, sensory functioning and pain and nearly all chapter headings of the ICF-CY 'activities and participation 'domain. The CHIP items ask 'how often 'something occurs, broadly assessing functioning. The length of the questionnaires is a disadvantage of the instrument. For children 6 -11 years old, the self-report questionnaire contains 45 items. The adolescent version takes up to 30 minutes to answer all 138 questions. Child Health Questionnaire The CHQ has two proxy versions, of different lengths (50 and 28 items), and one self-report version(87 items). The proxy version covers a broad range from 5 years of age; self-report is recommended from the age of 10 years. The different versions of the CHQ have been studied across general, mixed chronic conditions and neurodisability, and ndings have been reported in 19 papers. The content validity appears not to have been tested. The CHQ covers all 'activities and participation ' chapters in the ICF-CY, as well as mental functioning and sensory functioning and pain. The CHQ itemsbroadly focus on a child 's abilities, limitations and functioning. Evidence of structural validity, internal consistency, and test -retest reliability is inconsistent. Healthy Pathways The Healthy Pathways (child report and proxy report) is a recent instrument, published in 2010, targeted at children between 9 and 12 years old. The conceptual framework for the CHIP was the starting point for the Healthy Pathways. The selection of additional items was infl uenced by other questionnaires and/or generated by a panel of test developers, child health experts and clinicians. Items were then pilot tested with 200 children. However, no new qualitative work was carried out with children.93,111The Healthy Pathways is a rather long instrument, with 88 items, although studies report few missing responses. Structural validity has been tested using both factor analysis and Rasch analysis, providing persuasive evidence of the unidimensionality of all scales but one (balanced nutrition). At least some good evidence infavour has been reported for precision, hypothesis testing and internal consistency. The Healthy PathwaysSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 86 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukICF-CY pro le shows a good coverage of both 'body function 'and'activities and participation '. The questionnaire asks how often something occurs, assessing a child' s functioning. We found no studies that have been conducted with children and young people affected by neurodisability. KIDSCREEN The KIDSCREEN has three versions, differing in length, all available for self-report and proxy report. The KIDSCREEN questionnaires are available in various languages. The development of the rst version, the KIDSCREEN-52, involved literature searches and expert consultation, as well as focus group discussions with children and adolescents. After translation and back-translation, cognitive interviews and pilot tests were performed.79 Twelve papers have been published examining psychometric properties of the KIDSCREEN family in ageneral population. There is at least some evidence in favour of all three versions of the KIDSCREEN forall psychometric properties, including factor analysis and Rasch analysis to support the structural validity of the instruments. In addition, psychometric performance of the KIDSCREEN-52 and -10 has been tested with children with cerebral palsy, reporting minimal evidence of structural invariance compared withgeneral population samples. 125 All versions target children and adolescents from 8 to 18 years. The KIDSCREEN asks how a child 'feels ' (e.g. 'has your child felt t and well? ') as well as what a child has been able to do (e.g. 'has your child been physically active? '). The theoretical model implies seeking to assess aspects of both well-being and functioning. KINDL Two papers report on the psychometric evidence of the English-language version of KINDL. The contentvalidity has been examined with a German population. The instrument was derived from a conceptualmodel, in which the four main components of quality of life were included in interviews with children (several school classes). 218The items were constructed and pretested in two pilot studies involving 28 children each.219 There are different age group versions. The KINDL has 24 items and covers a broad range of concepts:mental functioning, sensory functioning and pain, general tasks and demands, relationships and some major life areas, as well as family functioning, having fun and some items on a child' s health condition. The items are targeted to capture how a child is doing and feeling, asking questions such as 'during the past week, I played with friends' and'during the past week I felt different from other children '. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory The PedsQL has three versions, according to age, for both the self-report and proxy report questionnaires.The PedsQL is one of three extensively studied instruments. In total, 16 papers report on the PedsQLpsychometric performance in a general population, ve studies tested the PedsQL in a chronic conditions population and 13 papers report on its performance in a neurodisability population. The PedsQL covers allactivity and participation domains, except for communication, learning, and tasks and demands. It alsocontains items on mental functioning and sensory functioning and pain. Asking 'how much of a problem your child has had with 'physical, emotional, social and school functioning, the PedsQL mainly assesses functioning. The developers suggest that it can be completed in less than 4 minutes. No evidence was found that qualitative work has been conducted to develop the questionnaire. Good evidence was found for structural validity from factor analysis, but not Rasch analysis, and hypothesis testing. Evidence of internal consistency, test -retest validity and precision was found to be inconsistent.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 87\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Twenty-three papers report psychometric evidence of the performanceof the SLSS family, including one recent paper reporting a study in which the BMSLSS and the SLSS have been tested with a chronic conditions sample including children and young people with cerebral palsy and acquired brain injuries. The development of the SLSS and MSLSS involved consultation with adolescents; no content validity reports were found for the BMSLSS. Good evidence in favour of construct validity, internal consistency, hypothesis testing, and test -retest reliability was found for all versions. Whether or not the construct assessed by the SLSS, MSLSS and BMSLSS is really HRQoL is debatable. Fewitems could be mapped onto the ICF-CY; all three versions focus mostly on satisfaction with life andemotional well-being. DISABKIDS The DISABKIDS family of PROMs were produced as part of an EU-funded project. The DCGM has a longand a short version (DCGM-37 and DCGM-12). Recently, a version has been developed for 4- to 7-year-olds: the DISABKIDS-Smileys-6. DISABKIDS has been validated for use in seven languages. The DISABKIDS-37 was developed using literature searches, expert consultation and focus groups with360 children and adolescents with different chronic health conditions and their families. 196Child and parent focus groups were conducted to develop the DISABKIDS-Smileys-6.192 Four papers report favourable evidence for the DISABKIDS-37 across psychometric properties, including Rasch analysis to support structural validity, and the Smileys-6 version has been evaluated with a chronic conditions population. The 12-item version has not been tested thus far. All versions of theDISABKIDS are strongly focused on how a child feels; they are not aimed at abilities or functioning. The DISABKIDS-Smileys-6 asks the child how they feel in general as well as about him- or herself and among others (school and doctor), using smileys as response options. The DISABKIDS-12 focuses on how achild feels about their life and their medical treatment. In addition to those items probing emotionalwell-being, the DISABKIDS-37 covers more topics: running, sleep, play, school (concentration) and friends. Child Health Utility 9D The CHU-9D was developed with and for children between 7 and 11 years old. The CHU-9D is the only PBM for which qualitative research was conducted to develop the instrument; interviews were undertaken with over 70 children aged 7 -11 years to generate the items and response options.201A self-report and a proxy report version are available. It consists of nine domains (worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, school work, sleep, daily routine and activities) and uses ve levels within each domain. The CHU-9D aims to assess a child 's health status by asking how a child is doing, but also probes for a child' s well-being (e.g. 'I do not feelworried today ', vs. EQ-5D-Y: 'Iamnot worried today '). The CHU-9D has since been evaluated across older age groups, but without further qualitative research to examine content validity. Some evidence in favour has been reported for hypothesis testing. Precision wasrated equivocal; although the scales of PBMs are interval level, there were very large observed ceiling effects. The instrument has not been tested yet in a neurodisability population. European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-Youth European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions consists of ve attributes (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Only one study was found evaluating a proxy-report version of the original version. The EQ-5D-Y assesses a child 's current health status; it primarily measures functioning, asking only how a child is doing (e.g. 'I have no pain ','I am not worried '), with three response levels per attribute. The EQ-5D-Y is available in various languages. The development process of the EQ-5D-Yincluded the revision of the content and wording of the EQ-5D to ensure relevance and clarity for youngSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 88 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukrespondents. After translation, cognitive interviews were conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden to test comprehensibility to children and adolescents.212 Five papers were found which reported psychometric evidence in a general population; some favourableevidence was reported from hypothesis testing and there was con flicting evidence for precision and test-retest reliability. Some hypothesis testing has been done to establish construct validity with children and young people with ADHD. Health Utilities Index The HUI2 uses seven domains (sensation, mobility, emotion, cognitive, self-care, pain and fertility) using three to ve levels, describing 24,000 unique health states. The HUI3 uses eight domains (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain) and ve or six levels. Both questionnaires have a self-report version for adolescents ( 12 years) and one proxy version targeting children 5 years. Four papers were found for the HUI2 and HUI3 (two studies in a general population and two in aneurodisability population); few properties were studied and little evidence in favour was reported. Of allPBMs, the HUI covers mostly 'Body Functioning 'chapters (including the less prevalent chapter genitourinary and reproductive functioning). The HUI2 and HUI3 measure functioning, asking about a child 's abilities and limitations. Comprehensive Health Status Classification System -Preschool The CHSCS-PS was developed for children aged 2 -5 years. The CHSCS-PS is based conceptually on the HUI. No additional information supporting content validity was found. One study involved hypothesis testing in a sample of young children with cerebral palsy, providing some evidence in favour of the instrument. Methodological reflections The methodology for developing and evaluating PROMs has progressed over recent years. Most notably, there has been an increasing use of Rasch analysis to evaluate the structural validity and provide evidencefor the precision of scores across the spectrum of measurement scales. Rasch analysis can also be used totest for any evidence of group invariance for items across age groups, sex, and between those with different diagnoses. Evaluation of these aspects of generic PROMs appears to have been relatively unexplored. An exception is that item invariance between general populations and children with cerebralpalsy has been evaluated for KIDSCREEN, with only minor differences reported. 125Therefore, although several generic PROMs have been used with children and young people affected by neurodisability, littlecan be concluded with respect to whether or not generic PROMs perform consistently across the variousconditions within neurodisability. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Good Research Practices Task Force for Developing Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes sets out ve good practices relevant for PROMs for children and young people: (i) attention to age groups and age-based cut-offs, (ii) establishing contentvalidity using concept elicitation to inform item generation, and cognitive interviews to assess and re ne all aspects of the draft instrument, (iii) consideration of whether or not proxy report is necessary, (iv) ensuringthat the instrument is designed and formatted appropriately for the target age group, and (v) considering cross-cultural validation. Age groups Some PROMs seek to cover all age groups with a single instrument, particularly the chronic-generic instruments and PBMs but also some of the generic tools. Other generic instruments have tailoredinstruments to speci c age groups by modifying the content being assessed, the number of items in the questionnaire, or the response style. Whether or not different age group versions are necessary dependson whether or not the constructs assessed are likely to change with the age and context of young people 'sDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 89\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Content validity Guidance suggests that children and young people can be content experts; however, varying efforts have been made to establish the content validity of the PROMs included in this review with children and youngpeople. A few instruments stand out as having evidence from extensive qualitative research to generatethe constructs and items in general populations (KIDSCREEN, DISABKIDS and CHU-9D). However, only two studies 97,165were identi ed in the review reporting qualitative research examining the content validity of PROMs with young people with neurodisability, respectively, for the CQoL and YQoL. In fact, the content of the KIDSCREEN has been compared with the life priorities identi ed by young people with cerebral palsy; while some overlap was found with the content assessed by KIDSCREEN, other key domainsidenti ed by young people were not represented. 220 Determining the content validity within age group strata has also been relatively neglected. For instance,the development of the CHU-9D included extensive qualitative research with children aged 7 -11 years but we did not nd evidence that content validity has been examined with adolescents, even though use of the instrument has been generalised to this older age group and other properties have begun to be assessed. Proxy reports We found no good evidence of the reliability between reports by children or young people and proxy reports by parents. Our ndings are similar to those reported by Eiser and Morse,221that reliability is often better for physical functioning and poorer for emotional and social domains. The evidence suggests poor reliability (below the recommended criterion of ICC > 0.7) for some domains of all candidate PROMs when this property has been assessed. It would be misleading to recommend a measure for which only somedomains are reliable. This adds weight to the argument that young people and parents generally have different perceptions about the content assessed in questionnaires, and scores from young people and parents should not beconsidered comparable, or be aggregated in analyses. 221 Proxy reports may still have a use, for instance for very young children and/or those without the cognitivecapacity to respond. Five PROMs were identi ed that were developed, or have separate versions, to speci cally target preschool children under 5 years: FSIIR, Scales, PWI-PS, and WCHMP, and Age-appropriate design and formatting The candidate PROMs identi ed varied in design and formatting. Few papers in the review documented evidence that questions were comprehensible and/or checked whether or not response options were appropriate across age groups, or reported whether or not any design features met with approval from potential participants. Cognitive interviews or focus groups appear to have been relatively neglected in thedevelopment of all but a few instruments. Cross-cultural issues As the focus of this review was English-language PROMs, we did not encounter cross-cultural validityissues for many PROMs. The KIDSCREEN and DISABKIDS instruments were developed as international collaborative projects, and considerable efforts were made to check the consistency of translated versions. The issue of cross-cultural validity was also encountered with the few papers where English-languageversions were used in Singapore and India, where language and meaning may vary contextually. Rigorous testing of PROMs should be undertaken when translating versions from other languages.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 90 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukStrengths and limitations This was a comprehensive systematic review utilising a two-stage search strategy to maximise the possibility of identifying all candidate PROMs, and any eligible evidence of their psychometric performancein general and neurodisability populations. In addition, we contacted the authors of instruments for whom no evidence was found and conducted a forward citation search using a key reference for each PROM. Our aim was only to appraise evidence of the psychometric performance of generic PROMs with children and young people affected by neurodisability. However, we decided to include appraisal of evidence from studies with general populations in order not to exclude emerging measures or those instruments with promising possibilities for use with neurodisability. This made the task much larger, but makes the ndings more likely to represent the actual state of knowledge about psychometric performance of generic PROMs. We included studies with children and young people with chronic conditions, providing that the samples included neurodisability. Hence, there is a body of research that was not included in this review, which isthose studies examining performance of PROMs with children and young people with conditions that would not be considered neurodisability (e.g. arthritis or asthma). Excluded from the scope of the review were clinical assessments and instruments designed to be administered by clinicians or trained assessors. Hence, there are several outcome measures that may be commonly used in research that would not be consistent with the de nition of a PROM. Examples include various forms of adaptive behaviour assessments, and for instance, the interview-administered Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H). 222Also speci cally excluded were domain-speci c instruments. Thus, instruments that only measure one aspect of health, for example the Strengths and Dif culties Questionnaire, which is often used to assess mental health and behavioural problems, were not considered.223 There are some limitations to this systematic review; most are a consequence of the strict inclusion criteria.Limiting the search to studies where an English version of the PROM was administered excluded somePROMs from further analyses. In addition, cross-cultural validity was not comprehensively assessed for the selected PROMs. Two PROMs excluded from this review that may warrant further investigation are ITQoL (for infants), which was developed in the Netherlands and for which an English translation is available butno published studies of this version were found, and the TNO-AZL family (TACQOL, TAPQOL andTAAQOL). If studies were included that were conducted using versions of questionnaires in languages other than English, then further evidence would emerge, for instance regarding the KINDL and the plethora of translated versions of the more popular instruments such as PedsQL. Nevertheless,psychometric performance cannot be assumed across languages and cultures; 217therefore, in our view, limiting the review to evaluations of English-language versions is a relative strength of the review. The WHO ICF-CY was used to create a content pro le for each of the questionnaires. In carrying out this analysis, many items could not be mapped readily onto the ICF-CY, and some items could not be mapped at all. This is both a problem with the conceptualisation and design of the ICF-CY, which focuses onfunction and is less concerned with aspects of well-being, and problematic because the questionnaires conflate these concepts. PROMs are often composed of items that assess various concepts in a single item; the latter is also problematic in view of the cognitive task faced by respondents. Another problem encountered with using the ICF-CY to describe the content of the questionnaires was how to deal with the way a question is asked. For example, the KIDSCREEN asks 'have you felt t and well? 'and the CHIP asks 'how often did you play hard enough to start sweating and breathing hard? '. Both questions can be mapped on 'b130 Energy and drive functions '; however, each item assesses something quite different, and may be answered differently. The KIDSCREEN predominantly assesses how children and young people feel about their health; the CHIP focuses mostly on functioning, asking whatchildren and young people can do. Describing the content of PROMs using the ICF-CY is likely to lead to a loss of information, without reference to the context and precise focus of the question.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 91\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The aim and purpose of this exercise should be carefully considered in future systematic reviews, as it is a time-consuming task. There is undoubted bene t from identifying and considering the methodological quality of studies evaluating psychometric properties of PROMs. However, in our quality assurance checks with a second reviewer, we found an issue in the consistency of how those making the ratings interpret of some parts of the COSMIN checklist. The most dif cult COSMIN item to code consistently was 'how missing items are dealt with ', and this item has a strong in fluence on the overall quality rating for most psychometric properties. The procedures for handling missing data may not have been reported in all papers that were included in the review, but may have been detailed in other papers or be detailed in the manual of the PROM. We did not examine the methods used to derive the preference weights applied in the scaling of the PBMs appraised in the review; the methods for creating the preference weighted scales were assumed tomeet the requirements for creating interval-level measurement. 224As the fundamental purpose of preference-based measurement is to quantify the value or strength of preference for health change, themeans for assuming and eliciting preference values should be critically assessed. 225Not all of the standard criteria for appraising PROMs are proposed to be appropriate for evaluating PBMs; for instance, therequirement for internal consistency may con flict with the underlying theory. 225Nevertheless, most criteria for face, content and construct validity and test -retest and proxy reliability remain applicable;225these properties of PBMs were found to be largely untested with children and young people. Our inclusion criteria only considered published peer-reviewed studies that speci cally set out to evaluate psychometric properties of PROMs. Hence, we will have excluded studies that may present incidental evidence of psychometric performance. For instance, there may be indications of ability to measure change, over time or with interventions, for any candidate PROMs that have been used in longitudinal observational or experimental studies. In addition, we will have omitted any information that may becontained in manuals, if these data have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. Summary This systematic review aimed to identify eligible candidate generic PROMs, and to identify and appraiseevidence of the psychometric performance of these PROMs in both general and neurodisabilitypaediatric populations. We identi ed 41 potentially eligible candidate PROMs; a total of 126 papers were identi ed that reported evidence of the psychometric performance of 25 PROMs that had been evaluated using English-language versions: 19 generic PROMs, two chronic-generic PROMs and four PBMs. Twelve candidate PROMs were selected as having more favourable evidence regarding their performance. Robust evidence was lacking inone or more respects to support the psychometric performance for all candidate PROMs that were appraised in this review, both in a general population and, more crucially, with children and young people affected by neurodisability. No evidence was found for any of the candidate PROMs to support theresponsiveness to detect meaningful change. The most studied generic PROMs are CHQ (two proxy versions and one self-report version), KIDSCREEN (three versions of different lengths), PedsQL (three versions for different age groups) and SLSS/MSLSS(three versions of different lengths). Of the generic PROMs, only the KINDL and the PedsQL cover all age categories from infancy to adolescence. For self-report questionnaires for children aged 8 years to adolescence, there is stronger evidence of the structural validity and precision of the Healthy Pathwaysand KIDSCREEN from Rasch analysis in general populations, and for the KIDSCREEN-52 in those with cerebral palsy.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 92 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukThe DISABKIDS was the only chronic-generic PROM in this review for which reasonable eligible evidence was found. As one would expect, it has been evaluated only with children and young people with chronic conditions, and these do include neurodisability. Promising evidence of psychometric performancewas found. Few conventional psychometric properties of the PBMs have been examined with children and young people. The CHU-9D has been tested more extensively, with some limited evidence in favour. However,the CHU-9D has not been tested with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Whether generic, chronic-generic or PBM, each candidate PROM appraised has a different conceptualisation of what they purport to measure; some PROMs focus more on functioning, other PROMs focus more on well-being, and still others assess aspects of both well-being and functioning in the same instrument. The selection of any instrument should be consistent with the purpose of measurement,and have face validity to potential respondents.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 93\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The aim from the study protocol addressed by the qualitative research was: to identify key health-care outcomes, beyond measures of morbidity and mortality, that are regarded as important by children with neurodisability, and parents. The speci c objectives were: 1. to identify, broadly, what outcomes children and parents expect from the NHS 2. to present candidate generic PROMs, with example items, to determine whether or not these instruments measure outcomes that children and parents value 3. to consider pragmatic approaches which might motivate children to want, and be able, to complete PROM questionnaires, such as novel technology. Methods Theoretical framework This was an applied health services research project with speci c objectives and required to relate to the other research streams. This qualitative research was not seeking to elicit a deep understanding of the 'lived experience 'of the young people and parents. Hence, the analytical approach re flected these issues and purposefully addressed focused policy-relevant questions. The WHO ICF-CY was used as a theoretical framework to link the ndings to the other research streams. Topic guide development Therst discussions to develop a topic guide were convened in a meeting of the qualitative research team and four parents, held as part of the co-investigator meeting in autumn 2011. These discussionshighlighted two key issues. First, there was a need to distinguish between 'health outcomes 'as de ned for this research study, and people 's experiences of health services; second, the concept of 'health outcomes ' was not readily understood by parents. Parents Members of the team in Exeter convened two meetings with several parents from the PenCRU Family Faculty; these meetings sought to explore ways in which 'health outcomes 'could be introduced and understood in the context of this research. The method that appeared to work best used the term 'aspects of health ', with prompts to build discussion around issues arising such as communication and pain; showing parents examples of PROM questionnaires was also helpful to focus discussions on topic.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 95\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Exception questions are used in family therapy and ask participants to focus on times when a problem does not occur or has not occurred; the inclusion of the question helped to move participants 'focus away from problems with the health system to the differences they would expect to see in their child if the health system were perfect. A hypothetical situation was proposed to parents of 'an ideal world ', where all services were provided satisfactorily. Given the scenario, parents were asked to consider what improvements in their children 's health they would expect, and ways in which they would want the NHS to improve their child 's health generally. After a break, parents were shown examples of PROM questionnaires, including the HUI, EQ-5D-Y, KIDSCREEN, and PedsQL with self-report and proxy report versions. Parents were asked for their views on the format and wording of the questionnaires but also on whether or not they felt that the questionnaires addressed the outcomes previously identi ed as important. Children and young people For children and young people, an approach was developed using a hypothetical character in order todepersonalise issues and to encourage them to raise issues that they might otherwise be reluctant toreveal. They were presented with a scenario where an imaginary young person was affected by a health condition, and asked to suggest what health problems they had. Participants were then asked about ways in which the character 's health could be improved. After a break, participants were shown examples of PROM questionnaires, and exemplar questions were extracted from PROMs that were 'blown up 'as posters, on which young people could write directly or make suggestions for the facilitator to annotate. The approach was piloted with an established disabled young people 's group in Torbay that was convened on behalf of the local authority by The Children 's Society. The pilot focus group was led by AF and observed by CM. Some modi cations were made in the light of this experience, particularly that prompts were helpful to encourage young people to consider aspects of physical, emotional and social health and that there should be less focus on the potential health problems of the character. This led to the development of a poster to introduce the concept of 'health outcomes 'to the participants (Figure 5 ). The poster showed a disabled young person, images of various health professionals, and a road leading to a sunny destination. Participants were invited to give the disabled young person a name and then asked to talk about which health outcomes would be important to the character when they arrived in FIGURE 5 Poster used to conceptualise the journey towards outcomes.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 96 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk'Outcomes Town '. To help structure the conversation in a way that enabled the participants to better understand and engage with the concept of outcomes, the facilitator (AF) introduced broad outcome areas, including physical health, emotional and mental health, and social and community life. Thisfacilitated discussion of more speci c topics; issues such as communication, pain and having friends were introduced as appropriate. Prompts were used to explore participants' views on (i) how the character in the poster might feel about each of the issues, (ii) whether or not an issue was likely to be important to themand (iii) what could be done could help improve the outcome. This structured conversation gave theparticipants the opportunity to explore and de ne the outcomes according to the importance they attached to them. After the outcomes discussion, the children and young people were shown examples of PROM questionnaires in small groups. They were encouraged to write on these forms to express their reactions, and supported by the facilitator (AF) and support staff to explore and evaluate the content of the forms in small groups. The small groups then came back together to discuss the forms as a single group and wereasked to make suggestions on how the forms could be improved to be more attractive to other childrenand young people affected by neurodisability. Adaptations and modications to the methodology After the fourth focus group, three themed posters were developed to help participants to explore key emerging concepts from the research in more detail ( Figure 6 ). The posters encouraged the participants to explore some of the physical health outcomes, mental and emotional health outcomes, and wider life outcomes that were emerging from the research, and to suggest additional outcomes that they felt were missing. Further signi cant modi cations to the topic guide were required to include young people with profound communication impairments. This group was included by using a 'Talking Mat framework' (Figure 7 shows an example). The facilitator (AF) collaborated with a speech and language therapist to create cards with illustrations that would be mostly familiar to young people using augmented communication to represent all the aspects of health that had been identi ed in the previous focus groups. A total of 157 cards were compiled as a resource to facilitate discussion about 10 outcome topics: movingabout, senses and pain, mental functions, activities, communication, participation, education, feelings, body functions, and diet. Participants were invited in turn to choose which of the outcome topics they wished to discuss. Subsets of symbol cards were then presented, relating to the speci c outcome selected. For example, when a participant selected the illustrated card for 'mental functions ', they were then presented sequentially with cards that related to sleep, memory and concentration. Participants wereasked if each of these symbols was for them 'good ','bad' or'sometimes good and sometimes bad' , and asked to indicate which topics were 'more important 'to them, 'somewhat important 'or'not important '. Young people' s personal choices of outcome cards were grouped on their Talking Mat boards, and their interactions were captured using audio recording and photographs of completed boards. Recruitment and sampling Interviews and focus groups were led by AA and AF of Council for Disabled Children (CDC). CDC is theleading national policy and practice improvement organisation for disabled children in England. CDC has considerable experience of consulting disabled young people and their parents on a broad range of issues. CDC maintains networks of disabled young people 's groups and parent groups. These networks provided expedient sampling frames for contacting children, young people and parents, including various conditions and age groups. CDC is also able to contact large numbers of families of disabled children through news items on their website and using Twitter and Facebook social networking sites.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 97\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

CDC also contacted professionals working with individual and groups of disabled children and young people who applied to be on the Department for Education Young People 's Advisory Group. CDC works closely with the National Network of Parent Carer Forums, which is the umbrella body for all 152 local authority forums for parents of disabled children. An invitation was advertised through these networks and using other media for individuals and groups of young people affected by neurodisability, and similarly but separately for parents, to volunteer to participate in this research. Volunteers registered their interest directly with CDC. Volunteer individuals and group leaders were screened by telephone to ensure that they were eligible, as CDC has a non-categorical approach to disability and some volunteers were not affected by health conditions included within the project de nition of neurodisability. Focus groups and interviews were purposively selected and strategically arranged to capture diagnostic, demographic and geographic variation. For instance, two groups were held in London in order to include black and minority ethnic communities. Interviewees were subsequently selected to address gaps identi ed in the sampling frame; for instance, interviews were arranged in the north-west, where it had not been possible to arrange a focus group. Procedure for interviews and focus groups The focus groups were organised with support from local professionals, working with parents and children and young people, who recruited participants and provided them with information about the study. The focus groups took place in a range of locations that the participants were familiar with: six took place at weekends or in evenings in premises that the groups used for regular meetings, and two took place in rooms in a school during the school day. Individual interviews were held at the participants 'homes. At the start of the focus group sessions, the convenors of the group introduced facilitators from CDC, who then introduced themselves to the group and explained the purpose of the project and consent forms were obtained for all participants. For children < 16 years, the consent forms were signed by their parents FIGURE 7 Example of Talking Mat board used to enable young people with communication impairments to express their views.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 99\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Participants were also asked to complete a form providing demographic details about themselves and/or their child. The facilitator then explained how the focus groups would be audio recorded and transcribed, and that this information would be treated con dentially. It was made clear that if at any point a participant said something that they wished to retract, either during or after the meeting, this would be removed from the transcript. All participants were happy with this, and none asked for information to be withdrawn atany point. The facilitators then began with an introductory activity to establish a relaxed atmosphere. For the children and young people, the facilitator introduced him- or herself and told the group about something he or she was looking forward to doing in the coming week, and asked the participants to do the same. Parents were asked to say who they were and three things about themselves, including how they chose to relax. Data management and analysis All audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and checked by the interviewers. Documents used in thedata collection and notes were also catalogued. Data were entered into NVivo 10 (QSR International,Warrington, UK) for management and analysis. The framework approach was developed as a systematic and rigorous methodology for applied qualitative research and was used for the analysis. 226Framework uses a structured and transparent approach to qualitative data collection and analysis.227Framework analysis involves ve distinct stages: (i) familiarisation with the data immersion in the raw data (listening to recordings and reading transcripts) to gain anoverview of the whole; (ii) identifying a thematic framework -identifying both the key concepts and issues a priori and those emerging from the data of individual respondents and recurring concepts;(iii) indexing -applying the framework to the transcripts, annotating the transcripts with identi cation codes referring to themes and subthemes; (iv) charting -extracting data from its original context, summarising and grouping it in chart form according to the thematic reference; and (v) mapping andinterpretation -reviewing the charts and research notes to compare and contrast, search for patterns and connections and provide explanations for the ndings. Two researchers (AA and VS) read the transcripts from four focus groups, including three with parents andone with young people, to develop the thematic framework used in the analysis. More salient issuesgrounded in the data were allowed to emerge; nevertheless, the interpretation of the ndings was heavily influenced by the prestated research objectives and the ICF-CY. The same two researchers (AA and VS) then both coded six transcripts, including two parents 'and two young people' s focus groups and two interviews (one with a parent and one with a young person). Double coding and subsequent comparison enabled us to check for consistency in the application of the index. The reliability of the coding was checked in NVivo. Nodes (themes) were discussed when the disagreement rate between the tworesearchers was higher than 2% and Cohen 's kappa < 0.40. Differences arising in interpretation between the researchers were resolved through discussion. One researcher (AA) then coded all materials from focus groups and interviews, working closely with the facilitator of the young people 's groups and interviews (AF). This was particularly important when coding material from the Talking Mat group. Once all of the material had been coded, two researchers(AA and AF) led on analysis. The data were themed into key concepts, with researchers identifying whichoutcomes appeared to carry the most weight for participants based on frequency and depth of discussion. Researchers then created maps to identify and illustrate the number and nature of relationships between these identi ed key outcomes. Several team teleconferences and face-to-face meetings were helpful for considering issues that arose as analyses progressed. The identi cation of the relationships between the key concepts as shown in the maps enabled the researchers to propose an overarching hierarchy, withinwhich the relationships between outcomes could be contained and explained. As the study progressed,QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 100 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukthe team discussed whether or not any new issues were emerging and judged that data saturation had been achieved. The emerging ndings were presented at a co-investigator meeting that included parents who were involved in the study and researchers not directly involved in the qualitative work stream. This generated particularly useful discussions and feedback, which aided re nement of the analysis. The sample size was determined pragmatically, initially, to enable a broad range of participants from different parts of England to be involved in focus groups and/or interviews. Where extracts of representative quotes are presented in the results, the identi cation code FGP (focus group parents) is used for parents 'focus groups, those from parents 'interviews are coded IP (interview parents), children and young people 's focus groups are coded FGCY (focus group children and young people), and interviews with children and young people are coded ICY (interview children and young people). For all extracts, square brackets containing three dots [. . .] indicate short sections of omitted speech. All names are aliases. Approvals The procedures were approved by National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee North East -County Durham & Tees Valley (reference 11/NE/0364); two protocol amendments were approved in relation torening procedures and topic guides. The study was co-sponsored by the University of Exeter and Royal Devon and Exeter Foundation Trust. Indemnity was provided through the University of Exeter. Results Sites and participants In total, 54 children and young people participated in the research: 50 participated in focus groups and4 in interviews. There were 53 parents who participated in the research: 47 in focus groups and 6 ininterviews ( Table 31 ). The children and parents were not related. The characteristics of participants are shown in Table 32 . There was variation by deprivation in the areas where participants lived, as a direct consequence of our purposive sampling. Ethnicity was mixed, althoughthe majority of participants who identi ed themselves were white British. The'primary 'neurodisability diagnosis shown in Table 32 was a pragmatic judgement (made by CM); many participants had indicated more than one impairment, or complex disability. In addition to the listed primary diagnoses, the parents of seven children reported that their children had epilepsy/seizures and the parents of four children reported sensory impairments. Some parents reported having more than one childwith a neurodisability: eight parents said that they had two children and three parents had three children affected by a neurodisability. Some children and young people also stated they had several impairments, including seven children who additionally recorded epilepsy and four who were recorded withsensory impairments. Some missing data resulted from parent groups, with parents arriving late and leaving early. In addition, some parents did not turn over the demographic data sheet and provide those data. A number of parentsof children taking part gave their child 's name in the box asking for diagnosis. Some stated that they did not want to give information on Disability Living Allowance (DLA).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 101\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Because of a need to have a common language for outcomes across the different strands ofresearch within this project, it was decided that they would be, as far as was possible, mapped onto the outcomes de ned by the WHO ICF-CY. To maximise intercoder reliability, ICF-CY chapter headings were chosen as far as was possible, with subheadings being utilised only when unavoidable. The ICF-CY and choices lneuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions lself-care, which includes having a good diet, exercise, washing, dressing and toileting lmajor life areas, for example education and work lfunctions of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, including endurance and fatigue lcommunity and social life, including recreation, sports and leisure lother mental functions, which encompasses consciousness, orientation, social skills, intellectual cognitive functioning, energy and drive ltemperament, which encompasses behaviour, mood, emotion, anxiety, attention and concentration lbody structures lgenitourinary and reproductive functions (continence, enuresis) lfunctions of digestive system including constipation, swallowing and drooling. In addition to these outcomes de ned by the ICF-CY, two additional themes emerged from the data that could not be mapped directly onto the ICF-CY: (i) emotional well-being and (ii) gaining independence/ future aspirations.TABLE 32 Characteristics of participants ( continued ) Characteristics Children and young people Parents DLA CC Higher rate 16 36 Middle rate 10 11Lower rate 3 0None 2 0Missing 23 6 DLA MC Higher rate 16 rate 9 18None 2 0Missing 27 10 DLA CC, Disability Living Allowance Component; DLA MC, Disability Living Allowance Mobility Component; IMD, Index of Multiple Deprivation.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 104 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukOutcomes identied Parents and children and young people were encouraged to identify and explore the importance and meaning of a range of health outcomes. Within these discussions, parents and young people did not generatediscretely de ned health outcomes. Through the process of analysis, it seemed that the most probable explanation for this was that parents and young people do not think about individual health outcomes inisolation. Rather, they view outcomes as strongly interrelated, facilitating or inhibiting each other. A number of key outcomes emerged from their accounts that seemed to be given more weight than others. Generally, this was because of the extent to which they affected other outcomes. However, some seemed intrinsically to hold more value for participants. Key outcomes included communication, mobility,pain, self-care, temperament, relationships, social life, emotional well-being and developing independence. These key outcomes are discussed below in the context of their relation to other outcomes and life aspirations. Communication Communication was regarded as a highly important outcome by both parents and children and youngpeople. They identi ed some shared elements, particularly the importance of communication in relation to decision-making and social interactions. Both parents and children and young people distinguished between different types of communication -basic and social. Parents with children with profound communication impairments wanted children to be able to indicatechoice. Many parents identi ed a link between profound communication impairments and challenging behaviour, where children were using behaviour to communicate feelings or desires: And he can't tell us if he's feeling depressed or angry or, he can scream and wave his arms aroundand that's how we know something's not quite right. FGP2 There was an underlying anxiety from some parents about safeguarding issues for children who could notcommunicate. A lot of parental effort goes into translating non-verbal communication for substitute carers: We felt that we had to really constantly talk to the staff because we were conscious that Stan couldn't tell them, so we were always having to say now if this happens, if this happens. IP3 Communication is thus seen as a critical gateway to independence; parents seem much more con dent about their children managing without them where they are con dent that they can communicate their needs and desires, and prioritise teaching them how to communicate choice: And they can make choices. [ . . . ] Teach them to say yes or no [ . . . ] Just a big thing is yes and no.It's a huge thing is yes or no. [ . . . ] Needing help to go to the toilet and needing to be fed they're all about personal dignity [ . . . ] some of these children will never experience, and that independence of, I'm going to eat that bit but I'm not going to eat that because I don't like that or I don't want it. FGP1 The relationship between communication and taking part in decision-making was recognised by childrenand young people, who saw communication as a vital element of independence and crucial to taking part in decision-making about their lives, both highly valued outcomes. Not being able to communicate was a source of anxiety for children and young people, associated with being marginalised or excluded frommaking decisions about their own lives, with other people taking decisions on their behalf without takingtheir preferences into account ( Box 1 ).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 105\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Children and young people also recognised the role that their parents played in understanding and transmitting their communication to others, especially other adults. These points were endorsed by a young person who participated using an eye-gaze computer to communicate: Facilitator: Why are friends and family important to young people? Participant: Because the parents can understand what the people are saying and understand them as well. Yeah, communication for parents. ICY1 All children and young people with complex communication impairments taking part in the Talking Matsessions selected communication as one of their key outcomes. They chose symbols for 'choice ','listen to me','people don 't listen to me ','independent 'and'people ignoring me 'as aspects of communication that were important to them ( Figures 8 and 9, FGCY7). One aspect that was articulated repeatedly by children and young people as one of the most importantelements of communication was being able to communicate with health professionals. This was raised inthe context of the importance that children and young people placed on being able to express their views and convey information to professionals in order to help determine treatments that could lead to better health outcomes: People messing you about like when you're in hospital and stuff, they don't understand you and stuff. And not necessarily just in hospital as well like in care and stuff because they don't understand what you, what your needs are and stuff like that. FGCY3 Parents with children with more moderate communication impairments wanted them to have support thatwould help them to develop social communication ( Box 2 ). They were frustrated about what they perceived to be a loss of potential speech (or development in speech) because of a lack of therapeutic input, or other interventions such as cochlear implants.BOX 1 Children and young people 's views on the importance of communication for self-determination I suppose support for young people, depending on their, how they can communicate, for them to be able to say what they need or any discomfort that they have or, instead of just having an expert saying this is what you need, listen to the individual sometimes. FGCY2 It's easy for someone to decide for you, but they don't really know how you feel about, you know, what you want or need . . . I think if the other person can't communicate then what they want might not get done. FGCY2 But the only person that can tell people about it is yourself really, isn't it?

They would probably get annoyed, frustrated and all that, angry. ICY1 Mobility Mobility was another area that was an important outcome for both parents and children and young people. Both groups identi ed the relationship between mobility and the ability to make choices. For children and young people, mobility was closely associated with making choices about being able to go where they want in order to access a range social and community activities while spending time with friends and family, without always needing somebody with them to support them, and was therefore alsostrongly related to community and social life: Being able to move when you want to move and not when other people just want to move you, as well, so you've got a choice over where you're going and what you're doing. FGCY2 A disabled person needs some help but sometimes they like to do things themselves . . . But sometimes they get stuck . . . it [mobility] would help them if they don't want to go about with someone with them all the time. FGCY8 Achieving this level of mobility was an aspiration for children and young people and provided them with a sense of freedom and independence that they regarded as a key part of living an ordinary life. For parents,there was the very basic fact that, for children without functional communication, mobility might be the only way in which they were able to indicate a positive, or negative, choice:BOX 2 Parents' views on social importance of communication and therapy She can talk and they discharged her because they said that she can make every sound of the alphabet but she is difcult to understand. So you need to listen to her in context and we don't always understand what she's saying. FGP5 Because my daughter can't, non [sic] verbalise at all, but the speech therapy see more of a swallowing issue for further problems as opposed to, they're not looking at it for, like let's see if we can develop her to socially communicate, be more independent. FGP5 Eventually we did get her a communication device. Actually if we'd have had it much earlier [ . . . ] Would have had a much better outcome for Katie [ . . . ] She would have been communicating from a very young age. FGP3QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 108 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukThe way he communicates to me is, if he wants a drink he will pull my arm until he gets what he wants. That's basically how he communicates, so anything he wants, and he just pulls me. IP4 Parents were concerned about the impact of mobility on social interaction, most commonly in relation toplay when parents talked about the way in which lack of, or poor, mobility impacted on their child 's ability to join in and keep up with other children, and then on their self-esteem: It's not that they're being mean, but they don't play with Dan, because he can't, so they end up getting too busy and zooming off somewhere else, and he feels that a lot, I think. [. . .] he seems to have become quite passive, to me, [. . .] but I think a lot of it is I'm not going to bother now, whichworries me. IP6 Children and young people shared this recognition of the way that their mobility impacted on their ability to participate in social and community activities with friends. There was a particular concern about how their level of mobility affected the extent to which they could attend school, take part in sporting activitiesand keep up with non-disabled peers: Because I'm not really fast at the moment, and all my other mates are, so I can't really catch up. FGCY1 Elements of children and young people 's physical functioning played a big role in determining their degree of mobility. Neuromuscular functioning in particular was seen as critical for mobility, with a particular emphasis on the importance on muscle and joint functioning in being able to move around to the greatest degree possible: My problems with my leg, legs I struggle to straighten it . . . it's just so difcult because you have toreally concentrate really hard and you have to like go like, you have to start slow and then go quicker. . . It's really hard to do things quickly so it's impact on me. FGCY4 This was often related to spasticity, but hypermobility and dyspraxia were also mentioned. Physiotherapyinput was highly valued by parents, and also by some of the children and young people, as a key route for maximising neuromuscular functioning and, therefore, mobility: He had a surgery on his hip and if like physio and occupational therapy provided a programme he needed he would have, would have been able to use a standing frame, even a walking frame. He isnot able to use any of them. FGP1 Effective mobility aids were important for the quality of life children and young people, who recognisedthe importance of achieving a level of neuromuscular functioning that enabled them to use their equipment comfortably and effectively: I was just going to say like having mobility aids can be, help give you more a sense of freedom and independence to move around and to do more what you please. FGCY2 I've got a dislocated hip on one side and for me I can only spend about half an hour in my [wheel]chair and then I need to get out again. So if the NHS could help me with that then that would be a lot better.

For children and young people with complex communication impairments, who were allwheelchair users, their mobility equipment was more important to them than their ability to stand or walk ( Figure 10 ). A number of parents voiced concerns about what they perceived to be 'low expectations 'from professionals. This crossed a number of different outcome areas, including mobility. For example, one mother was frustrated that her child had been discharged from physiotherapy services because she could now walk, when the mother felt that her daughter 's gait was still 'peculiar '. She wanted more input so that her daughter would be able to walk and present herself more 'normally '. This possibly indicates a difference between the goals of professionals and parents. For the physiotherapist, mobility is the goal andthis has been attained. For this parent, mobility is an end in itself, but she additionally has a higher-level goal, which is about her daughter standing out less from her community and her peers. Parents talked about the way in which a number of neurodisabling conditions, such as autism, meant that their concerns around mobility were not in relation to any physical dif culties, but rather because their child did not necessarily have the cognitive abilities that would enable them to be safely mobile: If she sees something she fancies. She ran out of the house and she stopped a taxi in the road, andshe lay on its bonnet and was shouting ow, ow. She'd seen something on the telly. FGP3 Pain Children and young people were concerned with the direct physical discomfort caused by pain but also by the negative impact of pain on a wide range of physical, mental, emotional and social outcomes andoverall quality of life. As a result, children and young people regarded pain as one of the major barriers to their life aspirations, one that affected 'everything '(FGCY1 + ICY4), and one of the aspects of their health that they wanted the health service to improve. FIGURE 10 Talking Mat showing importance of equipment for moving and moving about (FGCY7).QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 110 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukThis prioritisation of pain was linked to the strong feeling that if pain was not managed adequately then the consequences were serious and widespread and it could become a barrier in relation to a range of health outcomes that children and young people valued. The most prominent outcomes that were raisedby children and young people as being negatively impacted on by pain were communication, physical endurance, mobility, the ability and desire to interact socially with others, the ability perform mental tasks and school attendance ( Box 3 ). The impact that pain could have on school attendance, and participation at school, was important tochildren and young people, both in terms of learning new knowledge and skills, which was highly valued for gaining quali cations that would be bene cial after they left school, and as an important site of social interactions with peers. Pain, especially when it affected mobility, was frequently mentioned as a one of the main factors related to neurodisability that disrupted children 's and young people 's school experiences. This disruption was related to the negative effect pain has on the ability to concentrate and performcomplex mental tasks, and to the way pain limits mobility and can cause long-term school absence: If you're in a lot of pain then, and that's not being managed properly, then it's going to affect whatyou can and can't do as well, and whether you can enjoy doing those things, concentration and things like that. ICY3 BOX 3 Children and young people 's views on the general impact of pain I think it'll [pain] bring them generally down, as well, because [ . . . ] you can't . . . ] can't be independent because the pain isn't handled well, then I guess you become just, I don't know, bring yourself down, I guess. FGCY2 If you're in less pain there'd be a happier impact, if you're in more pain it would have a bad impact on yourself. FGCY2 It might mean you can't talk to anybody because you're in pain. FGCY2 Because if it hurts you, you don't want it to go on and on. FCCY1 It would get too tiring for them, plus they get too exhausted as well. ICY4 If they're so much in pain then it can cause somebody to be emotional and sometimes trying to nd the words to tell someone that you are actually really upset or really angry then it can be even quite hard and it doesn't always come across the way you want it to.

Well, it hurts quite a lot and it affects how I walk because if they hurt then obviously I can't walk as far and I have to take them off and it means I can't get round places that I need to go to. FGCY4 For wheelchair users, being able manage the potential side effects, especially minimising discomfort resulting from long periods of sitting in a xed position, and reducing the risk of pressure sores, was a major concern. Parents were also concerned about pain caused by poor equipment products, including incontinence products leading to sores and pain. There was frustration from parents about what was felt to be avoidable pain: The nappies that we've got keep him dry. So if he soils or wees at night, we don't have to change thesheets any more. He obviously still has the soreness issue. So it would be nice to have some that were the, like what you get Pampers and everything where they've got the layer that protects the skin. It just seems to be basic, very basic nappies. IP5 Parents of children with communication dif culties were very anxious about pain being missed or misunderstood and, therefore, not managed appropriately and effectively. Self-care Self-care was another pervasive outcome area for parents, but one that was not of equal concern forchildren and young people. As an outcome in and of itself parents were looking for their children to achieve the maximum amount of self-care possible and wanted health professionals to factor in the impact of interventions or procedures on self-care: Once the gastrostomy was put in there was absolutely no effort and no plan to keep up the[feeding] skills. FGP1 Parents identi ed neuromusculoskeletal functioning as an obstacle to self-care and valued interventions and exercises that were focused on helping their child to be more independent with their self-care: We want Stan to focus on things that are going to be useful to him and functional to him, sotransfers out of his wheelchair to go to the toilet and things like that [ . . . ] as parents we would liketo think that in the future when he's going to the toilet he has got some kind of privacy or dignity. [ . . . ] But in physiotherapy sessions they'll work on things like side sitting, which, he's not going to be able to use that in any kind of functional way. IP3 For children and young people, there was some concern that neuromusculoskeletal functioning restrictedtheir ability to carry out self-care independently, or made carrying out self-care tasks more dif cult and time-consuming. At best, this was regarded as an inconvenience that children and young people learnedto cope with; at worst, it was described as being highly distressing:QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 112 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukThey become tired and it makes it very difcult, like for instance going to the toilet, getting yourself dressed if your legs, if you try to do any little things then it can hurt and become all of a sudden very difcult. FGCY8 Some parents who wanted their children to have a greater level of independence prioritised toileting as akey outcome. Mothers highlighted concerns about the fact that they still needed to support pubescentchildren with washing and going to the toilet when more usual age-appropriate behaviour is a child' s increased desire for privacy. Toileting was also a priority for parents because of the logistics of changingchildren who are not continent; parents saw continence and independent toileting as opening up agreater range of social opportunities. The poor quality of continence products was also raised as an issue in this context, with parents feeling that the products did not support toilet training, for instance if no 'pull-up 'products were provided. Anxiety was also identi ed as an obstacle to self-care. For children and young people with high levels of anxiety, this could paralyse them in many different aspects of functioning, of which self-care andparticularly dressing was identi ed as one. Self-care was also seen as critical to children and young people gaining independence and parents often talked about the two concepts in tandem: If they understood why they felt stressed [ . . . ] if they had strategies that they were taught thatwould help to bring all of these down then they would be able to dress, they would be able to bemore independent. IP2 Daniel nowadays he loves his independence when he can shower himself and wash himself, but atthe moment I have to supervise him. FGP3 Children and young people did not make the same explicit link between self-care and independence, butthere was recognition of how requiring self-care support from family or friends could in fluence these relationships. This resulted in some children and young people identifying being able to carry out self-caretasks, or being able to help more with them, in order to minimise the disruption to relationships: Yes, and so I want to get stronger in my hips, so. My daddy doesn't, well, at the moment my daddylifts me and I want to be able to help him so if I had more strength in my legs I could help daddy more with lifting. FGCY4 Temperament Temperament was one of the topics that featured more strongly for parents than for children and young people. While children and young people recognised that dif culty in controlling emotions was an obstacle for them, it was a persistent, recurring theme for parents. This may partly be a re flection of the difference between being on the receiving end and the delivery end of severe anxiety or challenging behaviour; it isalso likely to re flect a difference in disability represented by the children and young people and children of the parents involved. Parents frequently mentioned a reduction in their children 's frustration and challenging behaviour as a desired outcome. They also referred to examples of children being able to manage their behaviour better with pleasure and with reference to another desired outcome, such as consequently getting on better at school: He's learnt to handle himself better and [ . . . ] he's no longer on school action.

FGP1 Ellie is quite extreme [ . . . ] In that she punches herself if it's, if there's something that she doesn'tlike. [ . . . ] And then if that doesn't work she'll bite herself, and then if that doesn't work she'll bite you. [ . . . ] It's communication. FGP3 Parents felt that anxiety caused their children emotional distress. Although anxiety is separate fromchallenging behaviour, parents were clear that it often led to challenging behaviour when children wereunable to communicate clearly what was making them anxious: Last year when he was doing GCSEs he got very agitated. And he was pulling his hair all the time andgetting up in the night and crying and all sorts of bad things. IP1 I heard Connor screaming and I came running and Evan had, [pauses to control emotions] sorry, he'd wrapped a cord round his neck and he was going blue and he did it because I wasn't there and he needed me. [ . . . ] And he's so helpless he just and so emotional and he was really angry with me andhe didn't do it because he wanted to die he did it because he was [ . . . ] really distressed, mentally ill. IP2 Parents identi ed a number of areas where they felt that poor outcomes led to increased anxiety and or challenging behaviour. These included sleep and 'sensory processing 'difculties. Anxiety was also identi ed as a barrier to sleep and both anxiety and challenging behaviour were identi ed as barriers to learning and to interpersonal relationships. For some children and young people, there was recognition that being unable to control emotions such as anger and frustration can result in verbal or physical outbursts that have a negative impact ontheir relationships: At school when people annoy me, I get really frustrated. I get really annoyed, and I shout at them,and there's no need for me to shout at them, and I just need to calm down . . . because then peoplewould think that I'm a better friend. FGCY1 Interpersonal relationships and interactions Interpersonal relationships and interactions, especially relationships with friends and family, emerged as a key overarching outcome for children and young people. Making and building friendships with other children and young people is a hugely important part of most children 's and young people 's lives and is regarded as an absolutely fundamental element of having a happy and ordinary life. Making and maintaining friendships was described as crucial for maintaining good mental health and positive emotional well-being: If you don't play with your friends you lose them, but if you see your mates you're more than happy. FGCY1QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 114 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukNot being able to spend time with friends or to build friendships was a major cause of anxiety for children and young people, who worried about being isolated and lonely, which was identi ed as a major contributor towards feeling depressed: If you don't have a group of friends at school, then you're a bit like 'what's the point of living?' FGCY2 Wanting their children to be able to form and maintain friendships and relationships with siblings was a recurrent theme for parents. As was the case for children and young people, this seemed to be about wanting their children to have a happy, ordinary life. The lack of any friends at school was one of the factors that caused one parent to consider that her son might have a neurodisability. It was an area ofpriority for parents to the extent that one had decided to have more children so that her disabled child would have friends. Parents frequently mentioned concerns about their children not having any friends and described situations where their children were left behind, not included or, in the worst instances, bullied.They wanted them to be able to keep up, and to be included with their peers. One woman described,through an interpreter, her desire for her 11-year-old son to have friends of his own age: So she wants him to socialise more with normal people, normal kids [ . . . ] She said when he goes tothe park he'll play with the little babies. FGP4 Parents valued children and young people developing and forming friendships, for instance: Evan now will admit to having friends at school, which is a huge difference, he never wouldhave before. IP2 A wide range of health outcomes, such as being in pain, having limited mobility or having problems with communication, were identi ed by children and young people as having a major negative impact on their ability to build and maintain positive personal relationships with friends and family. For children and young people, managing these aspects of their health in a way that minimises its impact on their personalrelationships is a hugely important outcome that the health service should support them to achieve: I think there needs to be working together with the schools and the doctors . . . socially, if you can'tsee your friends and things like that, there's that risk of not staying in contact, maybe losing thosefriends . . . I think with there being such a big focus obviously with the NHS on xing you, that is forgotten and because that's forgotten it has a bigger impact than it needs to have. ICY3 Relationships with parents were also very important to children and young people but, in addition to theemotional importance of having strong family relationships, there was an extra element to relationships with parents. Children and young people were aware of the role that parents played in providing extrasupport for them as a result of their neurodisability. This includes parents 'role in understanding children 's communication, providing care and support with managing a health condition, self-care and providingtransport. Children and young people described the importance of balancing these two elements of theirrelationships with their parents and not allowing their neurodisability to disrupt their family relationships by forcing them to prioritise their health issues rather than other activities. A young person interviewed, who used an eye-gaze computer to communicate (ICY1), said that they did not let their health condition get inthe way of their family relationships, but that the NHS did not do enough to support this. Another young person suggested: I think your family and stuff like that, it can affect being able to see them and having that relationship with them, because you're restricted . . . your family then starts to become second, whereas for aDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 115\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

ICY3 Parents never mentioned this aspect of their relationships with their children and this may re flect a taboo. Once parents have processed the loss of the child they had imagined they were having and have bondedwith their disabled child, it may be important not to articulate the additional demands. There may also be a concern for their child 's self-esteem and, therefore, a concern not to locate the problem in the child, or it may simply be that they take it for granted. Children and young people were also concerned that this increased dependence on parents for support could inhibit their opportunities to interact with other children and young people without supervision,which is something they valued for building friendships and feeling independent and having an ordinary life: Your friends and family are always there for you and sometimes when your mum and dad takes you out and then it, and then you get embarrassed by your parents being around . . . it could be a bigproblem for some young children if they need their parents with them . . . it's not really a social life it's more like a medical social life. ICY2 This was also true for parents, with many expressing a desire for their children to be able to form friendships and loving relationships. Conversely, not having friendships was seen as extremely negative anddistressing. Parents also recognised that challenging behaviour and anxiety were barriers to their children forming successful relationships. Social relationships were a major part of children 's and young people' s lives, and were identi ed by them as being directly related to their emotional well-being. Minimising the disruption to these relationships caused by neurodisability was one of their key overarching outcomes. Community and social life Community and social life were spoken of as a key priority by parents and children and young people. As outlined above, this was an area strongly linked to interpersonal interactions and relationships, with amutually reinforcing feedback mechanism; being able to take part in social and community activities was a major factor in in fluencing children and young people' s ability to build friendships, and being able to take part in social activities with friends was one of the most valued bene ts of having personal relationships. However, the concept was broader than a social life; it was about being included within one 's community and being able to participate in sports and leisure activities. Parents talked about community and social life being fundamental to having a life and enjoying life. They wanted their children to enjoy life, to be havingfun, and identi ed a relationship between community and social life and emotional well-being: But the fact she is now living a life that's having fun and doing things and taking part in theatreproductions and all sorts of stuff, but the most important thing, she's relaxed and you can physicallysee that with her. FGP6 This prioritisation seemed to be in part because they could identify the positive bene ts for their children 's well-being of their children enjoying life: 'he loves it and he laughs [ . . . ] must be good for his emotional well-being '(IP3). However, parents also seemed to have an eye on the future; there was a strong desire for their children to be included, to be a part of the community. This seemed, in part, to be about themQUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 116 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukbeing able to live an ordinary life, but it was also about their children being a part of something when they were no longer around to make sure it happened: He's becoming part of the community, which is what I really wanted for him [ . . . ] he goes and he gets his Coke and his packet of cheese and onion crisps, and they have it on the bar waiting for himnow. Hello [son's name], how are you? And it's, it's what I want for him when he's older, they'll know him, and when I'm long gone, he'll be part of something, he'll have people that know him and that can chat to him and say hello. IP6 When parents talked about social opportunities, there was often a palpable sense of loss. This was partlyfor their child, but also for the family as a whole. Parents often talked about the places that they could not go or the things they could not do as a family: And it's difcult because a lot of the things that we don't do as a family are because of Matthew's behaviour, not so much because of his health. So we generally don't go to the cinema together as afamily because Matthew is unpredictable as to whether he would sit and watch the lm. [ . . . ] We don't go for bike rides together as a family. IP5 The importance that children and young people placed on participating in social and community life was closely related to the importance of friendships and relationships with family. The interaction of these twofactors had a major in fluence on children 's and young people' s emotional well-being and mental health, and even on their perception of their wider health: I think it, having a social life, could impact on your health as well because if you've got one and ableto go out and see friends and family members or anyone [ . . . ] So you'll feel happy in yourself andsometimes being happy and being with people you know and going out, it can benet it on your health. So I think it's really important that all disabled people should have some sort of social life because it can have a positive effect and sometimes even improve your health. FGCY4 The importance of participating in social activities with friends and family meant that any outcomesthat enabled or prevented them from being able to participate in activities with friends took ongreat signi cance: Well, for instance like I can't go on day trips and I can't go to the theme park, right, and it's ruiningmy parents' and my life. So every day I have to stay in bed at a certain time and I get out for half anhour, then I get back in bed, so it's hard for me. FGCY1 For a number of children and young people, physical play was an important part of their social life, andhaving the physical functioning to be able perform physical exercise as part of play and sporting activities was an important outcome. For other children and young people, getting out in the community was not as dif cult as being able to carry out tasks that enabled them to participate in social activities. This was related to ne motor control and physical endurance, two aspects of health that could prevent children and young people from socialising with their peers in the way they wanted. While a young person might have enough mobility to get to a fast food restaurant or a theme park, if they did not have the ne motor skills to manipulate money to pay for things or be able to hold an ice cream, or were unable to meet the requirements to go on a ride, their ability to socialise was still restricted.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 117\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Both could prevent opportunities that are a normal part of most childhoods, such as play dates and sleepovers. For some families, this also meant that they could not have friends to stay, or that going on holiday was problematic. Emotional well-being Emotional well-being was a strong theme in discussions with parents and children and young people.Parents would often prioritise well-being over other outcomes: My main objective is to make sure he's happy and he's comfortable. IP4 I just want him to be happy. IP6 One parent talked about the fact that she and her partner supported their son in walking, although theyhad been advised by the physiotherapist that it was bad for his hips, because he got so much pleasurefrom it and she felt that it had a positive impact on his emotional well-being: I don't know what benets it gives him health, like physical health wise. [ . . . ] But mental health wiseit's so powerful because you can see on his face he just loves it and he laughs, and he just loves it, soit must be doing something good for his emotional well-being. IP3 Children and young people frequently related other health outcomes to the impact that they would haveon their emotional well-being, and this was a consistent way children and young people used to explain why an outcome was important to them ( Box 4 ). Children and young people referenced being happy, feeling sociable and relaxed as positive aspects of their emotional well-being, while anxiety, depression and frustration were mentioned as negative consequences of not being able to meet a range of outcomes. A number of parents of children with physical disabilities identi ed a link between physical ability and positive self-esteem. One mother felt that her son struggled with his physical disability and that when he was able to kick a football after a tendon transfer operation it increased his self-esteem: His self-esteem, you could see it coming out of his ears. IP6 Even if children were profoundly physically disabled, parents felt that things such as physiotherapy relaxedtheir children and boosted their con dence. The importance of self-esteem was also evident for children and young people, who referred to things in their lives that made them feel positive. A number ofparticipants expressed the importance of self-esteem in relation to their neurodisability, and how childrenand young people should be supported to come to terms with their disability and its impact on their life: Telling them what will happen, explaining it to them slowly and helping them get over what theycan't have . . . Helping them understand what they've got when they're young and helping themlearn to, to deal with it . . . and always teach them to have a positive outlook on life. FGCY8 And sometimes even knowing things that you could have done years ago that you can't now thatcan be quite emotional because I used to do a bit of walking and obviously I can't so much now. I'mmore or less wheelchair bound and sometimes that can be quite frustrating not for just me but for my parents and family around me. So having some, having people who understand that would make it easier.

Another talked about the bene ts of music therapy because it made her son relaxed. Another wanted her son to be out of pain because of the negative impact this had on his well-being and state of mind. One mother felt that her daughter 's mental health and well-being had improved as a result of having a proper communication system in place: She's physically relaxed, you're seeing her as a proper person. FGP4 Parents identi ed a number of undesired consequences that came from lack of emotional well-being, such as anxiety and depression, including self-harming. For some children, there were physical manifestations ofthis poor mental health, such as stomach cramps or migraines. Parents wanted their children to feel good about themselves and to have a positive self-image, to be able to value their strengths. Gaining independence, future aspirations Parents valued interventions and support that increased their children 's independence. This was regardless of cognitive and physical ability: In an ideal world he probably might, as I say, have been able to look after himself. FGP5 Washing and toileting independently, being able to communicate and to communicate choice wereconcepts most frequently referred to in relation to gaining independence. Whether or not this was thecase, parents were keen that their children 's dignity was protected and respected. So, ideally, they might want their child to be able to self-toilet, but they de nitely wanted continence products which did not leak when their children soiled themselves in public. For children with more profound disabilities, parentswanted them to have the personal dignity of continence or at least to have the independence that came from pull-ups as opposed to nappies. This may re flect the way in which parents try to 'future proof 'for their children. A number of the quotes in Box 5 refer to a time when parents will not be around to care for their children, and it is very clear that parents feel more secure about the idea that their children will be looked after well in their absence if their children can communicate need and indicate choice. So, there may be an aspiration to enable greaterindependence, as well as a strong pragmatic desire to prevent poor care in the future or, in the worst-case scenario, harm. The concept of gaining independence was slightly wider than wanting children to be as independent as possible; parents wanted their children to reach their potential. There was anger from a number of parents about what they perceived to be low expectations from professionals about what their children might achieve: He hasn't seen a speech therapist for 18 months. [ . . . ] And the last time we saw her she just turnedround and said, 'Liam's Liam'. That doesn't help me. Oh, I hate that. I hate that [ . . . ] what does that mean 'Liam's Liam'? Which is annoying. And it's low expectation. FGP5 They wanted their children to be the best they could be, whatever that might mean; they felt that, too often, because the best that might be achieved might not be the norm, there was a prevailing attitudethat a low level of achievement was good enough. Parents talked about therapies being withdrawn assoon as progress was beginning to be made.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 120 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukChildren and young people made far less direct references to gaining independence and future aspirations, and they did not talk about future developments in the way that parents did. As reportedabove, they were concerned with being able to make choices and participate in activities independently, but this was in the context of developments in the present or near future, rather than longer-term aspirations. Where children and young people did raise issues of future independence, this tended to be inrelation to issues common to all young people, such as education, quali cations and employment, and the additional support that disabled people require to achieve these. The nature of the relationship between outcomes As is evident throughout, parents and children and young people do not view health outcomesindividually. Outcomes were always spoken of in terms of whether they impacted on, or were impactedby, other outcomes. The research team observed that greater weight was given by participants to those health outcomes with the greater number of inter-relationships. In looking more closely at the inter-relationships and focusing on the way in which participants spoke about certain outcomes as having an impact on, or being impacted on by other outcomes, outcomes could be conceptualised and, it seemed, were experienced as an interdependent hierarchy (Figures 11 and 12). Within the hierarchy, the highest-level overarching outcomes were identi ed as being of critical importance. These higher-level outcomes were frequently described by participants as the end goal forhealth services, and the ultimate positive consequence of achieving other, lower-level health outcomes thatsit beneath them in the hierarchy: Huge differences in terms of Daisy being able to make clear choices, having key words to be able to slow herself down without the anxiety building up to her thumping somebody [ . . . ] Huge differencesBOX 5 Parents' views on gaining independence and communication So she's living her life independently [ . . . ] because Georgia's communication doesn't stop on my door. It doesn't stop anywhere. It's everywhere. FGP6 If they can learn to communicate better then they can tell people what they want when you're not with them. FGP4 I would like to know that he, other people could understand him because it makes them afraid of him, people are afraid of him. My own family don't want to know and would never look after him and I just, I sort of fear for the future really. FGP6 Let's see if we can develop her to socially communicate, be more independent. FGP5 I think it'd be nice for him to be able to go and say, this is where I want to go, mum, I don't want to go that way, I want to go this way.

[ . . . ] she is now living a life that's having fun and doing things [ . . . ] but the most important thing, she's relaxed and you can physicallysee that with her. FGP6 Lower in the hierarchy are fundamental or foundation outcomes related to more basic physical and mental health functioning. These foundation-level outcomes are not necessarily perceived as goals in their own right but take on importance due to their consequences on the achievement of other,higher-level outcomes: Obviously if you're in a lot of pain you don't really concentrate that much on other things and going out with friends and just having a life like everybody else would be is quite restricted because of that. ICY3 In between higher-level and foundation outcomes are intermediary concepts, more complex than basic outcomes related to physical and mental health functioning.

The weight given to them is based on their role in facilitating (or blocking) the achievement of higher-order outcomes such as gaining independence. Two overarching outcomes that were shared by parents and children and young people were emotional well-being and social and community life. Parents also prioritised gaining independence, while childrenand young people placed a far greater emphasis on the importance of interpersonal interactionsand relationships. Emotional well-being was frequently mentioned by both parents and children and young people as an overarching outcome. As set out in the previous section, and the quote above, parents commented on how interventions or procedures would impact on emotional well-being. Social and community life was also highly valued by both sets of participants, with other outcomes being valued for their contribution to enabling children and young people to take part in social and community activities. Parents identi ed the ability to participate in social and community life as being central to 'living a life '. Other outcomes such as mobility were referenced in terms of the way in which they presented an obstacle or made a contribution to children 's ability to participate socially. Gaining independence and future aspirations were identi ed as a key aspiration in all discussions and interviews with parents. Other outcomes such as mobility and communication were identi ed as being of value in supporting independence and were prioritised for that reason. There was often a different quality to parental discourse on these three higher-level aspects of health, and they spoke about these areas with clear emotion: He wheeled himself off round the corner, and I said where are you going? [ . . . ] they said he's coming to sit with the lads, stop cramping his style, and he went and sat with all these lads, and Ijust, I nearly cried, I thought it was fantastic. IP6 Children and young people prioritised social interactions and relationships. Minimising the impact that neurodisability has on their relationships with friends and family was a consistent theme and affected the value that they placed on a wide range of other outcome areas, and was often referred to as the ultimategoal of meeting other health outcomes. Feedback on exemplar questionnaires In the second part of the interview or focus group, participants were asked to re flect on a small selection of example PROM questionnaires, in terms of presentation and content. Young people were only asked about the self-reported questionnaires. Parents were asked for their views on questionnaires for children and young people to complete, and those designed for parents to complete about their child. Purpose and context of patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires There were immediate concerns from both parents and young people surrounding the purpose of thequestionnaire; they wanted the beginning of the form to clearly set out why the questions were being asked and what would be done with the information: There's no explanation as to, not only just the purpose of what the forms are for, but what they're hoping to achieve by us lling in the forms in the rst place. FGP2 It should be borne in mind that for many parents, completing questionnaires, such as those required forDLA, can directly affect their income. There was clearly a concern that lling in this form could have aDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 123\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Although parents understood that the results would be aggregated, there were still concerns about the inadequacies of the questionnaire in measuring health improvements in disabled children that might then lead to a failure to adequately fund services, or to their child receivingthe wrong service: Will they, in a sense, diagnose your child with something completely different than what happened, based on just this simple test? FGP2 Condential or not I would expect severe repercussions if we put the right or wrong thing. FGCY3 Some participants, both parents and children and young people, struggled not to see the form as an assessment method: Is there hope that through this form that you will be passed on or fed through to the relevant servicesavailable or does that need to be a separate question again? FGP2 A number of parents argued against the questionnaire being presented within health settings for thatreason; their children were often upset by appointments, and lling out the questionnaires at that time would give an unduly negative perspective on how they felt about life. Face validity issues There were major concerns about the language used in the questionnaires, in that it may be upsetting for those completing them, especially children and young people. The language was perceived as negative and focused around children and young people' sd ecits as opposed to celebrating what they were able to achieve ( Figure 13 ): And then you'd actually want to go away and commit suicide, wouldn't you, when you realise [ . . . ] That you have trouble getting along with the world, you have other kids who don't want to be with you. [ . . . ] I don't want Daniel to say yes to that. [ . . . ] I don't want them to be even, have that intheir head. FGP3 FIGURE 13 Feedback from young people about questionnaires (FGCY3).QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 124 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukI feel afraid and scared, I feel sad or blue, I feel angry, I have trouble sleeping, I worry about what will happen to me, I have trouble getting along with kids, other kids don't want to be my, my God. [ . . . ] FGP5 They're all really negative, aren't they? FGP3 Lots of negative questions in, for instance instead of saying, I feel sad or I feel really unhappy, it never really gave you an option of, no, I feel ne or I feel really happy. It was always negative, almostpresuming something was always going to be wrong . . . I think they're too negative. CYFG4 Some parents with profoundly disabled children indicated that they would feel alienated by a questionnaire that did not enable them to capture their child 's level of functioning: To me, straightaway it's not relevant because my child can't do any of these things yet. FGP2 Parents felt that they wanted to be able to give details of their child 's condition and/or their developmental age so that it gave some context to their answers: It may be never, but it's OK for it to be never. FGP3 They also wanted to be able to measure small improvements or capabilities: I can say she can dress herself, but washing she could never wash herself. FGP4 A speci c issue for parents of children with cognitive impairment but who were physically able was that a child might, theoretically, physically be able to do something but not be able to do it safely or reliablywithout supervision. For example, parents wanted to indicate that they had problems with running -not because they could not run but, rather, because they had a tendency to run off. Children and young people who were wheelchair users felt marginalised by the questions on mobility that related to walking and running rather than giving them the opportunity to answer based on how easilythey were able to get around. This marginalisation caused a negative feeling towards the forms and led to wheelchair users not valuing the questionnaires: Because all of them ones would be four for me because I'm a wheelchair user so most of them . . . it's not putting into consideration wheelchair users. FGCY4 I think it's hard because I suppose young people walking can be a problem but for people who are inwheelchairs . . . you can still go more than one block but you don't necessarily walk. FGCY2 That's not relevant to all to all young people because they can't walk. So it's how would you get about better?

IP3 Participants 'views on the appropriateness of the questions appeared mixed. Many parents and children and young people agreed that the questionnaires did measure outcomes of concern to them, if indirectly. However, a reasonably common initial response was that they did not: They're like, no, they're like a million miles away from asking any relevant questions. Interviewer: So what should they be asking, then? Can your child walk? [ . . your child . ] Can your child see? FGP2 This often seemed to be related to the level or type of a child 's disability, and so parents of profoundly disabled children, or children and young people themselves, often felt alienated by the questionnaires which they felt assumed too high a higher level of functioning in some or all areas, depending on theirchild 's condition: For the likes of us isn't that depressing? [ . . . ] it does make you realise what they can't do. FGP1 No one is ever perfect . . . FGCY5 Sometimes, when aspects of health that might affect a question were explored, parents and children andyoung people did then feel that the key areas were covered by some of the questions. Children and youngpeople often expressed approval of speci c questions as covering an important outcome area, but the way in which the question was asked undermined their approval, and led the participants to dislike theforms generally. Parents 'initial responses might be that the form did not cover the right areas, but then they might see that 'anxiety 'or'challenging behaviour 'could map onto questions about 'feeling afraid 'or'feeling angry '. However, even when they agreed that there was overlap, they were not always happy with the way in which some topics were addressed. This may have been related to degree of disability and the extent to which parents wanted more nely graded questions and response options which would enable them to track the small improvements that they might be able to expect in their child' s condition. There were a number of areas that were frequently identi ed as being inadequately captured, such as continence and food intolerances, and also children 's'levels of frustration '.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 126 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukThe proxy-reporting problem Some parents suggested they would not feel comfortable completing a questionnaire as a proxy for their child. Parents indicated that they would not know how to respond; this was particularly problematic forchildren with communication dif culties: For me with this one, my child can't communicate, so I couldn't actually answer most of the questions. So I wouldn't know if he's t or well or if he felt full of energy or sad or lonely because he can't tell me. FGP2 Many parents indicated that they would not know how their child was getting on at school and that theywould need the teacher or teaching support assistant to provide them with that information. For some children, their only social interaction outside of the family was at school, so again parents felt that they did not hold the knowledge necessary to answer those questions. For a few children and young people, therewas a concern that the questions relating to social functioning at school may be dif cult for children and young people to answer truthfully: I know it's a bit anonymous but, it's anonymous but some people may still not want to put forward their opinion. Facilitator: And why do you think that might be? Because people may feel, the parents may think, oh actually they've got loads of friends, and they're probably a bit scared to say whether or not they have loads of friends. FGCY2 However, it also refl ected parents 'acknowledgement that they might hold a different perspective to that of their child. Some parents additionally felt that there might be a difference between their assessment of whether or not their child felt a certain way and their child 's lived experience. The example most commonly cited was around the concept of loneliness for children with autism: I can denitely say, yes, he seemed lonely to me. But has your child felt lonely? I haven't the foggiest.He's usually happiest on his own, so maybe he's not lonely. IP2 The same issue arose with questions relating to sleep and bathing, with parents feeling that theirassessment may differ to their children 's responses. Cognitive challenges Three main cognitive challenges were raised: (i) understanding the question, (ii) the recall period and (iii)feeling able to respond accurately and completely. For children and young people, the language used in the questionnaires was a barrier to understanding, as there were a number of words and phrases that participants did not understand: Some could be rewritten so it's a bit easier, because it's for a little kid to read it should be a bitmore simple. FGCY3 Parents also felt that some of the language used in the questionnaires was not accessible for young people. A number mentioned simple things such as the use of the words 'male 'and'female' , which they felt were less familiar words to their children.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 127\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.Children and young people felt that some questions asked them to make dif cult judgements that they were not sure how to answer, for instance about their relationships with others. They felt that they may not have all the information necessary to ll in the forms 'accurately ', or were not able to give a response: Have your parents treated you fairly, what do they mean by that, and what's that, it doesn't explainwhat that's got to do with your health, that could mean anything? ICY3 Parents worried that children with cognitive impairments would not understand some of the concepts they were being asked about, particularly that children with autism might have an overliteral interpretation of questions; one parent refl ected that, for her son, energy was all about 'kcals '(kilocalories), and he would not appreciate that he was being asked if he had felt energetic. Parents and children and young people repeatedly described questions as too vague or unclear. They were concerned that some questions were not speci c enough. Again, this was particularly an issue of concern for parents of children with autism: So if you are told that it's hard to pay attention in class, he would say no. If you say, Andrew, areyou paying attention to what you're meant to be paying attention to in class, that's an entirelydifferent thing. FGP3 Another concern was that some questions contained more than one possible answer. These weredescribed as vague; for example, the question on getting on well at school could be answered from the perspective of attainment, social interaction or behaving well in class. Children and young people were concerned with answering the question accurately but were unsure what factors they could include when deciding how to answer the question. They were uncertainties about how they should answer questions that related to activities that they could complete but only with assistance,and how 'non-health 'factors should in fluence their answers: Doesn't give option of non-health barriers. CYFG5 Yeah, but that's not by yourself then, is it, if you've got support? FGCY4 Parents also raised an issue about the difference that environment makes and the fact that a lot of timeand energy goes into adapting environments to ensure that they meet the needs of their children bothphysically and emotionally, but that this does not necessarily happen equally in every environment. This could, therefore, mean that the answer to 'have you felt sad 'or'have you felt lonely 'might refl ect something situation-speci c as opposed to a pervasive feeling: They could be happy at home, but they can be miserable in school if they've not got theright support. FGP4 The recall period was also queried. Parents suggested that 1 month was too long a period for youngpeople to refl ect on, and that they themselves would nd it challenging to be asked to remember back over the last week or month. They felt that children very much lived in the moment and should be asked about that day; however, they were also concerned that because functioning might fluctuate considerably, children might be asked on a particularly good or bad day, which then would not give an accurateQUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 128 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukreflection. Children and young people' s attitudes to the recall period were mixed, with no clear agreement about an appropriate time frame. Parents suggested that there were too many response options for young people but not quite enough for themselves. This was partly about a desire to be able to answer accurately and partly about a desire to be able to capture more nely graded improvements: In his case he's somewhere between, I don't know, two or three. IP1 Both parents and children and young people consistently wanted comment boxes so that they couldexplain why they were answering in the way that they were and provide greater details and context about their answers. Parents wanted to give a context to the answers relating to the fact that they had no expectation of some areas of functioning improving: It may be never, but it's OK for it to be never. FGP3 For children and young people, they felt that the tick-box format of the response mechanism did not givethem adequate opportunity to provide all the information they wanted to about the questions they were being asked, and why they had answered in the way they had: You haven't got space to put in a comment and I don't think that should be a compulsory part of it, but I think you should at least have that chance to comment on things and make yourself clear aboutwhat you're trying to say. IYP3 Many of the children and young people struggled to comprehend the complexity of the response options, despite the instructions provided in the questionnaire. This included the way the responses were set out, the language used and the format of the scales. The level of complexity meant that some participantswere unable to understand how they should use the response mechanism to answer the question: It's hard for me to walk more than one block, yes or no, I don't really get, it's hard for me to walk more, never, I don't understand that, they need to be more clearer. ICY2 The use of pictures, symbols and simple scales was consistently proposed by children and young people and parents as a means of making the forms more interesting and more accessible ( Figure 14 ). Encouraging completion of questionnaires The initial response to the appearance of the questionnaires was overwhelmingly negative; they were described as being too dry and formal ( Figures 15 and 16show some examples). Children and young people repeatedly compared them to exam papers and found this intimidating, and their comments written directly on the questionnaires strongly re flected this. Parents felt that the questionnaires aimed at children and young people needed to be more colourful and engaging but they also thought that moreshould be done to make them appealing to parents, describing them as looking 'very of cial'(FGP5).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 129\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

They argued that the forms needed to be more accessibly worded and more attractively designed: Each individual is different, so some people need help, some people just need pictures to let them understand what the question means. FGCY3 For some children with information-processing issues, parents indicated that the questionnaire would need to be presented in a format which allowed for one question to be shown at a time. Having an online or touch-pad version of the questionnaire was a popular suggestion for parents and children and young people. For young people, it was felt that this would enable one question to be FIGURE 14 Young people 's comments on PROM questionnaire (FGCY3).

Young people also expressed that they would feel more comfortable with a computerised version of the form as this is amedium that they spend a lot of time interacting with, and it would seem more fun and appealing than a paper version: They can express themselves into the computer . . . it's more easy because there's lots of new products going around, iPads and they can just click, it'd be easier for them. ICY2 Because [on paper] maybe you'd need someone to do it for you but if you're on the computer you can just sit down and do it yourself easier. FGCY2 I spend a lot of mine time on the computer so I'd be better at it really. FGCY5 Parents felt that, for them, a digitally presented questionnaire would enable them to have the best of bothworlds: a short, basic questionnaire which captured more detail where appropriate, but which allowed them to skip past those capacities that were irrelevant to their child. Discussion Key ndings Health outcomes Children and young people and parents viewed health outcomes as inter-related and with reference to a hierarchy. Participants clearly identi ed the contribution that 'foundation 'and'intermediary 'outcomes made to a smaller set of higher-level outcomes that they felt were most important to achieve in order to have a good quality of life. The outcomes that were mentioned more frequently in discussions were communication, mobility, pain, self-care, temperament, interpersonal relationships and interactions, community and social life, emotionalwell-being and gaining independence/future aspiration. The three that seemed to be consistently identi ed as higher-level outcomes by children and young people were interpersonal relationships and interactions, community and social life and emotional well-being. For parents, the three were community and social life, gaining independence/future aspiration and emotional well-being. While these higher-level outcomes might appear to fall outside the sole infl uence of health services, young people and parents focused on the way in which health services could contribute to them. For instance, the way continence is managed and the ef ciency with which wheelchairs and other equipment are provided and maintained impacts on the ability of children and young people to engage in social opportunities. Where children and young people 's priorities differed from those of parents, this seemed to be due to the impact of lived experience. So, for instance, children described pain as pervasive and impacting on many areas of life. For parents, pain was something that needed to be effectively managed, but they identi ed far fewer related outcomes. Conversely, the issues of self-care and future independence featured heavily for parents but less so for children and young people. It seemed that this re flected the impact on parentsDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 131\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The issue of lived or personal experience had wider implications for the research. Parents approached the outcomes discussion from a position informed by their own experiences, and were clear and open about prioritising those outcomes that were an issue for their child, and which they thought that the healthservices could and should be impacting on. They were, therefore, less likely to mention improvements infunctioning which they felt their child had no prospect of attaining; as a corollary for some parents the desired outcome was maintaining the level of functioning their child already had. This may explain why sleep did not emerge strongly in the analysis, although it is an area that has commonly been raised as a concern for this group of children. The topic of sleep did arise, but was not discussed extensively in most groups. Where children and young people needed little sleep, they weremore likely to see it as a bonus than as an issue, and saw lack of sleep as problematic only if it made them feel tired. For many parents, sleep was not an issue for their child. Parents of children with autism were particularly concerned about sleep. For these parents, it was likely to be identi ed as problematic only when children were younger or had challenging behaviour and, therefore, in situations where the fact thatthey were awake meant that they needed to be looked after. This meant that for those parents affected it was a huge issue, but the numbers affected were relatively small. This personal perspective also meant that the outcomes prioritised by parents might be affected by their experience of services. In the same way that they prioritised those outcomes that they felt were achievable, they prioritised those where they felt that the health service had underperformed and their child had lostout as a result. So, parents who felt let down by the physiotherapy service, in that their child has lost functional ability, or missed out on gaining it, would be more likely to identify musculoskeletal functioning and mobility as high on their list of desired outcomes than another parent whose child had the samecondition but who felt that they were getting the interventions or therapies they required. Feedback on questionnaires The examples of PROM questionnaires were felt to be dry in appearance, inaccessible and often negativein their use of language. Parents of children with profound dif culties could feel alienated from a set of questions that seemed far removed from their own child' s abilities. The questions were felt not to be appropriate for children with neurodisability without the additional option of comment boxes so thatparents could qualify their answers in relation to their child' s diagnosis, functioning and reasonable expectation of improvement. This was particularly the case for parents of children with autism, who wanted to be able to explain that their children might have a cognitive rather than a physical dif culty with aspects of physical functioning in terms of doing something safely or proportionately. While the shorter, more generic, questionnaires generally covered the types of areas that parents wanted to be covered, they felt that there were key areas of functioning missing and that the concepts andresponse mechanisms were too crude to capture useful information about improvements or deteriorationsin their child 's functioning. Even with the more detailed questionnaires, parents felt that because they conflated outcomes such as eating, bathing, dressing and toileting they did not allow them to accurately reflect their child 's ability. A number of parents identi ed a dif culty in having the right information to complete the questionnaire in instances where they felt that the school rather than they would hold that knowledge. Parents were alsouncomfortable in completing the questionnaire as their child' s proxy, feeling that this might lead to a very different assessment than if the child completed it themselves.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 132 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukBoth parents and children and young people wanted the forms to be designed in a more accessible and inviting way and to use tools such as emoticons, with which their children were familiar as communication aids, as response choices. The idea of presenting the questionnaire digitally was universally popular in that it would enable the form to be presented in a way that might work better for those with information-processing dif culties - presenting one question at a time -but would equally enable parents to have a more personalised questionnaire where areas of functioning relevant to their child might be expanded. Strengths and limitations A methodological strength of this research was the gathering of views of a wide range of young people and parents. Young people and parents were drawn from socioeconomically diverse backgrounds, and from areas around England. The participants also included young people with a range of conditions andwide levels of functional ability. We were successful in including children and young people with profound communication impairments using the Talking Mat framework. However, engaging with these children was resource intensive ,and time constraints meant that we were not able to explore their views about thePROM questionnaires. Nevertheless, the sample could not be considered comprehensive of all theconditions under the umbrella of neurodisability. This may impact on the omission of any key outcomes that might be more speci c and/or important for certain conditions; there may be different priorities for subgroups of children and young people, for instance those with acquired brain injuries. In this research, a major challenge was nding ways to focus on 'health outcomes ', which many participants found to be nebulous. For the majority, 'health outcomes 'was an abstract concept that required considerable explanation. Hence, we tended towards using posters and prompts that presented them with a series of outcome areas to explore in conversation. This approach may have affected the scope of the ideas that participants generated. Nevertheless, as a result of the introduction of a series ofgeneral and then more speci c topics to participants, they were able to explore outcomes areas through a structured and depersonalised conversation. The networks that CDC maintains provide an expedient means to enable a range of disabled young people and their parents to have their say on relevant matters. CDC routinely consults with parents and young people about their experiences of health care, public services and other salient issues. This open consultative approach may have been a distraction in some early parent focus groups. Once this wasidenti ed as an issue, strategies and changes to the topic guide were put in place to minimise this problem in later groups. Nevertheless, it was sometimes dif cult to steer some parents away from talking about their broad experiences of the health system. In contrast to the parents, children and young people werenot preoccupied with experience of services, but they were keen to stress the importance of being able to communicate with health professionals as an important factor on infl uencing their health. Data were coded at focus group rather than individual participant level and we did not seek to accuratelymap whether or not views had links to particular diagnoses in any systematic way. Rather, the approach was non-categorical, aside from the stand-out observations noted in the results. The views of parents and young people overlapped on some topics but there were also differences. There were almost certainly differences in the characteristics of the children and young people who participated compared with the children of participating parents. For instance, some of the children of the parents whotook part had profound cognitive impairments and challenging behavioural problems which are not represented in the young people 's data.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 133\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

This provides valuable information to clinicians and health commissioners in understanding what patients and their families want and expect from the health services. Presentation of the examples of PROMs determined that these do measure some of the key outcomes identi ed by children and young people and parents, but: ldo not capture all of the health concepts that participants see as important to measure lare not worded or presented accessibly for all children and young people affected by neurodisability ldo not enable parents and children and young people to capture more nely graded improvements and, therefore, may not capture improvements made by children with more severe and complex needs ldo not take into account cognitive dif culties with physical tasks and are therefore seen as unsuitable for many children with autism. Pragmatic approaches that might motivate children and young people to want to complete PROMquestionnaires were identi ed: lthe use of emoticons for response options laccessible wording and more colourful presentation lthe use of digital presentation.QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY NEURODISABILITY, AND PARENTS 134 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukChapter 6 Online Delphi survey with health professionals Aims and objectives The aim of the online Delphi survey was to ascertain what outcomes health professionals in England think are important for children and young people affected by neurodisability. The objectives were:1. to recruit a multidisciplinary group of health professionals working with children and young people affected by neurodisability in England, and retain their engagement over time 2. to identify the current health outcomes that health professionals routinely prioritise when working with children with neurodisability 3. to focus attention on health outcomes that can be assessed using PROMs as reported by children and young people, and on outcomes other than mortality and morbidities 4. to seek agreement broadly among health professionals on a suite of health outcomes which the NHS could view as important goals for children and young people affected by neurodisability. It became apparent that, as there was no agreement about what conditions constitute 'neurodisability ',i t would be helpful to clarify and agree a de nition. Consequently, a fth objective was: 5. to seek consensus on a de nition of neurodisability. Methods Recruitment and sampling We sought a multidisciplinary group of health professionals working with children and young people affected by neurodisability in England. The rationale for focusing on England, rather than UK-wide, was consistency with the qualitative research stream being conducted by the CDC with young people and parents in England, and mindfulness of any cultural differences that might exist in delivering healthservices in the devolved nations. The sample of health professionals was recruited initially through an invitation sent to the lead contact person at child development teams (CDTs) in England. The British Academy of Childhood Disability (BACD) maintains a national database of CDTs throughout the UK. On our behalf, following payment of an administrative fee, the BACD administrator e-mailed the lead person with a request to forward aninvitation to take part in the survey to a range of their professional colleagues. The administrator sent tworeminder e-mails. In a subsequent phase of purposive sampling, conducted in order to recruit representatives of professions underrepresented after our initial round of invitations, we approached the following professional societies with a request to forward invitations to their members: lAssociation of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists lAssociation for Mental Health lBritish Paediatric Association lBritish Society of Children 's Orthopaedic SurgeryDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 135\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Professionals volunteered to take part in the Delphi survey by identifying themselves to the research team using an online form. Volunteer professionals were asked to provide details of their profession, region ofEngland where they were employed and their e-mail address. Survey procedures Data were collected using several iterative rounds of an online Delphi survey, an established methodfor seeking consensus. 228Recommended procedures for conducting Delphi surveys were followed, including beginning with open questions before moving to more speci c closed questions, and retaining non-responders in future rounds.229In each round, participants were emailed a unique web-link to an online survey system. Participants who connected through the link were presented with a mix of open questions with free-text response boxes, or asked to rate their agreement with statements using four-point Likert response options: 'strongly disagree ','agree ','disagree 'and'strongly agree '. Non-responders were sent reminder e-mails, which included an option to withdraw from the survey. Question development Health outcomes In round 1, participants were invited to state, using free text, what aspects of health they tried to in fluence and/or improve when working with children and young people affected by neurodisability; examples ('improve communication ','reduce pain ', etc.) were provided in order to encourage respondents to be precise and to focus on outcomes. Participants were also asked to indicate if they used PROMs and, if so,to state which PROMs they used. In round 2, survey participants were presented with the list of aspects targeted by respondents in round 1, classi ed according to the WHO ICF-CY domains. Participants were invited to rate their agreement with the list as broadly covering health outcomes that the NHS should routinely assess for children and young people affected by neurodisability. They were also invited to suggest additional key aspects of health that they felt should be considered, although they were reminded that not all aspects of health couldbe included. Many respondents in round 1 stated the very general goals of 'improve general health 'or'improve quality of life '. In order to elicit more speci c outcomes in round 2, we asked them what they used as an indicator tond out whether or not things were going well for the child.ONLINE DELPHI SURVEY WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 136 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukIn round 3, participants were presented with a revised list and the rationale behind it. We removed two items, 'activity and participation 'and'body functioning ', as both are top-level concepts in the ICF-CY. Other modi cations were based on participants 'feedback, and also comments from parents, taking into account the following three criteria: lCan the aspect of health be measured validly and reliably using a questionnaire? lIs the aspect of health common to many children and across all ages? lCan a health service be expected to infl uence that problem? Participants were again invited to rate their agreement with the list as presenting appropriate NHS outcomes for children and young people affected by neurodisability. The candidate PROMs identi ed in the systematic review measure subtly different tenets of health, some of which distinguish 'functioning 'and'well-being '. Therefore, we also invited participants to comment on whether the NHS should target 'functioning ', as in what a child can do or does, and/or 'well-being ',a si n how children and young people feel about their health. In round 4, we focused on gathering professionals 'views on the aspects of health that were assessed by the candidate PROMs emerging in the systematic review. In total, 23 health-related concepts, representing different aspects of health, were selected and presented to participants. Respondents were asked to rateto what extent they thought the NHS should be responsible for these as health outcomes. Participants were also invited to volunteer for the consensus meeting. Definition of neurodisability An initial version of the de nition was drafted following discussion at the rst co-investigator meeting (November 2011), with input from parents. In each of the rst three rounds of the survey, participants were asked to rate their agreement with the de nition presented from 'strongly disagree 'to'strongly agree '. There was an opportunity to make comments and suggestions using free text. The level of agreement with the de nition in each round, and participants 'speci c feedback, was re flected upon by the team, and further iterations of the de nition were revised and tested. Once an acceptable de nition was achieved among the survey participants in this work, we sought an international perspective. An invitation and link to a survey was sent by e-mail to (i) the country leadsfor the European Academy of Childhood Disability, and (ii) International Collaborators of the CanChild Centre for Childhood Disability Research, McMaster University, ON, Canada. We invited a rating of agreement with the de nition from international colleagues, from 'strongly disagree 'to'strongly agree ', comments on the de nition, and details of any terms synonymous with neurodisability used in their other countries/languages. The full text of the questions employed in each of the four rounds is included in Appendix 8 ; in summary, questions in each round addressed: laspects of health that clinicians target (rounds 1 + 2) luse of PROMs in clinicians 'practices and indicators for 'well-being '(rounds 1 + 2) laspects of health that NHS should routinely assess (rounds 2 + 3) lappropriateness of constructs of health covered by candidate PROMs (round 4) ldenition of neurodisability (rounds 1 + 2 + 3). Analysis We used an a priori criterion of 67% approval (agree or strongly agree) to appraise whether or not statements were generally acceptable to participants.229Free-text responses were categorised and analysed thematically, with reference to the WHO ICF-CY where appropriate (by AJ in discussion with CM).DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 137\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Ethics Formal ethics approval is not required for research with health professionals in the NHS; however, the procedures for the Delphi survey were included in the study approved by NRES Committee North East - County Durham and Tees Valley (reference 11/NE/0364). Results Survey response In total, 309 health professionals registered their interest in participating in the Delphi survey; registrantsidenti ed themselves as being from a range of professions. Although we principally targeted English health professionals, there were 14 registrants who identi ed themselves as working outside England. Their views on the de nition of neurodisability were considered eligible and they were retained in the survey. However, participants from outside England were not included in the Delphi process for developingconsensus on an appropriate suite of health outcomes, in order to be consistent with the purpose of the research and data collected from families in England. Responses to all four rounds including only participants from England were, respectively, 233 out of 284 (82.0%), 232 out of 294 (78.9%), 227 out of 293 (77.5%) and 191 out of 292 (65.4%) (Figure 17 and Table 33 ). Responses to the rst three rounds that included iterations of the de nition, and participants from outside England, were, respectively, 245 out of 290 (84.4%), 242 out of 300 (80.6%) and 237 out of 297(79.7%) ( Figure 18 and Table 34 ). Consensus among professionals Health outcomes In response to the open-ended question in round 1, about which aspects of health professionals sought to influence and/or improve when working with neurodisability, we received 1524 suggestions from 233 respondents. Some respondents stated aspects of health in general terms, such as 'improve function ', 'maintain/improve comfort ','maintain/increase participation ','improve general health ','improve quality of life'and'help the child have fun '. Other respondents were more speci c, identifying targets such as 'improving upper and lower extremity use ','increasing ne motor skills (this includes dexterity, digit strength, manipulations) ','improving motor co-ordination 'and'improving gross motor skills: rolling, sitting, moving on the floor, crawling, standing, walking, running, jumping, co-ordination, balance, core stability, etc. '. All 1524 aspects of health were mapped to the WHO ICF-CY,35using the most detailed level of ICF coding possible. Together, as a group, respondents targeted aspects of health across all broad domains of the ICF-CY ( Figure 19 ). Some aspects of health were cited more frequently than others; aspects of health that were mentioned 20 times or more are highlighted ( Figure 20 ), although we did not assume that frequency denoted or equated to importance. Most (78.2%) respondents indicated that they were not using PROMs; of those who told us they did use PROMs, more frequently mentioned instruments were condition-speci c PROMs or mental health questionnaires (e.g. Strengths and Dif culties Questionnaire).ONLINE DELPHI SURVEY WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 138 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukOnline registration for Delphi on 17 July 2012 (n = 298) Round 1Response: 233/284 (82.0%) Send invitation for round 2 (n = 295)Late registration (n = 11) Round 2 Response: 232/294 (78.9%) Send invitation for round 3 (n = 294) Round 3Response: 227/293 (77.5%)Opted out(n outsideof England(n = 14) 4(n = 293) Round 4 Response: 191/292 (65.4%)Opted out (n = 1) FIGURE 17 Flow chart showing responses to the Delphi survey regarding health outcomes (rounds 1 -4), including only participants from England.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 139\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

In round 3, 209 (92%) agreed or strongly agreed with a revised list of aspects of health, based on feedback received from round 2 and input from parents ( Table 36 ). Further comments received regarded adding or changing examples, missing items that needed to be added, overlapping redundant items, and aspects of health that were not perceived to be infl uenced directly by NHS services. We considered that we had dealt with all arising issues by the end of round 3; suggestions had been either integrated into the list, or dismissed as ineligible if: lthey could not feasibly be measured using a self- or a parent-completed questionnaire lthey were not common to children with differing neurodisabilities, and across age groups lthey could not reasonably be expected to be infl uenced by the NHS. In terms of the precise focus for professionals regarding aspects of health, 212 (93.4%) indicated that they targeted 'functioning ', and 190 (83.7%) indicated that they targeted 'well-being ', suggesting considerable overlap in these goals. In round 4, respondents rated the following as being the greatest responsibility of the NHS: pain, hearing, seeing, vision, mobility, communication, manual ability, sleep and toileting. Those aspects of health thatwere rated as less the responsibility of the NHS were play, relationships with family, sport and leisure,learning and applying knowledge, and relationships with friends ( Table 37 ). Note that no aspects of health were rated as outside the responsibility of the NHS, taking into account the grouped responses. Inspection of mean scores within professions revealed some minor variations. The varying number of professionals in each group affects the overall mean scores.

However, there were a number of queries, comments and suggestions which informed revisions following each round. In round 1, participants raised queries about whether or not both congenital and acquired conditions were included, and requested that it be made more explicit that these were long-term conditions with a broad range of severity and complexity, some of which vary over time. Participants were keen for the wording tobe consistent with the WHO ICF-CY; hence, we added that the impairments created 'activity limitations '. In round 2, participants commented that the revised de nition was too long, the inclusion of examples was contested, and some participants were uncertain whether or not neuromuscular and sensory conditions were included. We retained the key concepts from round 2, namely a group of conditions, congenital or acquired, long term, variable, limiting, comorbidity, and including undiagnosed neurologicalconditions. Nevertheless, we revised the de nition to explicitly include neuromuscular conditions, andTABLE 37 Professionals 'ratings of NHS responsibility for aspects of health assessed by PROMs Aspect of health n Min.

There was broad endorsement of the version presented in round 3, with 93% of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing. However, in response to a direct question about including example conditions, 75% of respondents favoured their omission. Parents working with the team thought that the examples mayhelp some parents but also considered that they could be misleading, especially if a child' s actual diagnosis was not listed and/or was very different from the examples. Iterations of the de nition are provided in Appendix 9 .

There were indications that no terms were consistently used or widely agreed upon. The most common feedback from international colleagues was to use terminology consistent with the WHO ICF-CY.35 Thenal recommended de nition from this process was: Neurodisability describes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. A specic diagnosis may not be identied. Conditions may vary over time, occur alone or in combination, andinclude a broad range of severity and complexity. The impact may include difculties with movement,cognition, hearing and vision, communication, emotion and behaviour. Discussion Key ndings Consensus on key health outcomes Our iterative approach to seek consensus took account of the frequency with which key health outcomes were mentioned by participants, appropriateness of the concept as a NHS outcome, and the extent to which the NHS might in fluence the outcome. Those aspects of health that were rated by participants as most commonly targeted, and viewed as the responsibility of the NHS, were predominantly located in the WHO ICF-CY 'body functions and structures'- pain, hearing, seeing, sleep and toileting -or were those domains of 'activities and participation 'most readily in fluenced by provision of available assistive technologies: mobility and communication. Less frequently endorsed as the responsibility of the NHS,by consensus among participants, were play, relationships with family, sport and leisure, learning andapplying knowledge, and relationships with friends. Nevertheless, the WHO ICF-CY chapter titled 'Community, social and civic life: e.g. engaging in social clubs; recreation and leisure 'did appear in the list of outcomes as broadly endorsed as important. Arguably, some aspects of health could be deemed morbidities. Aspects of health such as seizures, stroke, constipation, incontinence, respiratory functioning, spasticity, muscle strength and power, and gait may bebetter measured by quantitative means rather than self-reported using questionnaires. The same could be argued about impairments of aspects of health such as seeing and hearing. We list below a summary selection of outcomes identi ed in the Delphi survey that would be likely to be amenable to self-reporting using PROMs: lmental moving around environments, making transfers between postures lself-care: independence in all activities of daily living (washing, toileting, dressing, eating) lsocial, e.g. engaging in social clubs; recreation and leisure. Many participants recognised that there were limitations to the extent to which they felt that the NHScould be responsible for aspects of health that are infl uenced by multiple environmental factors, especiallyDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 149\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Participants noted the need to discuss treatment and therapeutic goals with families and to negotiate priorities. In this way, perhaps, professionals are seeking to have at least some infl uence on those aspects of health more distal to health services 'sphere of direct in fluence; that is, in contrast to managing pain, which is clearly perceived as mostly a direct responsibility of health services. Definition of neurodisability Contributions from parents and professionals have helped to produce a de nition of neurodisability that appears to be clear and generally, if not universally, approved. The de nition will help to discriminate between children affected by neurodisability and those with other long-term conditions, such asimpairments of the endocrine, respiratory or musculoskeletal systems. Although children with such conditions share some characteristics with those affected by neurodisability, there are suf cient differences to make this an important distinction. Although there was large agreement with the de nition in the Delphi survey, with 93% of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing, there were a small number of people who disagreed. One reason for disagreeing was inconsistency with the ICF terminology. We addressed this to some extent in the nal version by using 'impairment 'in the rst sentence, but we preferred 'functional 'rather than 'activity ' limitations in the last sentence because of the broader interpretation of 'functioning ', although some inconsistency with the ICF remains. Nevertheless, we were reluctant to become 'instructive 'about ICF terminology at the expense of clarity. One could be critical of the lack of details regarding 'causality 'within the de nition, to which we would emphasise that our de nition is intended to be descriptive of a phenomenon, rather than an explanatory model. One could also suggest that there should be moreexplicit, detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, which we did debate. Ultimately, we prioritised producing a concise de nition that would be accessible by any of our intended users, many of whom would not be familiar with the ICF or medical terminology. It could be argued that nding a de nition of neurodisability is an issue parochial to the UK. However, our international survey identi ed that similar grouping of conditions is made commonly in other countries, but that terminology is applied inconsistently. We believe that there is a need for international consensus, as people with neurodisability represent a group with particular dif culties, who are often vulnerable and require advocacy. Therefore, it is important to be able to identify people with neurodisability in order tothen identify their needs, and the needs of their carers and families. Hence, working towards internationalagreement for a de nition is desirable, to improve clarity of communication to enable sharing of knowledge, experiences, and use of ndings from research. Strengths and limitations A strength of this study is the multidisciplinary and geographically diverse sample of people whoparticipated, comprising paediatricians, paediatric neurologists, paediatric surgeons and a wide range ofallied health professionals, all working with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Their views may or may not accurately represent the views of the broader population of health professionals. We recognise that our participants were the ones motivated to volunteer and take part in the study, whichmay mark them as different to their colleagues. Our sample was composed of mainly community and hospital-based professionals. Professionals working in CAHMS were represented in smaller proportions to some other professions, and may beunder-represented. We did not purposively seek to recruit any GPs; while their caseloads are varied, they and primary care would be expected to co-ordinate some aspects of health care for neurodisability. Therefore, a major methodological limitation is the unequal proportions of health professions represented. The professions of respondents will have infl uenced the frequency with which certain aspects of health were mentioned and endorsed in the survey. Hence, there is a risk that professions with large or small proportions of representatives will have biased the overall consensus. We could argue that theseONLINE DELPHI SURVEY WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS 150 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukproportions broadly represent the numbers of health professions who interact with families in paediatric neurodisability, with more paediatricians and therapists involved, while general audiologists and surgeons with a mixed child/adult caseload may see fewer children. However, such arguments are tenuous; werecognise the methodological limitation of our sample, without discounting the potential validity of their views. The online Delphi survey was an ef cient and economical means of gathering the views of a large number of health professionals. We sought to provide the opportunity to participate in the survey as widely as possible to as many different professions frequently involved in the health care of children and young people affected by neurodisability. However, our ability to contact and invite eligible professionals wasalways mediated through third-party organisations. Invitations were largely sent by e-mail; as health professionals receive large numbers of e-mails, they make rapid decisions about whether to respond to or delete non-essential communications. A particular challenge was the unexpected large-scale organisational change to NHS e-mail addresses that was wholly beyond our control. This meant that some of our invitations could not be delivered toparticipants who had volunteered to participate, and the security system within the proprietary onlinesurvey process then considered them as withdrawn. Considerable efforts were made to contact these professionals and register their new e-mail addresses. There does not appear to be any systematic bias with attrition; there were a small number of participants who actively withdrew during the course of thesurvey, and some non-responders to each round. We used the WHO ICF-CY terminology and de nitions to code the information on aspects of health that professionals provided, and then presented these ICF terms back to them without precise de nition. While no participants raised this as an issue, and there is increasing awareness of the ICF and related terminology, it is possible that professionals may have interpreted particular health outcome termsinconsistently. There were subjective judgements made in the process of coding in the Delphi survey, and we sought opportunities to con rm our interpretations in later consensus work. Summary We recruited a large multidisciplinary sample of health professionals working with children and young people affected by neurodisability. Over four rounds of an online Delphi survey, professionals identi ed the aspects of health that they targeted, and agreed broadly on a core set of domains that representappropriate outcomes for NHS care. Some of the aspects of health that professionals target areneurological symptoms, and outcomes in these domains are less amenable to being assessed by using PROMs. A subset of outcome domains was identi ed that may be more feasible to assess using PROMs. In addition, participants in the Delphi survey helped to develop a de nition of neurodisability, which was generally approved, and also broadly endorsed by a small number of international colleagues.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 151\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Furthermore, preceding research activities had gathered ample feedback on the questionnaire design and format. Therefore, the aim of this part ofthe research was to seek agreement between families and professionals on which aspects of health should be assessed as outcomes of NHS care. The objectives were: 1. to bring together a nominal group of various participants who had taken part in previous elements of the study 2. to provide a forum whereby the participants could discuss the health outcomes that were identi ed by young people, parents, health professionals, and from questionnaires 3. to observe whether or not the group could negotiate and agree on appropriate health outcomes to assess for children and young people affected by neurodisability. Methods The methodological rationale for the consensus meeting was to convene a representative group of relevant stakeholders, and to use an interactive exercise to enable participants to explore their various perspectives. The participants were a nominal group in terms of seeking consensus,230although we did not impose all the elements of conventional nominal groups; for instance, we did not ask participants to prepare statements and we did not impose a structure of ordering which participants could speak andwhen. The activity selected was a 'Q-sort '. The chief investigator had experience of this working well for prioritising outcomes in a separate NIHR-funded research study about outcomes for young children withautism. 231The sorting activity is one stage of Q Methodology,232originally developed by Stephenson.233 Q Methodology has its foundations in approaches to using factor analysis as means to identifying types ofpeople based on how they respond to cognitive tasks. 232We did not set out to apply the statistical methodology. Rather, we used the Q-sort task to observe the processes and discussions that the participants go through when prioritising the concepts of health outcomes we presented to them, in order to gain insight in to their various attitudes and beliefs. The Q-sort task we used seeks to forceparticipants to make a choice about ordering concepts on a grid; the result was a 'forced choice frequency distribution 'representing their views. We were interested to see whether or not the participants would be able to reach consensus within groups, and also to compare the results between the groups. Participants Participants were invited from those who had taken part in earlier components of the research. Youngpeople and parents who had taken part in focus groups or interviews were selected and approached bythe CDC. Health professionals were selected from those who had participated in all four rounds of the online Delphi survey, and a further selection was made to include a range of the different professions. Ideally, we sought to balance, broadly, the numbers of family and health professional representativeswho participated.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 153\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health was selected as the venue, being both fully accessible andconsistent with the ethos of the research. A meeting room was identi ed that was large enough for the number of participants, and allowed them to move around during the meeting, taking into account thatsome young people used powered wheelchairs. A separate meeting room was reserved to provide abreakout room for carers not participating in the meeting, and for anyone who wanted to use a quietspace away from the event. In advance of the meeting, a list of the health outcomes was compiled from those issues identi ed (i) from the qualitative research with children and young people and parents; (ii) through the online survey with health professionals; and (iii) from the content of eligible PROM questionnaires. Duplicates were identi ed and removed from the list ( Table 39 ). There was debate about several aspects of health, for example whether or not they were eligible as being 'morbidities '(e.g. seizures) or perceived as self-reportable by young people (e.g. safety). Thenal list of 33 'aspects of health 'or'health outcomes 'were then represented on laminated cards, with an illustration inspired by the signs from the Talking Mat system used with young people with communication dif culties in the qualitative research. There were some aspects of health that overlapped conceptually, but a decision was made to present these items individually and allow the participants todecide if they could be collapsed as a group concept. A Q-sort grid was created depicting a 'normal distribution 'of boxes matching the size of the cards; the grid encourages participants to rank fewer items at the margins of the grid than at the mid-range of the scale ( Figure 21 ). The scale identi ed the horizontal boxes as ranging from 'less important 'to'more important 'for the NHS to focus on. Participants were asked to discuss the aspects of health, and then allocate each concept to a different box on the grid based on their perception of the importance of theaspect of health as an outcome of NHS care. We emphasised that, while the scale was ordered byimportance, no item was being considered as unimportant. Procedures The meeting hosts and facilitators were four members of the research team (CM, AJ, AA and AF).Participants were welcomed informally on arrival at the venue. Once everyone had convened, the meeting began with all participants introducing themselves, and then the chief investigator (CM) described the background to the research, the scope of what was meant by health outcomes in this research andthe purpose of the meeting. Participants were invited to ask questions and request clari cation. The Q-sort activity was introduced and instructions explained, and again questions were invited.The meeting was then divided into two groups, prede ned by the organisers, which sought to mix young people with parents and professionals from different health specialities (see Appendix 10 ). Each group was facilitated by two of the organisers, who were able to provide clari cation about the concepts portrayed on the cards and encourage all participants to engage in the activity. The groups worked through the Q-sort exercise for 90 minutes at separate ends of the same large room, and then broke for lunch. The groups reconvened after lunch for 15 minutes to review their decisionsabout relative placements of cards on the grids. Finally, the groups came together to compare whichaspects of health had been prioritised, and make any nal comments. The small group discussions were audio recorded, but were not transcribed. The facilitators made writteneld notes of pertinent points made by participants, and also recorded the processes through which the groups negotiated discussions and decisions. Photographs were used to record processes and the positionsof cards on the grids.CONSENSUS MEETING 154 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukTABLE 39 List of aspects of health used in the prioritising exercise Cards depicting:Qualitative work with children and parents PROMsDelphi survey with health-careprofessionals Play Sport Independent Communication Memory Concentration Emotional well-being Fitness and stamina Breathing Learning Let me decide Muscle strength Moving my body Manipulating objects Moving about Pain Worried Personality/con dence and self-esteem Family Friends Hearing and seeing Self-care Eating nutrition Self-care hygiene Safety Sexual health Sleep Social life/go out Continence Education Drool, swallowing, constipation Body structures Control behaviour Change body position Note: the card depicting 'safety 'was not printed and, therefore, not used in the exercise.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 155\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Indeed, we were keenly aware that the task might not be completed, depending on how the groups functioned. Wewere conscious in advance that various factors might affect the way individuals representing different perspectives would interact in the group discussions. The facilitators debriefed immediately after the event, and subsequently shared their notes. Participants were e-mailed to thank them for their contribution, and a feedback form was included in order to gather any additional comments about their experience of the meeting. The report of the meeting and ndings was drafted by the chief investigator and modi ed and agreed by the facilitators. A summary version of the report was shared with participants, inviting feedback on both the representativeness of the report andthe meeting and activity. Ethics The consensus meeting was included in the procedures approved by NRES Committee North East -County Durham and Tees Valley (reference 11/NE/0364). Consent forms were not required for participation in theevent; signed consent forms were used to permit use of photographs of the event for dissemination purposes. Participants gave consent to be named in the report but were assured that they would not be identi ed with any speci c comments. Results There were 15 participants at the meeting: 3 young people affected by neurodisability, 5 parents and7 health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, 2 paediatricians, nurse, paediatric surgeon,child and adolescent psychiatrist); apologies were received from a speech and language therapist and anorthopaedic surgeon. Interpretation of the concepts The participants generally shared an understanding of most of the concepts presented, but there were several exceptions that required explanation and generated discussion. For example, 'family 'was explained as relationships with family members, but participants also raised the importance of family roles and taking part in family activities. 'Education 'was explained as being involved in school and education, but created debate about the extent to which the NHS could be expected to have infl uence on school life, and certainly not on academic performance.FIGURE 21 Q-sort grid shape used to create forced choice distribution.CONSENSUS MEETING 156 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukParticipants thought that some concepts were not easy to distinguish from each other and, therefore, found them dif cult to separate for prioritisation. For instance, both groups linked the concepts of ','self-con dence 'and'worry ', and were also made between 'tness and stamina 'and'muscle strength ', and 'change body position 'with 'moving my body '. Queries were raised regarding whether or not it was realistic to assess some of the concepts using questionnaires. Approaches to prioritisation Various issues arose in the process of prioritising concepts as an important focus for the NHS. Participants recognised some concepts as being more readily infl uenced by health services. They distinguished other concepts as broader 'life outcomes 'that would be in fluenced by many factors. Physical outcomes were perceived as more amenable for health services to infl uence, including 'pain','communication' , 'continence 'and'moving my body '. Broader life outcomes that might be harder for health services to influence included 'emotional well-being ','making decisions ','friends ','family ','social about what constitutes 'the NHS 'and health services for children and young people affected by neurodisability, particularly as integration of health services with education and social care iscommonly pursued. There was also debate about how the concepts might be prioritised variously, depending on how the children and young people are conceptualised. For instance, 'sport 'was suggested as being more important for older children; it was suggested that 'continence 'might be more of a priority for some people, and 'worry 'might be more of a focus for people with mental health issues. Participants also asked whether or not comparisons with children and young people without neurodisability might be relevant. The groups engaged well with the task, but most found the task challenging. More discussion focused on how to arrange the 'most important 'half of the grid than concerned the 'least important 'items. Health outcomes placed towards the least important columns generally remained xed after placement, and did not generate much discussion. Group dynamics during the task Participants represented views grounded in their individual social roles, informed by their personal experiences. There were differences between the focuses of different professions. Some participants digressed from the task; professionals were prone to raise service issues such as commissioning targets andthe reorganisation of the NHS, and parents raised service user issues about the adequacy and access to services. Nevertheless, discussion was generally cordial and respectful and there was no evident disagreement between parents and health professionals. The group was supportive of the young peopletaking part; however, one young person chose not to engage with the activity as he found the social nature of the task challenging. One facilitator had a sense that the group was reluctant to challenge decisions proposed by the young people, and that a change may have taken place after the break whenthe group had forgotten that it was the young person who had originally placed that card. Prioritised health outcomes As expected, there was variation between the priorities selected by each group ( Figures 22 and 23); however, certain health outcomes were common higher priorities selected by both groups. Among concepts ranked as more important in both groups were: lcommunication lemotional well-being.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 157\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

Otherwise, there was little overall consistency between the groups; some concepts, for example 'control behaviour ', were ranked at opposing ends of the framework. The differences are largely explained by understanding the varying approaches each group took to the ranking, and the stage that discussions had reached when the session ceased. Feedback from participants General feedback was that participants enjoyed the event and the opportunity to hear differentperspectives and felt able to express their views. Feedback on the activity speci cally indicated some difculties in dealing with and ranking the large number of concepts that were presented. One parent suggested that it was a pity nobody from the Department of Health was present to hear theviews expressed.

Others argued that the novel aspect of the consensus meeting was that it was the only time in the research when family and professional representatives of the participants would interact together to discuss and debate the issues. The event appeared to be highly valued by the participants as an opportunity to be actively engaged in the project, and their contribution was certainly informative. Bringing young people, parentsand professionals together provided insight into factors likely to enable further development from the emergent ndings. The meeting was only feasible to arrange as a one-day event, which limited what could be achieved. The group were, for the most part, able to work together in pursuance of a common purpose, guided by the facilitators. The purpose of the event, composition of participants, motivation of the participants, the location and room environment, and the Q-sort activity all appeared to provide conditions that wereconducive to addressing a challenging problem in a collaborative way. All 'small groups 'have to nd their own way to work together, and not all small groups succeed. We were not aware of any overt individualor role power imbalances among participants that might have affected overall group decision-making. Twoof the three young people appeared to nd it easy to integrate with their small groups. Unfortunately, one of the young people found the experience overwhelming, and withdrew; this was probably in relationto the social aspects of the exercise, and could have been anticipated and accommodated withfurther preparation. The cognitive task was made challenging by the large number of concepts that participants had to understand, recall and rank. It has long been recognised that people nd it dif cult to discern more than a handful of categories in any reliable way. 235It may have been helpful to carry out a preliminary grouping of the concepts, and/or include a stage to see whether or not some concepts could have been eliminatedprior to moving to the ranking Q-sort task. Having gained experience with the Q-sort, and using a smallernumber of concepts, it may be useful to structure the sorting exercise as a series of separate activities, each using a speci c case study. This could reduce the number of variables that arose in discussions, such as age and problems associated with different diagnoses. In addition, some constructs may have appeared similar, despite being conceptually distinct in terms of ICF terminology and de nitions.CONSENSUS MEETING 160 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukSummary A small group of young people, parents and health professionals who had taken part in previous elements of the study participated in a consensus meeting. An interactive Q-sort activity was used to promote discussion and encourage a prioritisation of the various health outcomes that had emerged from the research. There appeared to be broad agreement on a group of more important outcomes for childrenand young people affected by neurodisability.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 161\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

We also convened a consensus meeting to bring together young people affected by neurodisability, parents and health professionals to seek agreement on key health outcomes. The WHO ICF was used as a means to code health outcomes and, hence, connect ndings emerging from different aspects of the research.At the outset of the research there was no agreed de nition of neurodisability. Hence, we also took the opportunity to address the lack of an agreed de nition of neurodisability, using the Delphi survey and involvement of parents working with the research team. Denition of neurodisability It is clearly crucial to know which children and young people are being considered in this research, in terms of inclusion in the various studies and the inferences of the ndings. An unanticipated element of this research was de ning 'neurodisability '. The term is commonly used to describe a group of children or subspecialty of paediatrics, particularly in the UK; neurodevelopmental disorders or conditions and other terms are used in the same context in other English-speaking countries. Nevertheless, there appeared to be no accepted de nition of any of these terms. Therefore, early in the detailed planning of the research, we sought to develop and seek agreement on a de nition of neurodisability. Using contributions from health professionals participating in the rst three rounds of the online Delphi survey, and incorporating the views of a small group of parents involved with the research team, we produced a de nition of neurodisability. We also sought international perspectives on the resulting denition using networks of colleagues. The following de nition was approved generally, if not universally: Neurodisability describes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. A specic diagnosis may not be identied. Conditions may vary over time, occur alone or in combination, and include a broad range of severity and complexity. The impact may include difculties with movement,cognition, hearing and vision, communication, emotion and behaviour. This de nition will help to identify children and young people affected by neurodisability, and may be useful in discriminating them from others with different long-term conditions, such as impairments of the endocrine, respiratory or musculoskeletal systems. Although children with such disabling conditions share characteristics with those affected by neurodisability, there are suf cient differences to make this an important and useful distinction, both in this and other research, and also in health services design, auditand evaluation.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 163\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

We carried out focus groups and interviews with both children and young people affected by neurodisability, and separately also with parents. Children, young people and parents viewed health outcomes as inter-related and with reference to a hierarchy. Participants identi ed clearly the contribution that foundation and intermediary outcomes made to a smaller set of higher-level outcomes that they felt were most important to achieve in order to have a good quality of life. Health outcomes that were highlighted more frequently by young people and parents were communication, mobility, pain, self-care, temperament, interpersonal relationships and interactions, community and social life, emotional well-being, and gaining independence/future aspirations. Someparents were also particularly concerned with sleep and/or behavioural problems. In terms of hierarchy, children and young people identi ed interpersonal relationships and interactions, community and social life and emotional well-being; parents identi ed community and social life, gaining independence/future aspiration and emotional well-being. We also sought to ascertain what outcomes of NHS care health professionals considered important for children and young people affected by neurodisability, through four rounds of the online Delphi survey.Professionals identi ed targeting aspects of health across the spectrum of WHO ICF-CY. In the domains of 'body functions and structures ', goals targeted pain, hearing, seeing, mental health, sleep and toileting; in 'activities and participation ', goals targeted mobility, communication, manual ability, self-care and social activities. Professionals also identi ed seeking to improve emotional functioning and well-being. Some aspects of health that professionals indicated they target were speci c neurological symptoms: seizures, stroke, spasticity, constipation or incontinence, breathing problems, vision and hearing loss, musclestrength and gait. Some of these health issues could be considered as measures of 'morbidity and or mortality' , which were excluded from our scope, as these are captured in other ways and less amenable to self-report using generic PROMs. Young people, parents and professionals all recognised that health services infl uence each of the outcomes to varying degrees. Although they recognised their importance as outcomes, professionals suggested that health services were less able to infl uence play, relationships with family and with friends, sport and leisure, learning and applying knowledge. Young people and parents also recognised that health services could play less of a role in infl uencing some valued higher-level outcomes, but considered that appropriate and adequate core health services provision was crucial to achieving in these outcome domains. We sought consensus among young people, parents and professionals on what aspects of health might be important to assess as outcomes of NHS care. The aspects of health and outcomes identi ed by the systematic review, qualitative research and Delphi survey were aggregated and presented to a nominalgroup of young people, parents and professionals. The consensus meeting appeared to identify severalstronger candidates for health outcomes for children and young people affected by neurodisability:communication, emotional well-being, pain, sleep, mobility, independence and worry. Thus, there does appear to be some consistency among young people, parents and professionals regarding an emerging suite of more important health outcomes: lcommunication lemotional well-being health lsocial activities lsleep. A further subset that parents rated as important, and professionals also identi ed were: lbehaviour ltoileting lsafety. One cautionary note concerns how these terms are de ned, and operationalised in the context of measurement. We used WHO terminology consistently within each aspect of this research, and also to provide a framework to link ndings from different parts of the research. We have recognised earlier in the report that there are elements of subjectivity in the process of coding and prioritising outcomes. However, we point to original quotes from participants in the qualitative chapter, and the iterative process of the Delphi survey and participants at the consensus meeting support the internal validity of our ndings. Candidate patient-reported outcome measures We sought to identify all generic PROMs for children and young people, and then sought evidence from peer-reviewed publications describing studies conducted to evaluate the psychometric performance of PROMs when using English-language versions of the questionnaires. We separately appraised instrumentsthat were generic (meant to be suitable for all children), chronic-generic (intended for to be suitable for children with health conditions), or PBMs. We also considered evidence separately depending on whether the research had been conducted with general populations or with children and young people affectedby neurodisability. We identi ed 41 potentially eligible PROMs, and identi ed 126 papers that reported evidence of the psychometric performance of 25 PROMs using English-language versions. Twelve candidate PROMs were selected as having more favourable evidence regarding their psychometric performance. Robust evidence was lacking in one or more respects to support the psychometric properties for all candidate PROMs appraised in this review, both in general populations and with children and young people affected byneurodisability. No evidence was found to support the responsiveness of any of the candidate PROMs to detect meaningful change in either general population or neurodisability. We identi ed those aspects of health assessed by candidate generic PROMs through the systematic review, and coded these pragmatically using the WHO ICF-CY. Each PROM questionnaire assesses a range of constructs, but each does so in a slightly different way. The most notable difference was in how somePROM questions assess functioning as what people do, or can do, and other questions assess well-being as how people feel about their health. A few PROMs focus predominantly on either functioning or well-being, but all of our candidate PROMs con flated these concepts. As with our previous note on dening outcomes above, it is necessary to audit closely how the constructs measured by PROMs are dened, and whether or not these are consistent with the style and context of the questions being asked. For children aged 8 to 18 years, there is favourable psychometric evidence for the KIDSCREEN, includingRasch analysis in general populations, and for the KIDSCREEN-52 with children with cerebral palsy. The Healthy Pathways is a promising instrument with some good evidence in favour, including from Rasch analysis; however, only two recent papers are published. The DISABKIDS was the only eligiblechronic-generic instrument for which favourable evidence was found of psychometric performance in children and young people affected by chronic conditions, including neurodisability. The version of DISABKIDS Smileys-6, aimed at children 4 to 7 years old, was the only competitive candidate PROM toutilise emoticons in the response options. This was something preferred by children, young people andDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 165\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The PedsQL and KINDL have versions to include younger children, but evidence for their psychometric robustness is weaker. The CHU-9D emerged as the PBM that has been evaluated more extensively, with some limited evidence in favour. However, the CHU-9D has not beentested with children and young people affected by neurodisability. The fact that some newer PROMs have been subjected to greater methodological scrutiny, and thus more robust psychometric evidence, probably re flects the emerging awareness of higher standards required for scale development and methods for psychometric evaluation. The ability of developers of PROMs to fund research generally drives evaluation of the instruments. Hence, the lack of robust evidence for some older measures may be an artefact of the research process rather than mean that some scales perform poorlyper se. Some older PROMs have become more established by frequency of use in research, even though robust psychometric evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, one can only make decisions based on the available evidence. There remains much scope for research to evaluate generic PROMs, particularly testing iteminvariance across neurodisability conditions, and responsiveness of PROM scores to meaningful change. The selection of any instrument should be consistent with the purpose of measurement and psychometric properties; nevertheless, the questionnaire must have face validity to potential respondents. There appearsonly partial overlap between the suite of key outcomes identi ed by young people, parents and professionals, and the content assessed by more competitive candidate PROMs. Looking broadly atWHO ICF-CY domains, each of these PROMs appears to assess some aspects prioritised; notably, though,communication is not represented in any of these PROMs, and mobility is tainted by a focus on walking/running rather than 'moving around ', which, if more broadly conceived, would include use of assistive technology. We presented examples of four commonly used PROM questionnaires as part of the qualitative research. General feedback on the questionnaires suggested poor face validity for using these to measure NHS care.Even though many questions were felt to be relevant, other key outcomes were identi ed as missing. In addition, participants disliked questions that were perceived as negatively phrased, verifying whatcolleagues had previously proposed. 17Response options were not perceived to re flect the health of children and young people affected by neurodisability appropriately, nor were they perceived likely tocapture salient improvement or deterioration. The exemplar questionnaires we used were chosen as more commonly used instruments, and feedback may not re flect across all PROMs. Nor did we seek speci c feedback on the PROMs individually, as they were simply conversation aids. Careful cognitive interviewing should be undertaken with children, young people and parents to examine the face validity of any candidate instruments before selecting any PROMs. Key issues to consider are thecontent assessed, appropriate phrasing of questions, whether or not the proffered response options are likely to capture differences or changes in health that are meaningful and realistic for the population being studied, and length of questionnaire. Our qualitative research identi ed that some questions present cognitive challenges that young people and parents felt made responding dif cult. Scale developers could do more work to ensure that such problems do not present, and those considering using PROMs inresearch or other contexts may want to pilot speci c questionnaires for themselves. Parents identi ed discomfort in being able to respond to some questions as their child' s proxy, particularly about emotional domains and about activities that take place away from them, such as at school and withfriends. Hence, there may be consideration as to whether or not these questions should be asked ofparents, especially as ample evidence identi ed in this review suggests strongly that proxy reporting is statistically unreliable. Parents may be required to report on behalf of those children who do not have thecognitive capacity to respond, but the questions parents are asked should re flect issues about which they feel able to respond. There were some outcomes that parents felt were more important to assess than did children and young people, including toileting, behaviour and safety, probably re flecting their roles as carers. These may be important outcomes to include in 'parent 'reported instruments, but less relevant to include in self-reported questionnaires for children and young people.SYNTHESIS OF FINDINGS 166 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukImplications for health services The Department of Health continues to pursue a commitment to a focus on outcomes. The NHS Outcomes Framework 2010 -11,20cited in our original proposal, has progressed to the NHS Outcomes Framework 2013 -14.236Allied work has produced the Public Health Outcomes Framework.237There remains a commitment to assess the HRQoL of people with long-term conditions as part of the NHS Framework;236 presumably, this would include children and young people affected by neurodisability. A recent consultation commissioned by the Department of Health was the Children and Young People 's Health Outcomes Forum; this pertained to all children and young people, not only those affected by neurodisability. The forum recommended 'speci c outcome measures and indicators for the very wide variety of illnesses and conditions of children and young people including where appropriate patientrated outcomes '(p. 12). 238The Department of Health 's response does not appear to address this recommendation directly; nevertheless, such a commitment is integral to the NHS Outcomes Framework.236 Thus, there appears to be a strong case for further research to address both the technical measurementissues and the potential barriers to the implementation of PROMs as routine outcome indicators fordisabled children. Existing PROMs would need to be re ned if they were to cover comprehensively the key outcomes that the children and young people with neurodisability, parents, and professionals ranked as appropriate and important. To move from the themes we identi ed to questionnaire items would be a natural next step in PROM development; this would require agreement on how to de ne the concepts, and further research with families and professionals. Research would also ensure that the questions and response optionshave face validity, and that the resulting measurements are robust across the range of standard psychometric properties. One strategy could be to consider a battery of condition-speci c PROMs, as usually these might include items thought to be more relevant to people with particular diagnoses. Such instruments have been developed for several conditions including epilepsy and cerebral palsy; however, this approach wouldisolate children and young people with rarer forms of neurodisability, and exclude those children withoutany diagnostic label. Having identi ed several key domains as part of this research, another approach could be to critically review existing 'domain-speci c'instruments for each of these as discrete outcomes. More recent psychometric approaches, using Rasch analysis, allow for the co-calibration of 'banks of items ' and scales from condition-speci c, domain-speci c and generic instruments which measure the same construct. Thus, in future, a carefully designed and integrated approach might emerge that offersinclusivity, flexibility and choice to young people. This has been the strategy adopted in the USA by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System initiative, funded by the National Institutesof Health. In fact, one potentially eligible instrument under development as part of this project was notidenti ed or appraised in our review. The Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) measurement system was initially devised for adults but, more recently, a children 's version has been proposed. 239Notably, there is only partial coverage of the key domains proposed by our research in the content of Neuro-QOL, and examination of included items suggests there may be similar problems withface validity identi ed with other PROMs. The response by the Department of Health to the Children and Young People 's Health Outcomes Forum does focus on children and young people' s experiences of care. There is an important distinction between the health outcome constructs assessed by PROMs and those issues assessed by patient-reportedexperience measures (PREMs), and the two must not be confl ated. The development and appraisal of PREMs, to assess how health services are experienced, for example in terms of whether or not professionals were respectful and supportive, waiting times and so forth, is a separate though related line of enquiry, evaluation and research. In fact, there was considerable confusion about what exactly the term'outcomes 'meant to participants in this research. Everyone wants to improve outcomes for children andDOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 167\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

The Children and Young People 's Health Outcomes Forum also recommended that outcomes for children and young people be considered in 5-year age bands, and the Department of Health 's response was broadly af rmative: 'all data will be presented in 5 year age bands up to 25 to enable effective transition to be monitored' [with caveat] 'where technically feasible and statistically robust '(p. 13).240This raises important considerations: whether or not the health outcomes assessed should be different for these agecategories, whether or not questionnaires should be formatted differently, or whether or not it is the presentation of the data within each age bands that is most important. The upper age categories of15-20 years and 20 -25 years also introduce a complexity that was not addressed in this research, as our systematic review focused on PROMs for children and young people < 18 years of age. There is scope for health services policy to address how health outcomes should be measured for disabled young adults between 18 and 25 years, for instance whether or not it is sensible to leap to the constructs assessed by adult PROMs, such as the Short Form Questionnaire-36 items and/or the EQ-5D. There is alsoan emerging classi cation of PROMs speci cally for young adults. Alternatively, one could consider using the concepts identi ed in this research, and test the appropriateness of extending the age range of existing candidate PROMs for young people to 20 or 25 years, as part of work to evaluate otherpsychometric properties. There is widespread recognition of the need for attention to supporting transitionbetween child and adult services, though practice remains inconsistent. Assessing outcomes with a common metric through these age bands would seem to offer advantages in terms of monitoring and evaluation of services. There is political momentum for integrating educational, health and social care services for disabled young adults. As part of the Children and Families Bill, 241legislation will introduce 'Education, Health and Care Plans 'for students with special educational needs, which will include many children and young people affected by neurodisability. The government has stated that these plans will be clearly focused on bothshort and long term outcomes that are important to the child and their family, across education health andsocial care, and services will be expected to work together to achieve these outcomes. In addition, theemerging roles of paediatric public health services, to be delivered in the community by local authorities rather than the conventional NHS, are an example of where the traditional boundaries of the NHS are becoming blurred. This creates further complexity to outcome measurement and monitoring: does it make sense to seek to measure NHS outcomes as distinct from integrated cross-sector outcomes? Many health professionals inour research felt that there were limitations to the extent to which the NHS (as they perceived it) could be responsible for more distal aspects of health infl uenced by multiple environmental factors, including social interventions that they regarded as social care. From the perspectives of families of children and young people with neurodisability, who receive support from a range of public services, partitioning NHS outcomes from those of other services may lack credibility. Increasingly, integrated education, health and social care services are promoted as likely to be more family centred and ef cient. Although this research did not nd adequate evidence of psychometric performance for any particular PROM, we did identify a number of issues that might be worth considering as part of any implementationof a PROMs strategy with disabled children and young people. First and foremost, there are importantcontextual factors to consider; families are all too familiar with completing various questionnaires and forms to apply for entitlements, and may be suspicious that data from the questionnaires will affect service provision and other support. Therefore, it would be advisable to provide transparent information abouthow information will be used, in order that reliable and complete information can be gathered. We also identi ed several other factors that might be likely to encourage participation in completing questionnaires to maximise response. Nevertheless, our research also identi ed that young people and parents often disliked aspects of the exemplar questionnaires. This was especially the case when the wording of theSYNTHESIS OF FINDINGS 168 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukquestions and response options did not allow them to express accurately the information they wanted to convey. This is a challenge for the implementation of PROMs in this context and probably also for other long-term conditions. Children, young people and parents in our qualitative research would prefer questionnaires to be designed in more accessible formats; there were suggestions that standard paper versions looked like 'exam papers '. Electronic administration using computers appeared to be popular, especially if the administration could beindividualised in some ways; personalised PROMs that are re flexive to responses and hence explore the most relevant areas of functioning are likely to be better received. Electronic formats that enable childrenwith communication dif culties to participate seem entirely fair, and feasible. Our qualitative research included children with profound communication dif culties who, given appropriate time and support, were able to express clearly their views on important health outcomes. Therefore, adequate planning shouldenable these children to participate in self-completing PROMs, and some young people may needpersonal assistance. Our review included evaluations only of English-language versions of PROMs; hence, there may potentially be an accessibility issue for people for whom English is not their rst language. Current policy using PROMs in the NHS appears to offer telephone support rather than providing alternative language versions. If alternative language versions were to be considered, then recommended guidance for evaluating translations indicates that this would require substantial work. 242,243 One nal implication for health services policy concerns the recommendation in the report by Sir Ian Kennedy that a common vision needs to be developed of what health services are trying to achieve forchildren and young people. This research has identi ed a suite of key health outcomes that appeared to be shared as important by young people, parents and professionals. Identifying these health outcomesmay present an incremental step towards developing a common vision, although further work is requiredto ensure that these are shared more widely, and agreed by stakeholders who were not represented in the research, particularly those responsible for commissioning health services. Our consensus meeting showed that young people, parents and professionals could be brought together and work together collaboratively, given that there is appropriate motivation, environment and support. Furthermore, the opportunity to participate in the consensus meeting appeared to be highly valued by the participants. This approach would seem a valuable and important opportunity to be seized, at a nationallevel in the rst instance, and then locally. Involving service users in designing services is already widely encouraged in the NHS; nevertheless, this opportunity may still fall within the remit of health servicesresearch, as facilitation requires an appreciation of the complexity of the various social roles of thestakeholders, and negotiating the varying priorities of the participants. Such strategies require broad support from all the health professions, who want to see how individual, as well as combined, therapeutic contributions in fluence the shared vision and goals. If the shared vision is too distal and removed from the day-to-day activities of health professionals, then the vision will lackcredibility and not be wholly shared. This issue will be particularly pertinent for professionals involved inhospital settings, who may be more focused on managing acute or chronic neurological symptoms. Therecould be a role for widespread consultation with relevant professional bodies regarding a core set of goals. Thendings from this research substantively inform what outcomes health services might seek to achieve for children and young people with neurodisability, and selection of PROMs for the NHS Outcomes Framework. Furthermore, we have identi ed several factors that could be considered in terms of implementing routine use of PROMs with disabled children, with respect to contextual issues, format and administration. A summary of the implications for health services emerging from the evidence in this study is shown inBox 6 .DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 169\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

First, there is scope for studies to build further consensus around the suite of key outcomes identi ed in this research. Such work could replicate the consensus meeting on a larger scale and more nationally, and include a wider range of stakeholders including those responsible for commissioning services and potentially representatives of professional societies. Bringing together young people with neurodisability, health professionals, and those responsible for services might lead us further towards the shared vision ofwhat the NHS should be seeking to achieve for these children and young people. The content of what is assessed by PROM questionnaires needs to closely match this vision, or at least the component domains. Thus, the constructs, items and response options used in PROM questionnaires should be re ned to ensure that they match purpose of measurement, and have face validity to respondents. This might be achieved through cognitive interviewing with a diverse range of potential respondents, using the more promising PROMs as a starting point. It may be necessary to add domains tocover key outcomes such as communication. Using reports of parents and carers as proxies for outcomes designed to be measured from the perspectives of children and young people appears wholly unsatisfactory. However, there will always be children and young people who do not have the developmental cognitive capacity to self-report, and it is usually parents and carers who seek health care for their children. Therefore, parent-report probably canprovide important insights. Nevertheless, we advocate that the appropriate content of a parent questionnaire should differ from the children and young people 's version. Parent questionnaires should assess items and concepts that are important to parents, and in ways that parents feel they can respond accurately. The potential for a proxy-reported PROM, but based on the domains of more importance toparents, would seem a promising line of enquiry for research.BOX 6 Implications for health services Evidence from this research suggests that: lChildren and young people with a wide range of neurodisabilities can contribute their views on what they believe are important health issues for them, and these do not always concur with parents 'views. lYoung people, parents and professionals agreed generally on a suite of more important health outcomes. lNone of the current PROM questionnaires adequately captures all of the key important constructs. lYoung people, parents and professionals do not always readily understand or interpret 'health outcomes ' in the same way. lThe purpose of measuring health outcomes using PROM questionnaires should be explained clearly and transparently. lAppropriate consideration to administration and p resentation of PROM questionnaires would enable more young people to self-report their health. lCurrent questionnaires may not have face validity to potential respondents. lThe appropriate age range and categories for measuring health outcomes is a key consideration. lThe feasibility and utility of measuring outcomes for the NHS and/or other public health, social care and education services merits consideration.SYNTHESIS OF FINDINGS 170 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukAlthough some children do not have the cognitive capacity to complete PROM questionnaire themselves, this should not be readily assumed. Many children with moderate intellectual delay and/or communication impairments will be able to self-report their health if provided with appropriate technology, time andsupport. Research could pilot practical methods for ensuring that all children who could self-report their health are not excluded as a result of design and administration processes and procedures. Finally, providing that a candidate PROM could be produced that appropriately captures content representing the purpose of measurement, that is to say the 'right outcomes ', and that the questionnaire has face validity and is acceptable to respondents, it should be tested. Such evaluation might be ashort-term longitudinal study with children and young people with a range of diagnoses, with perhaps 6to 12 months 'follow-up for each subject. This research could assess the extent of any item invariance across different neurodisability conditions and age groups, and also determine the magnitude ofmeaningful differences in scores, or change in scores. A summary of the implications for research emerging from the evidence in this study is shown in Box 7 . Summary This research involved a comprehensive systematic review of generic PROMs; qualitative research with a diverse group of children and young people affected by neurodisability, and parents; and an online Delphi survey with a multidisciplinary group of health professionals. The ndings would appear to substantively inform the NHS regarding what health services might seek to achieve, and inform selection of PROMs for the NHS Outcomes Framework . Furthermore, we have identi ed several key factors that might be considered in terms of implementing routine use of PROMs with disabled children and their families. BOX 7 Implications for research Evidence from this research suggests that: lFurther research to build consensus between famili es and professionals on a s h a r e dv i s i o nf o rh e a l t h services for neurodisability would be bene cial. lThere is potential to devise separate PROM questionnaires for young people and parents, capturing their different priorities for health outcomes. lGeneric and/or chronic-generic PROMs require re nement in order to capture all key important health outcomes for neurodisability. lCognitive interviewing with young people with neur odisability and parents would help to improve the face validity of questions and response options. lFormats for administering PROMs with children and y oung people that are that are inclusive, attractive and expedient should be tested. lThe extent of any item invariance across differe nt neurodisability conditions and age groups should be assessed in well-designed studies. lThe size of meaningful change or difference in PROM scores needs to be determined in well-designed studies.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 171\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

If you disagree, please use the free-text box belowto add any missing health aspects. It would be helpful to argue your choice using the above mentioned inclusion criteria. lWe are looking for a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for children and young people to assess NHS care. Your feedback on the aspects of health you focus on as a clinician has triggered discussion about whether, in your view, health care should target functioning and/or well-being. Option A, functioning, as in what children and young people can do. Option B, well-being, as in howchildren and young people feel about their health. (Participants could tick both options.) Participants were presented with two revised versions of the de nition: one with and one without exemplar conditions. Please indicate below to what extent you agree with this revised de nition? Additionally, they were asked to choose which one they preferred (only one option possible).APPENDIX 8 218 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukRound 4 This research considers what outcomes of NHS care should be measured for children affected by neurodisability.

This may, for example, result in predominantly physical dif culties (such as cerebral palsy), learning and communication dif culties (such as autism), or other medical conditions (such as the problems associated with epilepsy). However, some children with a neurodisability will not have been given aspeci c diagnosis. Version 2 Neurodisability includes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions with a broad range of severity and complexity, some of which can vary over time. Neurodisability is a consequence of impairment of the brain, central or peripheral nervous system that creates activity limitations. This may result in physicaldifculties (such as cerebral palsy), learning dif culties (such as intellectual disorders), and social/ communication dif culties (such as in autism), or other medical conditions (such as the problems associated with epilepsy). Sensory, behavioural and emotional dif culties are all included if they are a consequence of neurological impairment. Some children affected by neurodisability are diagnosed with speci c syndromes and conditions, whilst for others a speci c diagnosis may not be possible. Version 3 Neurodisability includes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions, which can co-occur, with a broad range of severity and complexity, some of which can vary over time. Neurodisability is a consequence of impairment of the brain, central or peripheral nervous system that creates activity limitations. This may result in physical dif culties (such as cerebral palsy), learning dif culties (such as intellectual disorders), and social/communication dif culties (such as in autism), or other medical conditions (such as the problems associated with epilepsy). Sensory, behavioural and emotional dif culties are all included if they are a consequence of neurological impairment. Some children affected by neurodisabilityare diagnosed with speci c syndromes and conditions, whilst for others a speci c diagnosis may not be possible. Version 4 Neurodisability describes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed todisturbance of the brain and or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. A speci c diagnosis may not be identi ed. Conditions may vary over time, occur alone or in combination and include a broad range of severity and complexity. The impact may include disturbances of movement, cognition,hearing and vision, communication, emotion and behaviour.DOI: 10.3310/hsdr02150 HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERY RESEARCH 2014 VOL. 2 NO. 15 221\u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.
