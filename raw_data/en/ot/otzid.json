It is based on expert consensus and references listed on page 9. ASCIA Drug Allergy Committee members are listed o n the ASCIA website www.allergy.org.au/members/committees#dac SUMMARY OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS AND DRUG ALLERGY ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 2 TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ALLERGY drug and toxic pustuloderma , is a rare severe cutaneous adverse skin reaction (SCAR), that is mostly related to medication administration. AGEP appear s on average five days after a medication is started. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is a general term that include s all unintended effects of a drug except for therapeutic failures, intentional overdose, abuse of the drug or errors in administration. ADRs can be classified into two types: - Type A reactions are predictable reactions and are based on known pharmacological properties of the drug . - Type B reactions are unpredictable and include drug allergy, drug intolerance and idiosyncra tic reactions to drugs . Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a s evere and immediate Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated allergic reaction . Anaphylaxis can affect breathing and/or the heart and blood pressure. Anaphylaxis is potentially life threatening and require s urgent medical attention. Whist a naphylaxis is more likely when medication is given by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection (IMI), anaphylaxis to oral medications can also occur . The most common causes of anaphylaxis are allergies to drugs (medications), foods and insect bites o r stings. Angioedema Angioedema is a swelling (oedema) of the structures of the skin (dermis, subcutaneous tissue ), mucosa and submucosal tissues. Benign rash In the context of drug allergy, a benign rash is a transient morbilliform or maculopapular rash that may be mildly pruritic and is not associated with other symptoms. Beta -lactam antibiotics Beta-lactam antibiotics are antibiotics that contain a chemical structure called a beta-lactam ring. Th ey include : - Penicillin derivatives (penams) Cephalosporins Monobactams - Carbapenems - a large group of beta-lactam antibiotics . Some cephalosporins share side chains attached to the beta -lactam ring with penicillins, which can lead to cross reactivity. Cephalosporins bind to and block the activity of enzymes responsible for making peptidoglycan, an important component of the bacterial cell wall. Cephalosporins are effective against a wide range of bacteri a. ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 3 Complementary and alternative medicine allergy (unproven medicines) While so-called complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) , including herbal medicines, are often considered to be safe, ADRs including allergic reactions can occur. It is therefore important to include questions about CAM in the patient's clinical history. Co-reactivity Co-reactivity is rare and refers to if a patient reacts to structurally unrelated drugs. This has been described for T -cell mediated reactions , especially for d rug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) . Cross -reactivity Cross -reactivity is an important clinical problem and may result in an ADR in some patients who are allergic to structurally related drug s. For example, some patients who are sensitised to penicillin may also have allergic reactions to cephalosporins , due to side chain cross - reactivity and rarely due to beta -lactam ring allergy. Cutaneous symptoms Cutaneous ( skin) symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction to a drug can include urticaria (hives) and angioedema. Rashes due to infection s can be mistaken as an allergic reaction to a drug. Non-immediate severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) are life threatening and are described on page 6. De-labelling Drug allergy de -labelling is the process of removing a drug allergy diagnosis from the patient medical record , after assessment . Assessment is achieved by allergy testing or subsequent safe exposure to the drug. The patient should receive a written and dated confirmation if their drug allergy diagnosis 'label ' is removed. It is important that the updated drug allergy status is rec orded in all medical records for each patient. Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) Drug -induced liver injury is a drug allergy and a leading cause of acute liver failure. Antibiotics are the most common cause for DILI worldwide. DILI can clinically present with hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver dysfunction. Drug allerg y Drug allerg ies are immun e mediated ADRs . In drug allergies , IgE or other antibodies or activated T cells are directed against the drug and its metabolite , which can be bound to serum proteins (haptens) . Allergic reactions to pain killers, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics are the most common drug allergies. Symptoms range from mild rashe s through to potentially life -threatening anaphylaxis and SCAR . Failure to accurately diagnose drug allergy , particularly to antibiotics , may result in the unnecessary use of less effective medication s, which is associated with negative patient outcomes. ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 4 Drug challenge (provocation test) Drug challenges are medically supervised tests using protocols in which a drug is administered (parenteral or oral), while the patient is being monitored for adverse effects at each stage. Drug challenges are also known as provocation tests and are considered to be the gold standard for drug allergy assessment. Location of challenges depends on the pre -existing risk profile of the patient and should be performed in a suitably equipped hospital or clinic , which can manage severe reactions . If a true drug allergy is diagnosed after a drug challenge , the drug must be avoided. Documentation of a diagnosed drug allergy should be in My Health Record, GP and hospital records. People with a diagnosed drug allergy should carry or wear medical identification jewellery or a card listing their drug allergies . Drug desensiti sation Drug desensiti sation is a medically supervised treatment, using protocols for rapid administration of incremental does (parenteral or oral), of allergenic drugs. The aim is to i nduc e temporary immune drug tolerance , by which effector cells are rendered less reactive to allergic immune responses . Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are unpredictable adverse effects of drugs that are allergic (immune mediated) or non -allergic (non-immune mediated) . DHRs can be classified as immediate and non -immediate , based on the timing when the reaction occurs . Immediate allergic DHRs develop as a result of IgE production by antigen -specific B lymphocytes after sensitisation , and occur typically within one hour, or up to six hours following exposure . Most non -immediate allergic DHRs are mediated through the actions of T lymphocytes , and typically occur after six hours following exposure . DHRs can be life -threatening, m ay require or prolong hospitali sation, and may require changes in therapy. Drug idiosyncrasy Idiosyncra tic reactions to drugs are abnormal and unexpected ADRs. These reactions can be allergic or non -allergic and are often reproducible on re -administration of the drug . Drug intolerance Drug intolerance is an undesirable pharmacologic effect that may occur at low or usual doses of the drug . Immune mechanisms are not thought to be involved, and a scientific explanation has not yet been established. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe idiosyncratic drug reaction . DRESS typically occurs two to eight weeks following exposure to the drug. DRESS has been linked to infection with human herpes virus 6 (HHV 6). Drug tolerance Drug tolerance is defined as a state in which a patient will tolerate a drug without an adverse reaction. Desensitisation can induce temporary, but not permanent drug tolerance. ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 5 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia is a condition in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds the laboratory reference range. In drug allergy, e osinophilia is often accompanied by a skin rash. Eosinophilia and skin rashes are common, whereas systemic DRESS is rare. Exanthem a Exanthem a describes a skin eruption , which can be caused by a range of reasons, including toxins, drugs, infections and autoimmune disease. Viral exanthem is a widespread rash usually occurring in children. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are various movement disorders (including acute dystonic reactions, pseudoparkinsonism and akathisia ) which can result from taking dopamine antagonists . These are u sually antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs, that are often used to control psychosis. EPS can also be symptoms of metabolic diseases. Fixed drug eruption (FDE) A fixed drug eruption (FDE) is an allergic reaction to a medication that usually recurs at the same site /s each time a particular drug is taken. The number of involved sites may increase over time. Generali sed bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE) Generali sed bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE) is a bullous type of fixed drug eruption (FDE) , characterised by sharply defined bullae at the same site following administration of offending drug. Unlike FDE, GBFDE requires aggressive treatment. Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) Certain non -immediate drug allergies are associated with the carriage of defined HLA (e.g. ADR to abacavir with HLA B*57:01). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is one of the five subclasses of antibody related to allergic reactions present in the blood, usually in very low concentrations and bound to the surface of cells such as mast cells. Cross linking of bound IgE on the surface of mast cells leads to the release of allergic mediators , including histamine. This can trigger mild, moderate or severe (anaphylaxis) allergic reactions. These reactions are known as IgE -mediated allergies. Allergen specific IgE can be measured using skin testing or blood tests. Maculopapular rash Maculopapular rash is a skin rash with a combination of macular ( flat, red areas) and papules (raised bumps ). Multiple drug intolerance syndrome Multiple drug intolerance syndrome occurs in patients with intolerance to three or more neither structurally nor pharmacologically related drugs, with no confirmation of allergy after evaluation , and can possibly be driven by patient anxiety. Non-IgE mediated allergy In non -IgE -mediated allergic reactions a patient may have similar clinical symptoms to IgE-mediated reactions, ranging from mild or moderate to severe allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis . These reactions do not involve Ig E antibodies against the allergens . ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 6 Non-steroidal anti - inflammatory drug (NSAID ) allergy (intolerance) Aspirin and other non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause reactions in some people. Symptoms include flushing, itchy rashes, blocked/runny nose and sometimes severe asthma, usually within an hour of taking a tablet. Aspirin allergy (more correctly referred to as aspirin intolerance) is more common in people with nasal polyps and asthma (AERD or Samter's Triad) . Aspirin -induced respiratory disease (AERD) is characteri sed by aspirin or non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced respiratory reactions in a patient with underlying asthma and/or rhinitis or sinusitis. Penicillin a ntibiotic allergy Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections . They are still widely used today, despite some bacteria develop ing resistance following extensive use. Approximately 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin, however, up to 90% of this group have an unconfirmed allergy and may not actually be allergic to penicillin. Penicillin allergy de -labelling is the process of removing an unconfirmed allergy diagnosis from the patient medical record. This may be achieved by allergy testing or subsequent s afe exposure to the drug. Perioperative allergic reactions Allergic reactions, including a naphylaxis , can occur during surgical and interventional procedures involving anaesthetic s and antibiotics . Allergic reactions to antiseptics, latex and anaesthetic drugs given during operations are rare , but can be serious. Allergic reactions to chlorhexidine antiseptics are increasing in frequency and may be due t o common usage of chlorhexidine -containing products. Pharmacologic interaction with immune receptors (P-i) concept The p -i concept (pharmacologic interaction with immune receptors) is a recently proposed drug hypersensitivity classification in which a drug binds noncovalently to an immune receptor, such as a T cell receptor . This may lead to an immune response via interaction with a major histocompatibility complex molecule . Pharmacovigilance (drug safety) Pharmacovigilance (a lso known as drug safety), is the pharmacological science relating to the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring and prevention of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products. Pseudoallergic (anaphylactoid) reactions Pseudoallergic (anaphylactoid) reactions are immediate systemic reactions that mimic anaphylaxis , but are caused by non IgE-mediated reactions with the release of mediators from mast cells and basophils. This term is rarely used and is incorrect as the anaphylaxis that results has the same characteristics as an IgE -mediated reaction . Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) Non-immediate severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) are rashes that are associated with fever, flu -like and other systemic symptoms . SCAR are potentially life-threatening , and require urgent specialist care. SCAR often involve mucosal surfaces as well as the skin and include: - Stevens -Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) - Drug reaction with eosinophilia symptoms (DRESS) - Acute generali sed exanthematous eruptions ASCIA Information for Health Professionals - Drug A llergy Terms 7 Skin tests Skin prick tests (SPT) Intradermal tests (IDT) A skin prick test (SPT) i ntroduces a tiny amount of allergen into the skin, via a prick into the skin. Intradermal skin testing (IDT) injects a defined amount of allergen into the dermal layer of the skin. IDT is more sensitive than SPT as it delivers a larger amount of allergen but can carry a risk of anaphylaxis in highly sensitised individuals. SPT and IDT elicit a localised allergic response in the form of a wheal (bump) and flare (re dness) at the site of testing. IDT can also elicit a delayed inflammatory reaction in the skin in non - immediate drug reactions. When drug allergy is uncertain, SPT or IDT or a medically supervised drug challenge can be conducted by clinical immunology/ allergy specialists. Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a life-threatening skin condition, in which cell death causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis. SJS is thought to be a hypersensitivity complex that affects the skin and the mucous membranes. The most well -known causes of SJS are certain medicati ons, but it can also be due to infections, or more rarely, cancers. Symmetrical drug - related intertriginous and flexural is also known as Baboon syndrome because of its resemblance to the distinctive red buttocks displayed by female baboons , SDRIFE is a systemic contact dermatitis with well-demarcated patches of erythema distributed symmetrically on the buttocks. The cause of SDRIFE may be drug -related, induced by systemic administration of drugs, including hydroxyzine , penicillin and iodinated radio contrast media. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a type of severe skin reaction . Symptoms include fever and flu -like symptoms , followed by blister and peel. Tryptase Tryptase is a proteinase that is abundant in human mast cells and basophils . Serum Tryptase is used as a marker for mast cell activation and rises in anaphylaxis particularly when caused by drugs and stings . Urticaria (hives) Urticaria (also known as hives or welts) is a raised, itchy rash that appears on the skin. Urticaria can be limited to one part of the body or spread across large areas of the body.
