After the analyses for this study were completed, questions arose regarding the integrity of study data from a single study site in Romania, which enrolled 102 subjects in the trial. Because evaluation of data from this site did not reveal irregularities when compared with overall study data and because GSK has no current plans to use the data from the study in support of any regulatory filings, they were not excluded from the analyses reflected in this results summary. |Study Type Superior Efficacy GSK2186877A in Elderly Subjects| |Actual Study Date :||September |Actual Primary Date :||June Group | subjects received 2 doses (1 dose per season) of FluNG vaccine during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) vaccination periods.
