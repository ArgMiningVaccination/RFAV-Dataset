Program Description Overview The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) is a compo nent of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Created in 1995, OVW implements the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and subse quent legislation and provides national leadership on issues of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Since its inception, OVW has supported a multifaceted approach to responding to these crimes through implementation of grant programs authorized by VAWA. By forging state, local and tribal partnerships among police, prosecut ors, judges, victim advocates, health care providers, faith leaders and others, OVW grants help provide victims with the protection and services they need to pursue safe and healthy lives, while improving commu nities' capacity to hold offenders accountable for their crimes. About the OVW STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program This solicitation provides program and application guidelines for Fiscal Year 2015 Services*Training*Officers*Prosecutors (STOP) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program (STOP Formula Grant Program) funding, including guidelines for complying with requirements of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), as amended. By statute, the STOP Formula Grant Program supports communities in their efforts to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women, including the crimes of d omestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking and to develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving these crimes . For additional information on the STOP Formula Grant Program, including what past STOP Formula Grant Program grantees have accomplished with their grant funds and to view the STOP Formula Grant Program performance measures, see http://muskie.usm.maine.edu/vawamei/stopformulamain.htm . Program Scope Activities supported by the STOP Formula Grant Program are determined by statute, federal regulations, and OVW policies.

Mandatory Program Requirements Implementation Plan As a result of changes in VAWA 2013, implementation plans are now due with the application. All states submitted three -year plans in 2014. For 2015 and 2016, plan updates will be required. An applicant that fails to include the required plan updates with its application will not have access to any funding, including administrative funds, until its plan update is submitted to and approved by OVW. OVW Priority Areas The emphasis of the STOP Formula Grant Program continues to be on the implementation of comprehensive strategies addressing violence against women that are sensitive to the immediate and long- term needs and safety of victims and hold offenders accountable for their crimes. States and territories should seek to carry out these strategies by forging lasting partnerships between 9 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 victim service providers and the criminal justice system, and by encouraging communities to look beyond traditional resources. States and territories should also look to new partners, including culturally - and population -specific organizations, to respond vigorously to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking crimes. In shaping their strategies for FY 2015 , OVW encourages states and territories to develop and support projects that: 1. Support and retain core services for victims of sexual and domestic violence, particularly support for rape crisis centers and domestic violence shelters; 2. Increase support for sexual assault, including services, law enforcement response and prosecution; 3. Increas e support for underserved populations, particularly communities of color, in a culturally appropriate manner, with a special emphasis on African- American, tribal and LGBT communities; 4. Increase the use of promising or evidence- building practices, where available; 5. Provide culturally -specific services and training to underserved communities based on factors such as race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, or gender identity; 6. Provide basic and advanced training to tribal law enforcement and tribal courts regarding services for victims in tribal communities; 7. Provide comprehensive training to victim services, law enforcement, prosecution, and court personnel on sexual assault, to support increased reporting, arrest and successful prosecution of perpetra tors; 8. Support Full Faith and Credit training for tribes, states and territories; 9. Implement evidence- based risk/danger assessments to identify and prioritize victims who are considered to be in relationships with a high risk of lethality . B. Federal Award Information Award Information Applicants that receive an award are bound by statute, federal regulations, the provi sions of this solicitation, the Financial Guide, any updates to the Financial Guide, and any conditions of the recipient's award. Avai lability of Funds All awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law.

Award Period The grant award period is 24 months. 10 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 Award Amounts By statute, of the amount appropriated for the STOP Formula Grant Program OVW will award a base amount $600,000 to each state and territory.

The most accurate and complete data compiled by the United States Bureau of the Census are used to determine the populations. OVW will make 56 awards. The STOP Formula Grant Program typically makes awards varying in range to each state and territory based on the formula described above. Awards will be made as grants. C. Eligibility Information Eligible Applicants It is very impo rtant that applicants review this information carefully.

All certification and other eligibility related documents must be current and developed in accordance with the FY 2015 solicitation. Cost Sharing or Match Requirements Required Match There is a 25 percent match requirement imposed on grant funds under this program. A grant made under this program may not cover more than 75 percent of the total costs of the project being funded. Subgrants to victim service providers for victim services can be excluded from the total costs. For a subgrant to qualify under this exclusion, the recipient must be an organization that is recognized by the IRS under section 501(c)(3) of title 26 (unless it is a tribal governmental organization or a governmental rape crisis center not in a territory). The applicant must identify the source of the 25 percent non- Federal portion of the budget and how match funds will be used. Applicants may satisfy the required match with either cash or in- kind services. In addition, victim service providers and tribes cannot be required to provide match. Such victim service providers must have IRS 501(c)(3) status (unless they are tribal governmental organizations or governmental rape crisis centers not in territories). For more information, please contact your OVW Program Manager or consult OVW's Frequently Asked Questions for STOP Formula Grants. The following provisions apply to match requirements: 11 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 1. The state may satisfy the match requirement with either cash (e.g., funds c ontributed from private sources or state and local governments) or in- kind services (e.g., services or goods donated by the applicant organization or other entities). 2. Funds from other federal sources may not be used to meet the match requirement. A state may use its discretion to require some or all of its subgrantees (except victim service providers and Indian tribal governments) to meet the match requirement, in whole or in part. OVW encourages states to consider the ability of subgrantees to meet matc h requirements when deciding whether and how much of the match to pass on; however, the state remains responsible for satisfying the match requirement. 3. Funds or in- kind resources used as match must be directly related to the project goals and objectives. 4. Grantees or subgrantees must maintain records which clearly show the source, the amount, and the timing of all matching contributions. 5. Sources of match are restricted to the same requirements as funds allocated under the STOP Formula Grant Program and must be documented in the same manner as STOP Formula Grant Program funds, including financial and programmatic reports. 6. The state must provide match for its administrative expenses. Grantees are advised that further guidance on the calculation, documentation and auditing of the match requirement can be found in the Financial Guide and on OVW's w ebsite. For more information and ideas regarding match, please see the Match Requirement for STOP Formula Grants on OVW's website.

The Certification of Compliance with the Statutory Eligibility Requirements of the Violence Against Women Act (as Amended) form must be signed and submitted annually by the Authorized Representative to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. (This form can also be found in the Appendix A.) STOP Formula Gran t Program applicants must also provide a brief description of the status of their compliance with the statutory requirements and submit copies of any legislative or administrative rule changes regarding these requirements that have occurred since submission of the state or t erritory's last application for STOP funds.

Note: STOP funds may be used to pay for forensic medical exams performed by trained examiners for victims of sexual assault, except that such funds may not be used to pay for forensic medical exams if victims of sexual assault are required to seek reimbursement for such exams from their insurance carriers. Note: Due to changes in VAWA 2013, states can no longer reimburse victims for the costs of the exams, but must make the exam available free of charge to the victim. This includes any deductibles or copayments for states that require victims to submit the charges to their insurance carriers. States and territories have until March 7, 2016 to come into compliance with changes to this provision i n VAWA 2013. If the s tate or territory is not compliant, it should include information in t he implementation plan updates on the specific areas of noncompliance and progress in addressing them . 3.

Applicant Registration Requirements It is very important that all applicants read this section carefully. Applicants are responsible for ensuring that all registration requirements are met in a timely manner . Federal guidelines require that applicant organizations must (1) be registered in SAM prior to submitting an application; (2) provide a valid DUNS number in its application; and (3) continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application under consideration by a Federal awarding agency. Federal agencies may not make an award to an applicant until that applicant has complied with all applicable DUNS and SAM requirements. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time that OVW is ready to make an award, then OVW may make the determination that the applicant is not qualified to receive an award and use that determination as Applicants must be registered and current with the SAM registration and with GMS prior to submitting an applic ation. Registration Applicants must follow the registration process outlined below. There is no fee associated with the registration process . Additionally, the registration process cannot be expedited. OVW strongly discourages applicants from paying a third party to register on their behalf in an attempt to expedite the registration process. To ensure all applicants have ample time to complete the registration process, applicants must obtain a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) Number, register online with the System for Award Management ( SAM ) and with GMS immediately, but no later than April 23, 2015 . Failure to begin the registration process in sufficient time may result in a delay in an applicant's ability to submit their application and there a delay in receiving funding. It is important that applicants do not wait until the day of the application deadline to begin the registration or submission processes . Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and System for Award Management (SAM) Applicants for federal grants and cooperative agreements are required to have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) Number to submit an application. A DUNS Number is a unique nine- character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) . Once you have completed the D&B registration, your DUNS Number should be available the next business day. Applicants should ensure that the DUNS number for the application is for an organization that is eligible to apply for the grant program. Also, only the organization that is registered in SAM may use that DUNS number to submit an application. 19 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 In Fiscal Year (FY) 2012, the System for Award Management (SAM) replaced the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as the government -wide registry for vendors doing business with the federal government. All applicants must register with SAM and renew their registration annually. The SAM centralizes information about grant recipients and also provides a central location for grant recipients to chan ge organizational information. Applicants must be registered and current with the SAM registration and with GMS prior to submitting an application. Applicants should begin the process immediately to meet the GMS registration deadline, especially if this is the first time using these systems. It is strongly recommended that applicants begin the registration process no later than April 23, 2015 in order to ensure that the registration process is completed and any difficulties are resolved well in advance of the application deadline. For more information on the process of registering with SAM and GMS , please see the \" System for Award Management (SAM) \" section below . System for Award Management (SAM) Applicants for all federal grants are required to regis ter with the System for Award Management (SAM). If the applying organization already has an Employer Identification Number (EIN), the SAM registration will take up to two weeks to process. If the applying organization does not have an EIN, then the applicant should allow two to five weeks for obtaining the information from IRS when requesting the EIN via phone, fax, mail or Internet . Follow the steps listed below to register in the SAM: Step 1: Obtain a DUNS number at the following website http://www.dnb.com/us/ or call (866) 705- 5711. Step 2: Access the SAM online registration through the SAM homepage at https://www.sam.gov/ and follow the online instructions for new SAM user s. Step 3: Complete and submit the online registration. If the applying organization already has the necessary information on hand, the online registration takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, depending upon the size and complexity of the business or organization. Please note that organizations must update or renew their SAM registration at least once a year to maintain an active status. (Applicants formerly used the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database). Grants Management System Applicants are required to submit applications through the Office of Justice Programs' Grants Management System (GMS) . This is not Grants.gov. In order to apply for a grant through GMS, go to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ and either sign in using the applicant's current GMS ID and password or register as a new user.

OVW Policy on Late Submissions In order to facilitate the timely processing of all applications, both discretionary and formula, applicants for OVW form ula funding must also adhere to an application submission timeline. This ensures that OVW has sufficient time to review the application contents for compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory, as well as to process the appropriate award documents. While OVW may accept a late application submission request for formula funding, it is the responsibility of the applicant to notify OVW about an issue that may cause a delay in the submission of the application.

Applicants must contact their state SPOCs to determine whether their programs have been selec ted for state review. The applicant should enter the date that the application was sent to the 21 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 SPOC or the reason such submission is not required in Block 3 of the Overview section of the GMS application. Funding Restrictions Activities that Compromise Victim Safety and Recovery Because of the overall purpose of the program to enhance victim safety and offender accountability, grant funds may not be used to support activities that compromise victim safety and recovery. The following activities have been found to jeopardize victim safety, deter or prevent physical or emotional healing for victims, or allow offenders to escape responsibility for their actions: 1. Procedures or policies that exclude vic tims from receiving safe shelter, advocacy services, counseling, and other assistance based on their actual or perceived age, immigration status, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health condition, physical health condition, criminal record, work in the sex industry, relationship to the perpetrator, or the age and/or gender of their children;2 2. Procedures or policies that compromise the confidentiality of information and privacy of persons receiving OVW -funded services; 3. Offering perpetrators the option of entering pre -trial diversion programs or placing batterers in anger management programs; 4. Requiring mediation or counseling for couples as a systemic response to domestic violence or sexual assault, or in situations in which child sexual abuse is alleged; 5. Requiring victims to report sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence crimes to law enforcement or forcing victims to participate in criminal proceedings; 6. Relying on court -mandated batterer intervention programs that do not use the coercive power of the criminal justice system to hold batterers accountable for their behavior; or 7. Supporting policies or engaging in practices that impose restrictive conditions to be met by the victim in order to receive services (e.g., attending counseling, seeking an order of protection); Out-of-Scope Activities Research projects are outside the statutory scope of the STOP Formula Grant Program and therefore cannot be supported with program funds. (This does not include program assessments conducted only for internal improvement purposes. See section on Research and Protection of Human Subjects in the Solicitation Companion Guide .) Any out -of-scope activities proposed within an implementation plan update will need to be removed prior to final approval by OVW. 2 If an award is made, the recipient will also be subject to statutory prohibitions on discrimination. For further information on these civil rights requirements, see the section on \" VAWA Non - Discrimination Provision \" under \"F. Federal Award Administration Information \". 22 OMB Number: 1122- 0020 Expiration Date: 8/31/2015 Unallowable Activities The following is a list of activities that are unallowable and cannot be supported by OVW STOP Formula Grant Program funding: 1.
