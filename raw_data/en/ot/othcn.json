Caring for your child's total health \u2014 mind, body and spirit \u2014 is just one way Children's Minnesota clinics stand out. Wherever your child's health journey goes, we're here for you every step of the way. You want the very best for your child and that's why we recommend following the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for well-child check-ups. At each exam we'll check your child's growth, well-being and development as well as offer guidance on nutrition, sleep, safety and other important topics. These visits are a great opportunity to learn more and ask questions about your child's health. This schedule of preventive care and immunizations helps you know what to expect and prepare your child at each age. Well child appointment schedules for newborn to 1 month may vary depending on your baby's needs. Follow your pediatrician's recommendations.

Children's Minnesota welcomes patients throughout their college years or through age 23. Our clinicians keep up-to-date with adolescent issues including pubertal development, acne, gynecology, depression and adjustment concerns. We have a dedicated adolescent clinic on our Minneapolis campus. Adolescence, roughly ages 11-21 years, is a time of huge transformation - physically and mentally. That's why we adjust our approach to well exams during adolescence. We spend time with teens and their parents in the room at the same time, but we also take time alone with the teen.

For children's safety, all babies and infants are assessed for abusive head trauma at every appointment. Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death and injury for children.
