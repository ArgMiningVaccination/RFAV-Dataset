Nutrients Over the last 20 years, the use of dietary supplements (DS) has continued to grow in many countries. Due to the public health crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and amidst fears regarding COVID-19 vaccines and their low supply in many regions of the world, there has been a marked interest in the use of DS as alternative means of protecting against and treating this emerging disease, as well as boosting the immune system and minimizing the risk of inflammation. Despite a lack of evidence to suggest their efficacy, a surge in the sales of DS has been reported in many parts of the world. Questions have also been raised about the health effects associated with DS due to their increased use during the health crisis. Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated their beneficial properties as well as some adverse and even toxic effects. In addition, given the current global interest in this issue, a review is needed to establish the status of dietary supplements before and during ... Foods Mothers are understandably concerned about protecting the well-being of their offspring in every way possible, including providing oral dietary supplements (DSs). Up to now, there has been limited data on maternal knowledge and attitudes toward concomitant maternal-child DSs practices in Lebanon. This study evaluated the maternal knowledge and attitudes toward DSs and documented the DS-related practices in mothers and their under-5 children with their correlates. This cross-sectional study involved a representative stratified cluster random sample of 511 mother-child dyads (mothers: 15.5 months, girls: 55.0%). A self-administered questionnaire was used to meet study aims. Most mothers lack awareness and hold unfavorable attitudes regarding DS use. Among all mothers, 47% were DS users, with the majority using vitamin D (82%). Almost 64% of mothers provide DSs for their children, with a predominant use of multivitami... Nutraceuticals are the nourishing components (hybrid of nutrition and pharmaceuticals) that are biologically active and possess capability for maintaining optimal health and benefits. These products play a significant role in human health care and its endurance, most importantly for the future therapeutic development. Nutraceuticals have received recognition due to their nutritional benefits along with therapeutic effects and safety profile. Nutraceuticals are globally growing in the field of services such as health care promotion, disease reduction, etc. Various drug nutraceutical interactions have also been elaborated with various examples in this review. Several patents on nutraceuticals in agricultural applications and in various diseases have been stated in the last section of review, which confirms the exponential growth of nutraceuticals' market value. Nutraceuticals have been used not only for nutrition but also as a support therapy for the prevention and treatment of variou... International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health At the start of 2020, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) invaded the world leading to the death of 3.92 million people. Sadly, to date, no remedy has been discovered for this virus. Preventive vaccines have been under investigation, but were unavailable until December 2020. Clinical deficiencies of nutrients may increase susceptibility to infections. This knowledge may have provided an incentive for some dietary supplement (DS) manufacturers to advertise their products as COVID-19 preventatives or cures without any substantiation, targeting mainly social media fans. The objective of this research was to assess the usage, knowledge and attitudes towards dietary supplementation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among Lebanese people. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on a convenience sample (N = 2966) and information from participants aged 18 years and above was collected about periods before and during the pandemic. Our findings showed that attitudes towards DSs changed whe... F1000Research Background: Increasing dietary supplement (DS) consumption was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the post-Delta wave period. This study aimed to measure the practice of DS consumption and respondents' knowledge of DS. Methods: An internet-based survey was distributed from October-December 2021 and obtained 541 valid and completed responses. Descriptive analysis was performed to present the practice of DS consumption, including frequency, duration, aim, preferable dosage form etc. Level of knowledge on DS principles, side effects and regulation were also measured. Inferential analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of the respondents' DS practice and level of knowledge. Results: Data from 541 valid responses showed that 77.63% of respondents consumed DS in the last 3 months, with only 59.52% reporting also consuming DS before the COVID-19 pandemic. One half of the respondents had good knowledge about DS; however, some knowledge regarding side effects... Foods Athletes are under the utmost pressure to reach excellence in their performance and achieve the desired outcomes in competitions, prompting them to use dietary supplements. Given the threats to both health and eligibility, it is crucial to observe the prevalence, sources of information, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) among Lebanese athletes practicing their sports for at least two years. In the present paper, a cross-sectional study is performed using the snowball sampling method, in which a self-administered KAP questionnaire is used to collect data from 455 athletes (mean age: 27.4 \u00b1 7.9 years; men: 73.1%) participating in four sports categories (ball games, combat sports, endurance sports, and weightlifting). Among the Lebanese athletes, the prevalence of dietary supplement (DS) use was 74%, where half of them had predominately used sports supplements. Athletes in Lebanon heavily rely on coaches (74%) and online sources, including webpages and social media (64%), as k... Nutrients The food supplement market is growing as many consumers wish to complement their nutrient intake. Despite all the regulations in place to ensure food supplements safety, there are still many cases of irregularities reported especially connected to internet sales. Twenty resveratrol food supplement products sold on the Slovenian market were evaluated on their compliance of declared vs. determined resveratrol content, as well as the compliance of labels with the European Union (EU) and Slovenian regulatory requirements. Both the ingredient contents and food information are important parts of food safety. Analyses of 20 food supplements performed using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) coupled with densitometry showed that 95% of products had contents different from what was declared and 55% of products contained higher contents than declared. In 25% of the products the determined content per unit exceeded the maximum level (150 mg/day) specified in EU novel food condi... Nutrients 2020 The use of dietary supplements (DSs) has been steadily increasing all over the world and additionally, the sales of DSs have dynamical increased in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in most of the countries. We investigated DSs phenomenon in 2020 through (1) exploration of Google searches worldwide and in Poland (with Google Trends (GT) tool), and (2) analyses of results of PLifeCOVID-19 Online Studies conducted during the first and second wave of the pandemic. The conducted GT analysis and cross-sectional studies revealed that during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, the interest in immune-related compounds and foods like vitamins C and D, zinc, omega-3, garlic, ginger, or turmeric, as well as their consumption increased. Improving immunity was the main reason behind the supplementation and changes in consumption of pro-healthy foods. GT analysis has shown these interests were positively correlated with the interest in COVID-19, but adversely with cumulative cases ... Nutrients 2021 Food supplements (FS) are a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals, or other ingredients with nutritional or other physiological effects. Due to their easy availability, widespread advertising, and sometimes low price, increased consumption of this group of preparations has been observed. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and intake of FS during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, with particular reference to FS containing zinc and vitamin D. It was noted that both of the above ingredients were used significantly more often by people with higher education (59.0%), with a medical background or related working in the medical field (54.5%), and/or exercising at home (60.1%). Preparations containing vitamin D were used by 22.8% of the respondents in the first wave, 37.6% in the second wave, and 32.9% in the third wave. To sum up, we showed the highest consumption of vitamin and mineral supplements, and preparations containing zinc and vitamin D were taken signi... Life Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenge for the world today, so it is very important to create healthy eating habits in society to support immunity and raise awareness of the benefits of supplementation. Objective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate diet and dietary supplementation, since previous studies indicate the protective nature of these in building immunity during the pandemic and post-pandemic period (COVID-19). The hypothesis of the study is whether the dietary regimen presented by the COVID-19 respondents can be considered protective in building immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Material and methods. The study included 304 subjects, with an average age of 39.04 \u00b1 23.59. The main criteria for inclusion in the study were that the respondent was 18 years old and participated voluntarily. The study was conducted using an original questionnaire. Results. In the study group, no change was noticed in the previous diet during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the le... Nutrients A stratified random sampling technique was used in order to explore the prevalence of and the factors influencing dietary supplement (DS) use and the consumer stance towards DS by Greeks (n = 28,491, 15 years) according to sex. Additionally, we performed a Pearson's chi-square to test within DS users for the dependence between sex and the examined factors, and binary logistic regression to create predictive DS user profiles. A history of DS use accounted for 55.5% and was more prevalent in women (58.4% vs. 52.3%, p < 0.001); multivitamins were the most popular DS used. The significant predictors for DS use for both sexes were age, education, employment status, exercise, and following a special diet, while BMI and monthly income were significant for women and men, respectively. The women and men DS users had mostly illness-health and fitness-related goals, respectively. Substantial proportions of the respondents had false beliefs about DS. A noticeable percentage of DS users disp... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable. You can download the paper by clicking the button above.
