With a lowered risk of serious illness\u2014 thanks to the effectiveness of vaccines and more widely available medication for COVID-19\u2014widespread restrictions have mostly been lifted around the world and on NYU's campuses. NYU COVID-19 Guidance For Everyone Whether you're a student, faculty, or employee, or you are temporarily visiting, affiliated with, or contracting for NYU, you can find NYU's COVID-related information here. Vaccination & Boosters We encourage everyone in the NYU community to [stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html). While NYU no longer requires COVID-19 vaccination for most community members and guests, vaccination is a key tool in reducing the impact of a COVID-19 infection and helps prevent the spread to others. A limited amount of COVID-19 vaccines are available for students at the [NYU Student Health Center](/students/health-and-wellness/services/medical-services/vaccines.html). Faculty and employees should seek vaccination from their care providers or local community health providers. Note: Primary series vaccination continues to be [required for covered Dental students](/students/health-and-wellness/next-stop-health-requirements/immunization-requirements.html) and Dental employees in accordance with applicable law. What should I know about getting vaccinated this fall? New COVID-19 vaccine formulations are anticipated to become available in September 2023. These vaccines have been updated to better match the COVID-19 variants that are currently circulating in the community. At this time, the NYU Campus Health team recommends that most healthy individuals wait to get boosted until the new formulations are available. Individuals with weakened immune systems and/or are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease, should consult their personal medical providers for specific advice. The NYU Student Health Center will have the new COVID-19 vaccines available for students when they become available this fall. Faculty and employees should seek vaccination from their care providers or local community health providers. Masks are Always Welcome As a community, we embrace the choice by friends, classmates, and colleagues to wear a mask and are committed to establishing an atmosphere where masks are always welcomed. Masking is only required in healthcare settings (e.g. Student Health Center, Dental Practice). Higher quality masks include: disposable masks (surgical or medical procedure masks), KN95 masks, KF94 masks, and N95 masks. Guidance for Symptoms, Exposure & Testing NYU community members who are experiencing symptoms, tested positive, or were exposed to COVID-19 should follow the [CDC COVID-19 guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/index.html) for next steps, precautions, and testing. For specific guidance on what to do if you have tested positive for or been exposed to someone with COVID-19, use the [CDC Isolation and Exposure Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). Follow all of these key recommendations if you are sick and/or have tested positive for COVID-19: - Stay home and distance yourself from others until your isolation period is over. - Wear a high-quality mask at all times if you must be around others, including the people you live with. - Only go out in public for essential reasons (to buy food, medication, or seek medical care) and return home as soon as possible to limit your exposure to others. Where to get COVID-19 tests: - Free at-home [COVID-19 test kits are available at specific NYC locations](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-testing.page). - Some retail pharmacies across NYC (CVS, Duane Reade, etc.) provide COVID-19 testing on-site and may have at-home COVID-19 test kits available to purchase. If you need medical care related to a COVID-19 infection: - Students can schedule a virtual appointment at the [Student Health Center](/students/health-and-wellness/make-an-appointment.html)or call [(212) 443-1000](tel:12124431000)and speak with a nurse. - Employees should contact their healthcare provider.

Visitors Short-term visitors, affiliates, contractors, and vendors are not required to comply with COVID-19 policies or requirements.
