We know there are still many questions and concerns about these vaccines. That's why Trinity Health is committed to keeping you and our communities informed and educated as major developments occur. There are many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine. We've heard you and put together a list of answers to the most asked questions. The vaccine is now available for everyone six months and older. Visit [vaccine.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) and your state's health department website for more information. All persons ages six months and older are now eligible to receive the vaccine. Visit [vaccine.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) and your state's health department website for more information. The COVID-19 vaccine gives your immune system a preview of the coronavirus, so it learns how to stop it. It triggers antibodies in your blood to attack the virus's unique spike protein. (Did you know, coronaviruses got their name because they have protein spikes that look like a crown?) Your immune system learns from the vaccine how to quickly recognize the actual virus and stop it from multiplying. The idea is to stop SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from getting into cells, replicating itself and making you sick. Two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are needed to provide the complete protection. The first one primes the immune system, helping it to recognize the virus, and the second one strengthens the immune response. If the vaccine you received requires two doses, you should receive both doses. You should also stay up to date on your COVID vaccines by receiving any [recommended booster doses.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) The single-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine is also considered in some situations such as for people who are allergic to an ingredient in the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. According to the CDC, those who are fully vaccinated will continue to be protected against serious illness and hospitalization. However, some study data suggests that immunity may decline over time after the primary series. Booster doses are recommended for optimal protection against the virus. In November 2021, the FDA authorized a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for millions of Americans to be administered at least five months after their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Individuals who completed the Johnson & Johnson primary vaccine series should receive a booster at least two months after their initial vaccination. The CDC recommends booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, with the number of booster doses dependent on age. Immunocompromised individuals aged 12 and older should receive a total of 5 doses of mRNA vaccine to be considered up to date. A complete schedule of COVID-19 booster doses for immunocompromised individuals is available on the CDC website: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) Yes, the vaccination is recommended for all people six months and older, including people who are trying to get pregnant, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or may become pregnant in the future. Data from thousands of people who are pregnant, breast-feeding and those who became pregnant after vaccination confirms that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective before, during and after pregnancy. In fact, the CDC has issued a health alert recommending those who are pregnant, recently gave birth, are breast-feeding, or trying to become pregnant receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. The CDC V-Safe data shows no increase in adverse outcomes in pregnant women who receive the COVID-19 vaccine. There is also no evidence linking vaccines to infertility. The risks of COVID-19 infection outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination while pregnant or trying to conceive. Pregnant women are at a higher risk to get ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant women. A study was conducted before the Delta variant; results [published by the Journal of the American Medicine Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2782978) showed pregnant women with COVID infection are 15 times more likely to die in hospital, 14 times more likely to require intubation and 22 times more likely to have a premature birth. See the CDC's [COVID-19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding info page.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) Yes. People who are immunocompromised are more likely to be hospitalized and get seriously ill from COVID-19. It's recommended you get vaccinated if you are immunocompromised. These people may not get as much protection after two doses of the vaccine as do people with normal immune systems. For that reason, [additional doses are now recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html), with the schedule varying by primary vaccine series. If you are immunocompromised, discuss the vaccine with your doctor for a personalized recommendation. In addition, discuss with your doctor whether you should get a medication called Evusheld that will help provide additional protection against COVID-19. The vaccines authorized are highly effective at preventing severe disease, death, and provide protection from the Omicron variant. The vaccines are not 100% effective, and some fully vaccinated people may experience illness. It's important that as many people as possible get vaccinated to slow the spread of variants. Newer versions of the vaccine may be available in fall 2022 that will provide even better protection against the newer variants of COVID-19. [Omicron Variant: What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html) We are confident the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective with the FDA's emergency use authorizations and now permanent approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The vaccines passed numerous, required safety checks and study of reported side effects or adverse events. Several months of data have shown us the vaccines are safe and effective. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now known as Comirnaty, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are available for children ages 6 months and older through emergency use authorization (EUA). The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also has permanent approval for people ages 12 and older. Vaccinating this age group will help kids get back to their normal lives including school, sports and more, while keeping high-risk family members and others safe. While most children are at lower risk for severe illness from COVID-19, there are still many unknown long-term effects. While uncommon, it is also possible for children infected with COVID-19 to become seriously ill or worse. Vaccination also allows for safe return to activities and normal life. Vaccination will: Clinical trials show COVID-19 vaccines are very effective in children. In fact, data shows the immune response for children ages 12 to 15 was better than trial participants ages 16-25, with no COVID cases in the vaccinated group. Trials for younger children took place during the Omicron waves, which lowered the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the vaccines were still protective, generating similar antibody levels as vaccines for older age groups. Side effects in children are similar to those in other age groups. The most common side effects include: For the Pfizer vaccine, 12- to 15-year-olds will receive the same dosing as adults. Clinical trials tested the adult dose and two smaller doses to determine safety and efficacy. This dose was proven safe and shown to be most effective for this age group. Children aged five to 11 years receive a smaller dose as part of a two-dose series, and children six months to 4 years receive an even smaller dose in a three-dose series. For Moderna, children aged six months to 5 years receive one-quarter the adult dose in a two-dose series. Children aged six to 11 years receive half the adult dose, and children 12 to 17 years old receive the full adult dose, both as a two-dose series. It's mostly fat, salt, electrolytes and sugar. Lipids, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), are the \"fatty layer\" that protects the delicate mRNA so it has time to work before getting chopped up. Potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride and dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate and sucrose are just fancy names for some salts and sugar. These ingredients help keep the vaccine stable and are natural preservatives. Billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been given worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccine is no longer \"new.\" Scientists and pediatricians feel confident in the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster. Waiting puts children at higher risk for infection and illness. The vaccine and booster got to us fast because: Since it has been given to so many with very few complications over a year now, there is a lot of confidence in the safety of the COVID vaccine. We now know that COVID complications from the disease can be MUCH worse than complications we have seen with the vaccine. As of June 2022, over 13 million COVID-19 pediatric cases have been reported in the U.S. The CDC estimates 209,254 pediatric hospitalizations in the U.S. As of June 2022, there have been 8,525 cases of MIS-C, a serious health condition affecting multiple organs that has been linked to COVID-19 infection. Over 1,200 pediatric deaths* have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S. Although this seems low compared to adults, COVID is now one of the top 10 causes of death for adolescents in the United States. Data from: [https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3) Long COVID has also been reported among kids. The U.K Office for National Statistics is reporting that roughly 12-14% of kids experience long-term side effects of COVID. The Omicron variant has changed the game. It is three times more transmissible than the Delta variant and spreads much more quickly. More quarantine, worsening mental health and school concerns: Those children and teens without the vaccine will likely face more quarantines and more isolation from school, sports, and other activities. This can lead to increased mental health concerns. Myocarditis is an extremely rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, affecting about 26 cases of per one million doses given. That's a 0.0026% risk. Most cases are mild, and teens often recover on their own or with minimal treatment like ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin). In addition, we know that myocarditis is much more common if you get COVID or even the flu, and the risks of heart disease from COVID infection can be more severe and long lasting. The vaccine requires two doses three or four weeks apart, depending upon vaccine. Immunity takes some time to develop- at least two weeks after last the last injection. For example, someone vaccinated in late December won't be fully protected until late January or early February. To be considered up to date on COVID vaccines, [people should receive all recommended boosters.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) Although the risk that fully vaccinated people could become infected with COVID-19 is lower than for unvaccinated people, any fully vaccinated person who experiences [symptoms consistent with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) should [isolate themselves from others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html), be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, and tested for COVID-19, if indicated. The symptomatic fully vaccinated person should inform their healthcare provider of their vaccination status at the time of care.
