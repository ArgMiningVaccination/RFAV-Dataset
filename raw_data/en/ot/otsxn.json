DSM 4 definition of Autism: - Qualitative impairments in social interaction - Qualitative impairments in communication - Repetitive, restrictive, or stereotyped interests - Repetitive, restrictive, or stereotyped interests and behaviors - Symptoms present before age 3 PDD-NOS is similar with less severe symptoms Clinicians see what we are looking for. Not every child who looks autistic has the same issues. How does a biomedical clinician see autism? Developmental symptoms reflect brain dysfunction Brain dysfunction reflects cellular dysfunctiondysfunction Cellular dysfunction involves metabolic insufficiencies, toxic overload, oxidative stress, and immunological overreactivity. What do we see when we look at an autistic child? Aloofness, lack of interest in others Language delays and abnormalities Cognitive delays Sensory hyper-reactivities and under- Sensory hyper-reactivities and under-responsiveness Hyperactivity or lethargy Irritability or emotional reactivity Obsessiveness and persistence Are there physical symptoms present? At least half of children with autism seem to have an intestinal problem chronic loose smelly stool or constipation Seizures are eventually diagnosed in Seizures are eventually diagnosed in about 25% Feeding disorders common Some of these children look sick Frequent Regression 10-50% of children with autism have history of significant developmental regression in the second year. Regressions anecdotally associated with Regressions anecdotally associated with episodes of significant illness or immunizations. Regression frequently associated with the development of physical symptoms Asperger Syndrome Asperger Syndrome is a distinct but related presentation of symptoms including: - No significant language delay - Qualitative impairment in social interaction - Repetitive, restrictive, or stereotyped interests and behaviors - No significant mental retardation Depression, OCD, etc. are common comorbidities Modes of inheritance Chromosomal Transplacental -- 10% of moms Autism higher in assisted pregnancies What about treatment? Behavioral Therapies Educational Therapies Occupational Therapies Conventional Medical Therapies Conventional Medical Therapies Biomedical therapies (e.g. DAN) Alternative therapies (Energy medicine) Behavioral Therapies The most important thing in therapy is to make a connection. Quantity Counts. - ABA - DTT -Therapist directed Skill acquisition is the goal Skill acquisition is the goal - Relationship based - Child directed Parents learn the skills and do the work Connection is the Goal Floortime, Son-Rise, Play to Talk, Others More than 24 hours a week needed Educational Therapies Individual Educational Plan (IEP) Speech, PECS, etc. Academic skills Managing classroom behavior Managing classroom behavior Consider a consultant Occupational therapies Activities of Daily Living Fine motor skills Feeding therapy Assistance with regulation Assistance with regulation - Parenting and teacher guidance Sensory Integration Therapy - Helps to cope with brain dysfunction Adaptations to the overstimulating world Conventional medical therapies Medications can affect irritability, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, sleep, repetitiveness, and self-injurious behavior. - Risperidal and Abilify are only FDA approved - Risperidal and Abilify are only FDA approved medications to treat irritability and aggressiveness in children with autism. - SSRI's not significantly effective in studies - Stimulants can improve attention, hyperactivity, and interaction However... Studies do a poor job of capturing individual responses. The effect sizes are often not impressive. Studies are all short term. Studies are all short term. Side effects can be significant. In my opinion, dramatic clinical responsiveness is as valuable as a randomized trial. But, don't be surprised if meds don't help. What can biomedical therapies treat? Core autistic symptoms Developmental delays Behavioral problems Feeding choices and behaviors Feeding choices and behaviors Medical issues such as diarrhea, constipation, and sleep We can improve the child and family's \"Quality of Life\" What do I see everyday? Children waking up Children calming down Irritability disappearing Bowels normalizing Bowels normalizing Language flowing Affection growing Worsening can be a sign of healing Problems I have also seen treatments not work Minimal good data exist Assessing developmental progress in a developmental disorder with a variable developmental disorder with a variable course Sorting out the individual factors affecting symptoms RCT vs N = 1 Trial Is this child treatable? Predictive tests do not yet exist. The more problems there are, the more likely that there are problems that can be improved (e.g. Maybe we can at least improved (e.g. Maybe we can at least improve the diarrhea). The more quickly a child responds to therapies, the more likely they will be responsive and potentially curable. The hardest question If a particular child is not responding to therapy, is it because that child is \"incurable\"? Or have we just not found the cure? Or have we just not found the cure? How do supplements help? An introduction to biochemistry Biochemistry is the study of the transformation of small molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids into each other and into macromolecules such each other and into macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and cell membranes Enzymes are the proteins that catalyze these chemical reactions. Proteins are made as strings of amino acids that then fold into a 3-dimensional acids that then fold into a 3-dimensional structure The function of enzymes is determined this structure and the specific amino acids that are brought together in its \"active site\" One of the most common amino acids in active sites is cysteine, which has a sulfur group sticking out. If this cysteine is damaged, say by having a mercury atom damaged, say by having a mercury atom attached to it, the enzyme will no longer work. That is how heavy metals do their damage. Vitamins and Minerals Vitamins are small molecules found in foods that the body cannot make itself. Some, like vitamin C and E absorb oxidative stress.oxidative stress. Some like vitamin A and D are hormones Some, like B vitamins act as cofactors for enzymes There are some like coQ10 and carnitine that the body can't make enough of. Many enzymes require cofactors to function, like a power drill and a drill bit. Some people have genetic variant enzymes (SNP's) or damaged enzymes enzymes (SNP's) or damaged enzymes that do not bind the cofactors well. These people need more vitamins than the \"RDA\" Some people need more anti-oxidants to absorb and reverse damage. This is a major role for vitamins in autism. For example vitamin C and E are needed For example vitamin C and E are needed to recycle glutathione. Zinc is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes and can be hard to absorb. A Schematic View of a Cell So, a cell is like an engine Engines don't always run clean Similarly-- A cell that is lacking in sufficient vitamins and partially poisoned by heavy metals like lead and mercury will run rough, losing horsepower and making smog.horsepower and making smog. This is called \"Oxidative Stress\" . Inefficiency makes more toxins Partially metabolized biochemicals Activated oxygen species Interrupted Detox pathways - Phase 1: activation of toxins-free radicals- Phase 1: activation of toxins-free radicals - Phase 2: conjugation and clearance - Conjugation substrates: Glutathione, sulfate, glucaronic acid, SAM Handful of Tylenol,anyone? What is the effect of toxins? Increased oxidative load Biochemical modification of important macromolecules - Enzymes, lipids, Enzymes, lipids, DNA Molecular mimicry - Hormones, neurotransmitters Toxins make more inefficiency Inefficiency leads to the accumulation of more toxins Heavy metals are pervasive toxins Mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic all modify and inactivate enzymes Mercury causes increased oxidative stress Mercury inactivates enzymes involved in Mercury inactivates enzymes involved in detoxification and antioxidant synthesis Heavy metals interfere with heme biosynthesis - urine porphyrins Heme is required for all oxygen transfer Oxidative Stress Deficiencies in Antioxidant MetabolismAutistic Patients Controls P +/- 90 993 +/- 118 <0.05 James et al. 2004, Yorbik et al. 2002 Elevations in Oxidative InjuryAutistic Patients Controls P value Nitric Oxide Products 1.6 +/- 0.5 0.9 +/- 0.22 <0.0001 Lipid Peroxides 32 15 +/- 6 +/- 1 <0.001 Sogut et al. 2003, Zoroglu et al. 2004, Ming 2005 Specific sulfation deficiencies in autistic children Autistic Control Sulfation/ High 2 19 GlycosylationGlycosylation Ratio Low 18 1 Mean ratio 1.1 3.1 P<.00002 This might go with genetic abnormalities in sulfate intake Autistic children seem to have less mercury in their hair \"Baby\" Hair ResultsAverage Mercury Level Autistic Children Normal Children 0.47 mcg/g 3.8 mcg/gP < 0.01 But they also can have more mercury in their urine if chelated. mcg/g creatinine Autistic children (n=221) 4.06 +/- 8.59 Controls 1.29 +/- 1.24 - AM urine collection after DMSA- AM urine collection after DMSA So, maybe autistic kids just have trouble getting mercury out.

The relevant concentration is the The relevant concentration is the concentration in the brain, or specifically in brain cells One carbon metabolism-a central abnormality in autism SAM SAH MTase THF MS B12 Protein synthesis BHMT Methylation AMP Autistic children have specific deficiencies in one- carbon cycle which resolve with therapy with TMG, folinic acid, and methyl B12 Control Children (n=33) Autistic Children (n=20) Autistic ChildrenBaseline Levels After Intervention 30.6 11 Total glutathione 7.9 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 \u00b1 8.9 8.6 \u00b1 3.5 24.8 \u00b1 4.8 Paul Cutler, MD and Jill James, PhD (2004) A few more caveats, This tells us about populations, not about individuals. These values are not easy to obtain, and the ranges in the normal and autistic the ranges in the normal and autistic populations overlap, meaning these measurements cannot be used to define the diagnosis of autism. Nonetheless, This study guides one of the most common and apparently effective treatments we have: - Methylcobalamin- Methylcobalamin - TMG - Folinic acid - Glutathione supplementation (I am not convinced it is absorbed? I prefer NAC) Cerebral folate deficiency A substantial fraction of children with acquired brain dysfunction have low CSF folate. Clinical improvement is seen with Clinical improvement is seen with supplemental folinic or 5-methylfolate. Anti-folic acid receptor antibodies elevated in milk protein allergy Mitochondria Depending on criteria, about 30% of autistic children have mitochondrial \"dysfunction\" \"disease\" \"disease\" This is associated with oxidative stress If nerve cells do not have sufficient energy they will not function. Mitochondrial cocktails available. Immune dysregulation Increased TNF- production by both intestinal and peripheral blood immune cells from autistic children in autistic children with cow's milk intolerance when children with cow's milk intolerance when cells are exposed to cow's milk protein. There are fewer IL-10 positive cells, and more IFN- cells. NO elevated in autistic children Elevated neopterin Brain Inflammation Elevated TNF- in CSF of autistic children Brain specific antiantibodies in 37% vs 13% Autopsy studies of children who suffered Autopsy studies of children who suffered accidental death show marked microglial activation. Many differences in cytokine expression are seen between autistic and nonautistic populations, but there is a lot of variability. How do we treat this inflammation? Heal the gut. HBOT Antibiotics Anti-inflammatory substances Anti-inflammatory substances - Quercetin - Curcumin - Low Dose Naltrexone - Singulair - Pro- and Pre- biotics Antioxidants \"Supplemental\" - Vitamin Fruits and vegetables, Acai, mangosteen, red juices, JuicePlus Other therapies I recommend Epsom salts Omega 3 fatty acids Vitamin A and D, High dose B vitamins Low Dose Naltrexone, First clean up the environment Cleaning supplies Water Plasticizers Pesticides in food Pesticides in food Antibacterial handwashes Excess fluoride and chlorine Wireless Epsom Salts Children with autism are sulfate deficient Epsom Salts are Magnesium sulfate This is an excellent laxative Soaking in Epsom salts allows the Soaking in Epsom salts allows the magnesium and sulfate to soak through the skin One can rub it on as a lotion Omega 3 Fatty acids Fish or krill or algae oil is definitely superior to flax seed oil (ALA). Structural lipids for brain growth and functionfunction Precursors of anti inflamatory prostaglandins Borage or Evening primrose oil (GLA) are anti-inflammatory omega 6 fatty acids Vitamin A and D Vitamin A seems to improve eye contact and activate the immune system. Carotenoids are a good source. Excess retinol can be toxic. Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption and Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption and much more. It is anti-inflammatory and associated with lower risks of multiple sclerosis, BD, and cancer. It reduces respiratory illnesses in children. All children probably need more than 1000 IU per day. Some people need huge doses. Low Dose Naltrexone Naltrexone is an opioid used to prevent narcotic abuse. In low doses, naltrexone appears to up regulate opioid receptors, down regulate regulate opioid receptors, down regulate cellular immunity, and reduce the impact of exposures to dietary opioids. Valtrex Valtrex is an inhibitor of herpes virus replication. In autism, it seems to do something else, possibly through affecting one-carbon possibly through affecting one-carbon metabolism. About 1/3 of patients seem to respond to it. Carnosine,Taurine, and GABA Carnosine is a peptide that has anti-inflammatory and anti oxidant properties, gut healing properties, and positive cognitive effects.cognitive effects. Taurine is an amino acid that is a calming and focusing neurotransmitter, and is a precursor of bile salts. GABA is nature's Valium, it is very soothing for irritable children. What is chelation? Chelation is the administration of chemicals that bind to heavy metals more firmly than the heavy metals bind to proteins. The chemicals used are DMSA, DMPS, and Ca EDTA. These can be given orally, rectally or IV. The patients need to be supplemented with minerals and followed for liver injury. How effective is chelation? No one has any data - 20-30% Very hard to study Hard to distinguish from antioxidant effects Not necessarily benign - Don't do a lot all Not necessarily benign - Don't do a lot all at once. Perhaps one can do as well by healing the detox mechanisms - Infrared sauna? Procognitive medications Often used Namenda - Nicotine Doses of reality There are many paths to autism. There are probably many paths back to normal. There are no reliable tests that identify which of these therapies will be helpful for a given child. There is minimal published data about any of the There is minimal published data about any of the therapies that we recommend, and few have been subjected to randomized trials. None of the doctors who care for these children have summarized their experiences. More of my philosophy I am very skeptical of biomedical therapies, but I have seen simple interventions bring amazing improvements. My impression is that 1/3 get much better, 1/3 get somewhat better, 1/3 do not respond at all. get somewhat better, 1/3 do not respond at all. The only way to know whether biomedical therapy is going to make a difference for a given child is to try it. When it works it is great. Even if the therapies do not cure the core symptoms of autism, they can often bring about significant improvements in quality of life. Biomedical therapies can be expensive and can require great effort. \"What if\" can be expensive too. \"What if\" can be expensive too. So try something reasonable and if it helps, try something else. If you are doing a lot and not getting very far, change directions. The hardest part is knowing whether you have done enough or too much. Implications for healthy children Many non-autistic children exhibit some of the same physiologic abnormalities seen in the autistic population, especially children with chronic allergic or inflammatory conditions and gastrointestinal dysfunction. gastrointestinal dysfunction. ADHD and behavioral problems often respond to similar therapies. It is possible that other disorders might also respond. Emerging Evidence Requires a New Paradigm From To Conventional view Biomedical viewA rare tragic disorder An alarmingly frequent disease Clear, if complex, genetic causes An environmental disease Clear, if complex, genetic causes An environmental disease with genetic risk factors Outcomes are inevitably Outcomes result from preventable events determined in utero A neurology problem A multi disciplinary problem The best and only treatment is Many opportunities for prevention, behavioral therapy treatment, and recovery The children are defective The children are sick Have we seen this paradigm before? Phenylketonuria is an inherited condition which uniformly causes autism and mental retardation. It is a defect in the detoxification of a It is a defect in the detoxification of a phenylalanine. Complications are completely preventable by reducing the toxic load of protein from the diet. Why can't some autism "}
