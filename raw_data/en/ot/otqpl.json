What I love about them both is they are down to earth, very dedicated, and well educated on natural ways to help the human body heal. My favorite part about their practice is they are not into prescribing a large number of supplements. They believe the body can heal on its own with the right help. The supplements they have me on I felt better that day from taking them and Kayla is always happy to provide a research article if I want to know more about the importance of why it would be beneficial to take a supplement they are recommending. I have had tremendous benefit from their homeopathy treatment. Their expertise in homeopathy has helped me heal from stress. I feel Kayla and Taylor are the best doctors in Colorado because they come from the heart. They care about their patients, they take time to listen and they allow you to honor what you feel is best for your body. I am not sure you could find a better doctor. They definitely have been a blessing to my life.\" -HL \"Dr. Kayla Cook at Clear Creek Natural Medicine is THE BEST! I came to her with a variety of complaints, including low energy, not sleeping well, and a long history with depression & anxiety. I had tried the traditional Western Medicine treatment approach for many years with little to no improvement. Dr. Cook was able to get to the heart of the causes of my symptoms and through very individualized & thoughtful care, I can happily say that I am feeling better than I have in years. She takes the time to get to know you and truly cares about how you're doing. She has amazing intuition and provides such useful resources & information to empower you to make changes that will result in drastically improved health. As a result of her care, I have gained much knowledge & confidence in knowing what my body needs to function at its best. She is truly an amazing practitioner.\" -AL \"I've worked with Dr. Taylor over the last year and it has been great. The time he takes to listen and understand the issues and symptoms holistically is fantastic. My wife also sees Dr. Kayla and has seen great results as well. They are running a fantastic practice that comes highly recommended.\" -MS \"Natural medicine needs to become more mainstream. My experience with Clear Creek Natural Medicine has given me back a level of health at 55 year of age that I had long since thought lost. The process of breaking down the issues and treating them individually and collectively with simple tests and lifestyle evaluations created an individual plan for me that just works. I believe our society's overall well being would benefit if everyone could have access to this style of medicine. My treatment did not just improve the health of my body but also my mind. I'm overall a better worker, partner, parent and citizen as result of the care accountability that Dr Lensegrav has "}
