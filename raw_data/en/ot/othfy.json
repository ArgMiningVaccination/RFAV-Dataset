Every year millions of people suffer the annoying and painful effects of sinusitis that can drag on for months or years, with little relief. The sinuses are the cavities around your nasal passages that filter and humidify the air you inhale. The lining of the sinuses contain little hair-like cells, cilia, which collect and sweep out pollutants, micro-organisms, dust, and dirt from the nasal passages. In healthy people, sinus secretions are always moving and draining into the nasal cavity. Sinusitis, when the cavities become inflamed and swollen, occurs when the movement of those secretions is blocked or mucous is thickened. Acute and chronic sinusitis have similar symptoms although acute sinusitis is a temporary infection often associated with a cold or flu that causes the sinuses to become inflamed and blocked, allowing a bacterial infection to develop, possibly with a fever, but clears up a few weeks after the cold has gone. Chronic sinusitis, also known as chronic rhinosinusitis, can last eight to twelve weeks and often longer, symptoms often wax and wane, but it does not cause fever. It mostly affects young and middle aged adults, although children can also suffer from it. If you have chronic sinusitis, it may be difficult to breathe through your nose and you always feel 'blocked' or stuffy. The area around your eyes, cheeks and forehead may feel swollen and tender, you may have throbbing facial pain or a headache, your sense of smell and taste are reduced and you may experience drainage of a thick yellow or greenish mucous from the nose or down the back of the throat. Other symptoms include ear pain, aching in the upper jaw and teeth, a sore throat and bad breath, fatigue and irritability, nasal sounding speech and sometimes a cough which is worse at night. Aeroplane travel, particularly when the plane is descending to land, can be especially painful. As the air pressure in the cabin changes, the pressure doesn't equalise between the sinuses and outside air due to the blockage. As Dr Vogel said, 'tackle the cause of illness and disease, and work in harmony with nature. Man is a unit of body and mind - a marvel of nature and subject to nature's laws.'
