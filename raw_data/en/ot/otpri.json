Advanced treatments like targeted therapy and immunotherapy have also become available to combat cancer more effectively. Of these, some studies suggest that immunotherapy may be more effective. As such, immunotherapy is not a newcomer. It has been available ever since. Of course, immunotherapy may not apply to all cancers. Moreover, immunotherapy is only effective in up to ten out of a hundred cases. Immunotherapy, for example, has long been used in bladder cancer. Early detection of [bladder cancer](https://www.punarjanayurveda.com/blog/treatment-for-bladder-cancer/) can increase the body's Immunity due to BCG injection and prevent the division of cancer cells. Studies have shown that [immunotherapy](https://www.punarjanayurveda.com/blog/what-to-know-about-immunotherapy-in-lung-cancer/) has a mild effect on bladder cancer. In General, Cancer cells first have an impact on the immune system. When the body's immune system is damaged, the number of cancer cells increases exponentially. Immunotherapy involves stimulating the immune system to fight off cancer cells. The immune system contains certain types of cells. T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes that grow antibodies, natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic are some of the cells in the immune system. These cells protect the body from germs that enter the body. Once cancer is detected in the body, all these cells become inactive. Immunotherapy involves the injection of a specific drug into the body to restore the immune system. But unfortunately, only 10 percent of people benefit from treatment provided by immunotherapy. In Rasayan ayurveda, treatment significantly affects people's Immunity and helps to fight against cancer. Many alkaloids are available to boost the Immunity of cancer patients. Depending on the belief, victims may resort to any medicine. But it is possible to increase Immunity quickly by resorting to chemotherapy or Radiation therapy as a supplement. Ayurveda suggests how to boost Immunity through diet as well. Not only Ayurveda, all doctors say Immunity will increase on its own if a healthy diet is adopted. Ayurvedic medicine is more beneficial than immunotherapy because Ayurvedic medicine is innate. Naturally occurring Immunity is very helpful. Rasayana Ayurveda gives vital energy to the body. These are some of the significant differences between Immunotherapy and Rasayana Ayurvedic Medicine.
