Each chakra rules over a different part of your body and different areas of your life, so if a chakra is imbalanced, the body parts and life arenas it rules will also become imbalanced. The good news is that you can clear, charge, and balance your chakras to heal them before physical symptoms ever develop. Working with a [spiritual teacher or energy healer](https://www.blisssanctuaryforwomen.com/activities/healing-retreat/) can help you determine which of your chakras needs balancing and then you can focus on healing those areas. Certain foods can actually help to recharge your chakras, nourish your personal energy and keep you healthy. With this in mind, we have pulled together some foods you can eat to heal your different chakras: Root chakra foods Your first chakra is based at the bottom of your spine and connects you to the physical world, if this is imbalanced you can feel stressed and unsafe. Some foods to help with this include root vegetables such as include beetroot, turnips, potatoes, onions, and parsnips, or proteins such as red meat or if you are vegetarian then lentils or red beans. Hearty harvest grains, red fruits and spices can also help strengthen your connection to the physical world. Sacral chakra foods Your second chakra sits just below your navel and is the base of your emotional body and the place that allows you to feel pleasure, emotions and be in touch with your sexuality and sensuality. This chakra is the essence of life as seen in bodily fluids like blood and tears and lymph. Foods to help heal this chakra include clear liquids, water, orange vegetables and fruits such as mangos, melons and tangerines which all have high water content to help keep this energy centre open and flowing. Solar plexus chakra foods Your third chakra is between your navel and sternum and is the source of your ego and self-esteem. Yellow fruits and vegetables can balance your solar plexus chakra whilst carbs and whole grains can provide you with slow-burning power needed to convert to energy. Digestive-friendly foods can help aid good bacteria in your gut such as yoghurt while herbal teas can help to soothe and relax this chakra. Heart chakra foods Your fourth chakra is the centre of love and compassion for yourself and others and is all about balance. Vibrant green vegetables such as broccoli and kale will help you heal this chakra, as well as green tea, spices such as basil and thyme and green water-based fruits like apples, limes and avocados. Throat chakra foods The fifth chakra is located in your throat and is the first of the spiritual chakras whereby you bring spirit into the physical realm and connect with your true essence. Speaking your truth is the best food you can feed your throat chakra. Liquids can help keep your throat healthy as well as blueberries, plums, peaches and pears. Third eye / Brow chakra foods The sixth chakra, called the brow chakra or the third eye, is located in your forehead and is the control centre for thinking, wisdom, intuition and your ability to plan, forecast, sense and know. Food to help heal this chakra include nuts and seeds packed with antioxidants, water and purple fruits like goji berries, acai and blackberries all optimizing your third eye chakra. Crown chakra foods Your final chakra is your crown chakra, which is your spiritual centre and its nourishment comes from sources other than food including love. It's located on the top part of your head and eating light meals whilst engaging in meditations can energise your crown chakra. Incense and herbs like myrrh and frankincense can awaken your chakra to spiritual communication.
