Nationally credentialeddietetics professionals working inhealth care, academia, public health,the media, government, and the foodindustry are uniquely qualied to ad-vocate for and promote science-basednutrition information to the public,function as primary nutrition edu-cators to health professionals, andactively correct food and nutritionmisinformation. Enormous scienticadvances have been made in thearea of food and nutrition, leading toa ne-tuning of recommendationsabout healthful eating. Consumershave become increasingly aware nutrition-health link and relianton nutrition information to base theirdecisions, and have assumed partialresponsibility for changing their eat-ing behaviors. Unfortunately, thesesame trends also create opportunitiesfor food and nutrition misinformationto flourish. News reports rarely pro-vide enough context for consumers tointerpret or apply the advice given,and preliminary ndings often at-tract unmerited and be andcontain sufcient context to allowconsumers to consider the informa-tion and determine whether it appliesto their unique health and nutritionalneeds. Consistent with ADA's organi-zational vision that members \"are theleading source of nutrition expertise,\"ADA recognizes its responsibility tohelp consumers identify food and nu-trition misinformation in the follow-ing ways: (a) ADA members shouldprovide consumers with sound, sci-ence-based nutrition information andhelp them to recognize misinforma-tion; (b) ADA members need to be theprimary source of sound, science-based nutrition information for themedia and to inform them when mis-information is presented; and (c) ADAmembers should continue to dili-gently work with other health carepractitioners, educators, policy makers,and food and dietary supplement in-dustry representatives to responsiblyaddress the health and psychological,physiological, and economic effects ofnutrition-related misinformation.J Am Diet Assoc. 2006;106:601-607.POSITION STATEMENTIt is the position of the American Die-tetic Association (ADA) that food andnutrition misinformation can haveharmful effects on the health, well-being, and economic status of consum-ers. Nationally credentialed dieteticsprofessionals working in health care,academia, public health, the media,government, and the food industry areuniquely qualied to advocate for andpromote science-based nutrition infor-mation to the public, function as pri-mary nutrition educators to healthprofessionals, and actively correctfood and nutrition misinformation.TYPES OF FOOD AND NUTRITIONMISINFORMATIONConsumers are interested in healthand nutrition information (1) but,although 43% of consumers reportthat they like to hear about new stud-ies, 22% claim to be confused by reports(2). Unfortunately, it is not alwaysclear how to distinguish accurate foodand nutrition information from nutri-tion misinformation. Accurate food andnutrition information is a result of sig-nicant scientic agreement from stud-ies that have withstood peer reviewand can be replicated. Conversely, foodand nutrition misinformation consistsof erroneous, incomplete, or misleadingscience without any scientic basis atall. It can be disseminated naively orwith malicious or self-serving intent (tosell products, gain attention, or pro-mote the philosophy of a special-inter-est group). Food and nutrition misin-formation may be harmful to aconsumer's health and general well-be-ing and includes food faddism, healthfraud, misdirected eating) specic foods, nutrientsupplements, or combinations of cer-tain foods may cure disease, conveyspecial health benets, or offer quickweight loss. TheSurgeon General'sReport on Nutrition and Healthde-nes the promotion of these foods asinvolving \"false or misleading healthor therapeutic claims\" (3). Althoughfood fads can be exploitative and en-trepreneurial, many people who pro-mote these fads may themselves bevictims of misinformation and maysincerely believe that they are provid-ing accurate information.Health fraudshares many of thecharacteristics of food faddism, exceptit is always deliberate and done forgain. According to the American Die-tetic Association's (ADA's)CompleteFood and Nutrition Guide,\"healthfraud means promotion for nancialgain, a health remedy that doesn'twork\u2014or hasn't yet been proved towork\" and well-being, claimsinclude incorrectinferences or generalizations about thehealth benets of food (5). This type ofclaim misdirects consumers by leadingthem to believe that the foods aremore healthful than is the case. TheFederal Trade Commission has advo-cated providing adequate disclosures tocorrect advertising misinterpretations(6). Such disclosures can be important0002-8223/06/10604-0015$32.00/0doi: 10.1016/j.jada.2006.02.019\u00a92006 by the American Dietetic AssociationJournal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION601tools in qualifying misleading impres-sions from current claims (7). Such mis-leading impressions or \"health halos\"can occur, for example, when a productis advertised as \"low in carbohydrates\"but is still very high in calories (8).HARMFUL EFFECTS ON HEALTH ANDECONOMIC STATUS OF CONSUMERSConsumers are increasingly takingcharge of their self-care (9). Al-though this brings new promise tothe role that sound nutrition infor-mation can play in one's life, it alsomakes people more vulnerable tofood and nutrition misinformationthat can impact their health andeconomic well-being (10). Food andnutrition misinformation may be es-pecially detrimental peoplespend increasing amounts of moneyon weight-loss solutions ($43 billionin 2004) (11). Whether it be related toweight loss or aging, people unrealis-tically look for simple, convenient,low-cost solutions. This leaves themvulnerable to misinformation thatpromises just such solutions.Why Is Food and Nutrition Misinformationon the Rise?The proliferation of functional foodsand dietary supplements has led to anexplosion of misinformation becausethe number of these products has out-paced federal regulations. Consumerspending on functional foods, dietarysupplements, natural/organic foods,and natural personal care productstotaled $168 billion in 2004 (10). Thiswide range of herbal, botanical, andsports supplements, which compriseover half of the dietary supplementindustry, has helped sales increase$13.9 billion in 2004 (12).The Dietary Supplement HealthEducation Act of 1994, which estab-lished guidelines for health claimsand labeling of dietary supplements,shifted the burden of proving the ac-curacy of claims, safety, and qualityto the US Food and Drug Administra-tion (11). This shift may have unin-tentionally led to an undeserved, im-plied level of credibility to food andnutrition misinformation because thefederal government has simply notdiscovered it and reviewed the claim.Although the Food and Drug Admin-istration and the Federal Trade Com-mission have critical roles in dealingwith food and nutrition misinforma-tion (Figure 1), the overwhelmingburden placed on them necessitatesgreater involvement by nutrition pro-fessionals.Short-Term and Long-Term Costs of Foodand Nutrition MisinformationThere are both short-term and long-term costs when nutrition informa-tion is misinterpreted by the media,by consumers, or by the food and sup-plement industry. In the short term,physical harm can occur if there areunknown drug-nutrient interactionsor toxic components in foods. Physicalharm can also occur if the use of prod-ucts leads individuals to delay or toavoid seeking proper health care, or ifit interferes with sound nutrition ed-ucation and practices. Economicharm can occur when purported rem-edies, treatments, and cures fail towork and when products are need-lessly purchased. Because the burdenof proof falls on the federal govern-ment, there are fewer safeguards pre-venting the development of costly anduseless products. The cost of healthfraud can be estimated to be in thebillions of dollars, especially when in-cluding the cost of purchasing prod-ucts that may do no harm but alsoprovide no benet.Long-term costs of food and nutri-tion misinformation also include in-sidious lingering psychological issuesof suspicion and diminished self-ef-cacy. Nutrition misinformation canlead consumers to lose faith in tradi-Functions related to consumermisinformationExamples of laws or acts related to consumermisinformationFood and Drug Administrationwww.fda.govIt is the FDA's role to see that the food weeat is safe and wholesome, thecosmetics we use will not harm us, themedicines and medical devices we useare safe and effective, and thatradiation-emitting products such asmicrowave ovens will not do us harm.Feed and drugs for pets and farmanimals also come under FDA scrutiny.The FDA also ensures that all of theseproducts are labeled truthfully with theinformation that people need to usethem properly.The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (1990,1993). This act required that nutrition labelingbe placed on most foods, and it provided forthe use of claims about the relationshipbetween nutrients and health-relatedconditions.The Dietary Supplement Health and EducationAct (1994). This act helped regulatesupplements by establishing guidelines forclaims and labeling.Federal Trade Commissionwww.ftc.govThe FTC's role is to maintain a competitivemarketplace for both consumers andbusinesses. Two ways it accomplishesthis is by policing misleading claims andanticompetitive practices. The FTC iscomprised of the Bureau of ConsumerProtection, the Bureau of Competition,and the Bureau of Economics.The Wheeler-Lea Amendment (1938). Thisamendment gave the FTC greater latitude inpolicing \"unfair and deceptive acts orpractices.\"The Magnuson-Moss Act (1975). This act gavethe FTC the ability to develop trade regulationrules that have the force of law, including howfood can be advertised.Figure 1.Brief overview of the functions of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).ADA REPORTS 602April 2006 Volume 106 Number 4tional sources of nutrition informa-tion and to provide less attention andcredence to the results of new nd-ings. It may even erode their percep-tion of their ability to condentlymanage a healthful lifestyle. Whenfood and nutrition misinformation iscommon, it is much more difcult togain public trust for future initiativesto improve public health (13).SOURCES OF FOOD AND NUTRITIONMISINFORMATIONConsumers receive nutrition informa-tion from a variety of sources. Accord-ing to the ADA'sNutrition and You:Trends 2002survey (2) and data fromthe Food Marketing Institute (14),consumers report that they receivedthe majority of their nutrition infor-mation from media sources such asmagazines (47%), television (34%),books (29%), and newspapers are physicians (31%), theInternet (21%), product labels (19%),and friends and family (18%). of consumers claimed their nu-trition information professionals (14).Misinterpretation of Scientic Studies inthe MediaScientic progress does not prevent oreliminate food and nutrition misinfor-mation. The media capitalize on pre-liminary research ndings in an ef-fort to enhance audience andreadership ratings. Therefore, it be-comes important that universitiesand research groups that release re-search results to the media use par-ticular caution when presenting theirndings.The International Food Informa-tion Council indicated that the mostpervasive cause of food and nutritionmisinformation related to scienticreporting was the lack of sufcientcontext for consumers to understandthe ndings (15). For instance, whena food or dietary choice was linked toa specic harm or benet, only 13% ofthe stories mentioned how much toeat, and only 21% cited the reference.A content analysis of selected nutri-tion-related news stories reportedduring 2000 to 2005 (16) found fourcommon forms of inaccuracy, includ-ing (a) reporting a correlation as cau-sation, (b) generalizing a study's re-sults to a broader population notrepresented by the study, (c) exagger-ating the size of an effect, and (d)using a single link in a chain of eventsto make predictions about events inthe future. News reports on nutritionrarely provide sufcient context forconsumers to interpret the advicegiven. The stories often fail to notehow much more (or less) of a foodshould be eaten, how often it shouldbe eaten, or to whom the advice ap-plies (17). Both the news media andresearchers must share responsibilityfor reporting accurate, balanced, andcomplete information to the public.Food and Nutrition Misinformation on theInternetThe Internet is a rapidly expandingsource of food and nutrition informa-tion. Forty-six percent of those partic-ipating in a 2005 Food Marketing In-stitute survey said they used theInternet on a regular basis. Althoughpeople are increasingly relying on theInternet for nutrition information(10), consumers must be informedthat the accuracy of information ap-pearing on Web sites is not governedby any regulatory agency. As a result,sites featuring sound, science-basedcontent coexist with sites containingquestionable, inaccurate, or alarmingnutrition information promoted by in-dividuals and groups supporting un-scientic views. Chat rooms, blogs,discussion lists, and electronic bulle-tin boards can provide a forum forexchanging inaccurate nutrition in-formation. In fact, this popularizationof electronic interaction has resultedin rapid and widespread dissemina-tion of misinformation and \"urbanhealth myths.\" Several health organi-zations are addressing the prolifera-tion of misinformation on the Inter-net. It is critical, therefore, thatdietetics professionals be skeptical ofinformation on the Internet, and thatthey are especially careful to provideaccurate, research-supported evi-dence when contributing to these ven-ues.For example, the American MedicalAssociation issued guidelines formedical and health information siteson the Internet (18). The Health Onthe Net Foundation (www.hon.ch)sets ethical standards for Web sitedevelopers and strives to guide healthpractitioners and consumers to usefuland reliable online health informa-tion.Food and Nutrition Misinformation fromIndustryMany food companies are diligentabout communicating accurate infor-mation about their products. In othercases, food and nutrition misinforma-tion may be disseminated by multi-level marketing companies promotingdietary supplements or unprovenweight-loss products. These compa-nies claim that their products canprevent or cure disease. Product liter-ature may contain illegal therapeuticclaims, or product distributors maysupply such information through an-ecdotes and independently publishedliterature (19).Advertising using testimonials alsomay spread misinformation. Peopletend to believe information that is en-dorsed by sports gures, celebrities,teachers, coaches, ministers, legisla-tors, health care workers, media com-mentators, and others they respect.When public role models give scientif-ically unfounded testimonials aboutthe benets of specic nutritionalpractices, the effects can be far-reach-ing and potentially harmful. Rolemodels should carefully examine theaccuracy and reliability of any foodand nutrition information they dis-seminate and sharpen their skills atmaking appropriate inferences fromscientic reports. When they are un-certain about the scientic merit ofnutrition products they are asked toendorse, role models should seek theadvice of a qualied dietetics profes-sional, who must be prepared to pro-vide them with science-based infor-mation.Food and Nutrition Misinformation fromFriends, Family, and CultureSome food beliefs rooted in traditionalcultures or religions are not sup-ported by scientic evidence. Theycan be followed as long as they do notresult in possible harm and economicexploitation.For example, some Latinos andAsians believe that \"hot\" foods (somegrains, oils, and meats) and \"cold\"foods (citrus fruits and dairy foods)have health properties that makethem appropriate for different occa-sions. Despite a high level of cross-cul-ADA REPORTS April 2006Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION603tural agreement regarding whethera food is \"hot\" or \"cold,\" there are dif-ferent cultural recommendationsabout which foods are most appropri-ate to eat under various circum-stances. For instance, many Latinosconsider pregnancy a \"hot\" conditionand believe that pregnant womenshould avoid \"hot\" foods. Conversely,the Chinese believe that pregnancy isa \"cold\" condition during which theexpectant mother should avoid \"cold\"foods to keep herself in balance forgood health. Cultural beliefs may bewell-intended, but it must be realizedthat some of the misinformation theycontain may lead to undesirable con-sequences.COMMUNICATING EVIDENCE-BASEDNUTRITION INFORMATIONThe impact of nutrition informationon promoting healthful lifestyles de-pends on how effectively nutritionmessages are communicated to con-sumers and how well consumers dis-cern science-based advice (20). Nutri-tion information must be presentedwith sufcient context to provide con-sumers with a broader understandingof the issues and to determinewhether it applies to their uniqueneeds (21).The Role of Dietetics ProfessionalsDietetics professionals are prepared todeliver current and emerging science-based nutrition information and shouldbe encouraged to take an active role indisseminating nutrition informationthrough the media and consumer-tar-geted materials (22,23). Initiativessuch as the ADA's national mediaspokesperson program have helped inrelaying accurate nutrition informa-tion to local, state, and national audi-ences and have helped to position die-tetics professionals as the nutritionexperts. However, a competitive eld ofcelebrities, tness experts, psycholo-gists, and others without legitimate nu-trition-related credentials are frequentsources for nutrition-related interviews(24), and they write the majority of thefood and diet-related books. Dieteticsprofessionals must be trained in criticalresearch skills because they have a re-sponsibility to clarify and demystifyconsumer-targeted nutrition messages.They can help to interpret emergingresearch for the media and consumers,and can encourage consumers to look todietetics professionals as nutrition ex-perts.Figure 2provides strategies fordietetics professionals to use in inter-preting and communicating nutritioninformation to the public (22,25). It isthe responsibility of every dietetics pro-fessional to remain current enoughwith scientic literature to be able toaccurately identify and counter foodand nutrition misinformation and notcontribute to it.ADA provides support for membersthrough its Knowledge Center, a lead-ing source of scientically based, ob-jective nutrition information for die-tetics professionals, researchers, themedia, and other health profession-als. Practical, positive nutrition infor-mation is provided to professionalsand consumers by the KnowledgeCenter through recorded nutritionmessages (800/366-1655), NationalNutrition Month, various publications,and ADA's Web site (www.eatright.org), which offers a gateway to govern-ment agencies and many allied profes-sional organizations that focus on foodand nutrition and health.The Role of Allied Health ProfessionalsConsistent nutrition guidance reducesconsumer confusion and reinforces thecredibility of science-based nutritioninformation. For this reason, alliedhealth professionals should collaboratewith dietetics professionals and educa-tors to provide consumer-focusedhealth education, to train medical andhealth personnel, and to implementcommunity nutrition education out-reach efforts. Physicians, nurse practi-tioners, and other health care profes-sionals need to seek the knowledge,skills, and services of dietetics profes-sionals.Although health professionals do notalways seek the skills and advice of adietetics professional, it is importantthat dietetics professionals be assertivein providing their expertise. This maybe in the form of in-house newsletters,e-mail updates, monthly brown-bagpresentations, or simply continuouslyunderscoring their availability.Strategic partnerships between al-lied health professionals and relatedscientic and professional organiza-tions and the nutrition communitycan help to ensure the delivery of con-sistent food and nutrition and healthmessages to consumers. For example,the Food and Nutrition Science Alli-ance is a partnership of seven profes-sional scientic societies whose mem-bers have joined forces to speak withone voice on food and nutrition sci-ence issues. One collaboration re-sulted in the development of the \"TenRed Flags of Junk Science\" (Figure 3).The Role of Government/RegulatoryBodiesVarious government agencies work toregulate and disseminate food and nu-trition information. Through the Foodand Drug Administration's labelingprograms, the government regulatesfood and nutrition information andhealth claims on food and dietary sup-plement labels. Federal agencies pro-Keep tips consistent, positive, short, and simple.Avoid speaking in nutrition jargon.Be careful when using buzzwords the consumers might relate with but impreciselyunderstand.React continually to misinformation, but do not be an alarmist. If you constantlyproclaim danger about food, people will soon believe that nothing is really dangerous.Debates about inconclusive research ndings should be minimized.Stay inside your area of expertise.Emphasize improvement, not perfection.Make the benet to the consumer clear.Be specic; describe an action (eg, \"eat more broccoli\").Show how all foods t into a healthful lifestyle. Do not perpetuate the \"good foods/badfoods\" myth.Do not make unrealistic promises; describe realistic outcomes.Provide examples of foods and activities that reflect the lifestyle, preferences, andculture of your audience.Figure 2.Strategies for communicating accurate nutrition information. Adapted from references22and25.ADA REPORTS 604April 2006 Volume well as sound nutrition andfood safety information through publi-cations and Web sites. Public-privatepartnerships, such as theIt's All AboutYoucampaign, also communicate posi-tive, simple, and consistent messagesto help consumers achieve healthful,active lifestyles.Federal, state, and local govern-ment agencies employ dietetics pro-fessionals for their expertise in nutri-tion. Dietetics professionals work inor collaborate with government agen-cies to help educate the media and thepublic and to develop the public policythat relates to nutrition educationand misinformation.The Role of Media and JournalistsConsumers report the media as theirmost frequent source of food and nu-trition information (14). Collabora-tion between dietetics professionalsand the media is key to consumersreceiving science-based informationabout nutrition issues. This is one im-portant function served by ADAspokespeople, who are credible,trained resources and are easily ac-cessible to the media on a wide rangeof issues. It is through these joint ef-forts that the dissemination of foodand nutrition misinformation can beminimized or avoided.In addition, the public's under-standing of emerging nutrition sci-ence can be increased when journal-istic reporting is accurate, balanced,offers a healthful skepticism, pro-vides practical consumer advice, andpresents reports that reflect soundscientic principles (21). One way ofaddressing this is in the manner thatnutrition studies are interpreted andin the way in which they are reported.Dietetics professionals can proac-tively educate the media about ex-tremist groups that routinely distortfood and nutrition information to pro-mote an ideology or to further an ac-tivist agenda.Figure 4provides ques-tions that journalists can use wheninterpreting a new study, and pro-vides tips on how such studies can bereported to have the desired impact.The Role of ResearchersResearchers should describe theirstudy ndings in a broader context tohelp readers understand the connec-tion with studies that have the sameor different outcomes. Researchersshould lay the groundwork for ensur-ing that their ndings are presentedaccurately by underscoring the differ-ence between correlation and causa-tion and by noting the context of theresults and what size dose (or serv-ing) would be optimal for what type ofeffect. They should also emphasizethe limitations of the ndings, howthey relate to contrary ndings, andthe populations with whom theywould be effective.Knowing the basic biases of jour-nalists and the shortcuts they arelikely to take in reporting researchresults can be useful for researchersin their interviews. Researchersshould communicate ndings in amanner that does not lose the ndings and the implicationsfor consumers.Figure 5provides tips for shar-ing research ndings with others.The Role of the Food and SupplementIndustryThe food and supplement industrycan be the dietetics professional's allyfor providing complete and reliablefood and nutrition information to thepublic. The food industry can helpconsumers understand emerging nu-trition issues by providing accurateinformation. Many food companiesemploy dietetics professionals fortheir expertise in nutrition issues,communications, and consumer af-fairs.Dietetics professionals need to con-tinue to work with the food industryto help shape the public's foodchoices, knowledge of nutrition andhealth, and ability to think more crit-ically about food and nutrition issues.Partnerships between the food indus-try health-focused positive, simple, impartial, andconsistent health messages for con-sumers.The Role of ConsumersConsumers need to recognize quali-ed dietetics professionals as credibleresources for food nutrition informa-tion who can help consumers makesound decisions that match their per-sonal needs. One important skill isknowing how to access credible infor-mation through ADA's Web site orother reputable Web sites.Figure 6lists questions that consumers shouldconsider when reading nutrition in-formation appearing on Web sites.1. Recommendations that promise a quick x.2. Dire warnings of danger from a single product or regimen.3. Claims that sound too good to be true.4. Simplistic conclusions drawn from a complex study.5. Recommendations based on a single study.6. Dramatic statements that are refuted by reputable scientic organizations.7. Lists of \"good\" and \"bad\" foods.8.

Adapted from references8and21.ADA REPORTS April 2006Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION605Many consumers may not be awarethat food and nutrition misinforma-tion exists. Consumers need to scru-tinize product claims and the quali-cations of the source providing thefood and nutrition information. Addi-tional information can be obtained bycontacting local hospitals or universi-ties for local resources and by contact-ing ADA, whose Web site not onlyoffers consumers a referral service toregistered dietitians but also providessound nutrition information ontimely issues.SUMMARYFood and nutrition misinformationcan be a serious threat to publichealth. Consumers who are misin-formed may have a false sense of se-curity about their health and well-being and may delay appropriate,effective health care or replace it withproducts or behaviors that may beharmful to their health. Food and nu-trition misinformation can lead to un-necessary nancial expenditure byconsumers.ADA encourages members to take aproactive role in providing consumerswith objective, science-based nutri-tion information and to help them rec-ognize and avoid being misled by mis-information. Dietetics professionalscan positively shape the nutritionchoices of Americans in many ways,including the following:stay current with the latest nutri-tion science;collaborate with the media to com-municate science-based nutritioninformation to consumers and tocounter food and nutrition misin-formation;direct reporters and consumers toresponsible sources of food and nu-trition information;write letters to the editors of printand electronic newsletters, newspa-pers, and magazines to offer sci-ence-based nutrition informationthat counters inaccurate and biasedinformation;call and express professional con-cern to radio and television pro-grams that interview nutrition ex-tremists and other sources ofmisinformation;encourage researchers to presenttheir results with a balanced view-point and to provide appropriatecontext for the study;collaborate with the food industryto provide reliable nutrition infor-mation; andcooperate with other health profes-sionals to expose emerging misin-formation, misbeliefs, frauds, andunmerited claims before they arewidely accepted.The challenge of addressing foodand nutrition misinformation is long-standing and persistent. Nationallycredentialed dietetics professionals,in partnership with other health careprofessionals and representatives ofthe food industry, can be a forcefulvoice identifying food and nutritionmisinformation and positively shap-ing food choices.References1.
