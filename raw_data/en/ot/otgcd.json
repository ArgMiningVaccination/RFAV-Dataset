Meeting the needs of individual children is the key purpose of anyeducational organisation, whether it is an early years centre, a school or a service providing outreach provision for pupils in a range of settings.We know also from HMIE's Missing Out report that the group of pupils with individualised educational programmes, which includes most children with autism spectrum disorders, is at risk of missing outon educational opportunities. Autism spectrum disorders, as the name suggests, do not represent a single nor straightforward set ofneeds to be met. The challenges facing education and other professionals, and the young people whose needs are being addressed, are considerable.The key is to see past the presenting issues, oftenbehavioural in nature, to the communication disorders beyond that and to find what works for each individual concerned. This report is about theextent to which the needs of pupils with autismspectrum disorders are being met across a range ofeducational establishments and services. Itevaluates the progress pupils make in their learningand the extent to which they achieve to their fullestpotential within the various forms of provision. Education for Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorders highlights the variety of provision and arrangements for meeting the needs of pupils withASD. Across the various forms of provision, the task group found that most pupils were making good progress towards the targets in their individualised educational programmes. However, theseprogrammes were frequently deficient in either the attention given to addressing the underlying ASD needs or conversely in addressing achievementacross the curriculum. Also, in many cases, the progress of pupils was not tracked systematically, with the result that schools and authorities did nothave sufficiently detailed information about theachievement of pupils with ASD. In addition, parents were not always kept fully informed about the range of provision available for their children. Training for all staff involved in the education ofpupils with ASD was also a key area for development. We need to do better in these highlighted aspects. It is important to get themright because if things go wrong, they can have serious consequences. This report was produced in response to the request of the Scottish Ministers that HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) carry out a task to evaluate and report on the educational provision for pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As part of that task, HMIE was charged with identifying good practice and making recommendations for moving for ward. As part of their evaluative activity, HMIEcommissioned the National Centre for AutismStudies to produce a literature review relating toASD. The literature review provides background toASD and includes information about the range ofapproaches used to teach children with thiscondition. It is published as Appendix 3 of thisreport and can be downloaded from the HMIEwebsite, www.hmie.gov.uk . Ensuring that all pupils succeed is a fundamental aim of Scottish education and essential to the achievement of excellence for all. I commend thisreport to you as an important contribution to ourunderstanding of autism spectrum disorders and the extent to which the needs of pupils with these conditions are currently being met.

INTRODUCTION At the request of Scottish Ministers, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) carried out a task toevaluate and report on the educational provision for pupils1with autism spectrum disorders (ASD2) in Scotland. The remit for the task was to: identify and report on the range of educational provision for pupils with ASD, including other specialist and mainstream services such as speech and language therapy ser vices, where these impinge on education; evaluate provision; identify and report on good practice; and make recommendations for moving forward. An advisory group3commented on the work of the task as it developed. The remit for the group ofexpert professionals and stakeholders was to: advise HMIE during the planning and implementation of the review of educational provision for children and young people withASD in Scotland; assist in the process of identifying key areas that should be investigated; comment on proposed arrangements for undertaking the task and emerging findings; draw the attention of the task team to relevant sources of evidence, material and expertise as appropriate; and comment on the draft conclusions and recommendations of the review. Legislative background The Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Act 2000 This Act places duties upon local authorities to ensure that schools meet the needs of all their pupils and encourage them to achieve their full potential, and to raise educational standards.The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act, 2004 This Act (known as the ASL Act) requires education authorities to replace the system for assessment and recording of children and young people with specialeducational needs with a new framework around additional support needs. The Act defines additional support needs more broadly than special educationalneeds. The Act extends the duties of local authorities towards pupils, as outlined in the Standards in Scotland's Schools Act, to individual pupils. Childrenare defined as having additional support needs under the terms of the ASL Act if they require additional support to that which might normally be provided inaschool to ensure that they make good progress in their learning. Schools have a key role to play in maximising the potential, raising the achievementand addressing the learning needs of all learners. Atthe commencement of the Act 4,Records of Needs could no longer be opened. Advice for schools andeducation authorities on implementing the terms ofthe Act are contained in Supporting children's learning: code of practice (2005)5. The framework for the task The aim of the task was to evaluate provision for pupils with ASD and to determine how well theneeds of individual pupils with ASD were being met.Tocarryout the task, HMIE made reference to the evaluative framework set out in How good is our school? .6This framework, used in all school inspections, contains a set of generic quality indicators which are used to evaluate the quality of education. To the generic evaluative framework, thetask team brought extensive knowledge of ASD and experience of working with pupils with ASD. The literature review added to the collective knowledge ofthe team. In this way ,the task team was able to apply an ASD specific 'lens' to the generic framework. 11The term 'pupil', for the purposes of this report, includes children under the age of five who attend pre-school provision. 2Autism spectrum disorders. Appendix 1: Glossary contains definitions of this and other terms used in this report. 3Appendix 2: membership of the advisory group. 4The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 was commenced on 15th November 2005. From the date of commencement, the concept of 'special educational needs' as defined in the Education (Scotland) Act, 1980 ceased to exist. The new act introduced the wider concept of 'additional support needs'. 5supporting children' slearning: code of practice, Scottish Executive, 2005 6How good is our school?: Self evaluation using quality indicators, HMIE, 2002 edition The evaluative framework for the task consisted of a selection of quality indicators from How good is our school? .The task team organised these indicators under a set of high level questions which areincreasingly being used by HMIE and other inspection bodies throughout Scotland as a framework to evaluate quality: What outcomes have we achieved? How well do we meet the needs of learners and their families? How good is the education we provide? How good is our management? How good is our leadership? These questions are used later in this report as organisers to set out the findings of the task. Evaluation instruments and interview schedules were developed for the task. These were based onHMIE inspection models and informed by theliterature review and the knowledge and expertiseof the task team. They are available on the HMIEwebsite: www .hmie.gov .uk.Description of evaluative terms used in this report Throughout this report the six-point scale from How good is our school? (updated version, 2005) is used to describe evaluations: level 6 excellent - outstanding, sector-leading level 5 very good - major strengths level 4 good - important strengths with areas for improvement level 3 adequate - strengths just outweigh weaknesses level 2 weak - important weaknesses level 1 unsatisfactory - major weaknesses. The following words are used to describe numbers and proportions throughout the report: almost all over 90% most 75-90% majority 50-74%less than half 15-49%few up to 15%.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 2Conclusion 2. CONCLUSION HM Inspectors found much good practice in relation to the work of education authorities and school and other professional practice that supported pupils with autism spectrum disorders.Pupils' achievements were often good in relation to the targets set for them. Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain for authorities, schools andpartner agencies. Gaps in strategy at education authority level need to be examined and addressed. More attention needs to be paid to what approaches to learning and teaching work for thisgroup of young people and less to analysis of the kind of provision. Targets set out in individualised educational programmes need to have appropriate breadth and level of challenge. Above all, thosewith responsibility for delivering services to pupils with autism spectrum disorders should ensure consistency in the quality of services provided. Thisis a challenging agenda since each individual youngperson affected will need a support package fit forpurpose and aimed specifically at addressing theirindividual needs.This task carried out by HMIE found that education authorities across Scotland have a variety of provision and arrangements to meet the needs of pupils with autism spectrum disorders. In the bestexamples, provision ranged from integration into mainstream primary and secondary schools to placement in special schools. However, educationauthorities often did not share with parents information about the provision for autism spectrum disorders available to them. In some cases, provision was developed in response topressing and immediate need rather than proactively as part of a wider strategy to support all pupils who have additional support needs. Staff training and continual professional development play a crucial role in the ability of each school to meet pupils' individual learningneeds, particularly in an area in which pupils oftenpresent challenging behaviour and apparently poorattitudes to learning. T eachers and support staff should be provided with high quality training to enable them to meet the needs of pupils withautism spectrum disorders and to ensure that thesepupils do not miss out on the educationalopportunities they deserve. 3HMIE carried out the task between January 2005 and March 2006. The task consisted of two separate phases. The first phase of the task was carried out between January and March 2005. It involved two aspects. 1) A literature review relating to ASD7. The National Centre for Autism Studies wascommissioned to produce this up-to-date literature review of ASD as a background to the task. The literature review providesinformation about the background to ASD, its causes and diagnosis. The review includes information from the United Kingdom andfrom international studies about the range of approaches used to teach children with ASD, and the extent to which each approach isused. The review includes a collation of thepublished evidence of the effectiveness of thevarious approaches. 2) An analysis of a questionnaire which was issued to all education authorities (EAs) inScotland.Each EA was asked to provide informationabout the number of children with ASD intheir authority and the provision which wasmade for ASD. The questionnaire also asked for information about provision for staff training. The second phase of the task took place from April 2005 to March 2006. During this phase, a task team was deployed to visit a sample of EAs. Theteam consisted of HM Inspectors with particular qualifications and knowledge of children with additional support needs and ASD, and secondedteam members including a speech and languagetherapist, a social work services manager, a depute headteacher of a large unit for pupils with ASD and an educational psychologist. The task team madevisits to six EAs throughout Scotland to inter viewkey staff and to evaluate practice. The six which were selected (Fife, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Scottish Borders, South Ayrshire and Shetland Isles) provided a representative sample across Scotlandand a balance between large and small, and urban and rural authorities. In addition to visiting the EAs, the task team also visited independent, residentialprovision at Daldorch School (managed by the National Autistic Society) and New Struan School (managed by the Scottish Society for Autism). During each of the visits to an EA, the task team carried out a similar set of activities. They interviewed: education officers with responsibilities for pupils with additional support needs; educational psychologists; social work officers with responsibilities for additional support needs and disability; amanager of speech and language ser vices; afocus group of headteachers; and agroup of parents of children who had ASD 8. The task team visited around six schools9within each authority .The number and type of schools visited varied depending on the size of the authority, the number of pupils with ASD and how the EA had organised its provision. In almost all EAs, the team visited pre-school centres, or nurseryclasses, primar yschools, a secondar yschool, a special school or, where appropriate, units for pupils with ASD which were located withmainstream schools. The team carried out a similar set of activities on the visits to Daldorch School and New Struan School. Visits to schools weresupplemented by inspections undertaken withinHMIE' sgeneral programme. Schools for pupils with ASD which were inspected as part of the general inspection programme during 2005-2006 wereincluded in the data set for this task.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 3. TASK METHODOLOGY 47Appendix 3: Literature Review is available on the HMIE website: www.hmie.gov.uk 8The groups of parents were selected by officers from the authorities. A number of other parents also contacted HMIE independently to provide more personal views of provision for their children. 9Throughout this document the term 'schools' is taken to mean pre-school centres, special schools, primary schools and secondary schools.TASK METHODOLOGY Total number of schools visited for the task Pre-school centres and nursery classes 5 Primary schools 14 Secondary schools 10Special schools and units attached to 3 (schools) mainstream schools (schools) 8 (units) National centres for autism 2 In each school the team: interviewed the headteacher; interviewed teachers and support staff; observed learning and teaching; interviewed a speech and language therapist; where appropriate, interviewed pupils; and where it was possible, met with individual parents. 5\"Autism is a severe disorder of communication, socialisation and flexibility in thinking and behaviour, which involves a different way of processing information and of seeing the world.\"10 In 1943, Kanner11coined the term 'early infantile autism' to describe children with unusual behaviourpatterns that had been present from early childhood. His original paper gave detailed descriptions highlighting extreme autism,obsessiveness, good relationships with objects, a desire for sameness, stereotypy and echolalia. Around the same time, Asperger 12published his original paper in which he described four slightly older and very intellectually able individuals. In hissummary of the typical features of the group, Asperger writes about the children's appearance; their distinct intellectual functioning including theirlearning difficulties and attention problems; theirproblematic behaviour in social situations; and theimpairment of their emotions and instincts. Thesebehaviour patterns differed from, but alsooverlapped with those of Kanner's autism group. Typically, autism spectrum disorders are characterised by a 'triad of impairments' 13 identified by Wing and Gould in 1979. The triad represents three broad and interacting aspects of ASD, all of which will be inconsistent with the presenting individual's chronological age. Thefollowing, by Jordan, is an adaptation of the triad.Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders From the most recent and most rigorous studies, the most accurate overall population estimateavailable for the prevalence of ASD in children isapproximately 60 per 10,000 children (0.6%).However ,findings about the sub-groupings within this differ and variations in prevalence may exist atalocal level. 14 The following set of charts and tables presents a synopsis of the information provided by education authorities in response to the HMIE questionnaire. The questionnaire asked each education authorityabout their provision for pupils with ASD. The charts and tables cover the range of provision in authorities and the numbers of children supported,along with the types of specialist education therapies used to meet the needs of pupils with ASD.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 4. WHAT ARE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? 6The triad of impairments Social Impaired, deviant and delayed or atypical social development, especially interpersonaldevelopment. The variation may be from 'autistic aloofness' to 'active but odd' characteristics. Language and communication Impaired and deviant language and communication, verbal and non-verbal. Deviant semantic and pragmatic aspects of language. Thought and behaviour Rigidity of thought and behaviour and impoverished social imagination. Ritualistic behaviour, reliance on routines, extreme delay orabsence of 'pretend play'. 10Jordan, R. (1999) The Nature and Definition of Autism.

There is no simple relationship between the number of pupils in each authority and the number identified with ASD. Chart 1 shows the total pupil population in each education authority. Chart 2 shows thenumbers of pupils with ASD, as reported by each EA, as a percentage of the total school population within each authority. Throughout the country, educationauthorities use different criteria to determine those children and young people for whom they will make provision. Some authorities make provision for those who have a formal medical diagnosis of ASD. Othersmake provision for all learners who display characteristics of ASD whether or not this is supported by a formal medical diagnosis.

Some authorities were developing pre-school provision which aimed to ensure early identification of ASD and other learning difficulties through inter-agency working, and to provide related support for children and their families. In the best practice, authorities did not limit support to those childrenwith a formal medical diagnosis of ASD. Someauthorities were unclear whether certain childrenhad been diagnosed or not. This was the case inaround 10% of the national total of children inspecialist pre-school provision. Survey results aresummarised in T able 1. (Comprehensive data on the actual numbers of children with ASD in mainstream nurseries was not gathered in thissurvey.)

Some units contained 'communication' bases which had beenaccredited by the National Autistic Society. Primary units in some authorities operated inclusively, with the children being on the school roll. Around 29% of pupils with ASD in primar yschools were in specialist units, with 67% of these children having been medically diagnosed with ASD. Two authorities were unclear about whether or not theremainder had been diagnosed. HMIE's surveyresults are summarised in Table 2.

PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 8This section of the report provides information on different types of provision and the numbers of pupils served by these provisions in each EA. The figures reflect the information given to HMIE by each EA.PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS Provision in secondary specialist units Just fewer than 60% of EAs made provision in specialist units for children with ASD in secondaryschools. Some of these units had been accredited by the National Autistic Society. In most cases, staff aimed to ensure that pupils were included to someextent in mainstream classes, where appropriate. Many pupils with ASD spent more than half of their time in mainstream classes and the rest in aspecialist base where they followed a curriculum to meet their specific needs. For example, in some authorities, rooms in the units were designed to limit visual distractions, to eliminate superfluous noise and to cater for pupils' various sensitivities.Some secondary schools with specialist units were an integral part of local school cluster arrangements in which the various agencies worked together toease pupils' transition from pre-school to primary,and from primary to secondary school. Some 28%of pupils with ASD in secondar yschools were in specialist units. W ithin these units almost 80% of the children had a medical diagnosis. Some authorities were unclear whether or not theremainder had been diagnosed. Survey results aresummarised in Table 3. Table 3: Provision in secondary specialist units Authorities with provision 20 Number of children supported 276Of those supported: Number of children with diagnosis 220 80% Number of children without diagnosis 12 4% Number of children where EAs were 44 16% unclear if they had a diagnosis or notProvision in schools for children with moderate learning difficulties Over 40% of authorities made provision for children with ASD in schools for children with moderate learning difficulties. These schools typically had 'autism-friendly' groups and gaveconsideration to ensuring an appropriate environment which included specifically-designed work areas and distraction-free spaces. Around 80%of children with ASD in these schools had been medically diagnosed. One authority was unable to quantify how many children with ASD it had in these schools. Survey results are summarised in Table 4. Table 4: Provision in schools for children with moderate learning difficulties Authorities with provision 15 Number of children supported 452 Of those supported: Number of children with diagnosis 363 80% Number of children without diagnosis 89 20% 9Provision in schools for children with severe/complex learning difficulties Around 75% of authorities made provision for children with ASD in schools for children with severe/complex learning difficulties. Over 25% of children in these schools had not been medicallydiagnosed. One authority was unable to quantify how many children with ASD it had in these schools. Survey results are summarised in Table 5. Table 5: Provision in schools for children with severe/complex learning difficulties Authorities with provision 25 Number of children supported 621 Of those supported: Number of children with diagnosis 462 74% Number of children without diagnosis 159 26%Provision in schools for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties Over 30% of authorities made provision for children with ASD in schools for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD). Almost 50% of children in these schools had not been medically diagnosed. Several authorities were unable to quantify how many children with ASD they had in these schools. Survey results are summarised in Table 6. It is likely therefore that the very small numbers in this table reveal under-reporting and under-diagnosis of pupils with ASDwho attend EBD provision.

In some authorities, teachers in these schools were supported by authority stafffrom a range of agencies and also shared support as part of a school cluster. In other cases, teams of teachers with appropriate 15qualifications and experience supported staff who worked with children with ASD in the mainstream sectors. Such arrangements were typically focused on specific staff who would support children as they were identified or transferred to individual schools. Some71% of pupils with ASD in primary schools were in mainstream classes. Around 20% of primary children supported in this way had not beenformally diagnosed and a number of authoritieswere uncertain about whether a diagnosis hadbeen made in 14% of pupils with ASD inmainstream primar yschools. Some 72% of pupils with ASD in secondary schools were in mainstream classes. Some 25% of secondar ypupils supported in this way had not been formally diagnosed and a number of authorities were uncertain aboutwhether a formal medical diagnosis had been madein the case of 12% of pupils with ASD in mainstream secondary schools. Survey results for provision in mainstream schools are summarised inTable 7.

Someauthorities were uncertain about the numbers of children supported through outreach since this often overlapped with other forms of support. Inmany cases, outreach support was provided by an inter-disciplinary team of professionals whose members were allocated to individual schools onthe basis of need. These teams were organised in a number of ways. For example, they could be centralised in an authority or contain members of staff from special schools or units. Members of the team provided support, advice and training to staffin mainstream schools, and also to parents. In some cases, support and development groups were run by psychological ser vices. In one authority ,for example, the outreach team worked initially in conjunction with the Scottish Society for Autism tosupport teachers who worked with specific pupilswith ASD. The team was augmented through theappointment of a development officer. Some 13%of children supported by outreach teams had notbeen formally diagnosed and a number ofauthorities were uncertain about whether adiagnosis had been made in the case of 27% ofpupils. Some authorities were unable to identify within the pupils supported by generic teams which pupils had ASD and which did not. Surveyresults are summarised in Table 8.

The National Autistic Society and the Scottish Society for Autism provide a range of professional qualifications. In addition, a number of education authorities provide entr y-level training for teachers. 11Other forms of provision Most authorities made other types of provision to meet the needs of children with ASD. Theseincluded, for example, the use of home programmes, residential placements and support from independent organisations such as theNational Autistic Society and the Scottish Society for Autism. The numbers of authorities using each type of provision and the numbers of childreninvolved are shown in Table 9. Several authorities used a range of approaches to support home programmes. However, in most cases these approaches supported only a very smallnumber of children and often as a 'trial'. These approaches included Son-Rise 16and Lovaas17 therapy. Support was generally provided by a home visiting teacher ,supported by multi-disciplinar y teams as appropriate, and focused on both children and their families.

See Appendix 1: Glossar yand Appendix 1: Glossary and Appendix 3: Literature Review.Analysis of data from the HMIE questionnaires to each EA indicated that in a number of cases authorities held incomplete data about pupils with ASD. It is important that each EA holds full detailsof the total numbers of pupils with ASD, and their placements. Recommendation 1: Education authorities should ensure that they hold complete information on the numbers ofpupils with autism spectrum disorders for whose education they are responsible to ensure that they develop a coherent strategy for meeting arange of needs. This information should include details of provision for these pupils. Allocation of support and resources should not be restricted tothose pupils with a medical diagnosis of autismspectrum disorders.APPROACHES USED TO TEACH CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 6. APPROACHES USED TO TEACH CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS HMIE's questionnaire asked all education authorities to provide information about the range of approaches they used to support pupils with autism spectrum disorders. All EAs reported that they used a wide range of tools, strategies and resources when makingprovision for pupils with ASD, and when providingsupport for their families. Treatment and Educationof Autistic and related CommunicationHandicapped Children (TEACCH) 18and ASD-specific Speech and Language Therapy were the most common approaches, used by over 60% of authorities. The Hanen19parent programme was used by around 50% of authorities. The Lovaasmethod and Son-Rise programme were used by afew authorities. Other approaches used included: visual communications systems cognitive behavioural therapy 20 social skills training play therapy video interaction guidance psycho-educational profiling social stories21. In delivering these approaches, education staff often worked closely with educational psychologists andspeech and language therapists, although some authorities reported that a shortage of these therapists limited the support they could provide. Mostauthorities were unable to quantify the numbers of children with whom the various approaches were used. The literature review associated with this report describes a number of the approaches which are commonly used. The volume of writing aboutinterventions and approaches refers frequently to their widespread use, but the published literature contains little information about actual practice. Afull evaluation of evidence about the effectiveness of individual approaches is provided in the literature review. The literature review supports the view that no specific approach to intervention brings greaterbenefit across the spectrum, or that any sub-groupof children benefits from any one particularintervention. The following key points are takenfrom the literature review. Methodological difficulties within studies mean that definitive evidence of the effectiveness ofany one approach, and the contrastingeffectiveness of one approach compared toanother ,is not available. Most approaches offer some evidence of positive and useful intervention results, and an eclecticmodel to supporting people with ASD hasemerged. A\"playful context\" has emerged as a widely used setting for supportive intervention. The use of peer-mediated support and social group contexts is increasing. Environmental structure and socio-constructive 22 teaching techniques tailored to the individual are important components of any support. Intervention approaches which involve the child in prolonged periods of training, or long periods of interaction with only a trained adult, maypreclude involvement of the child in other effective forms of support. The need for early intervention to meet the needs of a child when these needs are initiallyrecognised is apparent. The involvement of parents has emerged as a crucial element in intervention approaches and the need for support for parents and family isemphasised. 23 18TEACCH: Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children. See Appendix 1: Glossary and Appendix 3: Literature Review. 19Hanen programme. 1: Glossary and stories. Appendix 1: Glossar yand Appendix 3: Literature review 22Socio-constructive techniques include approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy and social stories. See Appendix 3: Literature review. 23Appendix 3: Literature review ,page 78. 13Programmes Learning and teaching programmes for autism spectrum disorders should address the needs that arise from ongoing assessment of the pupil in his orher learning environments. Programmes should also take account of the pupil's broader learning needs andthe associated difficulties which can co-exist with autism spectrum disorders. No one 'recipe' will provide the correct approach for all pupils in all situations. It is important for schools and educationauthorities to have a clear understanding of autism spectrum disorders and of the importance of meeting all the learning needs of an individualpupil.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 14Recommendation 2 Education authorities should ensure that they have a suitably varied range of provision to meetthe wide and varying needs of pupils with autism spectrum disorders. They should publish details of their provision for autism spectrum disorders,including planned future developments.WHAT OUTCOMES HAVE SCHOOLS ACHIEVED FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? 7. WHAT OUTCOMES HAVE SCHOOLS ACHIEVED FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? Inspectors evaluated how well pupils made progress in their learning and achieved to their fullestpotential within the various forms of provision. They evaluated pupils' attainment and achievement in all schools and the progress which pupils weremaking in the targets set out in their individualised educational programmes (IEPs). They also considered pupils' achievements in relation tonational levels of attainment and national qualifications, where these were appropriate. An IEP describes in detail the nature of a child's or young person's additional support needs, the ways inwhich these are to be met and the learning outcomes to be achieved. It also specifies whatadditional support is required, including thatrequired from agencies outwith education. Almostall pupils with ASD, in all schools visited as part ofthe sample, had an IEP. In most cases IEPscontained targets in language and communication,mathematics and personal and social development.In a few cases pupils had attainment targets inadditional areas of the curriculum. Increasingly,schools will wish to ensure that IEPs are used toplan for pupils with ASD so that they become successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors 24. Where appropriate, a school should work with appropriate agencies, including health, social work or voluntar yagencies to draw up IEPs so that objectives and ser vices can be coordinated.25An effective IEP for pupils with ASD helps to plan for the pupil's learning targets where additionalsupport is needed, or where support is needed to compensate for an ASD, and to ensure access to the broader curriculum. The quality of IEPs in the schools visited was variable. Although most pupils were makingprogress through the targets as stated in their IEPs, in some cases targets were insufficiently matched topupils' needs and their prior attainment. In a number of schools, generally in mainstreamsettings, targets within IEPs were insufficiently focused and did not always fully address pupils' specific needs in relation to ASD. In contrast, sometargets set for pupils attending specialised provision focused solely on pupils' needs in relation to ASD, for example, their communication and social needs,and did not identify targets for them to achieve more widely. IEPs were not always used effectively as tools to plan for pupils' progress. Education authorities and schools generally did not pay sufficient attention to tracking pupils' individualprogress or to analysing attainment information forpupils with ASD separately from the informationwhich they held for all pupils. For this reason, it wasdifficult for education authorities or schools tocompare the attainment of pupils with ASD withthat of pupils who did not have ASD, or tobenchmark the progress of groups of pupils withASD. Pre-school In most pre-school provision, children with ASD were making good progress and achieving well.They were developing skills in communication andin social interaction. In most centres, staff used arange of formal and informal assessments toidentify children's progress. Children's achievementswere monitored on an individual basis and theirsuccesses were identified and celebrated by staff. Arange of health education professionals, includingspeech and language therapists, were involved insetting appropriate targets for a majority of children. Parents were not always involved in the target setting process. However, most parentsreceived copies of individual targets which had been set for their child. In a few centres, staff were unaware of the school' slonger term targets for children. 1524ACurriculum for Excellence, www .acurriculumforexcellencescotland.gov .uk,Scottish Executive (2004) 25Supporting children's learning: code of practice, Scottish Executive, 2005EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 16Primary schools Overall, pupils in primary schools were making good progress towards the learning targets set within their IEPs, in particular, in targets which had been set for personal and social development. Afew pupils were making good progress within 5-14 levels of attainment in line with their peers. In a few cases learning targets were not sufficiently clear.Some were insufficiently focused on addressing the needs of pupils with ASD while others did not focus enough on improving pupils' attainment across thecurriculum. Teachers held regular reviews of pupils' progress and had good expectations of pupils' achievement and attainment. In the best practice, the speech and language therapy targets were well-integrated into thecurriculum for each pupil. Teaching staffcollaborated with speech and languagetherapists to help learners reach their targetsand achieve the specified outcomes. In one mainstream primar yschool, all targets for IEPs for pupils with ASD were colour coded to tie in with the triad of impairment 26.This careful attention to planning ensured that thespecific, individual needs within the triad foreach pupil were being addressed within thenational 5-14 framework. Secondary schools Overall, pupils made good progress towards targets in their IEPs. Higher attaining pupils generally achieved in line with their peers. In a number of schools, pupils achieved well in ScottishQualification Authority examinations. In a few schools, staff felt that pupils' abilities were not fully demonstrated in examination conditions and that 26Difficulties with social interaction, language and communication, and thought and behaviour . 27Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Networkpupils did not see the value of examinations. Pupils generally had appropriate opportunities to achieve across a range of different experiences. For example, schools made use of alternative ways oforganising the curriculum and certificated pupils' wider achievements through, for example ASDAN awards 27.Pupils' achievements in Outward Bound courses and within the local community were recognised and suitably accredited. Pupils with ASD, in a mainstream secondary school, who were sitting Standard Grade examinations, were able to choose their seats in the examination room and practise mock examinations in these seats. This approachallowed them to familiarise themselves with the unfamiliar examination conditions. Specialist provision and independent special schools Overall, pupils' IEP targets were more focused on addressing ASD than in mainstream schools. Pupilsmade good progress towards achieving individualtargets. Most were making particularly goodprogress in developing communication skills. A fewpupils in specialist units attached to primar yschools made good progress within appropriate 5-14 levels of attainment. However ,afew pupils could have achieved more through the identification of more challenging targets. The independent specialschools in the sample were ver yfocused on individual needs, particularly in targets related to ASD. In a unit for pupils with ASD based in a special school, pupils had personal records ofachievement. Individual booklets followed pupils through their school careers, and were monitored by the senior management team.WHAT OUTCOMES HAVE SCHOOLS ACHIEVED FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? 17Recommendation 3 Education authorities should ensure that schools prepare clear and effective individualised educational programmes for all pupils with autism spectrum disorders and use them as planning tools to meet thespecific and broader learning needs of individual pupils. They should ensure that schools also use individualised educational programmes to track pupils' progress towards meeting their potential. The Scottish Executive, education authorities and other agencies should work together to coordinate support forpupils with autism spectrum disorders, where there is a need. Education authorities should work with healthboards to develop clear procedures for early identification of children with autism spectrum disorders.Impact on pupils Schools should ensure that their pupils are enthusiastic and motivated to learn; have a sense of self-respect, well-being and ambition; respectothers and participate in things going on aroundthem; and have a sense of resilience. Inspectorsevaluated the extent to which pupils displayed such attributes and also what pupils felt about theireducational experiences. Topics for discussion with pupils were selected appropriately to meet theneeds of individual learners, for example, how well they were progressing in their learning, the extent to which they felt included in the life of the school,had friends and enjoyed school. All education authorities and independent schools had recognised the need to develop the range ofservices they provided for pupils with ASD. Overall,schools had a positive impact on children andyoung people. In almost all schools visited, pupilswith ASD had good access to a safe and secureenvironment. Most settings provided opportunitiesfor pupils to develop their social skills and theirabilities to interact through meaningful access toreal life situations. Anumber of schools provided good opportunities for pupils with ASD to engage with mainstream peers in out-of-school activities and clubs.However ,such opportunities were not yet fully developed within all authorities and schools. Residential pupils in the independent schools in thesample had ver ygood opportunities to take part in awide range of community activities during and after the school day. In all settings, most pupils hadaccess to residential educational experiences. However, schools did not usually maintain sufficiently clear records of the uptake of theseexperiences to allow them to plan for any improvements or gaps in the experiences of individuals. A small number of education authoritieshad good links with social work departments to develop out-of-school provision.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 8. HOW WELL DO SCHOOLS MEET THE NEEDS OF LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES? 1828Across Scotland, a variety of titles are used to describe the roles of non-teaching support staff.An educational psychologist and a parent of a boy with ASD put in a successful bid for a 'friendship' project to the Changing ChildrenServices' Fund and were awarded \u00a35,000. They used the funding to organise social outings for pupils with ASD and their peers. For example,one group of boys went to an executive box to watch a premier league football match. Pupils with ASD could choose a mainstream pupil togo with them on the outing. Pre-school In most pre-school centres, children's communication and social interaction needs were well supported through a range of approachesincluding the use of signs, symbols andphotographs. Social skills and interaction werebeing well targeted within activities and routines.In all pre-school centres, children had goodopportunities to interact with their peers. Primar yschools Within mainstream primary schools, pupils generally had good opportunities to transfer the skills they had learned within the school, forexample, in the lunch hall and at playtime. In a fewschools staff needed to consider how pupils could transfer skills between school and home. Most schools provided pupils with access to lunch andafter school clubs. However, schools did not routinely collect information about the uptake of these facilities among pupils with ASD. Secondary schools Secondary schools had the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of pupils by providing good access to a mainstream peer group, to broad curriculum experiences and to the nationalqualifications framework. In a number of secondar y schools pupils were observed to be 'over supported' by non-teaching staff. Pupils reportedthat they viewed auxiliaries and classroom assistants 28as being 'their' teacher and would generally expect their day to be organised, guidedHOW WELL DO SCHOOLS MEET THE NEEDS OF LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES? 19and directed by this member of staff. In one EA it was common practice for the pupil support assistant to transfer with pupils as they moved from primary to secondary school. This provided pupilswith a good level of continuity. However, it resulted in pupils developing an over-dependency on a known adult. Although there were some goodexamples of information being given to help all staff and pupils develop a general understanding of ASD throughout mainstream secondary schools, on the whole there was a lack of awareness of pupils'additional support needs. In a mainstream secondary school, the principal teacher of learning support acted as coordinatorof a flexible curriculum programme which allowed pupils to have access to mainstream subject areas but also ensured that they hadappropriate 'time out' periods. In this way,pupils were enabled to sustain a full day atschool. In one pair of schools, arrangements for the transfer of information from the primar yto the secondar yschool were effective. Staff held a planning meeting prior to transfer. At this meeting information about the best strategiesto encourage learning was identified and shared. Parents and pupil were fully included in the planning meeting. Specialist provision and independent schools Overall, special schools had a very good impact on pupils. Pupils had very good opportunities to transfer skills across different settings in the school. Pupils inspecial schools and units had ver ygood opportunities to transfer the skills they learned in school to community settings and, in the case of bothindependent schools visited, between school settings and care settings. Staff used a good range of communication approaches which supported pupils'learning and encouraged the development of their emotional well-being. One area in which it was difficult for special schools to have a strong impact onpupils' lives was the provision of good role models for behaviour. For example, a strong emphasis on routine during group activities can result in a number ofpupils spending too long waiting to take their turn.Recommendation 4 Schools should ensure that pupils with autism spectrum disorders are given appropriate opportunities to gain an understanding of thesocial world they live in and to develop life skills which they can use outside school. Pupils should be given full opportunities to identify and developtheir personal strengths. Delivery of the curriculum In most education authorities and independent schools the curriculum provided a positive focus onaddressing pupils' ASD-specific needs. Priority was given to addressing pupils' social communication and interactions. A feature of the curriculumthroughout the schools visited was the high degreeof personalisation of pupils' programmes of work.In a number of cases, approaches to enable pupilsto gain access to the wider curriculum were verygood. While break times provided opportunities forpupils to practise social skills in real situations, staffdid not provide sufficiently high levels of support toenable this to happen effectively. In some schools,teachers had no written guidance to help themplan effectively for pupils' learning in the widercurriculum. In these schools, some curricular areas were not adequately covered, curriculum choice was limited and opportunities for pupils to progress in their learning and achieve accreditation were limited. In most schools, and particularly in special and independent schools, speech and languagetherapists gave ver ygood support to aid communication and social interactions. For example, they led social language and social skillsgroups as well as supporting the development of social stories and the effective use of symbols to aid pupils' learning. Pre-school Children in pre-school centres had appropriate access to the early years curriculum, which was suitably adapted and individualised to meet theirneeds. The curriculum paid very good attention to developing children's communication skills and social interaction. In most centres, staff chose fromEDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 20arange of approaches to use with children with ASD to meet individual needs. They established appropriate routines for each day and expected children to respond to their names and to eachother. In a few centres there were insufficient sensory approaches to the curriculum. Primary schools Most pupils in primary schools followed a broad and relevant curriculum which had been suitably individualised to meet their ASD needs. Schools hadawide range of approaches to meet pupils' ASD needs. Most schools made good use of strategies like visual and individual timetables to structurepupils' days. In a few schools, staff did not pay sufficient attention to developing flexibility in pupils' thinking. Pupils were often removed fromstressful situations rather than challenged todevelop coping skills. A few pupils needed to begiven better access to a broad curriculum. Secondar yschools In mainstream secondar yschools most pupils had appropriate access to a broad and relevant curriculum suitably individualised through pupils'IEPs. In a number of schools, increasingly flexibleapproaches were used to meet individual needs. Forexample, a number of schools made use of ASDANawards and courses at Access level. Approaches todeveloping pupils' organisational skills and independence were variable. In a few schools, good use was made of individual timetabling to supportthe development of such skills. In others, classroom assistants supported pupils too closely. Pupils in units attached to secondary schools were notalways able to achieve in the wider school curriculum, for example, missing out on a modern foreign language. Specialist provision and independent schools Most pupils in special schools and units followed a relevant curriculum suitably individualised to meet their ASD needs. A high priority was given to developing pupils' skills in communication andsocial interaction. Most schools made good use of sensory approaches to learning and to structuring pupils' days through various forms of individualisedtimetables. In a few special schools, a concentration on communication and social skills was at the expense of broader curricular experiences. In both independent schools visited, the curriculum offered a very positive focus on addressing pupils' ASD needs. A range of approaches were used tomeet pupils' individual needs in relation to ASD and priority was given to addressing pupils' social and communication needs and the ability to transferthese skills within everyday situations. Positive and child-centred approaches were evident. Approaches to inclusion Most schools provided a very positive focus on social inclusion and promoted an ethos of equality and fairness. In a few EAs the provision and support for pupils was proactive and allowed for goodplanning for transitions. Early decisions made inthese authorities regarding provision andplacement alleviated parental, pupil and staff stress.However ,in a few EAs action plans for pupils with ASD were often developed reactively in response to sudden demands. Some pupils had beeninappropriately placed within mainstream classeswithout appropriate support, and a few had beenplaced in specialist provision who would have had benefited from more mainstream contact. In all education authorities there were generally good opportunities for pupils to have access totheir mainstream peers. In a few education authorities and in both independent schools, access to lunchtime and after-school activities was good.In one authority, a well-planned project for pupils with ASD enabled them to meet their mainstream peers outwith the school. In almost all educationauthorities, respite and community and leisure resources for pupils with ASD were limited. In a mainstream secondar yschool, a pupil with ASD was supported by a specific individualised programme in the community. This programmewas managed by a principal teacher in the school and offered a very high level of support which successfully met the pupil's needs andhelped to develop his communication skills.HOW WELL DO SCHOOLS MEET THE NEEDS OF LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES? 21Specialist provision and independent schools Pupils in specialist provision and independent schools benefited from being in a safe and secure environment where they were very well supported. Staff in most special schools and units made verygood use of the local community to develop a measure of social inclusion for pupils. Staff in most specialist provision for pupils at the secondarystages were developing opportunities for pupils to be included in broad curricular experiences. A few schools needed to put greater efforts into ensuringthat pupils were included in the national qualifications framework and had opportunities for their learning to be fully accredited. Pupils inspecial and independent schools had too little access to a mainstream peer group or opportunities for senior pupils to undertake appropriate workexperiences. Recommendation 5 Schools should ensure that they maximise opportunities for pupils with autism spectrumdisorders to be included socially andeducationally with mainstream peers. Impact on parents and families Education authorities selected the parents who met inspectors. Parents were interviewed either as part of focus groups or individually or in groups within the school their children attended. Most parentswho met with inspectors expressed good levels of satisfaction with the schools their children attended. A number of EAs had invitedrepresentatives of parents to participate in strategy groups to help develop policy. In a small number of authorities, individual parents contacted inspectorsto indicate that they were very unhappy about provision for their children and particularly the ways in which the EA had dealt with decisionsaffecting their child. These parents felt excluded and marginalised. Even parents who expressed satisfaction with their child' scurrent provision reported the occasional lack of planning and clarityabout future provision for their child. They felt that support during the time of diagnosis needed to bebetter and the time taken by the EA to make decisions, especially about transitions from onePre-schools Children in pre-school centres had good access to a mainstream peer group. Examples of shared placements worked well. In a few centres, children were supported to spend part of the week in amainstream nursery and part in a specialist pre- school centre. In this way children had good access to mainstream settings and role models, butalso had specific support for ASD. Primary schools Pupils in primary schools benefited from very good access to peers and to a broad curriculum. Pupils inunits attached to primary schools were well supported in transitions from lessons in mainstream classes to lessons in the unit. Transitionarrangements from primary to secondary schoolwere good, but initial planning for transitions couldhave taken place at an earlier stage. Secondary schools Pupils with ASD in secondary schools had good access to peers and positive role models. In the bestexamples, pupils with ASD were well involved withmainstream peers in classes and in super vised lunchtime activities. However ,inclusion was not without problems in secondary schools. Examples included: difficult social interactions between pupils with ASD and other pupils and reported bullying of pupils with ASD; and inadequate preparation of pupils with ASD for whole-school 'activity days'. In a number of units attached to mainstream schools, specialist teachers and support staff provided subjectteachers with useful information about the needs ofindividual pupils. This approach enabled pupils to be fully included in lessons. Schools did not regularly review the amount of support given to individualpupils to ensure a balanced approach to allowing pupils to develop independence. In a mainstream secondar yschool, pupils who had peers with ASD in their class undertook a 'peer awareness' programme. This programmewas delivered by professionals and parents who had children with ASD. It successfully raised awareness of the needs of pupils with ASD.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 22when they started school. Parents expressed concern that they had insufficient knowledge of school provision and felt that planning for transfer from pre-school to school did not start earlyenough. A few parents would have liked more specialised nursery placements. Primary schools Parents felt well involved in the annual review process. They felt that the range of formal and informal communication between themselves andtheir children's schools was good. They felt well supported by school staff. However, most reported that they did not always have a clear understandingof their children's general progress and were more aware of progress in relation to targets for ASD. Parents were pleased that their child was includedin mainstream settings, but were concerned aboutthe lack of knowledge they had about provision atsecondary stages. Secondar yschools Parents of children in secondar yschools reported that on the whole they were well involved with their children's schools and the annual process.They reported very good contact with schools.However, some parents described a number ofissues which had caused them to become lessconfident in the school's ability to meet theirchildren' sneeds. One example was when the onus was on the parent to contact the school and point out potential areas of difficulty for their child. Parents generally were pleased with their children's progress. A few felt that they could be makingbetter academic progress. In a small number of schools, parents met regularly as a group and provided a network of support for each other .A few parents felt that support from other agencieswas disjointed due to staffing problems. Although parents were satisfied with the work of theteaching and non-teaching staff who had regular contact with their child, a few felt that staff in some mainstream subject areas were not fullyaware of their children' sdifficulties and needs in relation to ASD. Parents would have liked more information about training opportunitiesconcerning ASD.setting to another, should be shortened. Parents did not present a unified view of the type of provision which they felt was 'right' for their children. The most important issue for parents wasfor the school to meet their children's needs and fully involve parents in decision making. Another issue was the amount and quality of informationabout its range of provision that EAs provided parents. Parents reported that they had had easy access to members of staff at school level for support and information. Most parents, irrespective of the type of provision their child attended, reported that there were good levels of communication betweenthe school and home. Inspectors found numerous examples of very positive uses of home-school diaries and parental leaflets focused on ASD. A fewEAs provided very helpful information for parentson authority procedures and useful contact namesand organisations. Although parents were keen thattheir child received the correct support many wereconcerned about their child being 'labelled' by staffand pupils. This was a particular issue inmainstream schools. Afew education authorities invited parents to contribute to training conferences and course programmes. This gave staff very effective insights into family life and was a very powerfulapproach to staff development across allsectors. Pre-school Most parents of children in pre-school centres were satisfied with their children' splacements and their own involvement with the centres they attended. They felt well informed about individual targetswhich centre staff had set for their children's development. They felt that on day-to-day matters they received good quality and regular information.In a small number of individual cases, parents expressed satisfaction that the EA had worked with them to provide an individual package of care andeducation that met the needs of their child and themselves. The main area of concern for parents of pre-school children in all EAs visited was thequestion of where their children would be placedHOW WELL DO SCHOOLS MEET THE NEEDS OF LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES? Specialist provision and independent schools Parents felt fully involved in the annual review process. They were aware of their children's personal targets and felt involved in decision making regarding their children. Parents werepleased with the regular formal and informal communication between themselves and schools. They reported that staff were very supportive ofthem and their children. They felt that their children were well placed and were making good progress. Most parents whose children attended aspecialist unit attached to a mainstream school were pleased that this afforded their children good opportunities to be included with their mainstreampeers. An area of concern for a number of parents was the lack of input from therapy staff within the specialist setting. Parental expectations of what thetwo independent schools visited could achieve fortheir children were ver yhigh. They felt positively about the regular contact they had with the schools, although by geographical necessity thiswas more often by letter or telephone rather thanface to face. They appreciated the well-organisedreview meetings which involved both care andeducation staff and felt that these gave them arounded view of their children's progress. Parentsfelt that the schools were addressing ASD needs very well, but that they were less sure about their children's progress academically. Parents expressedconcerns at high levels of staff turnover and, because of this, the ability of the school to provide consistency of approaches. 23Recommendation 6 Education authorities should ensure that parents receive full information about the provision they make for autism spectrum disorders. They shouldalso ensure that parents are informed of the options available to them when their child transfers from stage to stage or school to school.Education authorities and schools should work closely with parents of children with autism spectrum disorders to plan for progression,particularly at times of transition. They should involve parents in relevant training events about autism spectrum disorders. Where appropriate,people with autism spectrum disorders could be invited to contribute to training programmes for parents and staff.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 249. HOW GOOD IS THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUMDISORDERS? Policy and planning Analysis of the HMIE questionnaires sent to all EAs showed that just over 70% of authorities hadcarried out an audit of the numbers of pupils with ASD or maintained annually-updated figures. Several authorities were unable to quantify thenumbers of pupils with ASD or the number whohad been formally diagnosed. In some cases thiswas due to a lack of communication betweeneducation and health professionals. Otherauthorities considered it more important to identifyeach pupil's individual needs rather than arrive at aspecific diagnosis of ASD. Responses from EAsrevealed a gradual move away from diagnosingautism towards identifying a cluster of needs on theautism spectrum. Several authorities linked theirpolicies for ASD to wider policies for addressingadditional support needs, in line with the Education(Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act. Inthese authorities, support and provision wasinformed by diagnosis but not dependent on it.Most provided a continuum of support to meet awide range of needs. In five authorities, supportwas allocated on the basis of formal diagnosis only . Only around 50% of authorities had recently audited the numbers of children with ASD withineach form of provision. Several authorities were in the process of doing so. Policy development and planning were effective in only two out of the six education authorities inspected, and in one of the independent schools.The EA action plan for pupils with ASD was often only developed reactively in response to a sudden demand. Although appropriate multi-agencyapproaches to developing guidance and advice were in place at strategic levels, these were not always evident at operational levels. In a few EAs,collaborative practice was not yet well developed. Better joint working was needed when developing policies and planning for improvement for ASD.Most EAs needed to develop better planning with social work services. Within one health authority, which serviced two education authorities, speech and language therapy services had set up an Autistic Forumchaired by a child health commissioner. This group influenced strategic planning across the health authority by feeding into children'sservices planning and looking at issues such as diagnostic teams and care pathways.This approach encouraged equity . In one education authority, teachers in special schools worked with partners from healthservices to develop criteria for ASD-specific self-evaluation, which they intended to use toidentify areas for improvement. By workingtogether to identify key aspects for evaluation,they developed a shared understanding of thekey issues in ASD. Afew EAs had developed very good specific guidance on ASD. However ,the majority of education authorities did not give sufficient attention to specific guidance on ASD within theirgeneral policy on additional support needs. In afew education authorities, procedures to deal with challenging behaviours, including the reporting of incidents, were inconsistent. ASD was not reflectedin ser vice and school development planning. A few education authorities had made appropriate use of ASD-specific self-evaluation frameworks to evaluateprovision within schools, but the use of this type of framework was not yet widespread. Staff confidence in working with pupils with ASD Most teachers working directly with pupils with ASD felt they had a good or ver ygood understanding of autism spectrum disorders.Specialist staff felt they were well trained and had relevant knowledge of ASD. They were aware ofrelevant strategies and approaches used to support individual pupils. However, some education authorities did not use the expertise of such staffHOW GOOD IS THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? 25effectively to benefit and train others. The majority ofteachers and non-teaching staff in mainstream schools did not have a sufficiently good working knowledge of ASD. In a few cases, some staff inmainstream schools demonstrated their lack of understanding of ASD by identifying pupils' difficulties as \"bad behaviour\" rather than a form ofcommunication disorder. In almost all authorities, staff found the behaviour of pupils with ASD challenging. Most support staff who worked directly with individual pupils felt that they had sufficient training and support to carry out their jobs effectively. However, in a few cases, support stafffelt they were given too much overall responsibility for specific pupils, sometimes resulting in a pupil's over-reliance on one support assistant. Pre-school Staff in pre-school centres were well motivated and verypositive about their work. They felt that they had good knowledge of ASD in relation to the children in their centres. They felt well supportedby their colleagues and reported strong teamwork.Afew would have liked more opportunities to learn about different approaches which could be usedwith pupils who have ASD. Primar yschools Staff were highly motivated. Most staff within units attached to primary schools were very well qualifiedand had a good knowledge of ASD and individual pupils' needs. Teachers and support staff in mainstream primary classes had good knowledge ofindividual pupils in their classes, but felt that they required more training in ASD in general. In a number of centres staff had access to only a limitedrange of strategies to help pupils to develop appropriate behaviours. Staff felt that they needed to be better aware of behaviour support strategies. Secondary schools Staff working in units attached to mainstream secondary schools were very well qualified and knowledgeable. They felt well supported to carry out their work and believed that their trainingneeds were well met by the EA and through thewell-developed teamwork in their establishments. Good practice in one EA involved all probationer teachers being provided with general training on ASD. However, some staff in secondary schools,more than in other settings, expressed concern that they were often left to develop their own strategies for individual pupils without having a strongenough knowledge of ASD. In none of the EAs visited, did staff in mainstream schools have appropriate levels of expertise in ASD. A few teachers reported that it was difficult to cope withthe pressures of pupils' unpredictable behaviour. Support staff felt that too often subject teachers abdicated too much responsibility to them for supporting, and often teaching, individual pupilswith ASD in mainstream classes. Specialist provision and independent schools Almost all teaching and non-teaching staff in specialist and independent provision were welltrained and well qualified. Staff reported that theyhad a good range of opportunities for staffdevelopment and felt committed to their work.They had a good understanding of ASD and couldchoose from a range of strategies and approachesto meet individual pupils' needs. Most felt they hadbeen given sufficient training to deal with pupils' behavioural needs, although in a few cases individual staff in specialist provision felt that the EAcould do more to develop their skills in this area. Staff working in the two independent schools felt that teamwork was strong and that all members ofthe school community ,including therapists and psychologists, shared information and supported each other. Overall, staff indicated that they neededmore support in developing aspects of the curriculum. Training opportunities for staff and parents All but five of the authorities which completed the HMIE questionnaire provided some ASD-specific training for teaching and other staff who specialised in supporting pupils with ASD. All of the EAs visitedfor the purposes of this investigation provided good access to staff development for teachers. In the best, staff development in ASD was given a highEDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 26priority within the specialist sector and high levels of expertise were evident. Supporting pupils' challenging behaviour was a key focus. In a few education authorities, and within the independentschools, this expertise was used well to create a team of specialists who ably supported other staff, particularly in mainstream schools. Both theindependent special schools visited had comprehensive approaches to training and staff development. Most authorities provided training for non-teaching staff. The opportunities, however, varied across EAs. In most EAs, speech and language therapists and educational psychologists provided effectivesupport and good staff development for staff working in specialist provision. Such support was not provided consistently for staff in mainstreamschools. Support staff would have benefited fromregular updates to their initial training. In most education authorities and both independent schools, staff had access to specificASD accredited courses. In many cases these wereover-subscribed. T eachers from mainstream schools andsupport staff were generally under-represented on ASD training courses. Several authorities offered inter-agency training. In some EAs teaching and support staff were trained together. Aspects of training in ASD were open toall staff in some authorities. Uptake of this trainingwas increasing, much of it delivered throughtwilight and evening sessions. The numbers of staff receiving training, some of which had led to an accredited qualification in autism, had increasedsteadily over the last three sessions (see T able 10). Table 10: Numbers of staff trained to support children with ASD Year 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 Accredited training 81 68 88 Authority training 1866 2687 3752 (teachers) Authority training 670 855 1022 (support staff)Staff training took a number of forms including: sponsoring teachers to pursue post-graduate certificate or diploma qualifications in inclusivepractice containing an option module on ASD; sponsoring teachers to pursue post-graduate certificate or diploma qualifications in ASD; offering training courses which were specifically focused on ASD; and running modular Masters courses in additional support needs. Staff training was delivered in a variety of ways by: authority ASD outreach teams; authority staff teams with expertise in ASD; professionals from other authorities; and independent organisations. In one education authority ,support staff had good opportunities for training through Professional Development Awards in supportingpupils' learning which were delivered inpartnership with a local further educationcollege. In the majority of education authorities effective support networks were in place and were well usedby specialist staff to meet collectively to exchangeideas and discuss issues. They valued thisopportunity to provide a more consistent approach in schools and expressed the need for more frequent opportunities to network in this way. Around 80% of EAs provided ASD-related training for parents. Many used the Early Bird 29and Hanen materials with the latter being delivered by speech and language therapists. Local parent support groups were sometimes used to deliver this trainingand they also contributed to professional staff training. Some authorities also provided awareness raising sessions for parents in the PECS 30and TEACCH systems, and on behaviour management.Training sessions were generally delivered by authority staff but external organisations were occasionally invited to contribute. In most cases, 29Early Bird materials: See Appendix 1: Glossary and Appendix 3: Literature Review. 30PECS: Picture Exchange Communication System. See Appendix 1 GlossaryHOW GOOD IS THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? 27uptake of ASD-related training by parents and sometimes extended family members, had been high. Parental workshops had been popular and were often over-subscribed. One authority wassupporting parental study for the certificate in autism. Recommendation 7 Education authorities should ensure that teaching and support staff have access to a programme ofstaff development relating to autism spectrum disorders. Continuing professional development at an appropriate level should be available to allstaff in schools where there are pupils with autism spectrum disorders. Specialised training should be provided for teachers and non-teaching staff working directly with pupils withautism spectrum disorders. The Scottish Executiveshould work with training providers to ensurethat a comprehensive and progressiveprogramme is available. Management of staff resources All education authorities had structures which provided var ying levels of support to staff in schools. Analysis of the HMIE questionnaire sent to all EAs revealed that around 40% of authorities hadakey person within their centrally deployed staff who provided support to staff who taught pupilswith ASD. In most other authorities, support forstaff was provided by a range of personnelincluding educational psychologists, speech andlanguage therapists, authority continuingprofessional development teams, outreach staff, quality improvement officers for additional support needs and other specialist teams. One authorityhad established a team to provide support specifically for those working with pupils with ASD needs. In addition to providing advice andsupport to schools and parents, the team contributed to strategic development and training in the authority. In other authorities, support wasprovided on a school cluster basis. In one case, each cluster had a teacher who provided enhanced support for pupils with additional support needsincluding ASD. Support and development groups were occasionally led by educational psychologists. Most schools visited managed resources for pupils with ASD effectively. In all secondary schools, a principal teacher of support for learning coordinated support for pupils with ASD. Highlevels of teamwork were evident across all sectors. One authority had a range of provision which effectively supported the individual learning needs of pupils with autism spectrum disorders.The provision in the authority ranged from placement in mainstream schools with support from outreach teachers to split placementsbetween a mainstream and a specialist unit and full time placement within a specialist unit. In almost all education authorities, additional staff were deployed effectively to support individualpupils within a mainstream setting and, if necessary,in specialist settings, particularly in crisis situations.However, in most education authorities, the supportfor pupils with ASD in a mainstream setting wasdependent on classroom assistants. In many cases,the assistant had the main responsibility for thepupil rather than the class teacher . Approaches to inter-agency working There was a clear commitment to inter-agency working. It was recognised that where inter-agencypartnerships were strong they brought benefits for pupils and staff. A range of education and health professionals including speech and languagetherapists were well placed to provide important support to schools, parents and pupils. Their experience and knowledge regarding ASD wasreflected in the practice within a number of schools. However, in a few cases, particularly within mainstream secondar yschools, the input from speech and language therapists was variable and attimes had been reduced, due to staffing levels. Almost all authorities had shortages of speech andlanguage therapists. Inter-agency working was more of an intention rather than a reality in a number of schools. In a few, the only inter-agencyworking took place at annual reviews.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 28In one authority, mainstream staff who had pupils with ASD in their classes, attended a series of workshops on ASD run by thepsychological service. These workshops improved the staff's knowledge of ASD and created a support network for them. As a resultthey were better equipped to meet the needs of pupils with ASD. Inalmost all education authorities, the social work department was not involved early enough with families affected by ASD and was often only involved at a crisis stage. This was frequently putdown to shortages of social workers. Overall, schools ensured that pupils with ASD had access to a range of therapy staff, including verygood input by music and art therapists in mostspecialist provisions and in a few mainstreamschools. Pre-school In pre-school centres, children' sannual reviews were generally well attended by the variousagencies. In addition, in a few centres staffcollaborated effectively with EA teams and madegood use of identified key workers. Most centreshad an appropriate level of input frompsychological services. The involvement of speech and language therapists was, at best, sporadic in a number of centres. A few centres had no therapistinput. Primar yschools In primary schools, annual reviews were generally well attended by the various agencies. ASD support teams provided additional support and valuableoutreach to a number of primar yschools. Input from psychological services was strong in most schools. In afew cases effective collaboration between agencies provided good support to individual families. Some schools did not receive a direct allocation of time from speech and language therapists. Secondary schools In secondary schools, annual reviews were generally well attended by the various agencies. In a small number of schools, therapy staff were involved effectively with parents. ASD support teamsprovided additional support and valuable outreach to a number of secondary schools. Input from psychological services was strong in most schools.In a few schools, inter-agency planning was in response to crisis situations rather than proactive. Input from speech and language therapists wasextremely limited in a number of schools and some had no direct input from social work services. Specialist provision and independent schools Special schools and units had generally good multi- agency attendance at annual reviews. ASD supportteams provided additional support and valuableoutreach to a number of special schools. In most,the input from psychological ser vices was strong. While most special schools had an appropriate allocation of speech and language therapy servicesafew had no ongoing regular input from therapy staff. The independent schools in the sample had good multi-agency attendance at annual reviews. Theyhad strong and regular input from speech andlanguage therapists and psychological services.Input from the careers ser vice was variable. Recommendation 8 Education authorities and agencies should work together to develop plans, share strategies and commit resources to ensure that pupils withautism spectrum disorders receive appropriate support in line with their needs. Plans should be regularly evaluated and reviewed and openlyshared with parents.2910. HOW GOOD IS THE LEADERSHIP OF PROVISION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS? Leadership Most education authorities were able to articulate a clear vision for the development of provision andservices for pupils with ASD in line with the principles and duties outlined in the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act. Allauthorities had a strong desire to continue to improve services and to ensure that any gaps inprovision were filled. A number of EAs were working successfully with partner agencies to develop provision in 'localities' or 'neighbourhoods'. Not all EAs had successfully managed to ensure that their vision for the future was understood, orindeed known by, parents and school staff.Strategic plans for ASD were often stated generallywithin broader developments for additional supportneeds. While it is important to anchor ASD policyand strategy to the legislation, EAs should alsoensure that strategies for ASD are made clear to allrelevant stakeholders. Most education authorities provided good leadership and direction for staff. Most had a clearvision to improve services and provide effectivesupport for pupils with ASD. They demonstratedpositive commitment to provide high quality education within a mainstream setting for pupils with ASD. A few EAs provided appropriatedocumentation which clearly set out the strategy for ASD. Most senior managers in education authorities worked well with a range of agencies to provide a coordinated approach to ASD. However, almost alleducation authorities and independent schools, were insufficiently proactive in developing quality assurance procedures to evaluate practice for pupilswith ASD.One authority showed proactive leadership in meeting the needs of pupils with ASD by usingthe information derived from authority-wideevaluations and advice from an Autism Strategy Group in planning for future provision. In the best practice in schools, headteachers had a clear knowledge and understanding of ASD and had taken opportunities to ensure their ownknowledge remained up-to-date. Those headteachers who actively fulfilled their responsibility for ASD across the school weresuccessful in ensuring that all staff had an appropriate understanding of ASD and were able to meet pupils' needs effectively .In most schools, integrated provision offered good opportunities for pupils to be taught in class groups or individually asrequired and provided them with access tomainstream peer and social opportunities. In one primar yschool, which had a unit for pupils with ASD, the headteacher providedsupport, direction and guidelines throughmonitoring procedures and open flexibleleadership.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 3011. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1: Education authorities should ensure that they hold complete information on the numbers of pupils with autism spectrum disorders for whose education they are responsible to ensure thatthey develop a coherent strategy for meeting a range of needs. This information should include details of provision for these pupils. Allocation ofsupport and resources should not be restricted to those pupils with a medical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. Recommendation 2: Education authorities should ensure that they have a suitably varied range of provision to meet the wide and var ying needs of pupils with autism spectrum disorders. They should publish details of their provision for autism spectrum disorders,including planned future developments. Recommendation 3: Education authorities should ensure that schools prepare clear and effective individualisededucational programmes for all pupils withautism spectrum disorders and use them asplanning tools to meet the specific and broaderlearning needs of individual pupils. They should ensure that schools also use individualised educational programmes to track pupils' progresstowards meeting their potential. The ScottishExecutive, education authorities and otheragencies should work together to coordinatesupport for pupils with autism spectrum disorder , where there is a need. Education authorities should work with health boards to develop clearprocedures for early identification of children with autism spectrum disorders. Recommendation 4: Schools should ensure that pupils with autism spectrum disorders are given appropriate opportunities to gain an understanding of thesocial world they live in and to develop life skills which they can use outside school. Pupils should be given full opportunities to identify and developtheir personal strengths. Recommendation 5: Schools should ensure that they maximise opportunities for pupils with autism spectrum disorders to be included socially and educationally with mainstream peers. Recommendation 6: Education authorities should ensure that parents receive full information about the provision they make for autism spectrum disorders. They should also ensure that parents are informed of theoptions available to them when their child transfers from stage to stage or school to school. Education authorities and schools should work closely withparents of children with autism spectrum disorders to plan for progression, particularly at times of transition. They should involve parents in relevanttraining events about autism spectrum disorders.Where appropriate, people with autism spectrumdisorders could be invited to contribute to trainingprogrammes for parents and staff. Recommendation 7: Education authorities should ensure that teaching and support staff have access to a programme ofstaff development relating to autism spectrumdisorders. Continuing professional development at an appropriate level should be available to all staff in schools where there are pupils with autismspectrum disorders. Specialised training should be provided for teachers and non-teaching staff working directly with pupils with autism spectrumdisorders. The Scottish Executive should work with training providers to ensure that a comprehensive and progressive programme is available. Recommendation 8: Education authorities and agencies should work together to develop plans, share strategies and commit resources to ensure that pupils with autism spectrum disorders receive appropriatesupport in line with their needs. Plans should beregularly evaluated and reviewed and openly shared with parents.311. Additional support Provision which is additional to, or otherwise different from, the education made generally available by an education authority for children and young people of the same age in schools (otherthan special schools) under the management of the education authority. 2. Applied behaviour analysis An approach for changing behaviour that involves the systematic application of a set of principles derived from psychological theories of learning. 3. Asperger syndrome Adisorder that affects the way a person communicates and relates to others. A number of traits of ASD are common to Asperger syndromeincluding: difficulty in communicating difficulty in social relationships alackofimagination and creative play. However ,children, young people and adults with Asperger syndrome usually have fewer problems with language than those with ASD, often speakingfluently though their words can sometimes sound formal or stilted. Children, young people and adults with Asperger syndrome also do not have theaccompanying learning disabilities often associated with ASD; in fact, children, young people and adults with Asperger syndrome are often of averageor above average intelligence. 4. Attention deficit disorder Deficit in the ability to sustain attention. 5. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Adevelopmental disorder of early childhood causing problems with attention, activity levels andimpulsivity .6. Autism Alifelong developmental disability that affects the way a person communicates and relates to people around them. The ability to develop friendships is impaired, as is their capacity to understand otherpeople's feelings. All people with autism have impairments in social interactions, social communication and imagination. This is referred toas the 'triad of impairments'. \"Autism is a severe disorder of communication, socialisation and flexibility in thinking and behaviour, which involvesadifferent way of processing information and of seeing the world.\" Jordan, 1999) 7. Autism spectrum disorders Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are typically characterised by a 'triad of impairments'. Thefollowing description of the triad has been adaptedfrom Jordan R.(1997): Social -Impaired: deviant and delayed or atypical social development, especially interpersonaldevelopment. The variation may be from'autistic aloofness' to 'active but odd'characteristics. Language and communication -Impaired: language and communication, verbaland non-verbal. Deviant semantic and pragmaticaspects of language. Thought and behaviour -Rigidity: Rigidity of thought and behaviour and impoverished social imagination. Ritualistic behaviour ,reliance on routines, extreme delay or absence of 'pretendplay'. All of the above behaviours should be out of keeping with the individual's chronological age.Individual manifestations var ywith the individual' s degree of intelligence, individual personality and presence of additional disorders. In addition,changes in the way the disorder presents itself occur with age, especially in the more able individuals. Many children, young people andadults with ASD also have an over-sensitivity to sound, smells, touch, taste and visual stimulation.APPENDIX 1: GLOSSARYEDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 328. Behaviour disorders Disorders characterised by persistent and repetitive patterns of behaviour that violate societal norms or rules or that seriously impair a person's function. 9. Behaviour therapy Scientifically-based approach to modifying and shaping behaviour by identifying the triggers and reinforcements of specific behaviours. 10.

Challenging behaviour Behaviour of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others islikely to be placed in serious jeopardy .Behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to, or use of, ordinary community facilities, or impair achild's personal growth, development and family life. 12. Coordinator Person responsible for ensuring, so far as is possible, that the ser vices required to deliver the additional support identified in the coordinated support plan are in place for the child or young person and fortaking action to secure ser vices when necessary. 13. Coordinated support plan Astatutory strategic planning document to coordinate the provision of services for those children and youngpeople who meet the criteria, to help them work towards their long-term educational objectives. 14. Cognitive behavioural therapy Atechnique for the treatment of mental disorder that is based on the concept that how peopleperceive the world and themselves influences their behaviour and emotions.15. Communication disorders Impaired ability to communicate usually due to speech, language or hearing disorders. 16. Compulsions Stereotyped behaviours that are repeated again and again. They are not inherently enjoyable, nor do they result in the completion of inherently useful tasks. 17. Developmental delay An abnormal, slower rate of development in which achild demonstrates a functioning level below that observed in most children of the same age. 18. Developmental disabilities Generic term relating to all children and adults with asubstantial continuing disability originating in childhood. 19. Diagnosis The skill of distinguishing one disorder from another. The opinion arrived at as to the nature of adisease. 20. Dysphasia Difficulty in understanding language and in self- expression. 21. Dyspraxia Impairment or immaturity of the organisation of movement with associated problems of language,perception and thought. 22. Early Bird Athree month parental programme, which involves weekly group training sessions and home visits tohelp parents understand about ASD and support parents in developing communication and managing behaviour . 23. Echolalia The repetition or echoing of verbal utterances made by another person.GLOSSARY 3324. Elective mutism Condition in which children talk in one situation, for example, at home, but remain silent elsewhere, for example, at school. 25. Facilitated communication Approach to assist people with no speech or with dysfunctional speech to find alternative means of communication. The facilitator normally supports aclient's hand, wrist or arm while that person uses a communicator to spell out words, phrases or sentences. 26. Functional analysis Careful observation of a previously defined behaviour in a previously defined environment to understand the relationship between the behaviourand the environment. Dictionary of mental handicap, MLindsey 27. Gaze Agaze is a fixed look. It is used in social behaviour as part of the visual checking occurring duringinterpersonal interactions and usually involveslooking at another person's face. Gaze aversion or abnormal eye contact have been reported in individuals with ASD since Kanner's original paperin 1943. 28. Hanen parent programme Atraining programme for caregivers of children who have early language delay. The Hanen Centre in Toronto, Canada, first developed these family- focused, early language interventions to empowerdirect caregivers with the knowledge and experience they need to help children develop language use. They include interactive, experientialgroup sessions for caregivers (there are separate programmes for parents and early childhood teachers) using videotape analysis, groupdiscussions, and simulated practice activities, in combination with individual consultation through videotaping and feedback sessions.29. Hyperactivity Apattern of behaviour in children who have problems concentrating and who are always overactive. 30. Imitation Mimicking to learn a model's behaviour or responses 31. Individualised educational programme Written document which outlines the steps to be taken to help children and young people who have additional support needs to achieve specified learning outcomes. 32. Language disorders Disorders, usually due to cognitive or neurological dysfunction, resulting in problems in symbolisationor in delays in language and speech development. 33. Language skills The use of language for communicative competence. The ability to use language as a toolto aid interaction within society ,via communication with individuals and groups. 34. Lovaas method Intensive, behaviourally-based or training approach to working with young children with ASD, based on the theories of Ivar Lovaas at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles. 35. Nonverbal communication Communication through use of facial expression, posture, gesture and body movement. 36. Obsessions Ideas, images or impulses which enter a person's mind again and again in stereotyped form. They are almost invariably distressing.EDUCATION FOR PUPILS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 3437. PECS The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is an augmented alternative communication system designed to teach functional communication to children with limited speech,using a system of cards that illustrate objects, concepts, and activities. 38. Personal Learning Planning Process by which children, young people and parents are involved in discussions with the school about the goals of learning, including those for personal development. Its focus is on supportingdialogue and ultimately about engaging children and young people in their own learning. 39. Repetitive behaviour Abnormally intense preoccupation with one subject or activity; distress over change; insistence onroutines or rituals with no purpose; repetitivemovements, such as hand flapping. 40. Social stories Use of a short story form to inform a child about a social skill or social meaning. 41. Stereotypy Abehavioural condition characterised by a lack of variation in patterns of thought, motion and speech; by repetition of said patterns; or both.42. Son-Rise Atreatment program for autism, autism spectrum disorders and other disabilities related to communication and interaction. The program was developed by Barry Neil Kaufman and his wifeSamahria Lyte Kaufman in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while working with their own son who was diagnosed with autism as a toddler. 43. TEACCH Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children is a whole- life approach to helping children and adults withASD, developed by Eric Schopler in North Carolina. The principles and concepts of the TEACCH system are improved adaptation; parent collaboration; assessment for individualised treatment; structuredteaching; skill enhancement; cognitive andbehaviour therapy and generalist training. 44. Theory of mind Aphilosophical concept of the understanding one has that another person has an individualperspective on states of affairs, that thisconsciousness depends in part on informationwhich they may have which is not available tooneself and vice versa. 45.
