With advancing age bones loose mass, get weakened, become more prone to osteoporotic fractures. Development of osteoporosis is silent with reduction in total b one mineral content. Bone mineral density is the most important parameter which can measure gravi ty of OP. The T-score of 2.5 or below indicates OP leading to fractures commonly in bones of sp ine, hip and distal extremities. Objective: Purpose of this review is to fin d out currently available as w ell as future approaches those could be beneficial in faster recoveries. Method: Major databases were searched from inception to till January 2020. Relevant main articles and cross references were evaluated. In addition, findings were compared to a previously published review. Pharmacological and bio-molecule interventions decrease bone depletion by reducing bone resorption and enhancing bone f ormation process, and other external stimuli like strengthening muscular and skeletal tissues are em ployed to prevent OP and accelerate fracture healing and normal functioning. Results: A literature review of such interventions showed that bisphosphonates and selective estr ogen receptor modulator treat ment reduces fracture risks in osteoporosis and increase callus formation during fracture repa ir but do not reduce total time of fracture healing. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its analogues prevent OP by promoting callus formation as well as osteogenesis, enhance coup led remodelling and amount of mineralized tissue. When PTH is combined with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) improve mechani cal functioning by integrating new bone tissue with old bone tissue. Restraining and supportiv e therapies like the physical exercises could be beneficial to minimize gravity of osteoporosis. Electr omagnetic field therapy and pulsed ultrasonic therapy could be useful after surgical management of fracture or delayed union. Conclusion: To identify the quantitative effect of these therapies in isola tion or in combination, clinical trials under 244 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. proper experimental settings are especially important. Unlike t he therapies for fracture repair in non- osteoporotic patients, the line of treatment and duration of ea ch therapy in isolati on or in combination with pharmacological agents, biom olecules, physical stimuli, ex ercises and lifestyles are necessary.

Introduction Due to an increase in longevity o f life osteoporo tic fractures are becoming a major cause of morbidity, disability and mortality in elderly people. At least 200 million people worldwide is suffering from osteoporosis (OP). OP is know n as silent disease. It makes bone weak and brittle over the period which results in increased suscep tibility to fractures [1,2]. T his disease develops due to enhanced activity of osteoclastic cells over osteoblastic cells resultin g in low bone mass. The speed of bone mass loss increases in menopause wome n as age advances . Between 60 t o 69-year age women losses 0.6%, 70 to 79 years of age 1.1% and >80 y ears age groups 2.1% of bon e mass per year [3]. It has been estimated that chances to have a fracture (partial or complete discontinuity in bony tissue) in later years of life is higher in women that is 40-45 % as compared to 15-27% in men [4]. Whereas subsequent fractures cha nces are same in both genders a fter an initial fract ure, this indicates prevention of secondary fract ures are important [5,6]. The repair of fractured bone is a postnatal regenerative osteog enesis process like ontological events of embryonic skeletal development [7-11]. The process of fracture healing is summarized in Figure 1. Age is a major risk factor in case for osteoporotic fractures, as longevity of life has increased as compared to past. As a person reaches at the age of 60 years or above chances of the fragility fractures increase roughly 90% [12]. Some of the factors which predispose risk of osteoporosis a r e l i s t e d in Table 1. Few extrinsic and intrinsic fact ors also contribute in delaying fracture healing and regeneration process. Smoking, low body weight and excess alcohol are such e xtrinsic whereas menopause, vitamin D deficiency, prolonged immobili zation, and low calcium are suc h intrinsic factors [13]. As there is no such method to meas ure the bone mass directly, W HO has approved the bone mineral density (BMD) to predict fracture risk [14]. It has sta ndardized the values for BMD in terms of T-scores, standard deviations as per the young adult's mean as given in Table 2. The T-score is a division value of standard deviation of the di fference between patient's BMD and young normal BMD by the standard deviation of the young nor mal population. It is a score whose mean is zero and variance is one. Hence, the T-score measures t he standard deviation around mean BMD of young normal population. The gravity of osteoporosis inc reases as the T-score decreases. The OP patients will always lie on left side of the distribution an d its gravity increases with increased distance towards left from centre of the distribution for T-sco res. It permits the diagnosis of OP before the fracture occurs. The diagnosis of OP is with cut point set for T = 2.5 or less. The World Health Organization has recommended T-sc ore values for OP in advance o f fracture incidence. Normal T-245 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. score lies between 1 and +1. The patients with low BMD will ha ve T-score between 2.5 and 1.0 while the patients with danger of fractures will have T-score b elow 2.5 [15]. Figure 1. Process of fracture healing. 246 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. Table 1. Osteoporosis risk factors.

World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for osteoporosis clas sification. Classification T-score Normal 1.0 or greater Low bone mass (osteopenia) Between 1.0 and 2.5 Osteoporosis 2.5 and below Severe osteoporosis 2.5 and be low + fragility fracture Secondary OP could be gluco-corticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO P). The gluco-corticoids decrease osteoblast differentiat ion and increase osteoclastogen esis which results in disruption of normal bone architecture. BMD al one is not sufficient to assess internal bone structur e thus the fracture risk in GIOP. Femoral neck, vert ebrae, distal region of radius, pelvis, femur shaft are most common fracture sites under OP. A Fractur e Risk Assessment Score (FRAX ) [16,17] is in use for assessing risk of fracture in OP. This score in cludes parameters like age, his tory of fall or previous fracture, usage of glucocorticoids along with medical conditions like diabetes, sm oking, rheumatoid arthritis and alcohol consumption [18-20]. The most common site for osteoporotic fractures is hip, there a fter spine and distal forearm which impairs the quality of life of the affected patients [13]. Base d on prevalence of OP in modern society 247 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. due to lifestyle changes, risk of dying is same in both 50-year -old women having hip fracture due to OP or a breast cancer [21]. Surgical treatment is an elective intervention in some fracture s (such as hip fracture), but a delay in such fracture repair is comm on which complicate the problem further [22,23]. Although the prevention of fractur e is certainly the goal in OP , an accelerated and uneventful healing process is certainly desirable. Knowing the chances of delayed and non-union it is important to review the different interven tions available today for fract ure healing in osteoporotic patients. Current treatment plans and approaches in OP are majorly focuse d on pharmacological interventions and screenings. However, non-pharmacological opti ons like physical exercises and other therapeutic devices cannot be overlooked and these can be quite important in preventing OP or promoting fracture healing in OP patients. Recent studies on fr acture healing process revealed several molecular pathways those can t rigger new bone formation, could be beneficial in treating OP and impaired fracture healing. As each elderly patient needs unique interventions due to co-mo rbidities hence which treatment plan is the best treatment for t he healing of fractures in oste oporotic elderly patients is still debatable. This review aims to find out currently available as well as fut ure approaches those could be beneficial in faster recoveries. Most of th e previous reviews on OP, its p revention and fracture repair have covered some specific gender, drug, physical stimulus, nutritio n, bio-molecule in isolation or combination of a few while this article covers majority of the possible preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitation and pain management regimes comprehensively and emphasizes on type of research required on drugs (bisphophonates, hormonal analogues), bio-mol ecules (human monoclonal antibodies, sclerostin and bone morphogenic physical stimuli (electromagnetic and ultrasonic) and post-surgical reh abilitation (physical, behavio ural and pain management) protocols through well designed experiments covering large number and dif ferent category of patients to fill the information gap on mechanism of a ction of therapies and comfort of patients. 2. Pharmacological interventions The pharmacological interventions reducing OP can be grouped in to anti-resorptive agents that decrease bone resorption by inhi biting osteoclast activity and the anabolic agents that increase bone formation by promoting osteoblast activity. These agents also p lay a great role in fracture healing. Besides these pharmacological age nts there are other bio-molecu les which enhance fracture healing through improvement in biological environment and biomechanical functioning. Each of such intervention is r eviewed as under: 2.1. Antiresorptive therapy A systemic search conducted across the Cochrane, Google Scholar and PubMed revealed that the most popular anti-reso rptive osteoporotic me dications used for prevention and treatments of OP are bisphosphonates (BPs), denosuma b and selective estrogen recepto r modulators (SERMs). 248 AIMS Medical 7, Issue 4, 243-268. 2.1.1. Bisphosphonate Bisphosphonates (BPs) are widely used in the treatment of OP as it reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast cell activity [24]. BPs attach hydroxyapa tite binding sites on osteoclast cells surface undergoing bone resorpti on thus reduces bone remodellin g [25]. Inhibitory effects of BPs on bone remodelling process create h inderance in fracture healing in osteoporotic fractures later on affect functional recovery after fractures [26]. A specific group of BPs (al endronate, risedronate, ibandr onate and zoledronic acid) containing nitrogen have to be positi vely affecting the BMD in osteoporotic women after menopause [27,28]. A review of trials published between 2005 and 2019 con firmed that usage of these nitrogen containing BPs was helpful in preventin g the vertebral fracture compared with placebo [29,30]. Specifically, three BPs alendronate, risedronate and z oledronic acid were effective in reducing the chances of havi ng hip and non-vertebral fractures [29,31]. Several studies on animals also reported same BPs effects on bo ne, as they are helpful in new callus formation and reduction in time taken in radius fracture healing [32]. These are also helpful in increasing BMD whereas inhibits bone remodelling process which requires for modulation of callus morphology [33]. In addition to that BPs bolus therapy for 2 weeks after h ip surgery was found helpful in increasing BMD and reducing ov erall mortality significantly [34]. Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled trial (RPCT) study in United Kingdom published in 2019, conducted at multiple centres has found that weekly alend ronate therapy at the rate of 70 mg within 14 days immediately after distal radius fracture healing does not affect adversely the fracture union or any clinical outcome treated either surgically or cons ervatively [35]. Another study reported contrary results on BPs administr ation and found increased risk of delayed union at 3 months in surgically treated inter-tro chanteric fractures patients [36]. It has been established that while treating fractures in osteop orotic patients BPs increase callus volume, bone mineralization and bone-implant contact after surg ery during primary endochondral phase but delays remodelling and healing rate [37-40] . 2.1.2. Denosumab Denosumab is a potent mediator of bone resorption as it is an i nhibitor of osteoclast thus at fracture site it increases callus volume but delays remodelling [41]. Studies on animals have revealed that after binding with RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Fa ctor \"kappa of B-cells Ligand) denosumab prevents RANKL to bind i ts receptor site on cellular surface which is essential for osteoclast differentiation and delayed r emodelling even with better biomechanical properties [42]. However, no significant delay in fracture healing was not iced due to denosumab in patients previously receiving antiresorptive thera py for osteoporosis [43]. It is suggested that clinical studies on the effect of denosumab are clinically inconclusive regarding its effects on delayed or non-union or any kind of impaired fracture healing. Therefore, it warrants further studies for their use in humans. Hanley et al. [44] clearly explained the mechanism of action of Denosumab, molecular pathways and targets of anabolic and antir esorptive treatment through fi gures. The denosumab binds with RANKL and prevents it to activ ate its receptor RANK on surface of osteoclast thereby inhibits osteoclastogenesis and does not decrease bone mass [45] which m akes it a first choice of treatment to prevent vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures [46]. The bi sphonates get embedded in bone tissue 249 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. and binds the bone matrix. Such binding strength and period of action are highest for zolendric acid followed by alendronate and rise dronate in descending order [47 ]. On the other hand, denosumab does not get embedded in bone tissue and as a human monoclonal antib ody it binds RANKL causing dramatic decline in, the bone res orption marker CTX (a fragment of bone collagen protein) after single dose of 60 mg denosumab. Since this effect is reversible hence for re-initiation of this process the treatment is repeated after 9 months [48]. Superiority of twice a year dosing of denosumab over alendronate in increasing cortical BMD and its microarchitectur e was established after long-term studies for 2-3 years [49]. Very recently in June 2019 a recent systemic review and meta-an alysis was conducted by Fang et al. [50] after identifying 1423 records through data ba se search (1266 records on denosumab and 157 on romosozumab) amongst which 260 (225 on denosumab and 35 on romosozumab) were full text articles in E nglish, and only 17 (11 on denosumab and 6 on romosozumab) were randomized clinical trials quali fying the criteria conducting meta-ana lysis. They concl uded that 12-36 denosumab or romoso zumab in osteoporotic patients does not increase the composite as well as specific cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. In composite out come 3 P MACE (three-point major cardiovascular events) that is CV death, myocardial infarction, and stroke comes where as in specific CV outcomes atrial fibrillation, heart failure, aortic and intr acranial aneurism, aor tic dissection, aortic valve disease and serious hypertension comes. However, risk of 4 P MACE (four-point major cardiovascular events, including 3 P MACE and heart failure) ma y increase after romosozumab therapy. 2.1.3. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator Two types of estrogens receptors (ER) ER and ER have been ide ntified on the osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes a nd Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) are a class of compound that interact specif ically through the binding and activation of these in tracellular ER s without affe cting other o rgans in the body [52,53]. T h e t w o m a i n c h e m i c a l c l a s s e s o f S E R M a r e a p p r o v e d f o r c l i n i c a l use. First one Teriphenylethylene derivative which are used to treat breast ca ncer and were derived from Tamoxifen and Toremifene. Other one is Benzothiopene derivative, Raloxife ne, which indicated for the treatment and prevention of OP [53-57]. The action of SERMs on the estrog en receptor affects bone homeostasis by reducing the activity of osteoclasts and reducing bone resor ption. In different clinical trials [58-60] 60 mg/day of raloxifene was found e ffective in pre vention and t reatment of postmenopausal OP. A randomized clinical trial was conducted by Ettinger B et al. [60] on postmenopausal women who met WHO criteria for having OP . Participants were divided r andomly in three groups: first group received 60 mg raloxifene per day, second group received 120 mg raloxifene per day and the third group received placebo pills. Calcium and cholecalciferol suppl ementation were given to patients in all the groups along with the specific treatment. It was conclu ded that raloxifene increased bone mineral density in the spine and femoral neck after assessing i t with dual X-ray absorptiometry and reduced risk of vertebral fract ure as compared to control [60]. Maricic et al . [61] in 2002 in a post hoc analysis concluded that 12 months of raloxifene treatment reduc es the risk of new vertebral fractures by 68% in general population and 66 % in women who previously ha d a vertebral fracture. Thus, helped in reduction of greate r risk for another fra gility fracture. 250 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. 2.2. Anabolic therapy The most common anabolic medications include parathyroid hormon e and its analogues like teriparatide and abaloperitide. The other anabolic agents explo red to treat fractures are strontium ranelate, and certain biomolecu les like sclerostin, bone morpho genetic proteins, fibroblast growth factor, platelet derived growth f actor besides bone marrow graf ts. 2.2.1. Parathyroid hormone a nd its in regul arization of mineral homeosta sis. It is a naturally produced hormone by body. A drug in a form of Teriparatide (TPTD amino a cid 1-34) has been developed to treat OP. Intermitten t injection of such hor mones and analogues to increase their se rum concentration in body such as recomb inant human parathyr oid hormone (rhPTH), teriparatide (TPTD) and abaloparatide is a current regime to stimulate new bone formati on. It increases bone mass and mechanical strength as well to some extent [62]. On meta-analysis (2016) of ra ndomized and quasi randomized cont rolled trials comparing TPTD to placebo in the osteoporotic patients found accelerated fract ure healing and better functional outcomes in osteoporotic women treated with TPTD [63]. Similarly, after reviewing results of few well-controlled retrospective studies, retrospective post hoc s ubgroup analysis and r andomized clinical trials in a systemic review published in 2017, it was suggested that TPTD provides selective advantage to fracture healing or functional recovery in the management of osteoporotic fractures [64]. In a randomized clinical trial on 40 me nopausal women with proximal humerus fracture, no radiological signs of enhanced healing were noticed after daily injections o f 20 mcg TPTD for 4 weeks, and it was suggested that better radiogra phs are required for understandin g TPTD role in fracture healing [65]. The TPTD administration in patients with intertrochanteric frac ture with proximal femoral nail showed improved consid ering pain and qua lity of life [66]. In another study, TPTD showed better results after 6 months cons idering pain, fracture healin g and functional score levels when compared to controls [67]. These studies [62-67] indicate that TPTD could be beneficial in treating osteoporotic fractures in future if studies can be carried out to find out effective dosage and treatment regimens for the same. Parathyroid hormone-related prote in abaloparatide is a syntheti c analogue found to be effective in reducing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. In rats, imp roved fracture healing was found when both TPTD and abaloparatide given in 1:2.5 ratio as compared to 1:4 in human OP trials [68]. The FDA has also approved it for the treatment of post-menopausal O P after a clinical trial conducted on 2463 ambulatory post-menopausal women [69]. Bone remodelling continues thr oughout life but is required to b e accelerated whenever there is a fracture or compression in bones or deformities in articular su rfaces. Daily injection of PTH or its analogues (abaloparatide or terip aratide) maintain calcium (ser um and urinary levels) and phosphorous balance within physiological range resulting in increased bone mass and improving micro-architecture for functional strength [70,71]. This check is done by PTH thro ugh increased RANKL and decreased osteoprotegerin production in osteocytes [72]; increased proliferation (by activating ERK1/2-m-togen- activated protein kinase (Extracellular-signal regulated Kinase 1 and 2, phosphatidylinositol [73] and differentiation of oste of apoptosis through transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and cyclic Adenosine 251 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. monophosphate/protei n kinase (cAMP) [74]. It has also been noticed that PTH activates Wnt (Wingless-related integration site) signalling cells , osteoblasts thus incr easing proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts [75-77]. PTH has been found to reduce production of sclerostin, an osteocyte-specific protein which antagonizes Wnt signalling in bones [78], from osteocytes [79,80]. Therefore, to harvest the beneficial effect of PTH on bone formation its usage be dis continued after 18-24 months before its resorptive action exceeds bone formation [81]. To enhance bone formation for longer period use of abaloparatide (instead of teriparatide) is suggested which incr eases trabecular thickness and its microstructure [82]. Teriparatide enhanced endochondr al ossification through increas ed chondrocyte recruitment and differentiation [83] while PTH fastened the maturation of callus and improved biomec hanical properties [84] by increasing regulatory T-cell p opulation and balancing inflam mation in early stages after trauma [85,86]. It has been noticed that administration of PTH is requ ired at supraphysiological dose rate to produce desired results but it warns a great risk of osteosarcoma [87] a s t h e r e s u l t s regarding routes, timings, doses and duration of i (SrR) works on bone replication to help new bone formation. Ozturan et al. [89] studied SrR effects (450 mg /kg/day) through creating a osteoporotic rat model by ovariec tomy and heparin injection to induce OP. The experimental group had found higher fracture stiffne ss and mechanical strength as they developed more woven bone as compared to control group. It is said that SrR activates pre-os teoblasts in osteoporotic rats [90] and in a few clinical cases reports it was observed that strontium rep laces calcium resulting in increased bone mass [91]. Beneficial effects of SrR were also reported on complicat ed long bone fracture healing [92]. Contrarily, adding SrR to calci um and vitamin D supplementation in patients older than 60 years age treated conservatively with ma nual reduction and cast applicati on didn't reveal any accelerated wrist fracture healing [93]. Use of str ontium ralenate as treatment f or osteoporosis was authorized by the European Union on 21st September 2004. Previously it wa s available under the brand Pr otelos Osseor \u00ae, later on it was removed from European Union market in August 2017 by ceasing its marketing and support on commercial reasons due to its safety usage related t o cardiovascular system in patients treated with it. The strontium ralenate has again returned to market in United K ingdom as an osteoporosis drug treatment in January, 2019. A pha rmaceutical company 'Aristo' h a s n o w s t a r t e d m a n u f a c t u r e o f strontium ralenate and is avail able on prescription for treatin g OP specially in postmenopausal women and adults at high fracture risk who have no other effective ch oice of suitable treatment as stated by Dr. Nicola Peel from Royal Osteoporosis Society, UK. 2.3. Bone morphogenetic proteins A family of peptide cytokines bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs ) pertaining to TGF beta are key tissues in development of r egulators to induce ectopic bone formation. Functioning of different type of cells of osteoblast lin eage, chondroblas t lineage and m esenchymal stem cells have been found 252 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. to be associated with pleiotropic effects of over 30 different types of BMPs to form bony tissues during embryonic and adult stages [94]. In animals, local ad ministration of BMPs was found to be effect ive in fracture he aling and spine fusion [95]. BMP-2, -4 and -7 accelerate chondrogenesis and osteogenes is around periosteum by initiating differentiation of mesenchymal cells in early stages of fracture healing [95,96] while BMP- 3 helps in bone remodelling by antagonising most osteogenic BMP s [95]. In various allogenic or autologous grafts of large and small animals to repair bone def ects BMPs promoted healing [97-99] but clinical complications such as oedema, inflammation and het erotopic ossification restrict their usage [100-102]. Use of NEMO (NF-Kappa-B essential modulator) with BMP-2, have b een reported to be effective in inhibiting NF-kappa B (Nuclear Factor \"kappa-light-chain-enh ancer\" of activated B-cells) and thus reducing inflammation and oedema [103]. However, the short half -life and adverse clinical effects of BMPs restrict their usage in osteoporotic fractures. Use of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) and recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) was also approved by FDA in humans. F or infusion in lumbar spine, m axillary sinus, alveolar ridge strengthening and open tibial fra ctures recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) and recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) for open tibial fracture was given approv al in early 2000s [96]. Improvement in femoral defects of rat was seen when treatment i ncluded rhBMP-2 in conjugation with anti-sclerostin antibodies as co mpared with the group treated w ith anti-sclerostin antibodies alone. Alternative methods have been explored to modulate BMP-2 signal ling pathways using co- polymer-protected gene vectors or viral vectors within fracture site [104,105]. Similarly, non-genetic approaches such as conjugating o ilgoaspartic acid having affini ty to hydroxyapatite at fracture site may be useful in promoting higher concentration of required age nts for local gene transcription of growth factors [106]. 2.4. Sclerostin In mice targeted deletion of an autosomal recessive sclerostin gene has been found to increase bone formation [107] with excellent biochemical stability [108]. It has been noticed that sclerostin secreted by osteocytes inhibit low density lipoprotein receptor r e l a t e d p r o t e i n 5 ( L R P 5 ) a n d / o r lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) to locate recepto rs binding sites thus inhibits activation of Wnt signalling [109-111]. The sclerostin also promotes bone resorption by accelerating RANKL production in osteocytes [112]. Sclerostin also produces immune -neutralizing effect leading to increased rate of bone mass form ation and biochemical stability at skeletal sites [113,114]. Romosozumab, a highly specific monoclonal antibody neutralizes effect of human sclerostin, and it has been successful in decreasing risk of fractures in spine and hip of osteoporotic females by increasing bone mineral density [115-117]. 2.5. Exogenous Intramedullary injection of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and variet y of signalling molecules have shown to boost osteo-metabolism in experimental animals [118-121]. 253 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. Uninfected and aseptic, atrophi diaphysis grafting w ith aspirated bone marrow cres ts in 53 out of 60 patients [122]. A positive association was noticed between number of colonies for ming units in pre-graft in-vitro cellular aliquots and the volume of miner alized callus. The number of th ese colonies in cellular aliquots from seven non-union cases was exceptionally low. It was concluded t hat autologous bone grafting in non- united factures is safe, but its success depends upon the techn ique of quality of harvesting bone marrow and cell preparati on for the graft. Injection of 0.4 or 2.4 mg recombinant fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) hydrogel in transverse or oblique tibial shaft fracture site resulted in higher percen tage of radiographically proven unions without any adverse effects in comparison to those infected wit h plain gelatine hydrogel as placebo [123]. A similar fusion rate and lesse r side effects were found in tre atment with platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a peptide signalling molecule combined with beta tricalcium phosphate matrix in 260 patients (394 joints) requiri ng hind foot or ankle arthrodesis in comparison with the 137 patients (203 joints) treated with autologous bone graft from iliac crest [12 4]. 3. External stimuli to promo te mechanical functioning 3.1. Electromagnetic field (EMF) Application of electromagnetic field (EMF) is used to generate electromagnetic stimulus especially in non-union fractur es [125]. Electro magnetic stimul us lead to 80% success in non-unions [126,127]. Though its success was also demonstrated on delayed union of ti bial fracture [128] but its effectiveness in fre sh fracture was repo rted to be doubtful. On the contrary, after a meta-ana lysis of 11 studies, it was co ncluded that the effect of EMF stimulation is insignificant on delayed union or non-union of l ong bone fractures [129]. In vivo effect of pulsed electromagnetic force (PEMF) applied t hree times per week for six months on 27 postmenopausal women was compared with placebo on 25 women by measuring bone marrow adiposity using magnetic re sonance spectroscopy by Shaoj un li et al. [130]. Application of PEMF produced significant (P < 0.05) increase in lumbar spine a nd hip bone BMD from 1.46% to 2.04%, the serum specific and al telopeptides of type-I collagen (CTX) increased by 9.12%. No significant cha nges in BMD and these biomarkers were seen in placebo group. The PEMF significantly increase d bone specific alkaline phospha tase and beta-catenin concentration with simultaneous decrease in DKK-1 levels after 30 and 60 days, decreased CTX concentration at day 60, and d ecreased RANKL after 60 days with out any significant changes in calcium, phosphorous, sclerostin a nd creatinine levels [131]. T hey noticed a negative association between rate of change in DKK-1 with beta-catenine and rate of change in sclerostin with RANKL/OPG (osteoprotegerin) ratio. A statistically well-designed ra ndomized dou ble-blind trial conducted by Ziegler et al. revealed speedy osseous consolidation afte r high tibial osteotomy especially in patients over 50 years of age having poor bone metabolism on ap plication of extremely low frequency electro-magnetic force of 16 Hz with 6-282-micron T intensity a nd 6mm amplitude emitted as group of pulses (bursts) in send-pause intervals for 7 minutes daily for 30 days. On comparing mean differences using two-tailed Mann- Whitney U-test (N = 48, two s ided level of significance = 0.05, 254 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. power of the test = 80% and confidence interval = 95%) the ELF- PEMF was found effective in increasing bone density, quick filling of osteotomy gaps from l ateral to medial hinge (assessed by X- radiographs), an early increase in bone specific alkaline phosp hatase (responsible for enhanced osteoblast genesis) without any verse change in tartrate-resi stant phosphatase (TRAP (TN F alpha: responsible for inflammation), interleukin-6 (IL-6: responsible for monocytochrome attractant protei n-I (MCP-I: 3.2. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) Pulsed ultrasound has been explor ed for accelera ting fracture h ealing. In vivo animal and clinical trials have shown positive effect of low intensity pulsed ultra sound (LIPUS) on generation and activation of bone cells. It is expected that LIPUS produces pr essure waves which induce favourable biochemical and molecular events at the cellular level but its role in accelerating healing of OP remains uncertain [133-138]. Jason W. Busse et al. (2002) suggested that ultrasound may be b eneficial in fracture healing by producing signals to reduce healing time and disability period associated with delayed union and non- union of fractures leading to subs tantial cost savings [139,140 ]. When a local infection occurs due to bacteria at the fracture s ite, it delays the process of fracture healing and could lead to non-un ion as well. In such septic env ironment fracture doesn't show radiological signs of healing. A surgical intervention may be r equired as infection adds significant delay in bone healing and make situation more challenging. A st udy on 49 patients has observed positive effects of 20 minutes/ day LIPUS treatment along with antibiotics only. LIPU S has been found effective in reducing need for any surgical intervention in sep tic non-union circ umstances [141]. LIPUS was found helpful in reduci ng time taken for facture unio n in three out of seven trial as compared to the placebo group in a study done by Raman Mundi et al in 2009. They included radial, tibial and lateral malleolar fractures in their studies. Wherea s other four trials showed no significant results for the same [142]. Schandelmaier et al. [143] conc luded that LIPUS could not reduc e the time taken for full weight bearing and return to work. It was not even helpful in reducing in need for subsequent operation as well. Whereas a study publishe d in 2017 by Yadollahpour and Sam aneh Rashidi [144] used smaller and continuous mechanical stres s along with LIPUS in their expe rimental group. Investigators suggested that this combination of treatment in a clinical sett ing was effective in c allus formation and improved biological changes. It prevents bone loss and improves bone remodelling. There were few drawbacks in above trials as sample size were sm all, risk of bias was present and inconsistent results. No review offered definitive conclusion h ence extensive long term clinical and experimental studies investiga ting biophysical mechanisms of LI PUS quantifying its effect on bone formation and fracture repair are required. 4. Physical exercises In osteoporotic patients, physic al exercises are effective to p revent and stimulate bone osteogenesis. In a National Health and Examination Survey (NHAN ES I, United States), women doing recreational exercise had 47% low er risk of hip fracture as com pared to those doing little recreational 255 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. exercise [145]. OP agencies like National Osteoporosis Foundati on and International Osteoporosis Foundation recommend physical and weight bearing exercises thro ughout life to prevent OP in later stages [146-149]. A systematic review was published in 2013 by Mariana Barquet Ca rnerio et al. [150] on proximal femur fracture and their postoperative care. They studied findi ngs of randomized controlled trials conducted during 2002-2012 and conclude d importance of physical therapy in function al recovery of the elderly patients. Difficult follow up of elderly patients r educes the sample size and this limits the reliability of the study. In a cohort study, regarding cost a nd effectiveness of protocol used in treating lower limb fractures Pishtiwan H.S. Kalmet (2018) conc luded that permissive weight-b earing protocol has potential to be implemented on fractures of the pelvis and lower extremities an d are beneficial along with surgical interventions in peri- or int ra-articular fractures [151]. Based on analysis of retrospectiv e observational scores obtaine d from medical records through hospital follow up of 294 patie nts Manuel Baer et al. [152] fou nd contrary results on early mobilization and weight bearing. They noticed nil effects on pain and mobili ty of patients during their hospital stay. Though there is scarcity of eviden ce and researches on the quan tification of physical weight bearing and non-weight bearing ex ercises effects on fracture he aling but they are definitely useful in preventing the associated fract ures in high risk osteoporotic e lderly population. Helen Senderovich et al. in 2018 [153] reviewed scholarly artic les to investigate the different exercises on high ris k OP population consid ering fractures chan ces. They include d both high and low impact exercises such as jogging, dancing and step aerobics in high whereas, walking and Tai-chi exercises in low impact exercise s. They found that high impact exercises act as a barrier to the development of OP by reducing loss of BMD and bone stiffness, a nd low impact exercises demonstrated reduction in bone resorption levels while reducing the development of OP. The Tai-chi exercises also demonstrated helpful in attenuated bone loss in osteopenic post-menopausal women [153]. Based on the review dealing with s tudies on the effect of weigh t bearing aerobic exercise (walking, stair climbing, jogging) and stre ngth and resistance exercises (swimming, cycling) it has been inferred that exercises have significant effect on BMD in osteoporotic w omen hence limiting risk of fractures in osteoporotic patients but long t erm exercises are needed to evaluate the complete effects [154]. Although these investigations rev eal positive effect of exercis es in prevention of osteoporosis but the quantification in terms of duration and type of physical ex ercise whether weight bearing or non- weight bearing exercises after fracture of specific bones needs well planned studies such that specific treatment and exercise protocol s can be recommended for specifi c patients. Principles of fracture preventio n and physical rehabilitation o f patients with oste oporotic vertebral and hip fragility fractures were discussed by Erhan and Ataker in 2020 [155]. They concluded that for vertebral fractures maintain stability at fracture site, limit bed rest, and if possible keep some bearable mobility of patient in acute phase; in early phase initiate tho raco-lumbar neuromuscular stability exercise, extend range of motion in upper and lower extremities , conservatively use orthosis to stabilize spine for 8-12 weeks, avoid resistance strengthening; in rehabilitation phase evaluate improvement radiologically, perf orm pain free exercise of dorsa l extensor muscle strengthening to reduce kyphosis by protecting BMD, have surgery for vertebropla sty or kyphoplasty if pain persist. For hip fractures, keep hip in abduction during transportation, initiate rehabilitation at the earliest after surgical fixation to control pa in, improve physical function an d social participation to perceive quality 256 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. of life, plan exercises for d ecreasing sarcopenia and improving muscle strength, balance, coordination and bone density, and organize su rroundings to avoid future fal ls and fractures. 5. Vitamin supplementation Some important vitamins like Vitamin K and vitamin D play an im portant role in maintenance of healthy skeletal system as the y help in regulating some mineral s, especially the calcium metabolism. 5.1. Vitamin K Vitamin K is a fat soluble vitamin, found as phylloquinone (K1) in plants, mainly in green vegetables (kale, spinach, brocco li etc.), herbs (sage, thyme, parsley etc.) and fruits (kiwi, grapes etc.) or as menaquinone (K2, MK4, MK7) synthesized in intestine by en teric bacteria and also found in foods of animal origin (cheese, e ggs, meat, fermented soyabean or natto). It plays a major role in blood clotting. Its levels in blood may be affected by diabetes (impa ired sugar metabolism), obesity (abnormal lipid profile) and old age (reduced endogenous produc tion due to poor enteric bacterial activity and impaired digestion) . Its role has also been recogn ized in bone mineralization by osteocalcin carboxylation, a protei n derived from osteoblasts o f bone marrow and cartilage responsible for bone matrix by promoting transition of osteoblasts to osteo cytes and limiting osteoclast genesis [156] and due to its high affinity to calcium and hydroxyl peptide it improves calcium homeostasis [157]. Menaquinone ac tivates nuclear factor kappa B [158] which improves bone remodelling, bone mineral density and reduces fragility fractur es. Vitamin K supplem entation has been approved in Japan for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [159]. 5.2. Vitamin D Vitamin D is another fat-solubl e vitamin supplie d in diet from milk fat, fish and other sea foods. It is important to expose skin to sunlight for activating vitam in D availability. Fat consumption is restricted especially in elderly people due to its adverse effe ct on liver, arterial blockage, hypertension and impaired digestion. Old persons usually stay indoors due to restricted movements and have poor exposure to sunlight leading to vitamin D deficiency. About 90% of old people are deficient in Vitamin D and bone resorption r ate in them can be r educed by supplement ing 800 to 1000 IU of Vitamin D in their diet in the form of 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Such supplement ation improves skeletal health and reduces fracture risk and pain. Poor adherence with calcium sup plementation may result in improper vitamin D intake [160]. Vitamin D level below 50 nmol/l increas es musculoskeletal ailments and incidence of tumours [161]. Around 95% of women may not get eno ugh calcium and 50% of them have inadequate Vitamin D leve ls [162]. Out of 1515 postmenopau sal women receiving anti-resorptive drugs one-third of women were V itamin D deficient and vitamin D repletion was found essential to maximize response to raloxifene (60 mg/day), alendronate (70 mg /once a week) or risedronate (30 mg/once a week) for favourable B MD changes and anti-fracture th erapy [163]. Vitamin D status was also significantly associated w ith BMD response to SrR (2 g/day ) in post-menopausal osteoporosis at femoral neck but non-significant at lumbar spine. A positive re lation was also noticed between BMD changes at femoral neck and alkaline phosphatase. 257 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. 6. Pain management As defined by International Asso ciation of Study on Pain (ISAP) , \"chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or pote ntial tissue damage or described in terms of such changes\" [164]. Physiotherapy and therapeutic app roaches to manage pain in osteoporosis for improving quality of life were reviewed by Cat alano et al. [165]. The osteoporotic fractures cause acute pain (acu te discomfort during homeostatic recovery) while severe OP without fracture cause chronic pain. Intensity of chronic pain is affec ted by several nociceptive, neural, cognitive, memory, emotional and social components. OP and sarc openia (decrease of muscular tissue) often co-exist. They decrease daily life activities, increase r isk of falls [166] and even in the absence of fractures may cause axi al kyphosis and poor vertebral bone m ass. For pain management in OP mult i-dimensional (physiotherapy, pha rmacological and life style) approach is essential to improve quality of life. Physical pain therapy includes lo cal or comprehensive application of electric, thermic and mechanical stimuli. In ele ctric stimuli direct current or any low frequency simulated current comes where as in thermic a high fr equency or sort wave thermic, ultrasound, light thermic, infra-red light can be used. A massa g e o r s t r e t c h i n g c a n b e u s e d i n mechanical stimuli [167]. Muscle strength, coordination, body b alance, circulation and sleep are improved by physical exercises, yoga, Pilates exercises and acu puncture. Cognitive behaviour therapy improves self-control, social contact, emotions and positivity to pain by separating sensory and emotional aspect of pain [168]. Vibration training increase neu romuscular coord ination, physical fitness and relieves pain [169]. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory d rugs inhibit healing of injure d bone and tendon due to their adverse effect on cyclo-oxygenase useful dru gs to relieve pain without affecting healing process in osteoporosis but their side effects be taken care before prescribing them in different category of patients. Surgically, pain due to osteoporo tic ailments in spine could be managed by balloon kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty [165]. 7. Discussion With the advances in medical and health facilities, protection against direct environmental adversaries and supportive lifestyles longevity of human being has been increased especially in developed and economically rich countries. With advancing age b ones get weakened, become more porous, and fragile due to decrea se in bone mass leading to hig her incidence of ost eoporotic fractures with delayed healing causing incre ased morbidity, disability an d mortality. Development of osteoporosis (OP) is silent with reduction in to tal bone mineral content. Decreased calcium and vitamin D levels, less mobility, low calc itonin, low estrogen, higher intake of alcohol, caffeine, sodium and anim al protein, female gender, ol der age and genetics are important factors promoting OP. Bone mineral density is the most importan t parameter which can measure gravity of OP. The T-score of 2.5 or below indicates OP leadin g to fractures commonly in bones of spine, hip and dist al extremities. Pharmacological interventions s timulate bone formation process by triggering molecular pathways. Regular screenings al ong with physical exercises are targeted to prevent OP and accelerate 258 AIMS Medical Science V olume 7, Issue 4, 243-268. fracture healing and subseque nt functioning. Bisphosphonates li ke alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and acid have a significant role in impr oving BMD. The BP administration does not reduce time of fracture healing as they are the therap eutic agents to prevent OP while PTH promotes callus and endochondrogenesis [175], brides graft with surrounding bone [176], and enhances intracellular se condary remodelling [177]. PTH combined with BMP-7 improves mechanical function by integra ting new bone tissue with old bone tissue, neither PTH nor B MP-7 alone can improve mechan ization [178]. BMP-7 targets periosteal stem cells differentiation and is strictly anabolic facilitating bone repair only while PTH couples remodelling in underlined bone marrow space [176,178]. BMP signalling constitutive with homeostasis of bone mass by stimu lating Dickkopf protein and SO ST through osteogenic cells in medulla [179]. Besides restrain ing morbidity and administering anti-inflammatory drugs in initial stages after fracture PTH, est rogen and bone morphogenetic prot eins (BMPs), bio-molecules during and bone remodelling, dieta ry changes with rich calcium and vitamin D diets, EMF for delayed-unions or non-unions, and LIPUS and ph ysical exercises regimens during late stages for functional recovery are important interventions for complete fracture healing in osteoporotic patients. Among suppo rtive therapies, the physical exercises could be beneficial before the fracture to minimize gravity of osteoporosis, EMF and LIPUS could be useful after surgical management of fracture or delay ed and deformed union, and physi cal exercises again would be effective during late stages of fracture h ealing for better fun ctional recovery. 8. Conclusion It is suggested that to prevent or reduce osteoporosis use of a nti-resorptive medications in combination with physical exerc ises and healthy lifestyles are necessary. To identify the quantitative effect of these therapies in isolation or in combination clinic al trials under proper e xperimental settings are particularly important so tha t inferences for different the rapeutic regimes could be drawn. Similarly, in the event of fracture in OP patients use of vario us medications and other interventions starting from day one of the fracture needs an op timum regimen depending on the site and gravity of injury due to fracture. Unlike the therapies for fracture repair in young and non- osteoporotic patients, the line of treatment and duration of ea ch therapy in isolati on or in combination with pharmacological agents, bio logical or biomolecular agents, physical stimulus, exercise and lifestyles are necessary. The specific therapeutic regimes may be optimized in patients treated with surgical interventions for allo zygous or autozygous grafts and skeletal supporting devices specific for the specific site and individual patient.
