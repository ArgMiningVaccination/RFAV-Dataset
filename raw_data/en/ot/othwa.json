CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 5/ 26/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ..................................................................................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute r espiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which w e become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Animal studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported. Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmissio n is important for implementing control measures. A dditionally, the relative contributions of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species ? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed t hrough an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2 002/2003. To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Several anim al models have been developed to recreate human- like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. Incubation Period - How long a fter infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never dev elop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. Clinical Presentation - What a re the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.6 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The case fatality rate varies substantially by patient age and un derlying comorbidities. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,112 though generally show milder75, 238 or no symptoms. The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions v ary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. Protecti ve Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Understanding t he duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes. Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patien t nose, throat, or sp utum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological eviden ce of exposure does not indicate immunity. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 5/ 26/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing method s is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? ...........................................................................................................10 Treatme nt for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.149, 251 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, but results are preliminary.33, 90 Several drugs show efficacy. Remdesivir shows promise for redu cing symptom duration in humans.32 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this point in time. Large, randomized clinical trial results are ne cessary. Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated. Additional clinical trial results are being released, and data from these trials are needed. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ................................................................................................................................. 11 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered prelim inary until larger trials are completed. Published results from Phase I tr ials are needed. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? ................................. 12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. The effect of relaxing control mea sures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensiv e analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can p ersist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ..........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................15 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not be en made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare workers is critical due to th eir high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal speci es. Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ..................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Forecasti ng - What forecasting models and methods exist? ...................................................................................................18 Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders, and tracking how methods change in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going fo rward. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 5/ 26/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Work using SARS -CoV-2 A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).319 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms , but virus was shed from the nose and throat.319 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showe d mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (SARS -CoV-2 delivered through several routes), while common marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1.0x106 PFU intranasally.237 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).109 Rhesus macaques infected with -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate modera te disease observed in the majority of human cases.272 African green monkeys developed symptoms consistent with severe human disease when exposed to 500,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disea se.189, 312 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact .189 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets ,189 however , transmission without direct contact was found in another study.312 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU via the intranasal route closely resemble human respirat ory infection. Uninfected hamsters in close contact with infected hamsters show symptoms within 4 days of exposure.71 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.335 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intranasally with 100,000 50 (~70,000 PFU) , and all mice developed pathological symptom s consistent with COVID -19.28 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630 -756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU). 29 Key methodological details (e.g., particle size, quantification of actual aerosol dose) are missing from the study 's report . Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infec tions (all hamsters infected) .337 It has been suggested that higher viral loads at hospitalization correspond to more severe clinical outcomes,232, 350 though pre- and asymptomatic individuals also show vi ral loads comparable to symptomatic individuals.21, 426 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).106, 108 Genetically modified mice expressing DPP4 exposed intranasally to doses of Middle E ast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.12, 91, 217, 417 What do we need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Animal studies are a plausible surrogate.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 5,522,931 infections and 346,873 deaths177 in at least 188 countries and territories (as of 5/26/2 020).61, 330, 381 In the US there are 1,663, 221 confirmed COVID -19 cases across all 50 US states, with 98,228 deaths (as of 5/26/2020 ).177 Initial h igh-quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .248, 291, 315, 391, 416 SARS- CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,65 with fom ite transmission likely180 but unconfirmed.379 in the upper respiratory tract, and infec tious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.384 SARS -CoV-2 also infects human gut cell lines ,204 and ocular cells extracted from humans .164 SARS -CoV-2 genetic material has been found in semen from both clinically symptomatic and recovered cases ,216 however, the infectiousness and the possibility of sexual transm ission is unknown. Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been cult ured from patient feces.396 Contamination of patient rooms with aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in the human respirable range (0.25 - 2.5 m) indicates the pote ntial for airborne transmission .231 Viral RNA was detected up to 4 meters from ICU patient beds.150 To date infectious virus has not been is olated from aerosol samples.327 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation in the absence of cough, however more work is needed.9, 215, 327, 340 A prelim inary study in China detail ing a restaurant -associated outbreak supports aerosol transmission , though confirmation is needed.222 Experimentally infected ferrets were able to tran smit SARS -CoV-2 to other fe rrets by both direct contact (another ferret in same enclosure) as well as through the air (ferret s in an adjacent enclosure, separated by 10 cm).312 Similar results have been documented in transgenic mice .29 Evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted to infants during birth.77, 81, 84, 329, 403, 407 Individuals can tr ansmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Pre-symptomatic339, 419 or asymptomatic26, 162, 242 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2. At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission .114 It has been estimated that 23% ,229 44%,153 or as much as 56%57 of infections may be caused by pre- symptomatic transmission . Infected patients transmit infection s most often before symptoms bega n and within 5 days of symptom onset ,83 and pre -symptomatic individuals contribute to environmental contamination.178 Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset ,369 and culturable virus has been found in individuals up to 6 days prior to symptom onset.21 Severe cases are more l ikely to transmit disease , and most new infections are within households of infected patients.240 In China, it is estimated that infected individuals transmit COVID -19 to between 11.2%38 and 16.3%220 of household contacts , though even more may lack symptoms .242 In New York, 38% of household contacts of infected patients became infected, with the proportion increasing with age (20% for contacts <5 years old, 55% for >65 years old).320 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission , and most cases are not reported. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.219 M odels estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times greater than the reported number of cases in the UK,404 and 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.181, 324 Preliminary estimates of the case reporting rate vary widely among countries, from roughly 1 reported case for every 3 actual cases (in Germany), to 1 in 149 (in China) .194 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Epidemiological investigations by the Korean CDC suggest that individuals who have c linically recovered from COVID -19, but later show PCR positive tests, are not infectious.187 What do we need to know? Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution s of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown.

Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,423 with a suggested bat origin.93, 423 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wil dlife source,67 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.31, 94, 398, 408 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.318 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.221, 225- 226 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago.203 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than S ARS-CoV-1,389 potentially explaining its high transmissibility . The same work suggests that differe nces between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.389 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, b at, civet, monkey and swine cells.361 Host range predictions based on structural modeling, however, are difficult,132 and additional a nimal studies are needed to better define the host range . In vitro experiments suggest a broad host range for SARS -CoV-2, with more than 44 potential animal hosts, based on viral binding to species -specific ACE2 orthologs.230 The host range is predicted to be limited primarily to mammals. Genetic and protein analysis of primates suggests that African and Asian primates are likely more susceptible to SARS -CoV-2, while South and Cen tral American primates are likely less susceptible .261 Identifying the SARS -CoV-2 host range is important for identifying animal reservoirs. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range , in addition to receptor binding .262 To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS - CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to human s. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.71, 189 In the Netherlands, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.2 It is thought that a n infected mink has transmitted SA RS-CoV-2 to a human.196 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and close quarters aerosol transmission.337 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route335 or a combination of routes151), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.335 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies but exhibited no clinical symptoms.335, 338 Wild cats (tigers)368 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.249, 413 Two cases have been confirmed of pet domestic cats infected with SARS -CoV-2.60 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal route).335 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock ,169 though modeling suggests sheep, cows, pigs, and goats may be susceptible to infection by SARS -CoV-2.202 Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection when exposed to an intranasal dose of 105 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), confirmed by lack of positive swab and tissue samples.133 Fruit bats and ferrets were susceptible t o this same exposure.133 What do we need to know? Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures . Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition . What is the intermediate host(s)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats to humans)? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 5/ 26/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 6 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during t his time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit d isease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.210 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.210 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.26, 70, 149, 346, 419 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,65, 321, 346, 419 and asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.21, 188, 426 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.153 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.21 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .8, 219, 330 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.160 On average, there are approximately 4114 to 7.5218 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval) . Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China, the mean serial interval is 5.29 days .113 Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding vi rus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individua ls (17 days). 239 Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.421 What do we need to know? The incubation period is well- characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease?

What do we know? Many COVID -19 cases are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.6 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Approximately 18 -31% of patients are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection .269, 277, 352 These estimates are based on studies that minimize the likelihood of including pre -symptomatic patients, which can obscure asymptomatic rates.21 The majority of symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cases) .346 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% o verall, but only 44 -52% present with fever initially ),19, 149 cough (67.7% ),149 fatigue, shor tness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.66, 74, 161 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell401 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.66 The prevalenc e of GI symptoms varies.135 Neurological symptoms such as agitation and confusion may present with COVID -19,154 and may be more common in severe cases.100 Ocular issues393 and skin lesions may also be s ymptoms of COVID -19.41 Complications include acute respir atory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized patients, leading to death in 4 -15% of cases ),80, 161, 363 pneumonia,287 cardiac injury (20% ),336 secondary infection, kidney damage ,341 arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.149, 161, 363, 421 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) d amage.322 A number of immunological indicators may help differentiate between severe and non- severe cases.23, 117, 15 2, 163, 297, 343 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,149, 346 and approximately 5% of patients are admitte d to the ICU.149, 346 Patient d eterioration can be rapid .145 The survival rate of patients requiring mechanical ventilation varies widely (e.g., 35%,168 70%,22 75.5%313). Mortality rates in hospitalized patients can be high (~39%), although 37% of patients remained hospitalized, which may affect the final mortality rate .101 Clotting issues may be associated with severely ill COVID -19 patients191 and those with ARDS.100 COVID -19 patients should be monitored for possible thrombosis.213 The case fatality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.259, 346, 421 Hypertension and obesit y are common in the US135 and contribute to mortality.20, 2 89 Individuals >60 are at higher risk of death , and the CFR for individuals >85 is between 10 and 27% .346, 421 In a small study, men exhibited more severe symptoms and die d at higher rates than women.179 The effect of comorbidities on the likelihood of severe symptoms is higher for men.263 Deaths due to COVID -19 are underreported . In New York City, up to 5,293 (22%) of period -specific excess deaths are unexplained and could be related to the pandemic.281 More work is needed. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required . African Americans are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations ,135 despite having similar rates of several underlying conditions as other groups.144 African American com munities also contribute disproportionately to the number of deaths in the US.267 Preg nant women appear to develop severe symptoms at the same rate as the general population ,79, 184, 410 and current reports suggest no incr ease in risk of pre -term birth.402 Severe symptoms in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity.233 Most studies of COVID -19 in pregnancy represent women in later stages of pregnancy. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,112 though generally show milder75, 238 or no symptoms . Between 21 -28% of children may be asymptomatic.238, 292, 300 A detailed study of 100 children with COVID -19 found that 21% were asymptomatic, 58% developed mild illness, 19% had moderate illness, 1% had severe illness, and 1% developed critical illness.292 Severe symptoms in children are possible228 and m ore likely in those with complex medical histories.331 Infant deaths have been recorded.47, 238 Early reports indicate the possibility of rare hyperinflammatory syndromes or shock in children (termed Pediatric Multi -System Inflammatory Syndrome ) 143 linked to COVID -19 infection.316 The WHO380 and US CDC176 have issued case definitions for this condition. What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. How long does it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? What proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic? Does this vary by age, location, or comorbidities?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route , 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 days, and all patients produced antibodies by 14 days. Antibody production did not corre late with lower viral load.384 In a larger study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had s ignificantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.390 In a separate study, elderly patients also showed higher viral loads than younger patients.350 In a study of 285 COVID -19 patients, 100% developed antiviral immunoglobulin -G within 19 days of symptom onset.234 The neutralizing ability of these antibodies was not tested.234 In a smaller in vitro study (n=23 patients), levels of antibodies (immunoglobulins M and G) were positively correlated with SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability. 350 In a small series of 26 mild COVID -19 cases, res earchers found prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and SARS -CoV-2 RNA for up to 50 days. Additionally, one patient cleared SARS -CoV-2 without developing a significant antibody response.362 Based on one patient, a productive immune response is generated and sustained for at least 7 days. 347 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibod ies may wane after several years .52, 392 More dat a are needed. A small subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develop a serological response to infection , though the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.390 Similarly, between 16.7% (for IgG) and 51.7% (for IgM) of patients in a separate study di d not exhibit any immune response, in terms of production of those two types of antibodies.344 In a study of 221 COVID -19 patients, levels of two types of antibodies ( IgM and IgG) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.159 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease showed stronger antibody respon ses than those with non -severe symptoms.350 The early recovery phase of COVID -19 patients is characterized by inflammato ry immune response,371 suggesting the potential for adverse reactions after clinical improvement. Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVI D-19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.43, 146 Interestingly, these studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients ( via blood samples fr om 2015 -2018, before the COVID -19 pandemic ),146 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV- 2.43, 146 The degree of protection provided by these immune responses is currently unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques . In the first, two ex perimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected 28 days after their primary infection resolved. 27 In the second, rhesus macaques exposed to different doses of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal and intratracheal routes (104 - 106 PFU) developed pathological infection and were protected upon secondary challenge 35 days after initial exposure (little to no clinical symptoms, large reduction in viral titer compared to initial infection). 73 Longer -term research and work in humans still needs to be conducted.73 According to the WHO, t here is no evidence of re- infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.209 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear ,421 and after recovery and hospital discharge.205 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. Similarly , there is no evidence that recovered patients are protected against reinfection with SARS - CoV-2.376 Additional research is required before any conclusions can be drawn about the duration of protect ive immunity after SARS -CoV-2 infection.14 What do we need to know? Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes . Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? How does the patient immune response vary by age or disease severity ? How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. The US CDC has expanded testing criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.30 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared internationally.58, 96, 218, 334, 375, 382 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography is the most effective diagnost ic criteria (correctly diagnoses 91.9% of infections).310 A single throat swab detects 78.2% of infections, and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.310 PCR tests using saliva were better able to detect SARS- CoV-2 RNA than those using nasopharyngeal swabs, and may be useful for self, at -home sampling.395 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective ostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage is mixed.384 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symp toms, or identify patients at higher risk of sev ere disease.418 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection .48 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results . The false -negative rate for RT PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false -negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.198 These results suggest PCR screening may be ineffective in recently exposed individuals.198 The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for an antigen- based diagnostic assay, limited to use in certified laboratories (clinical laboratory improvement amendments, CLIA).119 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in - house for patient diag nosis.123 Tests from the US CDC are ava ilable to states.58, 65 Multiple rapid or real-time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,102 BGI,36 Cepheid,360 Abbot,121 and Mesa Biotech.39 Home tests are being developed; however, no ne are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnostic.273-274, 290 The US CDC is develo ping serological tests to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS- CoV-2.183 A rapid antibody test by Cellex is now authorized by the FDA.156, 372 Artificial intelligence algorithms were able to improve the ability of radiologists to distin guish COVID -19 pneumonia from chest CT scans.25 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of ex posure does not i ndicate immunity. Researchers found high specificity in a number of enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), though sample sizes for SARS -CoV-2 patients were small.280 Additional research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detec t positive and negative cases (sensitivity and specificity, respectively ). 208, 373 Lateral flow assays may be less reliable than ELISA.10 In one German town, serological testing has been used to identify the percent of the population already exposed to SARS -CoV-2 (14%), which can assist in public health response planning.307 Preliminary serological studies in Santa Clara and Los Angeles, California, estimated that 2.5 -4.1% of the p opulation has already been exposed to SARS -CoV-2 since the first confirmed cases in January,34, 250 which is between 28 and 85 times greater than official reports. There are issues, however, with non-random study populations,34 as well as false positive rates of the diagnostic tests themselves.250 The false positive rate of the diagnostic ass ay used may account for a s ubstantial portion of the reported infections,34 particularly if the true proportion of posi tive patients is low. In New York, initial serological testing indicates that 13.9% of the population has been exposed to COVID -19, approximately 10 times greater than the number of reported cases.3 This is in line with other underreporting estimates in the US.181, 324 What do we need to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of s ymptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determine factors that affect test accuracy. How accurate are clinical diagnoses compared to genetic te sts? How effective are d ifferent swab specimens as diagnostic samples? How many serological tests need to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure?

What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.149, 251 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, but results are preliminary.33, 90 Several drugs show efficacy. Two WHO -backed clinical trials ( Solidarity and Discovery )199 include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, and ritonavir/lopinavir a nd interferon -beta.199 The WHO has temporarily halted the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial due to conc erns about adverse patient reactions.141 Rem desivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans .32 Remdesivir can reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 11 days on average (compared to controls).32 There is a possibility remdesivir may reduce mortality rates , though the result was not statistically significant.32 In this trial, individuals with mild symptoms were excluded , and remde sivir was most effective in patients requiring supplemental oxygen (but not mec hanical ventilation).32 Remdesivir received an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA.275 In a separate clinical trial of severe COVID -19 patients, the effects o f remdesivir were inconclusive due to a limitation in the study sample size.366 For available patients, remdesivir did not reduce the time to recovery overall, but did show a tendency to reduce symptom duration for patients given the drug early.366 This trial ended early, reducing its statistical power .366 Hydroxychloroquine is associated wit h elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this point in time . Large, randomized clinical trial results are necessary. A very large (n=14,888) observational, retrospective study found elevated rates of mortality a nd cardiac arrythmias in moderately to severely ill COVID -19 patients taking hydroxychloroquine compared to matched control groups.260 This adds to existing st udies that have found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin)78, 138, 244- 245, 345 as well as cardiac side effects35, 88, 140, 174, 246, 264 and elevated risk of mortality.244 Individuals taking hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune disorders were not protect ed from COVID -19,139 though sample sizes were limited. Initial results purporting benefits of hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin137 have been called into question by other r esearchers166 and the journal's publishing society .172 One small clinical trial (n=62) suggests that hydroxychloroquine can reduce recovery time compared to control group .82 Key details are missing from th is preprint.82 A small retrospective study (n=48) found benefits to hydroxychloroquine, though details on patient study population selec tion were limited.405 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being in vestigated. A randomized Phase II trial found that a triple combination of interferon beta -1b, lopinavir - ritonavir, and ribavirin administered early in infection reduced symptom severity, viral shedding, and hospital stay time compared to patients taking lopinavir -ritonavir alone.167 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir76 (which has been approved to treat COVID -19 in China)1 and intravenous immunoglobulin.54 Early r esearch found no efficacy from combination ritonavir and lopinavir ,53 as well as an increase in gastrointestinal symptoms.223 Early results from a randomized clinical trial found that high doses (600 mg, twice per day) of chloroquine diphosphate were associated with toxicity and lethality in patients with severe COVID - 19.40 The trial did not have a large enough sample size to assess chloroquine treatment efficacy.40 A small (n=21) , observationa l study found benefits of tocilizumab in severe COVID -19 patients .399 Potential b enefits of immunosuppressants7 should be weighed against potential risks .303 The anticoagulant h eparin is being used to mitigate risks of pulmonary embolism.117 Systemic anticoagulant use was associated with reduced mortality rates in severely ill patients .288 Passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum )55 is being given to patients (FDA Investigational New Drug approval).122 In a small trial ( n=5 patients),332 convalescent sera administration was followed by clinical improvement.332 Large efforts are underway to broaden and enhance serum therapies.333 Preliminary results from a small study (n=39 patients) found that those receiving convalescent plasma were more likely to see improvements in their need for supplemental oxygen.227 Additionally, there was a reductio n in mortality in those receiving plasma.227 What do we need to know?

Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger trials are completed . Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine,15 including HHS/NIH/NIAID,155, 214 CEPI, Moderna Therapeutics, Sciences,4-5, 276 Sanofi,42 and Johnson and Johnson.182 Vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trial are liste d below. Phase II Trials (initial testing for efficacy, contin ued testing for safety) : China's CanSino is the first to complete Phase I safety trials of their adenovirus type5 vector based Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Ad5 -nCoV, and has advanced to Phase II human tr ials.224 University of Oxford's C hAdOx1 candidate has begun Phase II/III human trials.285 Phase I Trials (initial testing for safety) : Sinovac Biotech has reported that their inactivated virus vaccine shows protective effects in rhesus macaques, partic ularly at high doses.134 The vaccine is currently in Phase I clinical trials.92 Phase I trial results for the CanS ino vaccine (Ad5 -nCoV) showed few severe adverse reactions in humans within 28 days of follow -up (side effects included fever [sometimes severe], fatigue, headache, and muscle pain).424 Immune responses were found in most patients, peaking at 14 days for T -cells and 28 days for antibodies.424 Two dose s were selected for human Phase II trials. Vaccine efficacy in humans is currently unknown.424 Moderna has a Phase I trial underway based on its mR NA platform, mRNA -1273. Preliminary data from the trial suggests that the vaccine is well -tolerated by human subjects, and induces an antibody response against SARS -CoV-2.270 Results from trials designed to test efficacy are needed. Inovio had their IND approved by the FDA and have started their Phase I clinical trials on their DNA vaccine candidate INO -4800.325 Shenzhen Geno -Immune Medical Institute is testing its aAPC257 and lentiviral255 vaccines in Phase I clinical trials . BioNTech and Pfizer 's BNT162 program is in Phase I/ II clinical trial for four of its mRNA vaccine candidates.296 Univ ersity of Oxford 's ChAdOx1 vaccine is in Phase I clinical trials. Th is vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus expressing S ARS- CoV-2 proteins.295 The ChAdOx1 platform has shown protective efficacy in rhesus macaques in preclinical trials. Safety and effica cy still need to be determined in human trials.357 The Beijing Institute of Biological Products /Wuhan Institute of Biological Products have initiated a Phase I trial of their inactivated vaccine candidate.383 Symvivo Corporation has received approval to begin a Phase I trial with their oral bacTRL -Spike vaccine candidate in Canada.253 Novavax is testing a recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine in Phase I trials.254 Immunitor LLC is starting Phase I trials of a heat -inactivated vaccine derived from pooled patient plasma.258 Aivita Biomedical will begin a Phase Ib/II randomized double blind clinical trial of 180 people, specifically healthcare workers a nd first responders.

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates , and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 4 4% in Hong Kong99 and reduced spread throughout China193, 197, 201, 235, 247 and Italy.136 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a f ew days ,425 in part , through reductions in an individual's average number of contacts.411 Modeling demonstrates that multifaceted restrictions and quarantines in China reduced the R 0 of SARS- CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between January 23 and February 5.286 Additionally, movement restrictions and other con trol measures helped limit the amount of time where community transmission was possible (i.e., R 0 > 1).412 A US county -level model found that shelter in place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.97 SIPOs had larger independent effects, but restaurant and bar closures contributed more to overall case reductions because they were in place longer. 97 School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.97 Similarly, researchers found that a larger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associat ed with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.185 Mobility129, 207 and physical contact rates175 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Models indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are required to effectively limit transmission.126 School closures alone appear insufficient.173, 201 Non-pharmaceutical interventions in China did not reduce transmission equal ly across all groups; transmission rates in younger individuals, particularly infants, as well as hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmission rates declined. 286 Contact tracing to identify infected individuals reduces the amount of time infectious individuals can transmit disease i n a population and increases the time between successive cases .38 The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to h elp plan for easing of restrictions. Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep c ases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic. 190 Results depend critically on the duration of immunity after exposure.190 Two modeling studies suggest that contact tracing combined with high levels of testing may be capable of limiting the potential for large second waves of COVID -19 transmission once initial social distancing policies are relaxed.13, 127 Modeling suggests that premature lifting of social distancing measures will substantially increase the number of local COVID -19 cases in Wuhan, China. 298 Similarly, forecasts in the US estimate a resumption of exponential case growth if social distancing measures are r elaxed.103 In the UK, modelers are assessing the efficacy of rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks to keep healthcare demand below a critical point.404 A modeling study using Chinese data suggests that carefully balancing control measures to maintain R0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase above 1 at any point .211 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US, but would require additional staff and resources to conduct effectively.367 The WHO has released guidelines on public health strategy,374 and Johns Hopkins released a report outlining how to re -open certain categories of activities (e.g., sc hools, restaurants, events) while reducing COVID -19 risk.317 SARS- CoV-2 levels in wastewater may track with prevalence in the po pulation,394 and could be used to monitor viral elimination in an area. What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. What are plausible options for relaxing social distancing and other intervention measures without resulting in a resurgence of COVID -19 cases?

What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on con ditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission i s unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. SARS -CoV-2 Data In simulated saliva on stainless steel surface , SARS -CoV-2 exhibits negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on the intensity of simulated UVB irradiation levels .306 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces between 3 days ( 21-23oC, 40% RH)355 and 7 days (22oC, 65% RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22oC, 65% RH).87 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23oC and 65% RH).355 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70oC) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4oC).87, 305 SARS- CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms u p to 17 days after cabins were vacated . The infectiousness of this material is not known.271 In a preliminary study, SARS -CoV-2 stability was enhanced when present with bovine serum albumin, which is commonly used to represent sources of protein found in human sputum.293 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.241 Model ing suggests that even accounting for pote ntial reductions in transmission due to weather and behavioral changes, public health interventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.265 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies suggest that other coronaviruses can survive on non- porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS- CoV) ,56, 72 and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)116 in air conditioned environments (20 -25oC, 40- 50% RH). Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),56, 72, 302, 356 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical office or hospital conditions .356 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up t o 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.56 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH) .299 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.200 What do we need to know?

SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.195 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.86 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.282 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.11 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based378 and ethanol -based95 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56oC) is sufficient to kil l coronaviruses,302, 420 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.302 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite (0.02% bleach radiation can several (MHV and CCV).326 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.165, 38 5 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV-1 after 30 minutes of contact. 301 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.348-349 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.115 Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an E mergency U se Authorization (EUA). Researchers have identified four met hods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70oC, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).128 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.128 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.314 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks pe r day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.119 The FDA has issued a n Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating 10 N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.44 What do we need to know?

Healthcare worker illnesses346 demonstrates human -to-human transmissio n despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.328 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.309 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 report work in a healthcare setting as their sing le source of exposure .49 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patie nts] should use standa rd precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) .\"63 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.377 Clothing and PPE that c overs all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.125, 370 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols .378 Additional protec tion, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirato r (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high- risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation) .46 Particul ar attention should be paid to the potential fo r transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.148 There is evidence both for231 and against282 the detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA via air sampling in patient rooms and other hospital areas . Research at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has provided initial estimates of PPE needs in the US: 7.8 billion gloves, 668 million gowns, 360 million surgical masks, and 136 million N95 or similar respirators.351 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.120 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.124 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission . A non-peer -reviewed report of an experimental trial with hamsters suggests that masks may reduce SARS- CoV-2 transmission via aerosol when the mask material is used as a filter between separate cages housing infected and uninfected hamsters .157 Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals . 105, 212, 354 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavi rus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m) compared to not wearing a mask.212 Other preliminary work has fai led to document protective efficacy of surgical or cotton masks,24 and more SARS- CoV-2 specific research is needed. On 4/3/2020, t he US CDC rec ommend ed wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain .64 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection if no other options are available.89, 104, 311 The filtering efficiency of homemade mask materials is variable. Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,192 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 - 62%).364 In a meta -analysis of mask studies, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including infl uenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.279 N95 respirators were associated with large reductions (up to 80%) in SARS -CoV-1 infections.279 What do we need to know? Most PPE rec ommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare worker s is critical due to th eir high rates of infection. What is the importance of aerosol transmission (particles <5 m)? What is the effective distance of spread via droplet or aerosol? How effective are barriers such as N95 respirators or surgical masks for SARS -CoV-2? What is the appropriate PPE for first res ponders? Airport screeners? What are proper procedures for reducing spread and transmission rates in medical facilities? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission?

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavi rus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.111 Genomic analysis suggest s that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.17, 423 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non - human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"17 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed g enetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses ,386 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses .225-226 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bat s could be t he source of SARS -CoV-2.397 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.414 Additional research is neede d. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion in the viral f urin cleavage site. While distinct from the insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.422 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,17 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS- CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently imposs ible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"17 Work with other coronaviruses h as indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in t he previous furin enzyme recognition motif.107 What do w e need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 5/ 26/2020 CLEA RELEASE 17 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletion s in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes . There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to De cember 2 019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 -12/17/2019.18, 31, 304 An alysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an es timated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.358 The same analysis estimates the emergence of SARS - CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.358 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019 , in Europe in late December 2019 ,110 and circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020 .388 Despite evidence of variation in the genome69 and areas und er positive selection,50 there are no known a ssociation s between particular mutations and changes in transmission or virulence.51 Thus, there is currently no evidence of distinct SARS -CoV-2 phenotypes at this time .243, 358 Research attempting to define clades or subgroups of SARS -CoV-2 based solely on genomic features has suffered from limited data409 and sampling bias.131 Ana lysis shows that no recurrent SARS -CoV-2 mutations are associated with increases in v iral transmission , providing no evidence of distinct lineage with different rates of growth .359 In 94 COVID -19 patients where both symptoms and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV-2 were known, there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.415 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and closely related b at coronaviruses . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to pan golin coronavirus.225-226 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein , which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein .236 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat236 and pangolin226 coronavirus es. An a nalysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.342 In Arizona, researchers identified an 81 -base pair deletion (removing 27 amino acids) in the ORF -7a protein, indicating that mutations can be detected by routine sentinel surveillance. The function of these deletions are unknown at this time.158 A recent report of virus mutations within patients needs more research.186 Additional analysis of data suggests the results may be due to experimental methods.142, 400 Structural modeling suggests that observed changes in the gen etic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.283 More specificall y, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus - receptor binding complex.283 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing binding efficacy.284 Infectivity assays are needed to validate the genotypic c hanges and possible phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key differen ce between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).98 The US CD C is launching a national genomics consortium to assess SARS -CoV-2 genomic changes over time.59 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression i n patients) is needed. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? What are the m utations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission ?
