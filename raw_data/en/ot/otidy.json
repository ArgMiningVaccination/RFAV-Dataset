These forms must be completed and returned to the Plan Administrator on or before your Plan entry date (or, if later, within the deadline for completing any enrollment materials, as set f orth below) . If you do not complete the enrollment materials required by the Plan Administrator , you will not receive any benefits under the Plan. (1) Failure to Enroll When First Eligible . If you fail to enroll when you are first eligible to do so, you may not enroll in the Plan until the next Open Enrollment Period , in which case your enrollment will not take effect until the first day of the following Plan Year . The same rule applies if yo u fail to enroll your Dependent s when they are first eligible to enter the Plan . In general, you must enroll in the Plan within 63 days of the date on which you first became eligible to participate in the Plan. The re are, however, a number of exceptions to this rule, which are set forth below: (2) \"Special Enrollment\" Rights Pursuant to HIPAA . (a) Acquisition of New Dependen t. If you acquire a new Dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or appointment of legal guardianship , you may enroll that Dependent outside the normal Open Enrollment Period. To do so, you must enroll them in this Plan (by completing any required enrollment materials) within 63 days of the marriage, birth, adoption, or legal guardianship appointment . (b) Loss of Other Group Health Plan Coverage . If you declin ed enrollment in the Plan for yourself and/or your Dependent s because you and/or your Dependents were enrolled in an other group health plan or health insurance policy, and that other coverage is subsequently lost, you may enroll yourself and/or your Dependents in this Plan outside the normal Open Enrollment Period. To do so, you must enroll in this Plan (by completing any required enrollment materials) within 63 days after your other coverage ends.

If you and/or your Dependent(s) enroll in the Plan by virtue of the HIPAA \"special enrollment\" rights set forth above, any other Dependents who are eligible, but not currently enrolled in the Plan, may enroll at the same time. This is known as the \"tag -along\" rule adopted by the Plan. (3) Qualified Medical Child Support Orders . The Plan will enroll and provide coverage to any of your Dependents who are the subject of a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (\"QMCSO\"), consistent with the terms of the QMCSO and any applicable federal laws and regulations.

You and your Dependents may obtain Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 4 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 from the Plan Administrator, free of charge, a copy of the Plan's procedures governing the determination of whether an order is a QMCSO. (B) Plan Entry Date for Participants . If you have met the Plan's eligibility conditions and you have completed all of the required enrollment materials, you will enter the Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of hire . However, if you are enrolling in this Plan based on your loss of coverage in another group health plan or insurance policy, then you will enter the Plan on the first da y of the month that follows the date on which you lost your other coverage, provided that you have returned your enrollment materials to the Plan Administrator within the time period required by the Plan . (C) Plan Entry Date for Dependents . In general, your Dependents (whom you have timely enrolled) will enter the Plan at the same time as you. If you had been participating in the Plan but one or more of your Dependents had not, you may enroll such Dependents during the Open Enrollment Period, at which p oint their coverage will commence on the first day of the Plan Year. If you wish to enroll a Dependent outside of the Open Enrollment Period based on one of the special enrollment rights described in Section III(A) above, the following rules apply with re spect to the Dependent's commencem ent of coverage under the Plan: (1) Newborn and Newly Acquired Children . If your newborn or newly acquired Child (via adoption or appointment of legal guardianship) is properly enrolled in the Plan, the Child will enter the Plan on: (a) The date of birth in the case of a natural or adopted newborn Child; or (b) In the case of a chil d other than a newborn, the date the child is placed in the Participant's home for adoption, or the date the court awards legal guardianship to the Participant and/or his/her Spouse. (2) New Spouse . If your new spouse is properly enrolled in the Plan, he /she will enter the Plan on the first day of the first month coincident with or next following the date of the marriage.

If you are enrolling your Dependent in this Plan ba sed on his/her/their loss of coverage in another group health plan or insurance policy, then the Dependent(s) will enter the Plan on the first day of the month that follows the date on which they lost their other coverage, provided that you have returned t he enrollment materials to the Plan Administrator within the time period required by the Plan. (4) All Other Situations . For all other situations in which you are permitted to enroll a Dependent outside the normal Open Enrollment Period, the Dependent wi ll enter the Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date that the Dependent becomes eligible for coverage under the Plan, provided that the Plan Administrator receives the enrollment materials within the time period requir ed by the Plan. (5) Special Rule for Dependents Entering Plan Pursuant to Tag -Along Rule . If a Dependent is being enrolled in the Plan pursuant to the tag -along rule ( see Section III(A)(2)(d) of this SPD), the Plan may, for administrative convenience, allow such Dependent to enter Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 5 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 the Plan at the same time as the Participant and/or other Dependent(s), even if it is earlier than the time that such Dependent would otherwise be permitted to enter the Plan. (D) Termination of Participant's Coverage. Your participation in the Plan will end at the end of the last day of the month coincident with or next following your loss of eligibility or termination of employment. Please note that, while y our coverage for benefits under the Plan ends with the termination of your participation , you may be entitled to purchase COBRA continuation coverage. (E) Termination of Coverage of Dependent . Your Dependent's participation in the Plan ends at the end of the month coincident or next following the date on which the Dependent ceases to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the Plan. Please note that, while y our Dependents' coverage for benefits under the Plan ends simultaneously with the termination of your participation , your Dependents may be entitled to purchase COBRA continuation coverage. IV. Continuation Coverage Under the Plan (A) COBRA Continuation Coverage - In General . If the coverage for you and/or your eligible Dependent(s) under the Plan terminates because of certain \"qualifying events\" specified in a federal law known as the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( \"COBRA\") , then you and/or your eligible Dependent(s) may have the right to purchase continuing coverage under the Plan for a limited period of time . COBRA requires that continuation coverage must be offered to \"qualified beneficiaries\" (described below) w ho lose their coverage under the Plan as a result of certain \"qualifying events\" (described below), so long as the qualified beneficiary timely notifies the Plan Sponsor of the \"qualifying event\" and pays any applicable premiums. (B) Qualified Beneficia ries. Under COBRA, \"qualified beneficiaries \" include you and/or any of your Dependents who were covered under the Plan on the day before the \"qualifying event.\" Qualified beneficiaries also include any children who are born to , or adopted by , you while you are continuing your coverage pursuant to COBRA. (C) Qualifyin g Events. A \"qualifying event\" includes any of the following occurrences if you (or another qualified beneficiary ) would otherwise lose your/their eligibility for coverage under this Plan as a result of such an event: (1) Termination of your employment (other than for \"gross misconduct\") or a reduction in the number of hours you normally work ; (2) Your death ; (3) Divorce or legal separation from your covered Spouse; (4) Entitlement to Medicare (Part A, Part B, or both); or (5) Covered Dependent no longer satisfies the conditions for being covered as a Dependent under the Plan; Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 6 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 (D) Notice Procedures . When the qualifying event is a termination of your employment, reduction in hours of your employment, or your death , the Plan will offer COBRA coverage to qualified beneficiaries. You need not notify the Plan Administrator of any of these three qualifying events. For all other qualifying events, you must notify the Plan Administrator in writing within 60 days after t he date on which the qualifying beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the Plan as a result of the qualifying event. If notice of a qualifying event is not timely made within the 60 -day notice period, no COBRA coverage may be electe d by any qualified beneficiary. (E) Election to Continue Coverage. Once the Plan Administrator receives timely notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA coverage will be offered to each qualified beneficiary. Each qualified beneficiary will hav e an independent right to elect continuation coverage. For example, your covered Spouse may elect COBRA even if you do not. COBRA may be elected for one, several, or all of your covered D ependent children who are qualified beneficiaries. You may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of your covered Spouse, and either you or your Spouse may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of your children. For each qualified beneficiary who timely elects COBRA co verage, such coverage will begin on the date that Plan coverage would otherwise have been lost. (F) Premium for COBRA Continuation Coverage. A qualified beneficiary who elects to continue coverage must pay the entire cost for such coverage along with an additional 2% charge or, with respect to an extension of the maximum coverage period due to a subsequent disability, an additional 50% charge . Premiums must be paid on a timely basis or else COBRA coverage will be terminated . (G) Maximum Coverage Period. The maximum period of time for which COBRA continuation coverage will be provided shall be as follows: (1) Termination of Employment or Reduction in Hours. If coverage is lost as a result of your termination of employment or a reduction in your hours, the maximum period of COBRA continuation coverage will be 18 months. (2) Disability Extension. If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to have been disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage and the qualified beneficiary n otifies the Plan Administrator of such determination (a) within 60 days of such determination and (b) while COBRA continuation coverage is still in effect, the maximum period of COBRA continuation coverage will be 29 months. (3) Second Qualifying Event. If a second qualifying event takes place while coverage is being continued following the original qualifying event and the second qualifying event is other than the termination of your employment or a reduction in your hours, the maximum period of COBRA co ntinuation coverage will be 36 months. (4) Any Other Qualifying Event. The maximum period of COBRA continuation coverage will be 36 months for any qualifying event for which a shorter maximum coverage period is not set forth in this Subparagraph (H ). Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 7 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 (5) Calculation of COBRA Deadlines. The maximum coverage period shall begin as of the date on which the qualified beneficiary would otherwise lose coverage as a result of the original qualifying event (as opposed to beginning on the date of the qualifying event itself). The deadline for t he Employer to notify the Plan Administrator of a qualifying event (if applicable) and the deadline for a qualified beneficiary to notify the Plan of a qualifying event (if applicable) shall also be measured from the date that coverage is lost. (H) Termination of COBRA Continuation Coverage. COBRA continuation coverage may be terminated prior to the expiration of the maximum coverage period if any of the following circumstances occur: (1) Covered Under Another Group Health Plan . The qualified beneficiar y becomes covered under another group health plan; (2) Premium Not Paid . A required premium is not paid within the applicable deadline (including any applicable grace period); (3) Plan is Terminated with No Other Coverage Offered in its Place . The Empl oyer terminates this Plan and no longer offers coverage under a group health plan to any of its Employees; (4) Entitlement to Medicare . After electing COBRA coverage, a qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, o r both); (5) No Longer Disabled . During a disability extension period, the disabled qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to be no longer disabled; or (6) Other Analogous Reasons for Terminating Coverage . Coverage w ould have been terminated under the same circumstances for a Covered Person who is not receiving COBRA continuation coverage (e.g., if the Covered Person engages in fraudulent activities against the Plan). (I) Coverage Provided During COBRA Continuation Period. The coverage provided during the COBRA continuation period shall be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated persons covered under the Plan with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred. This includes open enrollment and special enrollment rights. If coverage under the Plan is modified for any group of similarly situated persons, the coverage shall also be modified in the same manner for all qualified beneficiaries who have elected to continue their covera ge under COBRA. V. USERRA Continuation Coverage Under the Plan USERRA Continuation of Coverage . If you are absent from employment as a result of military service, you have the right to elect continuation coverage for a period of up to twenty -four (24) months if such coverage would otherwise be lost as a result of such military service. Your right to continue coverage is subject to the following: (1) Payment of Premium. You must pay the applicable premium for any USERRA continuation coverage. For a leave of absence for thirty (30) days or less , you will not be required to pay more than what you would have paid had you not been on leave. For a Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 8 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 leave of absence of more th an thirty (30) days, you may be required to pay up to 102% of the applicable premium under the Plan. (2) Exclusions or Waiting Period Upon Reinstatement. The Plan may impose a Pre-Existing Condition exclusion or Waiting Period for coverage of any illnes s or injury determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, your performance of qualified military service. (3) Failure to Apply for Reemployment. Following completion of your military service, your right to continue coverage under USERRA will end if you do not apply for reemployment within the applicable time period set forth in USERRA (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 4312(c)). VI. FMLA Conti nuation Coverage Under the Plan (A) Continuation of Coverage While on F amily and Medical Leave. If you take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") , the Employer will, to the extent required by the FMLA, continue to maintain your benefits under the Plan on the same terms and conditions as if you were sti ll an active Participant . If you choose to continue your coverage while you are on a FMLA leave, the Employer will continue to pay its share (if any) of the premiums. However, y ou will be required, if you choose to continue your coverage, to pay your sha re of the premiums in one or more of the following ways : (1) You may pay your share of the premiums with after -tax dollars while you are on FMLA leave. (2) You may pay all or a portion of your share of the premium upon the termination of your FMLA leave. (3) You may pay all or a portion of your share of the premium prior to your FMLA leave. (B) COBRA Coverage Following FMLA Leave . If you take FMLA leave and do not return to work at the end of your FMLA leave, you (and /or your Dependents) may be entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage following such leave if each of the following is true: (1) Each individual seeking COBRA continuation coverage was covered under the Plan on the day before your FMLA leave began (or became covered during your FMLA leave); (2) You did not return to employment with the Employer following your FMLA leave; and (3) You (and your Dependents, as applicable) would, in the a bsence of COBRA coverage, lose coverage under the Plan within 18 months of your last day of FMLA leave. If the elements set forth above are satisfied, you (and/or your Dependents) will be eligible to seek COBRA continuation coverage following your FMLA le ave regardless of whether you (and your Dependents, if applicable) were covered under the Plan during your FMLA leave. COBRA coverage elected in these circumstances will begin on the last day of the FMLA leave, with the same 18-month maximum coverage peri od (subject to extension or early termination) generally applicable to the COBRA qualifying events of termination of employment and reduction of hours . Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 9 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 VII. Benefits Available Under the Plan The Plan makes certain health benefits available to Covered Persons. A detailed summary of the specific benefits and scope of coverage is set forth in the Plan's Benefit Description, which is available from the Plan Administrator. The Plan Sponsor shares the cost of coverage under this Plan with covered E mployees. The level of Employee premiums/contributions is set by the Plan Sponsor. The Plan Sponsor reserves the right to change the level of Employee premiums/contributions prior to the commencement of each Plan Year. VIII. Plan's Right to Recover Benefits - Subrogation & Reimbursement (A) Subrogation . The right of subrogation means the right of the Plan to \"step into your shoes\" and take over your right to receive payments from third parties or to pursue a cause of action against third parties, to the extent of payments made by the Plan. By accepting benefits from the Plan, you are agreeing to the Plan's right of subrogation to any Claim or right of action that you may have against a third party. You may be required to sign an agreement affirming th e Plan's right to subrogation before any benefits will be paid to you (or on your behalf) in connection wi th a particular injury or condition. Example of Subrogation: You are injured in a car accident and the Plan pays your medical expenses resulting from the accident. You have a Claim against the other driver for your injuries. The Plan may make a Claim against the other driver because either (1) you do not assert a Claim against the driver, or (2) you assert a Claim against the other driver, but it does not include damages for medical expenses that were paid by the Plan. (B) Reimbursement. The right of reimbursement is the right of the Plan to recover from you or your covered Dependent any and all benefits previous ly paid by the Plan with respect to an injury or condition in the event you are compensated for such injury or condition from any source, whether by settlement, judgment, compromise, or otherwise. The right to reimbursement also includes future medical ex penses, if any. By accepting benefits under the Plan, you are agreeing to reimburse the Plan out of any recovery you might receive from third parties. If you bring a liability Claim against any third party, benefits payable under this Plan must be includ ed in the Claim. Moreover, the Plan has a right to reimbursement from you, your Covered Dependent (s), and/or any assignee(s) for any benefit overpayments attributable to mistake, clerical error, fraud, or any other reason contributing to a payment not fully payable under the terms of the Plan. You must not do anything which would prejudice the Plan's rights of reimbursement . You may be required to sign and deliver documents reasonably necessary to secure the rights of the Plan to reimbursement. Example of Reimbursement: You are injured in a car accident and the Plan pays your medical expenses resulting from the accident. You bring a Claim against the other driver for your injuries, which you eventually settle against the other driver. The Plan is entitled to immediate reimbursement from what you recovered in your s ettlement for all benefits paid by the Plan in connection with your injuries. You may not reduce the amount owed the Plan in order to account for attorney fees and costs . Further, the Plan must be paid first out of the total amount of the settlement. Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 10 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 (C) Amount Due. The amount owed to the Plan may not be reduced by the attorney fees and costs incurred in asserting your Claim against third parties. Moreover, the Plan's rights of subrogation and reimbursemen t take precedence over your right to be made wh ole. (D) Condition of Payment. At the Plan's request, you (or your covered Dependent ) must take any action, give information, and/or execute instruments required by the Plan, in its discretion, in order to aid the Plan in its enforcement of its rights of recovery through reimbursement and subrogation. If you (or your covered Dependent ) fail to comply with such requests, the Plan may withhold benefits, services, payments, or credits due under the Plan. (E) Notice of Potential Third -Party Liability. If a third party may be liable for an injury or illness for which the Plan has paid benefi ts, you must provide notice to the Plan of such third party's potential liability before commencing a legal action against that third party. If a settlement is reached with that third party (or its insurer) without the formal filing of a legal action, you must provide notice of such settlement to the Plan before the settlement is finalized. (F) Coordination of Benefits. If you (or your Covered Dependent) seek benefits under this Plan that are also payable under another medical plan or medical reimbursem ent arrangement (such as Medicare), the plans will coordinate how benefits are to be paid. The procedures governing this coordination of benefits are set forth in the Core Document. (G) Proceeds from Judgment/Settlement Are Plan Assets. Any amount that you (or your covered Dependent) recover from a third party in connection with a judgment, settlement, or otherwise that arises out of an injury for which the Plan has paid benefits will be considered plan assets, thereby rendering you (or your covered Dependent) a fiduciary with respect to those plan assets. The Plan, in turn, may fully enforce its rights against you (or your covered Dependent) under applicable federal and/or state law. IX. Claims Procedures If you have a Claim for benefits under the Plan, you must follow the procedures outlined in Appendix A of this SPD. The Claims Administrator of the Plan is B enefit Management . Please note that Benefit Management has been delegated full discretionary authority in connection with the Plan's internal claims appeal process to make all determinations regarding the administration and payment of Claims, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. X. Your Rights Under ERISA As a Participant in the Plan, you have certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to the following : (A) Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits . You have the right to examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator 's office and at other specified locations, all documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series ) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education 11 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 Effective 0 7/01/2020 You also have the right to obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents gove rning the operation of the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series) and updated summary Plan description. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for th e copies. You further have the right to receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary annual report. (B) Continue Group Health Plan Coverage . You and your Dependent(s) may have the right to continue health care coverage under the Plan if there is a loss of such coverage as a result of a qualifying event. You or your Dependent(s) may have to pay for such coverage. Be sure to review the Plan document as well as the COBRA notice you received after enrolling in the Plan for the specific rules governing your COBRA continuation coverage rights. (C) Prudent Action by Plan Fiduciaries . In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your Employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or from exercising your rights u nder ERISA. (D) Enforcing Your Rights . If your Claim for a welfare benefit under the Plan is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules . Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within thirty (30) days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a Claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a medical Child support orde r, you may file suit in Federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a F ederal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.

This determi nation is based on whether: (a) The Claimant is /was covered under the Plan at the time the Claim was made or incurred; (b) The denial relates to the Claimant's failure to meet the Plan's eligibility requirements. (If the Claim involves an eligibility issue, External Review is not available); (c) The Claimant has exhausted the Plan's internal Claims and Appeal procedures; and (d) The Claimant has provided all the information required to process an External Review. Within one (1) business day after completion of this preliminary review, the Claims Administrator will provide written notification to the Claimant of whether the Claim is eligible for External Review. If the request for review is complete but not eligi ble for External Review, the Claims Administrator will notify the Claimant of the reasons for its ineligibility. The notice will include contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration at its toll free number (866 -444-3272). If the request is not complete, the Claims Administrator's notice will describe the information needed to complete it. The Claimant will have 48 hours or until the last day of the 4 -month filing period, whichever is later, to submit the additional information. Section A.47 Assignment to Independent Review Organization for External Review . If the Claimant's request is eligible for the External Review process, the Plan will assign it to a qualified independent review organization (\"IRO\"). The IRO is responsible for notifying the Claimant, in writing, that the request for External Review has been accepted. The notice will include a statement that the Claimant may submit in writing, within 10 business days, additional information the IRO must consider when conduc ting the review. The IRO will share this information with the Plan. The Plan may consider this information and decide to reverse its denial of the Claim. If the denial is reversed, the External Review process will end. Section A.48 Evaluation of Claim b y IRO. If the Plan does not reverse the denial, the IRO will make its decision on the basis of its review of all of the information in the record, as well as additional information where appropriate and available, such as: (a) The Claimant's medical records; (b) The attending health care professional's recommendation; (c) Reports from appropriate health ca re professionals and other documents submitted by the Plan or issuer, Claimant, or the Claimant's treating provider; (d) The terms of the Plan; (e) Appropriate practice guidelines; (f) Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the Plan; and Benefit Management, LLC Appendix A -14 Summary Plan Description Version 07/17 (g) The opinion of the IRO's clinical reviewer. Section A.49 Claim Decision by IRO . The IRO must provide written notice to the Plan and the Claimant of its final decision within 45 days after the IRO receives the request for the External Review. Section A.50 Availability of Expedited External Review . Generally, a Claimant must exhaust the Plan's Claims and Appeal procedures in order to be eligible for the External Review process. However, in some cases the Plan provides for an expedited External Review. Expedited External Review is available if either of the following two conditions i s satisfied: (a) Requiring Appeal of Adverse Benefit Determination Under Plan's Internal Claims and Appeal Procedure Timetable Would Seriously Jeopardize Claimant's Life or Health . The Claimant receives an Adverse Benefit Determination that involves a medica l condition for which the time for completion of the Plan's internal Claims and Appeal procedures would seriously jeopardize the Claimant's life or health or ability to regain maximum function and the Claimant has filed a request for an expedited internal review; or (b) Final Adverse Benefit Determination Involves Emergency Services and Claimant Remains Hospitalized . The Claimant receives a Final Adverse Benefit Determination that involves a medical condition where the time for completion of a standard Exter nal Review process would seriously jeopardize the Claimant's life or health or the Claimant's ability to regain maximum function, or if the Final Adverse Benefit Determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which the Claimant received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility. Immediately upon receipt of a request for expedited External Review, the Plan must determine and notify the Claimant whether the request satisfie s the requirements for expedited review, including the eligibility requirements for External Review listed above. If the request qualifies for expedited review, it will be assigned to an IRO. The IRO must then make its determination and provide a notic e of the decision as expeditiously as the Claimant's medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than 72 hours after the IRO receives the request for an expedited External Review. If the original notice of its decision is not in writing, the IRO must provide written confirmation of the decision within 48 hours. MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT DESCRIPTION WOMEN'S HEALTH AND CANCER RIGHTS ACT Do you know that your group health plan, as required by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, provides benefits for mastectom y-related services incl uding all stages of reconstruction and surgery to achieve symmetry between the breasts, prostheses, and complications resulting from a mastectomy, including lymphedemas? In the case of a Covered Person who is receiving benefits in co nnection with a mastect omy, coverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient. Such coverage may be subject to the annual Deductible and Co-Insurance provisions as may be deemed appropriate and are consistent with tho se established for other benefits under the plan or coverage. Contact the Claims Administrator for more information: Benefit Management, LLC, PO Box 1090, Great Bend, Kansas 67530, (800) 290 -1368. STATEMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE N EWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' H EALTH PROTECTION ACT Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for t he mother or newborn ch ild to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your physician, nurse mid wife, or physician assi stant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of benefits or out -of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48 -hour (or 9 6-hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for pre scribing a length of st ay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce your out -of-pocket costs, you may be required to obtain pre-certification . For information on pre-certification , contact your Claims Ad ministrator.

Wichita C enter for Graduate Medical Education Appendix B -2 Benefit De scription 07/01/2020 PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (PPO) NETWORK AND NON -NETWORK PROVID ERS This Plan has enter ed into an agreement with certain Hospitals, Physicians and other health care providers in the ProviDRs Care Network, called Network Providers, who have agreed to certain reduced fees.

It is the Covered Person's choice as to which provider to use; however, reimburs ement is at the highest level when services are provided by a PPO Network provider. In order for the claim to be appropriately filed, it is important that the provider of service have the most current identification card. It is the patient's responsibilit y to confirm the most cu rrent card is on file with the provider. Out-of-Area Network The Plan is a plan which contains an Out -of-Area Network (sometimes referred to as a \"travel network\"). The Out-of-Area Network, First Health, is available for Covered P ersons who seek healthca re services outside of the PPO service area.

Additionally, benefits will be upgraded to the PPO Network lev el in limited situations when the Claim s Administrator determines the PPO provider availability is insufficient and a person would be required to travel more than 50 miles to seek services. If a Covered Person receives services from a Municipal Health Dep artment. If a Covered P erson has a Medical Emergency or is out of the PPO service area and has a Medical Emergency requiring immediate care. If a Network Physician or Medical Care Facility refers x -ray and laboratory services to a Non - Network provider. If a Non-Network assist ant surgeon performs services in a Network Facility. If a Covered Person receives Physician or anesthesia services by a Non -Network Provider at a Network facility. If a Covered Person has no choice for purchasing Medical/Surgical Supplies and Durable Med ical Equipment through a Network Provider.

For specific questions about Prescription Drug exclusions or alternatives, contact MedTrak Pharmacy Services . Any medication approved to enter the market will not be covered until reviewed by MedTrak's Clinical Care Center. Step Therapy Program The Step Therapy Program encourages safe and cost -effective medication use. Under this program, a \"step\" approach is utilized for certain high -cost medications. To receive the benefit, the Covered Person may be directed to first try a pr oven cost-effective medication before using a more costly treatment, if possible. However, treatment decisions are always between the patient and the patient's Physician. Drug categories which may be included in the Step Therapy Program are medications s uch as A lpha- Blockers, Blood Pressure, Diabetes medication, High Cholesterol, Depression, Acid Reflux, Acne, Proton Pump Inhibitors and more. For a specific list of Step Therapy Program medications contact MedTrak Services at the number listed on the Cover ed Person's ID car d. The Step Therapy Program requires th e Covered Person to have a prescription history for a \"first -step\" medication before ther Plan will cover a \"second -step\" drug. A first -step drug is recognized as safe and effective in treating a s pecific medical co ndition, as well as being cost -effective. A second -step drug is a less - preferred or sometimes more costly treatment option. Step 1 - Whenever possible, the Physician should prescribe a first -step medication that is appropriate for treatment of the medical condition. Step 2 - If the Physician determines that the first -step drug is not appropriate or is not effective, the Plan will cover a second -line drug when certain conditions are met. The Pharmacy and the Covered Person's Physician will work with MedTrak Services to obtain prior authorization for second -step medications.

The BIC Align Program is designed to maximize manu facturer C o-pay assistance for conditions such as Hepatitis C, HIV, Inflammatory Conditions and Multiple Sclerosis Members will pay no more than the Brand Name drug flat C o-payment for Special ty Drugs when active in the progr am.

Contraception and Sterilization Ag All Food and Dr ug Adminis tration (\"FDA\") approved contraception and sterilization agents for women are covered at 100% without cost -sharing when purchased at a Network Pharmacy. If a Gener ic drug is available and the patient or Physician, for whatever reason, requests a Brand Name drug, the patient will pay the applicable Formulary or Non -Formulary Co-Payment. If a Generic is not available, then the contraception or sterilization agent is c overed at 100% withou t cost-sharing when purchased at a Network Pharmacy. If a comp elling med ical reason exists, the Claims Administ rator may approve an alternative Brand Name Drug. 90/91 Day Packaged Products at Retail Certain medications are packaged a nd sold in 90/91 day supplies.

The program consists of: (a) Pre-certification of the Medical Necessity for the following non -emergency services before Medical and/or Surgical services are provided: 1. Inpatient stays for medical and/or psychiatric or substance use l. Genetic Testin g 2. Outpatient surgery not performed in an office setting m. Home Health Care 3.

Wichita C enter for Graduate Medical Education Appendix B -31 Benefit De scription 07/01/2020 (b) Retrospective review of the Medical Necessity of the listed services provided on an emergenc y basis; (c) Concurrent review, based on the admitting diagno sis, of the listed services requested by the attending Physician; a nd (d) Certification of serv ices and planning for discharge from a Medical Care Facility or cessation of medical treatment. Pre-certification is the process of obtaining Medically Necessary certification. This program is not designed to be the practice o f medicine or to be a substit ute for the medical judgment of the attending Physician or other health care provider. If a particular course of treatment or medical service is not certified, it means that either the Plan will not pay for the charges or the Plan will not consider that c ourse of treatment as appropriate for the maximum reimbursement under the Plan. The patient is urg ed to find out why there is a discrepancy between what was requested and what was certified before incurring charges. The attend ing Physician does not have t o obtain pre-certification from the Plan for prescribing a maternity length of stay that is 48 hou rs or less for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours or less for a cesarean delivery. In order to maximize Plan reimbursements, please read the following provisions carefully. Here's how the program works. Pre-certification . Before a Covered Person enters a Me dical Care Facility on a non-emergency bas is or receives certain non-emergency outpatient services requiring pre -certification , the utilization review adminis trator will, in conjunction with the attending Physician, certify the care as appropriate for Plan reimbursement. A non-emergency stay in a Medical Care Facility is one that can be scheduled in advance. The utilization review program is set in motion by a telephone call from, or on behalf of, the Covered Person. Contact the utilization review administ rator at the telephone nu mber on your ID c ard in advance of the date the services are scheduled to be rendered with the following information: - The name of the patient and relationship to the covered Employee, - The name, employee identification numb er and address of the cov ered Employee, - The name of the Employer, - The name and telephone number of the attending Physic ian, - The name of the Med ical Care Facility, proposed date of admission, and proposed length of stay , and - The proposed medical services . If there is an emergency admission to the Medical Care Facility, the patient, patient's family member, authorized representative, Medical Care Facility or attending Physician must contact the utilization review administrator within thre e (3) business days after the admission. The utilization review administrator will determine the Medically Necessary number of confinement days or whether th e outpatient care, treatment, or services is appropriate for the condition being treated . Failure to follow this procedure may redu ce reimbu rsement received from the Plan. If the Covered Person does not receive pre-certificati on for Inpatient admissions a s explained in this section, the benefit payment will be reduced by $250 per confinement. Concurrent review, discharge pl anning. Concurren t review of a course of treatment and discharge planning from a Medical Care Facility a re parts of the utilization r eview program. The utilization review administrator Wichita C enter for Graduate Medical Education Appendix B -32 Benefit De scription 07/01/2020 will monitor the Covered Person's Medical Care Facility stay or use of other medical services and coordinate with the attending Physician, Medical Care Facilities and Covered Person either the scheduled r elease or an extension of the Medical Care Facility stay or extension or cessation of the use of o ther medical services. If the attending P hysician feels that it is Medically Necessary for a Covered Person to receive additiona l services or to stay in the Medical Care Facility for a greater length of time than has been pre-certified, the attending Physician must request the ad ditional services or days. POST-SERVICE CLAIM REVIEW The Plan reserves the right to conduct claim revi ew to ensure that appropriate billing and coding guidelines are applied to Covered Charges. This includes - but is not limited to - guidelines as stipu lated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, the American Medical Association, and the Federal Regist er. Code edits including - but not limited to - reductions and/or denials based on the aforementioned guidelines may be applied . SECOND AND/OR THIRD OP INION PR OGRAM Certain surgical procedures are performed either inappropriately or unnecessarily. In som e cases, surgery is only one of several treatment options. In other cases, surgery will not help the condition. In order to pr event unnecessary or pote ntially harmful s urgical treatments, the second and/or third opinion program fulfills the dual purpose o f protecting the health of th e Plan's Covered Persons and protecting the financial integrity of the Plan. Benefits will be pro vided for a second (and t hird, if first and second opinions are contradictory) opinion consultation to determine the Medical Nece ssity of an elective surgical procedure. An elective surgical procedure is one that can be scheduled in advance; that is, it is not an emergency or of a life-threatening nature. Benefits for the second (and third, if first and second opinions are contradic tory) opinion will be paid as any other Sickness. The patient may choose any board -certified specialist who is not an associat e of the attending Physic ian and who is affiliated in the appropriate specialty. PREADMISSION TESTING SERVICE The Medical Bene fits percentage payable will be for diagnostic lab tests and x -ray exams when: (1) performed on an outpatient basis within se ven days before a Hospita l confinement; (2) related to the condition which causes the confinement; and (3) performed in place of tests while Hospital confined . Covered Charges for this testing will be payable at the applicable Deductible and Co-Insurance even if tests show the co ndition requires medical treatment pr ior to Hospital confinement or the Hospital confinement is not required.

The alternative benefits, called \"Case Management,\" shall be det ermined on a case-by-case basis, and the Plan's determination to provide the benefits in one insta nce shall not obligate th e Plan to provide the same or similar alternative benefits for the same or any other Covered Person, nor shall it be deemed to waive the right of the Plan to strictly enforce the provisions of the Plan. Wichita C enter for Graduate Medical Education Appendix B -33 Benefit De scription 07/01/2020 A case manager consults wit h the patient, the family and the attending Physician in order to develop a plan of care for approval by the patient's attending Physician and the patient. Th is plan of care may include some or all of the following: -- personal support to the patient; -- contacting the family to offer assistance and support; -- monitoring Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility; -- determining alternative care options; and -- assisting in obtaining any necessary equipment and services. Case Management occurs when th is alternate benefit will be beneficial to both the patient and the Plan. The case manager will coordinate and implement the Cas e Management program by provi ding guidance and information on available resources and suggesting the most appropriate treatment plan. The Plan Administr ator, attending P hysician, patient and patient's family must all agree to the alternate treatment plan. Once agreement has been reac hed, the Plan Administrator will direct the Plan to cover Medically Necessary expenses as stated i n the treatment plan, eve n if these expens es normally would no t be paid by the Plan. Unless specifically provided to the contrary in the Plan Administrator's instructions, reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection with the treatment plan shall be s ubject to all Plan limits and cost sharing provisions. Note: Case Management is a voluntary service. There are no reductions of benefits or penalties if the patient and family choose not to participate. Each treatment plan is individually tailored to a s pecific patient and shoul d not be seen as appropriate or recommended for any other patient, even one with the same diagnosis.
