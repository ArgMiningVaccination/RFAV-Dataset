Conventional treatment will \"disguise\" the disorder with a combination of medications that will mask symptoms with a false perception of treatment.

Never go \"cold turkey\" with any medications; work with your prescribing physician to meet your health goals. Stress is the leading cause of health problems, anxiety, and depression. We are continuously exposed to stressors, whether they're related to work, family, relationships, or our environment. A stressor triggers a release of hormones initiating a response from both mind and body to be on high alert. This is commonly called the flight or fight response. We all have different approaches to self-regulating this response, allowing us to relax back to our normal state. However, the inability to handle these stressors, leaving us on high alert, will negatively affect our physical and emotional health. Unresolved stress can alter the pathways that help our brain maintain normal function and balance. Unfortunately, many of us do not recognize stress as the culprit of body, mood, and behavior changes. Anxiety or worry is a natural response experienced from childhood through adulthood. If you find yourself feeling anxious without reason or anxiety is affecting your quality of life, it can be a sign of anxiety disorder.
