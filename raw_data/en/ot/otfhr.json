If you seek experiences that nourish your consciousness and the wellbeing of your mind, body, spirit and relationships, you're in the right place. We begin with your main concern, such as stress (work, relationship, etc.), fertility issues, depression, anxiety, insomnia, gastro-intestinal problems or pain. Since all of you is important, together we pay attention to how all the parts fit together and affect one another, including your inner landscape. It's all part of your Life Journey. If your primary focus is health and wellbeing of mind, body and spirit, book an IntegralHealing Session (in person or online). If your primary focus is creating better relationships with people you care about, book a Safe Conversations Training Session (in person or online) or join an upcoming [worskhop](https://integralhealer.as.me/SafeConversationsWorkshopRegistration). You're supported along the way. IntegralHealer Wellness clients receive a written summary tailored specifically to the situation. Over time, reflections and reminders will continue periodically to nurture your path of healing, growth and wellbeing. Safe Conversations clients also receive companioning updates and guidance throughout the training process. Some of the tools I incorporate are outlined below. Your unique situation and decisions will determine what comprises our Sessions. Acupuncture The body is always striving to heal, but sometimes it needs a helping hand. Acupuncture is a safe and effective therapy that addresses both physiological and energetic disharmonies manifesting as dysfunction or pain of the body, mind and spirit. It involves the gentle, shallow insertion of extremely thin sterile needles into specific prescriptive points on the body. The treatment reverses the body's physiological stress responses, relieves energetic obstructions and recruits the body's own powers of healing.

Many medicinal herbs have clinically proven immune boosting, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, healing and hormonal balancing effects and have been shown to regulate mood, all with no side effects (or very rare and mild ones). Powerful healing tools, Chinese Medicinals and many other natural remedies are only safe when prescribed for your individual presentation by a Board Certified Herbalist like myself (NCCAOM.org). [Read More ](/chinesemedicine) Safe Conversations Training for Pairs (and Group Workshops) Talking is the most dangerous thing most of us do. We hurt each other constantly and rupture our connections to others - not because we are bad people, but because we're unskilled talkers and listeners. But who taught us to taught and listen well? To understand what is affecting us when we talk and listen? No-one. I can teach you to talk in a way that repairs rupture and maintains safe connection, so you can thrive in your relationships. Relational and modern brain science gives us a way to connect beyond our differences, with skills allowing listening without judgement, talking without criticism, and maintaining a safe environment within which to relate. Contact me for more information, or book now to learn Safe Conversations. Workshops and training can be tailored to your group and situation. Fertility Enhancement & Coaching More and more couples face fertility challenges, but Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine can help. In fact, the best fertility doctors in the world such as those of the CCRM network of clinics refer clients to practitioners like myself who are Board Certified in Fertility Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine. Here's a short video interviewing a Doctor at the Center for Reproductive Medicine in Houston explaining why - [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T7eyZguPK0). I use Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Fertility Lifestyle and Nutritional Coaching and other modalities to maximize your chances of successful pregnancy, so you can have the family you've imagined. [Read More](/fertilityenhancement) Cupping and Therapeutic Massage Chinese Medicine massage techniques are well known for their powerful therapeutic effects including pain reduction, stress management, healing promotion and relaxation. A lesser known but trending ancient practice, cupping uses gentle, controlled suction to stimulate blood flow and the lymphatic system, relax tension and open up range of motion in congested joints, muscles and fascia, release toxins through the skin, promote healing, and relieve pain. Cupping treats many kinds of musculoskeletal pain, but also other things like lung congestion and constipation. [Read More ](/cuppingtherapy) Lifestyle & Nutritional Counseling What we eat and drink, what we do and what we repeatedly think (consciously and subconsciously) determine our health and wellbeing to a very large extent. I invite clients to an honest assessment of aspects of their lifestyle, which might include diet, movement, toxin exposure, affirmations, meditations, self care and other practices, as well as their relationships to food, their body, their work and other people. Ultimately, clients learn responsibility for their wellness and how to make their own healthy lifestyle choices to carry them forward. As your coach, I'll help motivate you to mobilize internal and external resources to enact sustainable change. [Read More](/lifestylecounseling) Moxibustion and Infrared Therapy Moxibustion is the ancient therapeutic practice of burning moxa (the medicinal plant mugwort, Artemesia Vulgaris) close to particular points of the body, penetrating the body with a unique heat signature to effect beneficial change. Both moxibustion and infrared-lamp therapy reduce inflammation and focus the body's healing potential on painful or dysfunctional areas, promoting healing of joints, muscles, nerves and other tissues. Both therapies are also relaxing and feel amazing; I'll make sure you don't get too hot or uncomfortable. Particularly special is moxa's ability to increase fetal movement in the womb to correct breach positioning in the later weeks of pregnancy. IntegralHealer Support I support to individuals (and couples) as they walk their divine soul development journey on Earth. We're here in physical form to grow spiritually, to learn, grow and heal. As an ordained interfaith minister, I midwife clients through life's sometimes challenging but ever-present changes, no matter the faith background. Being out of one's spiritual purpose and alignment can manifest as pain, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, poor mood, a feeling of meaninglessness and relationship and work struggles, for example. Through our partnership, your personal innate wisdom and divine inspiration will surface to consciousness where it's available to guide you. [Read More](/spiritualcounseling) Celebrations and Ceremonies As an interfaith/interspirtual minister, I create soulful customized celebrations, services and rituals that reflect your unique personalities, dreams, spiritual backgrounds, values and relationships. Do you need help creatively incorporating aspects of one or more faith traditions into your ceremony? Dreaming of a sweet baby blessing ceremony where your family and loved ones feel intimately included in welcoming your precious new arrival? Excited to celebrate the kicking of a habit, a successful personal campaign, a graduation or the welcome end of a particularly challenging phase of your life? Wondering how to honor a loved one who has passed with a tailored and uplifting Life Celebration service? Be it a wedding, baby blessing, home blessing, vow renewal, memorial service, funeral or any other ceremony or ritual, I'll work with you to ensure you have a ceremony that appropriately delights, comforts and inspires. I also at times incorporate aspects of ritual and ceremony as appropriate into client sessions. "}
