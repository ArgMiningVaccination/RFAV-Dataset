Update - version 2.4 Fully describe what is the purpose of the project and how is the processing of information necessary to that work? NHS England has commissioned NHS South , Central and West CSU (which is part of NHS England) to implement a National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) . The implementation of NIMS will deliver a centralised service for the management of : seasonal flu immunisation and clinical cohorts as part of the call / recall service for COVID va ccinations This service is an essential component of NHS England's response to the COVID -19 pandemic. This is because : 1. it will help to ensure that any second \"spike\" in coronavirus infections in England is separated in time as far as possible from the annual flu epidemic - so minimising pressures on NHS resources 2. it will provide a mechanism for the delivery of the national COVID -19 immunisation programme by establishing a dynamic infrastructure capable of responding rapidly to target appropriate cohorts across the whole population of England. It is essential that the two programmes are coordin ated to accommodate the developing characteristics of the pandemic, and any interfaces between the vaccines , and their delivery processes as they are established . To this end the Immunisation Management System (IMS), the central database that supports th e NIMS will be populated with 1. demographic information from the Personal Demographics Service for everyone resident and registered with a GP in England (excluding S flags indicating that a record is sensitive , so access is restricted ) - 2. SNOMED flu clusters which indicate vulnerability to flu, and underlying conditions for everyone registered with a GP in England ( again excluding S flags) Any additional SNOMED clusters extracted from GP system suppliers defined as necessary for identification of COVID at risk groups for call/ recall and management of the vaccination service as determined in partnership with PHE / Chief Medical Officer NHS Digital have agreed to provide both the demographic and clinical dataset s as an initial load and on an on -going basis. Work will be carried out with System C (Data Processor) who will develop the technical infrastructure. ----------- The seasonal flu programme is a long -established and successful vaccination programme that has saved lives and deliver ed a cost -effective prevention programme, along with reducing pressures on NHS services during the winter. The annual vaccination progra mme is a critical element of the system -wide approach for delivering robust and resilient services throughout the year. The service has traditionally been offered to patients in specified 'at risk' cohorts and to those aged 65 years and over and was expa nded in 2013 to include the first children's programme. This children's programme has expanded year upon year and in 19/20 covered children aged 2 years to those in school year 6 inclusively. Originally , the services were mainly delivered by the register ed General Practice (GP) of the patient , but this model has expanded to include community pharmacists, maternity units, school -aged vaccination providers and others as the programme developed and the cohorts increased. Some provision is universally offered and there are also additional regional variations to suit the local populations and to ensure that diverse groups are catered for and that inequalities are minimised . Uptake of the vaccination varies locally and regionally and is different for each cohor t. In 19/20 the vaccination uptake rates ranged from 43.8% for 2 and 3 year olds to 72.4% for the '65 years and over' cohort. In all cohorts , coverage has failed to reach the desired aspirational targets each year. The measures introduced by the Governmen t in England to contain and control the spread of the COVID -19 virus will impact on the delivery of the seasonal flu programme in 2020/21. Social distancing, shielding of the most vulnerable patients, public awareness and perceptions of viruses, herd imm unity and infection control, alongside the public drive to protect the NHS are all contributing factors. The current uncertainty of when and how lockdown measures put in place by the Government are likely to be relaxed or changed is also a limiting factor that requires a variety of delivery options to be developed . A cohort by cohort approach to operational planning and delivery has been taken below with the addition of some cross -cutting themes. The project is based on the existing children's immunisatio n service which is managed by NHS South Central and West CSU (SCW). This model has been expanded to cover all citizens. The service uses two integrated standard off the shelf software systems: the CarePlus immunisation system, and the CareCentric share d record system, supplied by the System C and Graphnet Care Alliance. CarePlus currently manages immunisations for around half of children in England and combined with CareCentric it delivers the children's immunisation programme for all of Greater Londo n. CareCentric holds and provides access to very detailed clinical records including primary care records for over 12m English citizens. NIMS will be supported by an Immunisation Management System (IMS). This platform will integrate new instances of CarePlus and CareCentric. It will be populated initially with demographic data representing the population of England from the Personal Demographics Service which is processed by NHS Digita l under Direction of the Department of Health and Soc ial Care and NHS England . It will subsequently receive regular updates to ensure that the two systems remain synchronised. NHS Digital will also provide SNOMED Flu Clusters with underlying conditions , which will be mapped to the demographic data in IMS . This will enable NHS England flexibly to identify cohorts for invitation for both flu and COVID -19 immunisation when the vaccine becomes available. It is essential that there is interoperability between the demographic data required for Flu and COVID -19 immunisation s to ensure that that we are able to accurately track immunisation status. A Summary of how the Service will Work Loading the national citizen list. The Immunisation Management System (IMS) population list will be fed from the Spine Demograph ics Reporting Service (SDRS). This includes demographic details for every citizen. There will be an initial load of data and the system will then be connected to receive nightly spine updates. Loading SNOMED flu cluster data to enable cohort selection. NHS Digital will provide SNOMED flu clusters with underlying condition to enable NHS England to identify cohorts to be invited for immunisation. For COVID, the SNOMED Clinical Risk Clusters will be extracted directly from GP System Suppliers. Adding additional citizen data. There are other factors such as the shielded patient lists, health staff and social care worker lists etc which could be used to augment the clinical data and further refine the system for selection and reporting purposes. Lists of unpaid carers are obtained via NHS Digital from the DWP, Local Authorities and other sources. Selecting citizens to immunise. The system will have an interactive dashboard which will allow the selection of cohorts of citizens to call for immuni sation. Factors such as age, ethnic origin, gender, social determinants (e.g. economic banding), frailty, and underlying conditions can be added. The system will show how many citizens will be called if the selection criteria entered are used. The analysi s will include a full geographical breakdown so users can ensure there are sufficient vaccinations and delivery capacity to meet demand. Citizens already vaccinated will be excluded automatically. Processing selected citizens. Once the groups to immun ise have been selected on the interactive dashboard , the selection criteria will be notified to the Immunisation Management System (IMS) for processing. Calling citizens for vaccination . Once the cohort selection has been processed by the IMS the following steps will occur: o Scheduling. The IMS will action the selection criteria and generate the list of citizens to be invited for immunisation. The list of selected citizens will be sent to the mailing service and the national booking system managed by NHS Digital as a controller . o Calling citizens for vaccination . The mailing service will produce the invitation letters using pre -defined templates. The letters will include details signposting citizens to local vaccination centres appropriate for the locality (e.g. GP Practice, national and independent vaccination centres). The letters will be posted in blue envelopes to mitigate risk of loss in postal service. o Returned Post. The mailing service will provide a list of the details of any citizens where the post has been returned. o Reminding citizens not yet vaccin ated. The IMS will monitor the citizens invited and send out a reminder via text or letter to any who have not yet been vaccinated or who have not booked an appointment through the national booking system. o Booking an Appointment. The citizen will arrang e for an appointment with a local vaccination service and the booking will be managed locally by the vaccination services or alternatively through the national booking service. Booking methods will include on -line registration, telephone bookings and walk -in centres ; the booking system is out of scope for the IMS. o If the citizen makes a booking through the national booking service, the national booking system will be able to validate that the citizen has been selected. Recording vaccinations given. When a citizen attends for vaccination the immuniser will be able to use one of a number of point of care systems provided by NHS England as a controller to record vaccinations given and adverse reactions: o NIMS Web App - an integral part of NIMS - see below. o Arden and GEM NIVS app for health and care workers recorded on the NHS Electr onic Staff Record ( flu and COVID ); Maternity patients for flu only (a separate DPIA has been approved for this by NHS England ) o The Pinnacle Pharmoutcomes system for GP Practices and vaccination centres run by Primary Care Networks and Trust s. (delivered by EMIS/Pinnacle as a processor on behalf of NHS England) In addition to the systems listed above, similar point of care systems commissioned by other organisations enable them to record vaccinations given. The providers of th ese systems act as processors for the commissioning organisations, for example the GP practices comprising a Primary Care Network. All of these systems provide updates to NIM S via NHS Digital - see the Providers to NHS Digital section in the Data Flows - detailed flows section . The only exceptio n to this is the NIMS Web App which updates NIMS directly - see process I3 in the Data Flows - detailed flows section . All of the point of care systems access the IMS lookup. This provide s details regarding the citizen's immunisation status and pertinent medical conditions so that the immuniser can make an informed decision on whether it is safe to administer the immunisation or not. The immuniser will be able to record the details of the vaccine administered directly to the IMS using the Web APP. For GPs, this information will come automatically through the GP data feed. Immunisation centres will also be able to send an electronic list of citizens immunised on a daily basis via the Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH). Other attributes are collected at the point of care include: Carer Social care worker Health care worker Care home worker Care home resident Ethnic category Also Vaccination location Care home details Informing GPs. The IMS will send daily updates to GP systems to allow them to update their local record and monitor progress for their citizens. Providing real -time local and national statistics. The system provides a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Micro soft Power -BI which allows comprehensive dashboarding and analysis of the vaccination programme in real time. This service is an integral part of the call/recall process and drives initiatives to increase uptake. Dashboards can be provided at national, r egional, STP, local authority, ICS/P or GP practice level and in each case will only cover statistics for the citizens covered at that area. Reports provide aggregate level population reporting on flu and covid vaccination uptake with the ability to drill to practice and ward level granularity. Providing person -identifiable and pseudonymised data for vaccination management and recall Organisations supplying a workforce file to NIMS (D4) have the ability to view vaccination status within their organisation. The report allows drill down to person -identifiable level data and person details can be exported. Access is via the IMS Workforce Status App. Vaccination sites have access to person -identifiable data from their point of care system (e.g. Pi nnacle) relating to the patie nts that they have vaccinated for the purposes of identifying patients to conduct second dose COVID vaccination recall . Vaccination sites also have access to pseudonymised data which can be analysed to produce aggregate report s vir management and planning purposes, without the need to reveal patient identities. SMS Invitations: Content Optimisation Trial A random selection of individuals will be sent one of 5 variants on the SMS. Objectives: Which BI informed text message will maximise the likelihood of booking a COVID -19 vaccination appointment and receiving first -dose vaccination? The primary outcome will be the booking rate within 72 hours of receiving the SMS and the secondary outcome will be the first dose vacc ination rate within 14 days of receiving the SMS. A unique pseudonym ID is required to enable linkages when updates are received relating to the same patient, without revealing their identity. Pseudonymised datasets will be sent to Behavioural Insights for analysis. Behavioural Insights is a processor acting for NHS England .

If all of the screening questions are answered N o, you do not need to complete the rest of the form, but the central or regional Corporat e IG team must still review and approve the document . Personal data3 Why would it not be possible to do without personal data? The system needs to include citizens personal and clinical details in order to be able to call and recall citizens for immunisations, to determine cohorts of patients to immunise and to plan remedial action where take up is insufficient. What are the required personal data? Please itemise them or supply a dummy sample, blank forms, screenshots from the prototype system etc. The data that is loaded in to the IMS will include demographic data, SNOMED flu clusters and underlying conditions for every patient registered with a GP in England. See the table below for the SNOMED flu clusters. 3 'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person We need the full demographic data for PDS so that we can have a consistent denominator for reporting vaccine uptake and also for trace ability between the population for the interplay between Flu and COVID cohorts . We need all the events data for each vaccination event per person to inform future call/recall activities - this will include specifically which vaccine type was used (i.e. which variation of flu vaccine , or which variation of COVID vaccine ) given there will be different brands/types of vaccine for both vaccination programmes that may lead to different call/recall business logic. Please confirm that this is the minimum amount of personal data that is necessary. Yes - the da ta flows, datasets and justifications are set out in the data flows section. Would it be possible for NHSE to use pseudonymised personal data for any element of the processing? The solution uses de -identified data in all areas where identified data is not required. In particular the cohort selection, planning and reporting functions work with de -identified data only. If Y, please specify the element(s) and describe the pseud onymisation technique(s) that we are proposing to use. Anonymised and/or pseudonymised data will be used for cohort monitoring and update purposes. The solution uses de -identified data in all areas where identified data is not required. In particular the cohort selection, planning and reporting functions work with de - identified data only.

If information exists in the immunisation management service about that patient, the status will be returned - including: If the patient has been assessed as \"ready\" for a COVID vaccination (i.e. they are eligible to book) The type of COVID vaccination(s) that the person has been selected for (based on rules applied by NIMS) The date of their most recent Flu vaccine The dates of their most recent COVID vaccines (doses 1 and 2) The type of COVID vaccination administered (dose 1 only) C3a: Query for Invited and Recent Imms (Pinnacle) IMS Pinnacle As C3 As C3 As C3 As C3 C3b: Query for Invited and Recent Imms (EVA Healthcare) IMS Pinnacle As C3 As C3 As C3 As C3 C4: Bookings Data Returned To be able to report on booking that have been made, changes to booking, cancellations, etc. data can be sent back into the IMS Pop Health repository Booking Service IMS SFTP Daily Graphnet: NIMS Feed Spec - Booked List for Booking Service CSV C4 0.7.docx\" Receipt by the by the National Immunisation Management System (IMS) for eligible individuals who have booked or cancelled an appointment with the National Booking System (NBS) , regional booking service , or Trusts using SimplyBook for a COVID vaccination.

NHS Number, booking information and cohort . C4a: Trusts create C4 from SimpyBook data and Imms IMS [* verify] [* verify] C4 spec. We asked all booking services to provide a daily file of the bookings that have been made in their system, so we know not to invite/remind people who already have a booking for a Vaccination. Whilst the other booking services (National Booking Service and AccuBook) are able to do this directly from their booking system, the SimplyBook system used by a number of acute trusts wasn 't able to provide this daily extract directly. One of the trusts involved (Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust) therefore created a utility which accesses data held in SimplyBook, and uses it to produce the file each day. However, the data they capture in SimplyBook and are able to extract using this utility does not give them the dose sequence that was booked (i.e. whether it was a dose 1 or dose 2). They therefore requested access to the immunisation status API to allow t hem to query the status of the patient 's existing vaccinations to determine whether the booking was for a dose 1 or dose 2. They do this by comparing the dose 1 administered date returned by the immunisation status API with the booking scheduled date/time from SimplyBook.

To make de -identified NIMS COVID -19 vaccination data available for scientific research and statistical analysis purposes through the ONS Secure R esearch Service (SRS) to Accredited Researchers including those working for the Accredited Projects of SPI -M members, AND To link the vaccination data to other data held by ONS, as approved by the relevant Controllers on a case by case basis. The purpose of each research project will be subject to the Accreditation of the Research Accreditation Panel according to the criteria established by the Digital Economy Act's Research Code of Practice, and will be published in accordance with that Code. Projects ena bled by this agreement are listed below: The Community Infection Study is a large, random -sample household based study of Covid -19 incidence. It is of considerable scientific research value to link the CIS data with vaccination data to better inform polic y decisions made on the basis of incidence rates tracked through this study. Participants in the CIS do so on a voluntary basis and are informed on the intent to use these to link their data from the study with other data sources (see study protocols whic h can be found here: https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid -19/covid -19- infection -survey/protocol -and-information - sheets). This agreement enables ONS to perform the link to NIMS vaccination data and to anonymise the resulting liked data such that the data can be u sed by Accredited Researchers, including the ONS's research partners in the Community Infection Study, Oxford University; and the Joint Biosecurity Centre, subject to the approval of the Research Accreditation Panel. The ONS has produced a de -identified, linked analytical dataset drawing together information on socio -demographic characteristics from the 2011 Census, death outcomes from death registrations, hospitalisation due to COVID -19 and information on comorbidities from NHS HES and GPES datasets. Thi s dataset has enabled urgent analysis to determine population -level relative risk for different Covid -19 outcomes for different people. It is of significant research value to include vaccination data in the ONS COVID -19 risk models. This allows for researc h models using vaccination data as: (i) the exposure of interest (i.e. is vaccination associated with reduced risk of adverse outcomes); (ii) a confounder to be controlled for (i.e. does the relationship between socio -economic exposure and outcome still ho ld after controlling for vaccination status); and (iii) an outcome (i.e. are certain socio -demographic groups more/less likely to take -up vaccination). Names are required for clinical safety reasons. SPI-M1: SPI-M (SPI -M are an independent group set up by the Government to support SAGE with COVID.)

GDPR Article 9(2)(j) Yes Common law duty of confidentiality Are any of the data subject to a duty of confidentiality (e.g. clinical records, OH details, payroll information)? If so, please specify them. Yes Where it is planned to disclose such data, what are the grounds for doing so? Consent No Please describe Safeguarding No Please describe Other overriding public interest No Please describe Legal duty or permissive power (e.g. s251 support, court order) Yes NHS England - power to receive and process confidential patient information NHS England is processing Confidential Patient Informatio n for the purposes of the NI MS under The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 - regulation 3(1) and 3(3)(c) This power applies to NHS England's dissemination of confidential patient information to Public Health England (The da ta disseminated to MHRA (CPRD) is pseudonymised) Health organisations - power to disclose confidential patient information Under the provisions of the COPI Notice, issued by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, NHS organisations are legally required (not just 'requested') to provide confidential patient information about patients and, where relevant ( e.g. the vaccination programme), staff to support the response to the pandemic. This includes the flu and COVID -19 vac cination programme. The COPI notice specifically states that confidential patient information can be shared to support: \"understanding .... about patient access to health services and adult social care services and the need for wider care of patients and vulnerable groups as a direct or indirect result of COVID -19 and the availability and capacity of those services or that care.\" And can be relied on for reasons, including: It is critical that we reduce ill health and complications from flu and as far as possible avoid outbreaks, particularly when the NHS is already dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Failure to manage flu, and its impact on the NHS, will reduce the capacity of the health and care system to treat patients infected with COVID -19. It is important to monitor take -up of the flu vaccine by staff and the potential impact staff absence might have on the capacity of health and care organisations to manage COVID -19. Being forewarned about the risks that flu might pose to the health and care sy stem is necessary to support planning for the response to COVID -19. The general COPI notice can be accessed -2002 -general If the processing is of data concerning health or social care, is it for a purpose other than direct care8? Yes - Monitoring and reporting on the uptake of the vaccination . 8 direct care: a clinical, social or public health activity concerned with the prevention, investigation and treatment of illness and the alleviation of suffering of individuals. It includes supporting individuals' ability to function and improve t heir participation in life and society. It includes the assurance of safe and high quality care and treatment through local audit, the management of untoward or adverse incidents, person satisfaction including measurement of outcomes undertaken by one or more registered and regulated health or social care professionals and their team with whom the individual has a legitimate relationship for their care. Consultation Would it be appropriate to seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the proposed processing? No If Y, how will this be done? If N, why is this the case? Urgent implementation in the context of the COV ID-19 pandemic. Would it be helpful to seek advice from independent experts (clinicians, security experts, ethicists etc.) where their specialist knowledge would be useful in understanding and managing privacy risks?

No Risks What are the identified risks of the processing? Please complete risk register attached . Incident reporting What plans are in place in relation to the internal reporting of a personal data breach? (NB Unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and NHSE / CSU incident reporting procedure and Deputy DPO Risk Escalation Framework NHS England have a standard process and are working with analysts to set up a process whereby they will log incidents of inadvertent freedoms of the individual(s), it will normally need to be reported to the ICO within 72 hours.) re-identification of de -identified data to ensure lessons are learned. Given the current controls the risk of re- identification remains unlikely without unreasonable effort. What plans are in place in relation to the notification of data subjects should there be a personal data breach? (NB Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the individual(s), they should be notified as soon as reasonably feasible and provided with any recommendations to mitigate p otential adverse effects.) NHSE & CSU incident reporting Procedure and Deputy DPO Risk Escalation Framework Business continuity planning How will the personal data be restored in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident? There are several aspects to this implementation , some of which are either newly developed or new to Azure . Disaster Recovery Plans will be reviewed and updated as required. The Business Continuity plan will need to be reviewed for this service. However, for the backend application the following will be applicable: Azure PITR (Point In Time Restore) backup functionality on all SQL databases, which allows data to be restored to any point in the last 7 days. Should there be a need to restore a database, an appropriate point in time will be agreed with customer and the database restored to that point. In the event of the need to restore, an appropriate point in time will be agreed with customer then a restore will be produced from that point in time. Resilience and availability levels (BCP/DR) are typically defined within the customer's contract and would be provided using the two Azure data centres, namely, UK South and UK West. Microsoft Azure operates at TIA942 Tier 3 equivalence and the datacent res are engineered to provide 99.999% availability. Azure provides multiple availability zones for customers to deploy resources to ensure availability. Standard Azure networking has built-in DDoS protection. Records Management Will corporate records be created and / or managed as a result of this processing? Yes Where will these records be stored? IMS database Is there a trained Records and Information Management Coordinator (RIMC) responsible for these records? Retention of personal data What is/are the retention period(s) for the personal data? Data will be retained for 6 years from the last event date and reviewed at that point to ascertain if there is a need to retain it longer. What is the basis for this retention period? (Please indicate applicable guidance or rationale) The Records Management Code of Practice does not specify the retention for immunisation data. The NHSE records management team have provided advice that 6 years, with review , is recommen ded. Where personal data are processed outside of NHSE's premises or systems, how will they be securely returned to NHSE for the remainder of the retention period(s) as and when this becomes necessary (e.g. following the closure of the project)? The m echanism for the either deletion or return of the data to NHSE at the end of the contract period will be agreed between the parties , but will be in line with the relevant/appropriate security standards. Direct marketing10 Will any personal data be processed for direct marketing purposes? No If Yes, please describe how the proposed direct marketing will take place: Data portability Where the processing is based on consent or due to a contract, it is carried out by automated means and the data subject has provided the personal data to us, will it be possible to provide them or a different controller with the personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine -readable format ? (NB This does not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller - GDPR Article 6(1)(e ).) N/A 10 direct marketing is \"the communication (by whatever means) of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to part icular individuals\" - all promotional material falls within this definition, including material promoting the aims of not -for-profit organisations Automated processing Will the processing result in a decision being made about the data subject solely on the basis of automated processing11 (including profiling12)? No If Yes, is the decision: necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller authorised by law based on the data subject's explicit consent? Please describe the logic involved in any automated decision -making. Please outline the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. ICT Will we, or the data processor(s), be using a new system to process the personal data? Yes - the IMS described above. 11 examples include the automatic refusal of an online credit application and e -recruiting practices without any human intervention 12 'profiling ' means any form of automated processing of persona l data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferen ces, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements If Yes to the above question around new systems, please ensure that a System Level Security Policy is completed , risk assessed by ICT and attached to this DPIA before proceeding to the sign off stage below.
