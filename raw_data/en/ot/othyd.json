Vitamin C works as a protective compound that helps prevent and fight harmful microorganisms, support respiratory health and overall immunity. Moreover, vitamin C protects biomolecules, like DNA and collagen, and offers anti-aging benefits as a bonus.* Delivers Phenolic Compounds & Other Bioactive Substances: Phenolic compounds are naturally occurring compounds from plants that strengthen your immune system and boost overall health. They are present in elderberries, echinacea, and turmeric, and increase your body's power to fight free radicals. Turmeric, rich in curcuminoids, and garlic, which contains allicin, are known for their immune enhancing properties. * Strengthens Natural Defenses & Immune System Function: The natural components in black elderberries are shown to stimulate immune cell multiplication and the production of protective proteins. Defense cells and proteins are your body's power to fight foreign molecules - and the more of them you have the better you will react when you face an immune challenge. * Supports The Respiratory System: Many of the immune challenges we face on a regular basis affect the respiratory system. Black elderberries, echinacea, vitamin C, and probiotics have all been shown in clinical studies to support immune responses and help regulate your immune system, decreasing the length and the severity of temporary, immune-related discomforts. * Helps to Prevent & Fight Free Radicals: Several things cause increased oxidative stress in the body. Reactive oxygen species are constantly produced by our immune cells to fight off invaders, and they need to be neutralized not to harm our own cells and affect our health. Antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and phenolic compounds can fight free radicals and protect your cells from damage. * "}
