Often misunderstood as just a random series of Ayurvedic treatments, Panchakarma is in fact a very specific protocol, with a defined minimum duration. Not suitable for everyone, you'll be assessed by an experienced Ayurvedic doctor before booking a retreat. We are one of the few places in the world where Panchakarma is made equally comfortable and fruitful, through our unique cuisine, complementary therapies, healing spaces, caring team, and beautiful environment.
