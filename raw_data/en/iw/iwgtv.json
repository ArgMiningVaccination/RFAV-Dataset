It's much more possible that various prescription medications you're taking may combine in ways that make you shaky. - Getting older- Although you are wiser and older, you could be a little less stable. As you age, your inner ear balancing system may deteriorate. Poor balance might result from weak eyesight, hearing, or even touch senses, all of which can worsen over time.
