Before registration of a medicine, access is usually limited to clinical trials authorised by the Authority. SAHPRA may, in certain circumstances, and in accordance with section 21 of the Act, authorise the sale of an unregistered medicine for such purposes and in such manner and during such period as the Authority may determine. Whilst clinical trials are authorised by the Authority in accordance with section 21 of the Act, authorisation of the sale of unregistered medicines used in clinical trials is not covere d by this document. Guidelines that detail authorisation for the use of unregistered medicines as part of a clinical trial can be accessed at https://www.sahpra.org.za/ . Post-trial access to an investigational med icine must be done in accordance with the relevant guideline issued by the Authority (SAHPRA Guideline 2.42: Post Clinical Trial Drug Access) . In cases where it is not possible to adhere to that guideline, justification and motivation must be submitted with an application for authorisation to sell unregistered medicines in terms of section 21 of the Act, which will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis, to ensure that participant safety and wellbeing is not compromised. The main purpose of any authorisation granted in terms of section 21 of the Act is to provide access to medicines on an exceptional basis, where conventional therapies have been rule d out, have failed or are unavailable. This must always have regard to the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines accessed through section 21 which are set out in regulation 29. Affordability on its own is not generally a significant reason to grant a section 21 authori sation, however , applications will be considered on a case -by-case basis. The importation of unregistered medicines for purposes of exhibitions is not covered in this guideline and must be done in accordance with regulation 43 of the Gene ral Regulations. Access to veterinary (Category C) medicines is not addressed in this guideline. 1.3 Objectives This document is intended to clarify the mandate, intent and scope of access to unregistered medicines in terms of section 21 of the Act according to the scope of the document described in 1.2 and outlines: a) the process to be followed to enable access to a medicine that is not registered for sale in South Africa; b) the responsibilities of sellers of unregistered medicine including health care providers, persons submitting an application on behalf of a health establishment, and the holders of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act; c) the role and responsibilities of the organisational unit responsible for managing applications submitted in terms of section 21 of the Act (Section 21 Unit); and d) the information required to comply with section 21 of the Act and regulation 29 of the General Regulations made in terms of the Act. Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 5 of 17 1.4 Legislative Provisions Section 1 of the Act defines \"sell\" as follows: \"sell\" means sell by wholesale or retail and includes import, offer, advertise, keep, expose, transmit, consign, convey or deliver for sale or authorize, direct or allow a sale or prepare or possess for purposes of sale, and barter or exchange or supply or dispose of to any person whether for a consideration or otherwise; and \"sale\" and \"sold\" have corresponding meanings; Section 1(3) of the Act states: In determining whether or not the registration or availability of a medicine is in the public interest, regard shall be had only to the safety, quality and therapeutic efficacy thereof in relation to its effect on the health of a person, as the case may be.

(5) A medicine referred to in sub -regulation (1) shall be properly labelled and the package shall sufficiently identify the information. 1.5 Definitions For the purposes of this guideline any word or expression to which a meaning has been assigned in the Act or General Regulations shall have the meaning so assig ned and, unless the context otherwise indicates - \"adverse drug reaction\" means a noxious and unintended response to a medicine; \"Authority\" means the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority established by section 2 of the Act \"health care provider\" means a health care provider as defined in section 1 of the National Health Act, 2003 (Act No. 61 of 2003); \"institution\" means any organisation that wishes to sell an unregistered medicine and includes a health establishment as defined in sectio n 1 of the National Health Act, 2003 (Act No. 61 of 2003), or the holder/s of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of section 22C(1)(b) of the Act; and \"medicine\" means medicine as defined in terms of the Act. \"public health emergency\" means an extraordinary event which, in consultation with the National Department of Health of South Africa, has been determined to: (a) constitute a serious health risk to members of the pub lic of the Republic of South Africa; or (b) cause or has the potential to cause an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 1.6 General principles Authorisation for the sale of an unregistered medicine in terms of section 21 of the Act must be granted prior to any such medicine being import ed into , or manufactured in the Republic of South Africa. No person may sell any unregistered medicine unless they have been so authorised as an applicant or co -applicant in terms of section 21 of the Act. Conditions associated with the authorisation for the sale of an unregistered medicine may be imposed at the time of authorisation or during the authorisation as additional conditions in line with the provisions of section 21 of the Act and regulation 29 of the General Regulatio ns.

POSSIBLE ACCESS SCENARIOS 2.1 Individual named patient Description This scenario considers access to unregistered medicines for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of conditions, diseases or disorders for an individually named patient when conventional therapies have been considered and ruled out, have failed, are unsuitable or unavailable as marketed products. Section 21 access should be an exception and, where possible, post -trial, open -label or comp assionate access provisions should be incorporated into medicine development plans to meet the needs of patients not eligible for enrolment in clinical trials. Applicants An application for authorisation for the use of an unregistered medicine shall be submitted by the health care provider responsible for the care of the patient. Co-applicants The co -applicant/s for authorisation to sell an unregistered medicine shall be t he applicable holder/s of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of , or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act, responsible for the supply of the product for which authorisation is requested. 2.2 Bulk stock held by a health establishment Description In exceptional circumstances, certain unregistered medicines need to be available urgently and an individually named patient application is not possible. In such circumstances, bulk stock of the unregistered medicine may need to be maintained at a health establishment for use in, for example, an intensive care unit or theatre. An application may be submitted for authorisation to hold a certain amount of emergency stock in the pharmacy of the health establishment for use when an emergency arises. Applicants In such cases, the applicant shall be the health care provider who is the intended prescriber of such medicine or a health care provider who is designated as a representative of the health establishment requiring the stock. Additional information required The applicant must provide a clinical rationale as to why the unregistered medicine is required as emergency stock as opposed to requesting it per individual patient , in advance of use. Co-applicants The co -applicant/s for authorisation to sell an unregistered medicine shall be the applicable holder/s of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of s ection 22C(1)( b) of the Act responsible for the supply of the unregistered product for which authorisation is requested. Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 8 of 17 2.3 Bulk stock held by the holder of a licence issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) Description In exceptional circumstances, certain unregistered medicines may need to be maintained at a single point of storage for distribution on an urgent basis to one or more health care providers or health establishments. Applicant In such cases, the applicant shall be a health care provider who is designated as a representative by the holder of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of , or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of section 22C(1)(b) of the Act. Additio nal information required The applicant may apply for a certain quantity of emergency stock to be held on the premises of the licence holder, for distribution when required in accordance with the conditions of the authorisation granted. The applicant should include a rationale or description of the clinical scenario with an explanation as to why this mechanism of supply is required as opposed to the submission of applications per individual patient. Co-applicants In such circumstances, co -applicants shall in clude health establishments and prescribers, where these are known. Where these are not know n, the applicant is required to keep adequate records in accordance with any condition s of the authori sation. 2.4 State Procurement Description In exceptional circumstances, certain unregistered medicines may need to be procured by the State for distribution on an urgent basis to one or more public sector health establishments. These circumstances may arise where all other mechanisms of supply have been exhauste d and where, without intervention, a significant public health risk may be realised. Applicants The State may designate a health care provider as a representative in order to apply for authorisation for the supply or sale of an unregistered medicine to, an d by health establishments. Co-applicants In such circumstances , the co -applicants shall include the licence holder(s) involved in the supply of the unregistered medicine to health establishments and prescribers, where these are known . 2.5 Public health emergency (PHE) In line with SAHPRA Guideline 2.64: Availability of medicines for use in a Public Health Emergency (PHE) , unregistered medicines may be authorised for sale which are intended for use for a n identified PHE. All requirements as stated in section 3 of SAHPRA Guideline 2.64 are applicable as qualifying criteria for consideration of authorisation for sale of an unregistered medicine. Additional considerations for the availability of such medicine by way of authorisation in terms of section 21 of the Act would include when there is an unmet medical need , where existing products have not been successful in eradicating the disease or preventing outbreaks and, in the face of the PHE there: Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 9 of 17 a) are no medicines available for the intended use or indication ; b) are no medicines available for a critical subpopulation (e.g., children); or c) there is insufficient supply of registered medicines for the intended use or indication . Despite any authorisation provided by the Authority , the sale of any medicine may only be permitted after compliance with any other legislative or policy requirements that may be required outside of the mandate of the Authority. Medicines that meet the criteria as stated above may be considered for authorisation based on their status of authori sation by other medicine regulatory authorities (MRAs) with which the Authority aligns: 2.5.1 Medicines that have been authorised or registered for use by MRAs recognised by the Authority The Authority may consider the authorisation of an unr egistered medicine for sale in terms of section 21 of the Act if the medicine has been authorised or registered for use in a PHE by any MRA recognised by the Authority (see SAHPRA Guideline 2.01 : General Information ). In this instance, an application m ay be submitted before an application for registration in terms of section 15 (see scenario 3.1 of SAHPRA Guideline 2.64: Availability of medicines for use in a Public Health Emergency (PHE) ). If authori sed, a condition for sale shall include a time limitation for authorisation of a specified amount of medicine . The renewal of such authori sation shall only be considered if an application for registration in terms of section 15 of the Act is made within a stipulated period of time from the date of submission of the application for section 21 authorisation . 2.5.2 Medicines that have not been authorised or registered for use by Medicine Regulatory Authorities (MRAs) recognised by SAHPRA An application for authorisation in terms of section 21 may only be submitted after an application for registration in terms of section 15 has been made in the case of novel medicines which have not been authorised for use by an MRA recognised by SAHPRA (see SAHPRA Guideline 2.01: General Information ). During the r eview of the section 15 application for registration a favourable risk -benefit analysis may indicate that the medicine should be made availab le, although there is insufficient data to support registration of the medicine . To allow for mitigation of the PHE, a n application for authorisation in terms of section 21 may be submitted. If authorised , a condition for sale shall include a time limitation and authorisation for the sale of a specified amount of medicine . The renewal of such authorisation shall on ly be considered provided that progress on the section 15 submission for application for registration is made within a stipulated amount of time from the date of submission of the application for section 21 authorisation . Applicants Applicants must be a holder of a licence issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act. Co-applicants All sellers of the medicine up until the supply of such medicine to the end -user (including all designated holders of licences issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act ) must be listed as co - applicants and must be authorised to sell the medicine pertaining to the application. The co -applicants should also include the prescribers, where these are known .

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The scenarios outlined in section 2 require that various persons and/or institutions need authorisation in terms of section 21 to sell unregistered medicines, with all role -players assuming responsibility as applicant or co -applicant/s. 3.1 Applicants and co -applicants In all instances, the applicant should be the individual who accepts responsibility for the submission of the application, while co -applicants will be all persons (including holders of licences issue d in terms of section 22C(1)( b) or institutions) involved in the sale of the un registered medicine. Applicants are required to assume responsibility for the application process and submission thereof. Co-applicants must provide accurate information for submission with an application. Both applicants and co -applicants must - a) ensure tha t the medicine for which authorisation is granted is sold, prescribed and dispensed in compliance with the provisions of the Act; b) ensure that the medicine for which authorisation is granted, is used for the purpose, in the manner and for the duration for w hich authorisation is granted; and c) comply with any other conditions imposed by the Authority. Following the granting of authorisation by the Section 21 Unit, the applicant and co -applicant (s) is/are responsible for deciding whether or not to sell the medicine. An applicant or co -applicant is under no obligation to sell an unregistered medicine and cannot be compelled to do so , however, the Authority must be notified by the holder of authorisation when the authorised medicine will not be sold Applicants and co -applicants are expected to ensure that significant new information about the safety, quality and efficacy of a medicine for which authorisation has been granted in terms of section 21 of the Act is made available to relevant role -players and in acc ordance with the relevant guideline issued by the Authority . 3.2 Health care providers The health care provider who submits an application for authorisation to use an unregistered medicine must ensure that the decision to use the medicine is supported by credible evidence. Such evidence is usually found in an investigator's brochure, prescribing information from another jurisdiction, or publications in peer -reviewed, medical literature. A health care provider designated as a representative of an instituti on will represent the institution as the applicant. This individual will be responsible for the actions and responsibilities of the institution associated with the application. Health care providers who prescribe an unregistered medicine must provide the patient with information about the potential risks, benefits, consequences and costs of the unregistered medicine as well as the range of any alternative therapies available. Health care providers must also comply with the provisions of section 6(1) of the National Health Act, 2003 (Act 61 of 2003) - as quoted below: 6. User to have full knowledge (1) Every health care provider must inform a user of - (a) the user's health status except in circumstances where there is substantial evidence that the disclosure of the user's health status would be contrary to the best interests of the user; (b) the range of diagnostic procedures and treatment options generally available to the user; (c) the benefits, risks, costs and consequences generally associated with each option; and (d) the user's right to refuse health services and explain the implications, risks, obligations of such Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 11 of 17 refusal. (2) The health care provider concerned must, where possible, inform the user as contemplated in subsection (1) in a language that the user understands and in a manner which takes into account the user's level of literacy. Furthermore, according to regulation 29(3) of the General Regulations (as quoted below) progress reports must be submitted on a six -monthly basis from the date of c ommencement of use of the unregistered medicine. A final report must be submitted 30 days after the use of the unregistered medicine has been stopped. These reports should be sent by email to: section21@sahpra.org.za . 29. Authorisation of sale of an unregistered medicine for certain purposes (3) The person under whose supervision the unregistered medicine or substance is prescribed shall submit to the Authority - (a) any adverse event report; (b) progress reports after every six months from the date following commencement of the use of the unregistered medicine; and (c) progress report 30 days after the completion or termination of the use of the medicine. The provisions of regulation 40(3) of the General Regulations (as quoted below), which place an obligation on health care providers or any other person to report suspected adverse drug reactions or new or existing safety, quality or effectiveness concerns, shall apply equally to unregistered medicines for which authorisation has been granted in terms of Section 21. 40. Vigilance ... (3) A health care provider, or any other person should inform the Authority, in the manner as determined by the Authority, of any - (a) suspected adverse drug reactions; or (b) new or existing safety, quality or effectiveness concerns, occurring as a result of the use of any medicine or scheduled substance. 3.3 Holders of a licence issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act After authorisation has been granted to the holder (s) of a licence to manufacture, import or to act as a wholesaler of or distribute a medicine or Scheduled substance, issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act, the Authority may impose conditions on the sale of a medicine to ensure that it is used in accordance with the latest information available and in accordance with the conditions determined by the Authority. These conditions may include but are not limited to the quantity of the medicine sold. The holder of a licence in terms of section 22C(1)( b) who imports an unregistered medicine must comply with the provisions of section 22A(11)( a) of the Act (as quoted below), namely : 11. (a) No person shall import or export any specified Schedule 5, Schedule 6, Schedule 7 or Schedule 8 substance or medicine p rescribed for that purpose unless a permit has been issued to him or her by the Director -General of Health in the prescribed manner and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Director -General . Importers should clearly display the Letter of Authorisation issued in term of section 21 of the Act with other related documents, such as import permits, to facilitate clearance by South African customs authorities. Unregistered medicines which may be sold following the granting of an authorisation in terms of Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 12 of 17 Section 21 may not be exported. The importing company must provide evidence (an agreement) that the sponsor or patent holder is in agreement with the use of the unregistered medicine that is being applied for. Any pharmaceutical company may inform the Authority that a patented unregistered medicine may not be brought in by another importing company without the ir consent. This must be accompanied by evidence that the aforementioned notification has also been sent to the importing company. Furthermore, a holder of a licence in terms of section 22C(1)( b) must inform the Authority of any new or existing quality, safety or effectiveness concerns according to the relevant Authority guideline and must maintain or have access to records and case repor ts of such cases. With regard to any safety concerns, the provisions of regulation 40(1) and (2) of the General Regulations (as quoted below) apply to unregistered medicines authorised by way of Section 21. 40. Vigilance (1) A person who has applied for r egistration of a medicine in terms of section 15 of the Act, a holder of a certificate of registration in respect of a medicine or Scheduled substance, or a holder of a licence in terms of section 22C(1)(b) must inform the Authority, in the manner and with in the time frame as determined by the Authority, of any - (a) new or existing quality, safety or effectiveness concerns related to any medicine or scheduled substance, including but not limited to adverse drug reactions; and (b) risk management activities associated with paragraph (a) .

APPLICATION PROCESS 4.1 Initiation of application To initiate a Section 21 application an applicant and co -applicant/s shall complete the Section 21 Application Form. The latest fee schedule and relevant instructions may be accessed and downloaded from the Authority website www.sahpra.org.za . A completed application form must be accompanied by the prescribed fee and must contain at least the information as prescribed by regulation 29(2). The Authority has implemented a submission portal in order to process Section 21 re -authorisations as well as new applications. New applications These must be submitted via the ONLINE SERVICES tab on the SAHPRA website homepage, www.sahpra.org.za and navigating to New Applications . Re-authorisations Re-authorisations imply that an authorisation was issued approximately 6 (six) months previously, which is close to expiry or recently expired, and that a new authorisation is required for ongoing treatment. These must be submitted via the ONLINE SERVICES tab on the SAHPRA website homepage, www.sahpra.org.za and navigating to Re-authorisations. Supporting documents (e.g. proof of payment and informed consent) for online applications should be sent by e -mail to: section21@sahpra.org.za. Following consideration of the application , the Section 21 Unit may either authorise the sale of the unregistered medicine, request additional information from the applicant, or deny the application . 4.2 Hours of Operation The Section 21 service is offered 24 hours a day, throughout the year. Regular business hours are weekdays from 08:00 to 16:00 South Africa Time (GMT +02:00). Outside of regular business hours and during public holidays, the cell phone numbers for Section 21 on the SAHPRA website www.sahpra.org.za may be used. 4.3 After Hours Applications Telephonic applications should be limited to life -threatening situations requiring immediate attention. An application outside of regular office hours should be made to the designated official, who can be reached on the emergency number provided on the website. In the case of telephonic applications , the applicant should be prepared to provide all of the required information using the application form as a guide. This must be followed by the process detailed in section 4.1 Initiation of application . Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 14 of 17 5 EVALUATION PROCESS 5.1 Screening Applications related to scenario 2.1 are typically processed within 24 working hours of receipt. This timeframe is extended for other scenarios ( 2.2 to 2.5) based on their complexity and amount of information to be reviewed. Requests are triaged to ensure that urgent matters take precedence over less urgent matters. During initial screening, the application is checked to ensure that: a) all sections of the form are complete; b) all contact details of the applicant and co -applicant/s are provided; c) the information provided is legible; d) a quantity of six months' supply or less is requested; and e) the health care provider has provided his/her registration number . The applicant will be requested in writing to respond to critical screening outcomes. Once a request has passed screening, it is forwarded to a designated official f or review. 5.2 Evaluation Evaluation is the process by which the Section 21 Unit decides whether authorisation is appropriate and justified. Each request represents a unique set of circumstances and is supported to varying degrees by information provided by the applicant and co -applicant/s. A decision to authorise or deny a request is made on a case -by-case basis taking into consideration the nature of the unmet medical need, the availability of marketed alternatives and the information provided in support of the request regarding the use, safety and efficacy of the medicine. Medicines accessed through Section 21 do not undergo the scrutiny of a benefit -risk assessment applied to medicine registration submissions or clinical trial applications. Accordingly, authorisation through Section 21 does not constitute an opinion that a medicine is safe, efficacious or of acceptable quality. Furthermore, approval of a Section 21 application does not constitute authorisation to sell a medicine outside the conditions st ipulated by the Section 21 authorisation, nor does it compel a licence holder to sell the medicine so authorised. Evaluation takes into account the information supplied in terms of regulation 29(2) and balances the following factors to ensure that an unmet medical need exists and there is credible data to support the request: a) Seriousness of disease based on a description of the unmet medical need for which the medicine is requested; b) Clinical status of the patient/s, including prognosis for patient -specific applications; c) Other therapies that have been tried and failed, or have been considered and ruled out, or are unavailable d) Other current/concomitant medication whether for diagnosis, treatment or concomitant disease; e) Prior patient experience w ith the medicine, including evidence of efficacy and adverse drug reactions; f) Data provided with the application including quality and relevance of data regarding the unmet medical need. A hierarchy of available evidence may range from o prescribing info rmation/professional information from the jurisdiction where the medicine may be marketed, preferably a regulatory authority with which SAHPRA aligns itself; o published data to support the application; or Section 21 Access to Unregistered Medicines August 2021 2.52_Section_21_Access_to_Unregistered_Medicines_Aug21_v3.docx Page 15 of 17 o unpublished reports; g) Data available from medical literature, treatment guidelines, investigator's brochures, information obtained from the manufacturer, clinical trial reports, consultations with experts; h) Regulatory status of the medicine; i) Availability of clinical trials as an option for a n individual patient ; and j) Where applicable, the availability of medicines for use in a Public Health Emergency (PHE). 5.3 Special Considerations 5.3.1 Medicine shortages and discontinued medicines In circumstances where a medicine is in short supply or is discontinued from the market, the Section 21 Unit will consider authorising access to an alternative source in circumstances where: a) the medicine is considered to be medically necessary for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention in an area of unmet medical need; b) the manufacturer has disclosed the reasons for the shortage or discontinuation of the medicine; c) there are no other dosage forms of the medicine on the market that would be considered a reasonable alternative; d) there are no other medi cines or therapies that would be considered to be reasonable alternatives; and e) in the case of a medicine shortage, the manufacturer demonstrates that efforts have been made to avoid and manage the shortage. 5.3.2 Complementary Medicines Medicines confo rming to the definition of a Complementary Medicine (Category D) (CM) may be considered for authorisation for sale by way of section 21 based on, inter alia, the following criteria: a) the medicine applied for is a bona fide CM in South Africa and complies with the definition of a CM in terms of the General Regulations; b) consideration of the composition of the CM in its entirety would yield no overt safety concerns relevant to the intended benefit to the patient; c) an indication whether the medicine is register ed or licensed for sale in the country of origin or elsewhere. In such instances, proof of same should be provided in the form of registration certificates, licensing, market authorisation or appropriate legislative reference; d) proof of manufacture preferab ly by a duly licensed manufacturer, and the provision of all contact details pertaining to the manufacturer; e) an indication that the stated intended use of the CM matches the registered / licensed use of the product. A further motivation of the reasoning fo r its intended use based on bona fide medical / discipline principles may be provided; f) demonstration that there is no South African registered medicine or equivalent available; and g) relative to the nature of the medicine and condition it is intended for, th e prescription of the CM should be overseen by the relevant duly legally authorised prescriber.

Authorised applications are sent by e -mail to the applicant and copied to the co -applicants as required. The Authority will inform applicants by e -mail of any section 21 application which is not granted wit h reason/s for the decision. The applicant may also reply to the Section 21 Unit by e-mail to discuss the reasons and , if applicable, the process for submitting a new application with additional information. 6. RECORD KEEPING All records relating to unregistered medicines sold must be maintained in accordance with applicable legislation (recommended to be no less than five years), in a manner that permits rapid retrieval if necessary. The Section 21 Unit may at any time request that applicants and co -applicants account for all quantities of medicine received or supplied i.e. reconciliation of the quantities for which authority is granted, procured and used. The holder of a licence issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act is required to maintain complete and accurate records of all Section 21 transactions in a manner that permits rapid response to specific requests to verify the distribution of medicine supplies to health establishments or health care providers. 7. REPORTING Applicants and co -applicants must provide reports to the Section 21 Unit on the use of the unregistered product and any adverse drug reactions (ADRs) encountered, using the tools and/or forms provided by the Authority. The SAHPRA ADR reporting guideline must be followed regard ing what should be reported, and the associated timeframes. Specifically, the health care provider shall inform the Section 21 unit of any serious unexpected adverse medicine reaction within: a) 15 days after becoming aware of the information if the reaction is neither fatal nor life - threatening; or b) seven (7) days after becoming aware of the information if the reaction is fatal or life - threatening. 8. UNUSED MEDICINES As a general rule, unused supplies of a medicine should be returned to the holder of a licence issued in terms of section 22C(1)( b) of the Act. Health care providers may, however, request that unused supplies of a medicine be transferred to a new patient by submitting a new Section 21 application. Unused medicines for which authorisation has been granted in terms of section 21 of the Act must be disposed of in terms of regulation 44 of the General Regulations. 9. ADVERTISING A general condition of authorisation under section 21 of the Act, read together with regulation 29(4)( a) is that a dvertising and marketing of unregistered medicines accessed through Section 21 authorisation is strictly prohibited .
