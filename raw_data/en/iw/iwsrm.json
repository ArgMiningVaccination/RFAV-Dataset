After your vaccine shots, you may experience some side effects. The most common ones are a sore arm, muscle aches, headache, feeling tired, chills or fever. Similar side effects are reported in adults and children. Even if the side effects are strong enough to affect your daily activities, they should go away in a few days. Side effects aren't a sign you have COVID- 19. The available vaccines don't contain live coronavirus and can't make you sick with COVID-19. If you develop symptoms including fever, sore throat, stuffy nose, altered taste or smell, cough, breathing problems, diarrhea or vomiting, these might mean that you've developed a COVID-19 infection before the vaccine started working. Consider getting a [PCR or antigen test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html) and isolating if you think you may have COVID. If you think you're having a severe allergic reaction, call [911](tel:+911) immediately. "}
