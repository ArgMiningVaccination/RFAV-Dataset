Introduction Minimum Standards These minimum standards tell you (the child care operation permit holder) what requirements you, your employees, and your caregivers must follow. These minimum standards: were developed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) with the assistance of child -care operations, parents, stakeholders, and other experts in a variety of fields; reflect what the citizens of Texas consider to be reasonable and minimum; and meet the guidelines set forth in Chapter 42 of the Texas Human Resources Code (law) for what must be included in the minimum standards. The Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act requires that proposed standards be published for public comment before they are adopted as rules. All members of the public, including providers , are encouraged to provide input when proposed minimum standards are published for comment. The commission considers recommendations from interested persons or groups in formulating the final draft, which is filed as rules with the Secretary of State. Deficiencies A deficiency is any failure to comply with a minimum standard, rule in Texas Administrative Code Chapter 745, law, specific term of the permit, or specific condition of probation or suspension. Weights The minimum standards are weighted based on a common understanding of the risk to children presented if the standard or rule is violated. The weights are: high, medium -high, medium, medium -low, and low. The assigned weights do not change based on the scope or severity of an actual deficiency. Scope and severity are assessed by Child Care Regulation (CCR) staff, documented, and considered in conjunction with the weight when making CCR decisions. You will see the weight is noted at the end of each standard or subsection in green. Only those minimum standards which can be cited as a deficiency are weighted. For example, the minimum standard prohibiting physical discipline is weighted but minimum standards that are definitions are not weighted. Revised: 12/19/2022 7 Maintaining Compliance It is essential that you, your employ ees, and your caregivers recognize four critical aspects of CCR's efforts to protect the children in care and to help operation employees and caregivers comply with the law, rules, and standards. The four aspects are: Inspection Technical assistance Invest igations Caregiver's rights and entitlements The Inspection Various aspects of regulated operations are evaluated for compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and laws during regular inspections. The emphasis on these inspections is to prevent risk to children in care. The frequency of inspections will fluctuate depending on the type of permit and the operation's history of compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law. During any inspection, if we find that your operation does not meet minimum standard, rule, or law, the deficiencies are discussed with the person in charge at the time of the inspection. You will be given the opportunity to correct deficiencies within a specified period of time. If you have questions, concerns, or disagree wit h the citation, we encourage you to talk with us before we leave your operation. If your concerns are not resolved, you may request an administrative review. Technical Assistance We are available to offer consultation to potential applicants, applicants, a nd permit holders regarding how to comply with minimum standards, rules, and laws. While we most often provide technical assistance during inspections and investigations, technical assistance can be requested at any time. The Child Care Regulation section of the HHSC web site has a Technical Assistance Library that allows you to view or download information about a variety of topics related to child care. You can view it by going to https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider -portals/protective -services - providers/child -care-licensing and selecting Technical Assistance Library from the Resources section. A feature of the minimum standards publication are the Technical Assistance boxes that follow certain minimum standards to provide additional guidance, clarification, resources, and/or best practices related to the applicable rule. Revised: 12/19/2022 8 Investigations When a report alleges a vi olation of minimum standards, rule, or law, CCR staff must investigate the report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation results within prescribed time frames. Your Rights and Entitlements Waivers and Variances You may request a waiver If your operation is unable to comply with a standard for economic reasons. You may request a variance if your operation wishes to meet the intent of a standard in a way that is different from what the standard specifies. Waiver and variance requests are submitted through your online provider account or made in writing to your assigned CCR inspector. Administrative Review If you disagree with a CCR decision or action, you may request an administrative review, during which you are given an opportunity to show compliance with applicable minimum standard, rule, law, action, permit restriction(s) and/or permit conditions. Appeal Hearing You may request an appeal hearing on a CCR decision to deny an application, revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew a permit or a condition placed on the permit after initial issuance. Appeal hearings are conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH). For Further Information It is important that you, your employees, and your caregivers clearly understand the purpose of minimum standards and the reasons for CCR's inspections and investigations. Do not hesitate to ask us questions that will help you und erstand any aspect of our regulation. You may obtain information about minimum standards or procedures by calling your local CCR office or by visiting the HHSC web site Subchapter A, Purpose and Scope \u00a7749.1.

Who is responsible for complying with the rules of this chapter? Subchapter A, Purpose and Scope January 2007 The permit holder must ensu re compliance with all rules of this chapter at all times, with the exception of those rules identified for specific types of services that your agency does not offer. For example, if we grant you a permit to offer adoption services only, you do not have t o comply with rules that apply to foster care services; however, you must comply with all other rules of this chapter [High] .

All communications regarding lessons learned should be approached in a way that ensures a blame -free environment. [Medium -High] Technical Assistance Regarding subsection (c)(1)(C) for annual suicide prevention training: o More than likely training on suicide prevention will have to be tailored for each operation because some of the training is based on an operation's own safety planning and the specific screening tool an operation uses to screen for risk. However, related to training on risk factors, protective factors, and warning signs of suicide, one resource that might be helpful is the AS+K? Basic Gatekeeper Training. o An inspector should cite: \u00a7749. 939(a)(1) - (4) if the training doesn't meet the instructor -led requirements; and \u00a7749.949 if the training documentation requirements are not met. Regarding subsection (c)(1) suicide prevention training for employees and foster parents and subsection (d)(3 ) training on the suicide risk screening tool, both types of training may be used to complete the annual training requirements at \u00a7749.930 and \u00a7749.931. Regarding subsection (c)(3): o Examples of non -employees that may be appropriate for suicide prevention training are non -employees that have routine contact with a child or perform a supervisory role for the child. o You do not have to promote suicide prevention training for foster paren ts verified to care for children five years of age or older because those foster parents are already required to receive routine suicide prevention training. o Examples of promoting suicide prevention training include sharing your suicide prevention policies and other relevant resources with the appropriate non -employees or encouraging appropriate non -employees to participate in other specific suicide prevention training. Regarding subsection (d)(2), you may use any evidenced -based screening tool that is appropriate for your program. Two screening tools that are free, evidence -based, and have ample research supporting their validity and reliability, are the: o Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS); and o Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ).

Subchapter C, Organization and Administration Division 1, Required Plans and Policies, Including During the Application Process September 2022 (a) The requirements for policies only apply to your policies that are required or governed by this chapter. (b) All employees and caregivers must be aware of and follow your policies and procedures [Medium] . \u00a7749.139. What requirements must I follow when adopting my child - placing agency's plans, policies, and procedures? Subchapter C, Organization and Administration Division 1, Required Plans and Policies, Including During the Application Process January 2017 (a) Your agency's plans, policies, and procedures must ind icate the date on which you adopted them and their effective date [Medium -Low]. (b) You must formalize the adoption of your agency's plans, policies, and procedures as appropriate for your type of ownership: (1) If you are a sole proprietor, you must sign them date [Medium -Low]; (2) If you are a partnership, each partner must sign them date [Medium -Low]; or (3) If you are a corporation or other type of business entity, the governing body must take a written action to adopt (sometimes this may be an order or the adoption ma y be included in the minutes of the governing body) date [Medium -Low]. Revised: 12/19/2022 55 \u00a7749.141. Can Licensing cite my agency for a deficiency if I fail to operate according to my approved plans, policies, and procedures? Subchapter C, Organization and Administration Division 1, Required Plans and Policies, Including During the Application Process January 2017 Yes, if you violate plans, policies, or procedures, then we may cite the relevant standard in Division 1 of this Subchapter (relating to Plans and Policies Required During the Application Process) as a deficiency; Technical Assistance Licensing only enforces plans, policies, and procedures required by the minimum standards. For example, Licensing does not enforce your policies on purchase approvals. In addition, Licensing will not cite this standard if you meet a specific minimum standard but do not meet your policy that requires more than the minimum standard. For example, if your policy requires caregivers to complete 12 hours of general pre -service tr aining and inspection results indicate an employee only completed ten hours of training, we will not cite you for failing to meet your policy. If this Chapter contains another relevant minimum standard, then that standard would be cited for failure to comp ly with a policy. For example and using the same example as above, if an employee only completed six hours of general pre -service training, we will cite \u00a7749.863(a)(1) because the minimum standards require eight hours of general pre - service training. Howe ver, if there isn't another relevant minimum standard, then we would cite the relevant standard in Division 1.

[Medium] Revised: 12/19/2022 87 Technical Assistance Regarding subsection (a)(2), not every trip to a hospital or emergency clinic must be reported as a serious incident. Only those incidents involving a \"substantial physical injury or critical illness\" must be reported and documented as a serious incident. The definition of \"substantial physical injury\" contains some examples of reportable serious incidents. Visi ts to the emergency room or emergency clinic (that did not result in hospitalization) for a common illness such as the flu, for a chronic illness such as an asthma attack, or for a routine medical exam would not warrant reporting as a serious incident. Also, it is the nature of the injury or illness that determines whether it is reportable as a serious incident, not the venue in which it is treated. Taking a child to the emergency clinic or doctor's office for stitches is still reportable as a serious incid ent, even though the treatment did not occur at an emergency room or hospital. Regarding children receiving treatment services for primary medical needs, planned admissions to the hospital are not reportable as serious incidents. If the child sustains a su bstantial physical injury or contracts a critical illness, a serious incident report is required. However, ongoing treatment for the child's chronic illnesses or conditions is not reportable as a serious incident. In addition, admission to a psychiatric ho spital only warrants a serious incident report if the admission is precipitated by a reportable incident, such as a suicide attempt. The admission itself is not reportable as a serious incident. Regarding paragraph (e)(3), a disaster may be declared by the governor or the presiding officer of the governing body of a political subdivision. The operation or foster home must be located in the area impacted by the declared disaster before paragraph (e)(3) applies. Regarding subsection (e)( 7), see the Citizen's Guide for the Texas Criminal Justice Process for more information on criminal matters. \u00a7749.505. What constitutes a suicide attempt by a child? Subchapter D, Reports and Record Keeping Division 1, Reporting Serious Incidents and Other Occurrences September 2010 A suicide attempt is a child's attempt to take his own life using means or methods for causing his death, including any act a child commits intending to cause his death, but excluding suicidal gestures where it is clear that the act was unlikely to cause death. Suicidal thoughts are not reportable as a suicide attempt. Revised: 12/19/2022 88 \u00a7749.509. How do I make a report of a serious incident or occurrence to Licensing?

[Medium] Technical Assistance Regarding subsecti on (3), this requirement is not intended to conflict with confidentiality laws or rights. Identifying information for one child should not be placed in the record of another child. You may choose to 1) write one incident report that is filed centrally (not in each child's record) and de -identified when released as part of a child's record, 2) write one incident report that is filed in each child's record, with each copy de -identified to not show the full name of other children involved in the incident, or 3 ) write a separate incident report for each child, with only the first name or initials of each other child involved. Regarding subsection (5), witnesses to the incident are persons who were present when the incident occurred and can give a first -hand acco unt of what they experienced during the incident. A person is not automatically a witness because he lives in the same unit or cottage as the child involved in the incident. Witnesses may also be persons unaffiliated with the operation, such as a visitor t o the operation who was present at the time of the incident. \u00a7749.513.

They provide infants accessibility to potentially hot surfaces, containers of hot liquids such as coffee, dangling appliance cords, poisonous plants or hazardous substances and buckets, toilets or other containers of water. Revised: 12/19/2022 248 Technical Assistance Regarding paragraph (a)(2), baby bungee jumpers present a hazard due to increased risk of injury to the in fant as a result of spinning, swinging, or bumping into walls while placed in the jumper. Regarding paragraph (a)(3), accordion gates with large V -shaped openings along the top edge and diamond shaped openings between the slats present entrapment and entan glement hazards resulting in strangulation, choking or pinching to infants who try to crawl through or over the gate. Regarding paragraph (a)(4), examples of items that present a choking hazard for infants and toddlers include coins, balloons, safety pins, marbles, Styrofoam \u00a9 and similar products, and sponge, rubber or soft plastic toys. Regarding subsection (b), examples of items that can be used as alternatives to blankets and sheets are a one -piece footed sleeper, a body shirt or undershirt underneath a sleeper, sleep sack or wearable blanket that zips up the front and can be worn over a sleeper. Wearable blankets are sleeveless, so a baby can still move his arms around while the rest of his body stays covered. \u00a7749.1815. What are the specific sleeping requirements for infants? Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management Division 1, Additional Requirements for Infant Care January 2017 (a) Caregivers must place an infant not yet able to turn over on his own in a face -up sleeping positio n unless a health -care professional orders otherwise.

May I allow an infant to sleep in a restrictive device? Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management Division 1, Additional Requirements for Infant Care April 2021 You may not allow an infant to sleep in a restrictive device. If an infant falls asleep in a restrictive device, you must remove the infant from the dev ice and place the infant in a crib as soon as possible. [High] Revised: 12/19/2022 249 Technical Assistance A restrictive device is equipment that places the body of an infant in a position that may restrict air flow or cause strangulation; usually, the infant is placed in a sem i-seated position. Examples include car seats, swings, bouncy seats, and high chairs. Infants sleeping in restrictive devices are at risk for injury and positional asphyxiation. Placing a car seat containing a sleeping infant in a crib is one example of pr ohibited use of a restrictive device. Allowing a sleeping infant to remain in a car seat during transportation is not an example of prohibited use of a restrictive device. \u00a7749.1819. What are the specific requirements for feeding an infant? Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management Division 1, Additional Requirements for Infant Care January 2017 (a) Caregivers must feed an infant based on the recommendations of the infant's licensed health -care professional.

Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management Division 1, Additional Requirements for Infant Care April 2021 You may not lay a swaddled infant down to sleep or to rest on any surface at any time, unless you have an order signed by a health -care professional. You must keep the order in the child's record. [High] Technical Assistance There is evidence that swaddling can increase the risk of serious health outcomes, including SIDS and hip disease, and research does not provide definitive data to support the use of swaddling. Even with newborns, research does not provide conclusive data about whether swaddling should be used. Swaddling blankets that become loose during sleep pose an additional risk for infants. For concerns with maintaining an infant's temperature, appropriate clothing and/or a sleeveless infant sleep sack that does not r estrict the infant's movement can be utilized.

The caregiver must explain the reason for the disciplinary measure when t he caregiver imposes the measure. [Medium] Revised: 12/19/2022 260 Technical Assistance It is a good idea for disciplinary measures to be consistent among caregivers. Using positive methods of discipline and guidance encourage self -esteem, self -control, and self-direction. Positive methods of discipline include the following: Using praise, positive reinforcement, and encouragement of good behavior instead of focusing only on unacceptable behavior; Reminding a child of behavior expectations daily by using clear, positive statements; Talking with the child about the situation; Focusing on the rule to learn and the reason for the rule; Focusing on solutions that are respectful, reasonable, and related to the problem behavior, rather than blaming or focusing o n consequences; Redirecting the child's attention or behavior using positive statements; Providing prior notice of possible consequences for inappropriate behaviors; Giving the child acceptable choices or alternatives; Using brief supervised separation or time away from the group or situation, when appropriate for the child's understanding, age, and development. Best practice suggests that quiet time or time out from the group be limited to no more than one minute per year of the child's chronological or de velopmental age. However, this time frame may need to be adjusted for some children, such as a child who has attention -deficit disorder. Time out is not appropriate for infants and is not recommended for toddlers, since they are too young to understand thi s intervention; Arranging the environment to allow safe testing of limits; Using kind but firm action; Giving logical consequences that are appropriate to the situation and severity of the behavior; and Withholding privileges.

Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management Division 6, Discipline and Punishment January 2007 (a) \"Unproductive work\" is work that serves no purpose except to demean the child. Examples include mo ving rocks or logs from one pile to another or digging a hole and then filling it in. Unproductive work is never an appropriate behavior management tool. (b) \"Unproductive work\" does not include work that corrects damage that the child's behavior caused. For e xample, you may require a child who defaces a fence or wall to repaint it. This example includes a logical consequence and an acceptable behavior management tool. Revised: 12/19/2022 262 \u00a7749.1957. What other methods of punishment are prohibited?

[Medium -High] Technical Assistance Children's Nutrition Research suggests the following: Milk and milk products served to children 12 months old or older should be Grade A pasteurized or from sources approved by the Department of State Health Services. The following milks do not contain the right amounts of all the nutrients infants need and can harm an infant's health. Iron -fortified infant formula is the best substitute for breast milk. Infants should not be given the following unless recommended by the infant's health -care professional: Cow's milk; Evaporated cow's milk Sweetened condensed milk; Goat's milk; Soy milk; or Imitation milks, including those made from rice or nuts (such as almonds) or nondairy creamer. (http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/Resources/feeding_infants.html Feeding Infants: A Guide for Use in the Child Nutrition Programs p.24) Milk should be fluid milk. Breads and grains should be made from whole -grain or enriched meal or flour. Cereal should be whole grain or enriched or fortified. Vegetable or fruit juices should be 100% vegetable or fruit juice when used to meet a serving from the vegetable or fruit group. Children under one year old shoul d not be offered unpasteurized or raw honey because it may contain spores that pose a health risk. Revised: 12/19/2022 367 Technical Assistance Food Allergies A food allergy is caused by the body's immune system reacting inappropriately to a food or food additive. Symptoms may include wheezing, diffi culty breathing, diarrhea, rashes, itching, hives, and headaches. Food allergies are most common in infants, due to their immature digestive systems. Food allergies are usually outgrown during the preschool years. Although any food may cause an allergic re action, six foods are responsible for most of these reactions in children. These foods are: Peanuts; Eggs; Milk; Tree nuts; Soy; and Wheat. A child who is pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid consuming peanuts and peanut products due to its association with the development of peanut allergies in infants. It is best not to offer children under two to three years old peanuts or peanut products, such as peanut butter and foods containing or cooked in peanut oil, because of the potential of devel oping this life - threatening and often life -long allergy. Foods that cause allergic reactions should be eliminated from the diet. However, it is important that the diet still contain a variety of foods for healthy growth and development. A child should rece ive a medical evaluation if food allergies are suspected. If the child's licensed physician determines that the child has a food allergy, a determination should be made of whether the child's allergic condition meets USDA's definition of disability. Food I ntolerance A food intolerance is an adverse food -induced reaction that does not involve the body's immune system. Lactose intolerance is one example of food intolerance. A person with lactose intolerance lacks an enzyme needed to digest milk sugar. When th at person eats milk products, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain may occur. It is best to provide food substitutions for children with food intolerances who cannot consume the regular meal.
