Part A is randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and includes patients with eosinophilic gastritis and/or duodenal-only disease. After completing Part A, participants can continue to Part C - - open-label benralizumab treatment period. Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||12 Years and Over| |Gender||All| Inclusion criteria: - - Aged >= 12 years of age at the time of signing the ICF or informed consent or assent form. - - Confirmed diagnosis of EG/EGE for at least 3 months prior to screening. - - Baseline Eosinophilic gastritis, with or without duodenitis, or eosinophilic duodenitis alone confirmed by biopsy with a gastric count of 30 eosinophils/hpf in at least 5 hpfs and/or duodenal eosinophil count 30 eosinophils/hpf in at least 3 hpfs without any other cause for the gastrointestinal eosinophilia. - - Symptoms including at least moderate abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, early satiety, and/or loss of appetite. - - Must be adherent to daily PRO assessments including at least 8 of 14 symptom assessments in the 14 days prior to randomization. - - If on background medications for EG/EGE, the medications should be stable at least 4 weeks prior to the run-in period. - - Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and visit schedule including follow-up visits. - - Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective form of birth control (confirmed by the Investigator) from randomization throughout the study duration and within 12 weeks after last dose if IP. Exclusion criteria: - - Other gastrointestinal disorders such as active Helicobacter pylori infection, history of achalasia, esophageal varices, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease. - - Hypereosinophilic syndrome or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. - - Current malignancy, or history of malignancy, except for patients who have had basal cell, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are eligible provided that the patient is in remission and curative therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to the date of informed consent. - - History of anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy or vaccine. - - Current active liver disease. - - Helminth parasitic infection diagnosed within 24 weeks prior to the date informed that has not been treated with or has failed to respond to standard of care therapy. - - Known immunodeficiency disorder including testing positive for HIV. - - Concomitant use of immunosuppressive medication. - - Receipt of live attenuated vaccines 30 days prior to date of informed consent or assent. - - Receipt of inactive vaccines within 7 days of informed consent or assent. - - Initiation or change of a food-elimination diet regimen or re-introduction of a previously eliminated food group from 6 weeks prior to start of the run-in period and unable or unwilling to remain on a stable diet until the completion of Part A and C. - - Currently pregnant or breast-feeding. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use.

Benralizumab has been widely approved for treatment of asthma. Biological: - Placebo Placebo will be injected as a comparator to injection with Benralizumab to examine effect on both the signs and symptoms of EG/EGE and the underlying eosinophilic inflammation, with dual primary outcome variables Contact a Trial Team If you are interested in learning more about this trial, find the trial site nearest to your location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone.
