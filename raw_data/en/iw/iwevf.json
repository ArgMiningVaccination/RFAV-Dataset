This is the time of year where many get the flu shot so, I thought it would be wise with all the media attention around vaccination to tell you what is in your flu shot. There are many option you have to choose from so its best to do the least toxic one or skip it altogether if you are weary. Its important you know they base the current flu vaccine on strains from the previous years and viruses evolve, this is why people still get the flu despite the vaccine. The cases of death due to flu are rare. When this occurs all are immunocompromised or suppressed and those with serious underlying diseases. The typical child can withstand getting the flu and with proper interventions can be over it themselves within 3-7 days. 1. Influenza (Afluria): Beta-Propiolactone, Calcium chloride, Neomycin, Ovalbumin, Polymyxin B, Potassium Chloride, phosphate, sodium taurodeoxychoalate (Agriflu): Thimerosal glutamate, sucrose phosphate glutamate buffer. The decision to vaccinate for the flu is a decision made by each family and many feel pressured to do it all the while wondering what the facts or potential harm may be, this will hopefully help those wanting more information. Some things to consider before you get your flu shot.... The ingredients listed below have side effects and toxicity levels affect each child different. Consult with your doctor before getting the flu shot to see if the effects will delay their treatment. Both seasonal flu and swine flu vaccines will require two inoculations. This is because single inoculations have failed to produce sufficient antibodies. This is an admission that prior flu vaccines were virtually useless. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to boost production of antibodies but may trigger autoimmune reactions. Some adjuvants are mercury (thimerosal), aluminum and squalene. Researchers are warning that over-use of the flu vaccine and anti-flu drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can apply genetic pressure on flu viruses and then they are more likely to mutate into a more deadly strain. Most seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains tested from the United States and other countries are now resistant to Tamiflu (oseltamivir). Tamiflu has become a nearly worthless drug against seasonal flu. Public health officials are irresponsible in their omission of any ways to strengthen immunity against the flu. No options outside of problematic vaccines and anti-flu drugs are offered, despite the fact there is strong evidence that vitamins C and D activate the immune system and the trace mineral selenium prevents the worst form of the disease. Ingredients: A. Beta-propiolactone: C3H4O2 An attenuating agent.The vapor is very irritating and the liquid form is carcinogenic. Propiolactone is \"reasonably expected to be a human carcinogen.\" (IARC 1999)Recognized - carcinogen, Suspected - gastrointestinal or liver toxicant, respiratory toxicant, skin or sense organ toxicant. More hazardous than most chemicals. \"Neurological complications due to beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated antirabies vaccination. Clinical, electrophysiological and therapeutic aspects.\" \"Seventy six patients with neuroparalytic accidents due to antirabies vaccination (ARV) with BPL vaccine were studied.... Fourteen (18.4%) patients died and 6 were autopsied. The pathological features were essentially myeloradiculopathies, with variable degree of encephalic involvement. Two showed distinct necrotising myelopathy of immune type.\" Swamy HS, et al, J Sci. 1984 Jan;63 (1):111-28. \u2014 1/1/1984 B. Potassium chloride:KCl Potassium chloride is also commonly known as \"Muriate of Potash\" used in medicine, scientific applications, and judicial execution through lethal injection. The majority of the potassium chloride produced is used for making fertilizer. Side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort including nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding of the gut. Orally it is toxic in excess, high doses can cause cardiac arrest and rapid death. C. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG):C5H8NNaO4 Stabilizer:MSG is a food additive, popularly marketed as a \"flavour enhancer\". In its pure form, it appears as a white crystalline powder. D. Monopotassium phosphate:KH2PO4 Monopotassium phosphate is a soluble salt used as an additive in cigarettes, fertilizer and as a fungicide and buffering agent in vaccines. The synthesized, active, end-use product is a crystalline powder containing 100% active ingredient. E. Squalene: C30H50, an Adjuvant Too dangerous for human use, Squalene is not licensed for use in the United States. Oil adjuvants like squalene have been ordinarily used to inflict diseases in animals - for experimentation and study. According to anthrax vaccine expert Gary Matsumoto and other reliable sources, the US military used an unlicensed, experimental anthrax vaccination laced with squalene, with disastrous consequences, including Gulf War Syndrome. F. Sodium taurodeoxycholate: Detergent Sodium Taurodeoxycholate has been observed to promote tumor growth in the throat, pancreas, colon and other tissues. By increasing cell permeability it also increases drug uptake showing that exposed cells become more vulnerable to toxic insult. G. Octoxynol-10 (or 9): Detergent Octoxynol 9 (or 10) typically contains traces of the toxins ethylene oxide, dioxane, C9 phenols, or glycol ether. Detergents and emulsifiers promote tumors and cause cells to leak or explode by weakening their walls, with no mechanism for regulating destructive activity. H. Polysorbate 80: C64H124O26: a Detergent, Emulsifier, Solubilizer, Stabilizer.These chemicals are similar to detergents in their ability to increase cell permeability, damage, and bursting. After injection they can rapidly metabolize into sorbitol and ethylene oxide, which is much, more toxic than the original chemical. When Polysorbate 80 breaks down there are 20 moles of ethylene oxide for every mole of sorbitol. These polysorbates have been shown to cause dangerous, sometimes fatal effects, when given through a needle. Changes in heart function can occur immediately. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) can be weakened and penetrated, followed by seizures and even death. Anaphylactic and other reactions can occur. Infants are particularly susceptible (some math analysis here). These polysorbates also demonstrate synergistic toxicity with a range of chemicals (here and here) including lindane, thalidomide \u2014 even than 20% but perhaps more than 10% of the general population may be susceptible to formaldehyde and may react acutely at any exposure level. More hazardous than most chemicals in 5 out of 12 ranking systems, on at least 8 federal regulatory lists, ranked as one of the most hazardous compounds (worst 10%) to ecosystems and human health (Environmental Defense Fund) J. Sodium deoxycholate: Detergent Sodium Deoxycholate causes cell death and symptoms such as burning, redness, and swelling. It has been shown to weaken the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and subsequently activate seizures. It demonstrates synergistic toxicity \u2014 notably with Amphotericin B, the antifungal listed above. K. Thimerosal: C9H9HgNaO2S a Preservative Thimerosal is a very toxic compound, which is harmful by inhalation and ingestion. It is a neoplastigen and a teratogen. Thimerosal is also dangerous for the environment.Causes cell deathInhibits methylation- methylation is vital to our biological process. It can be involved in modification of heavy metals, regulation of gene expression, regulation of protein function, and RNA metabolism.Depletes glutathione- MOST important molecule for the detoxification and elimination of environmental toxins. It's made mostly in the liver antioxidant, immune support, supports cellular response, helps eliminate toxic metabolic waste products, methylation & enzymatic rxns.Causes DNA damage at .6 mcg/ml, vaccines are 25-50 mcg/ml Reference: CDC, March 2010.
